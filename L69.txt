L69|The Roles of Institutional Frameworks in Enforcing Food Safety in Malaysia|Objective - Food is one of the basic elements of survival. Nevertheless, the advancement of science and technology has made food safety a complex issue. Chemical additives that are harmful to health are constantly added into our food products. Food safety involves the health of the society at large and the productivity of individuals in our country. There needs to be a tightening of laws to ensure that the food safety of our products is always protected. The objective of this paper is to examine the roles of various enforcement agencies - both governmental and non-governmental - and to conduct a comparative study with the Food Standard Agency in the United Kingdom. Methodology/Technique - The governmental agency involved in this study is the Food and Quality Division under the Ministry of Health Malaysia. The paper also examines the role of non-governmental agencies, namely, the Consumer Association of Penang and the National Consumer Complaints Centre, in channeling and documenting complaints from consumers to relevant enforcement agencies. A qualitative methodology is adopted to analyze the relevant documents. Findings - The results of the research identifies that the enforcement of the laws by governmental bodies needs to be improved. On the other hand, non-governmental bodies are found to be effectively executing their duties. Therefore, it is suggested that government agencies should increase transparency in reporting their cases to the consumers, particularly through their website. It is also suggested that they report irresponsible food manufacturers in newspapers and seek to prosecute those manufacturers in courts. Novelty - It is hoped that this paper will act to advise food manufacturers of the governmental and non-governmental regulatory bodies in place. The paper also proposes that the Food Safety and Quality Division work together with non-governmental bodies, namely the Consumer Association of Penang and the National Consumer Complaint Centre, to combat food safety and quality, to increase transparency and enforce the laws on food safety more rigorously.

It provides insight into factors shaping employee voice in this under-researched knowledge-intensive sector of China that has emerged rapidly since the economic reform. It suggests the notion of employee voice among the highly skilled knowledge workforce can only be understood in terms of technological convergence and cultural divergence.
L69|Study On a New and Effective Speed Sensorless Controller for 3-phase Induction Motors by applying De-coupling Methodology|The 3-phase induction Motors (3pIM) are widely used in energy technologies as well as other industries. There have been many studies, which help to increase performance of the 3pIM, however, there are still many problems remaining, such as separation of the current that makes flux and the current that make moment is not completed; the control systems could not be fully digitalized to ensure high quality. To overcome these disadvantages, this study uses a new approach to design a new and effective controller for the 3pIM by applying Direct-Decoupling Methodology based on Exact Linearization Algorithm and Adaptive Backstepping Technology together with Kalman filter for constructing an observer for rotor flux. 3pIM are expressed by a system of non-linear equations for currents and flux in the d-q coordinate system, and moment and motion. Then State feedback controller with pole assignment from predefined poles is used for deriving a linearized model or the de-coupling structure of the 3pIM. After adding integral component to reduce static errors, non-linear oscillating noises to take into account oscillations of stator angular frequency, rotor flux, stator voltage and motor?s and choosing a Lyapunov control function, Kalman filter for observing rotor flux, the Adaptive Backstepping Controller of the 3pIM has the structure as shown in the Image 1. Several simulations and experiments (with speed changed from 1500 to -1500 rpm and from -1500 to 500 rpm) have been carried out using Simulink/Matlab, where state feedback controller, controller for currents, controllers for speed and rotor flux provided by the Simulink. Besides, programs for state vector modulation and Kalman filter were written in C language and installed in Simulink throug S-Function. Simulations and experiment results show clearly that the rotor flux can be well estimated in all operating conditions and performance of the 3pIM under all dynamic modes can be improved by using the new developed controller. In any speed intervals the designed system has excellent responses, speed?s overshoots were always less then 7 rpm, and response times were very short (less than 200 ms). Direct-decoupling methodology has been effectively applied to construct a new adaptive backstepping controller for the 3pIM, and a Kalman filter has been also successfully used for observation of rotor flux. In order to prove the application of the new method in practical aspects, designing of a controller without adaptation of rotor time constant will be studied and published in the near future.
L69|Forecasting of Turkey’s Sectoral Energy Demand by Using Fuzzy Grey Regression Model|Population growth, technological developments, economical growth and efforts to achieve a high standard of living increase the demand for energy. Satisfying this increasing demand without interruption is of vital importance for countries to ensure security of supply. Safely forecasting the energy demand of Turkey, which is about 3-4 times the world average, is important for sustainable development and improving standards of living in the country. This study seeks to forecast Turkey’s total energy demand and determine the distribution of this demand among sectors and the amount of unutilized energy. In the study, the energy demand projection until 2023 was revealed with fuzzy grey regression model using the data between years 1990 and 2012.

L69|Les Investissements De Sécurisation Des Sites Industriels À Risque Et La Concertation Entre Firmes Et Riverains : Une Approche Théorique|Cet article propose une modélisation de la concertation entre industries à risque et riverains sur les investissements de sécurité à mettre en oeuvre. Le modèle permet de déterminer à quels niveaux tendent à se fixer le taux de profit espéré et le taux d’investissement de sécurisation. L’intérêt des riverains, favorables à plus de sécurité, n’est pas forcément incompatible avec l’intérêt de la firme : une exigence plus grande des riverains en matière de sécurité peut s’accompagner d’une hausse simultanée de l’investissement de sécurisation et du taux de profit espéré. Dans cette situation, nous suggérons la nécessité de rendre la concertation plus équilibrée en permettant aux riverains de commander des contre-expertises en matière d’études de danger.
L69|Methodical Principles of Internal Control of Inventories in the Enterprise Operations Management System|Effective formation of reserves at the enterprise acts as a buffer between suppliers of raw materials and materials and eliminates the need of continuous supplies, and reduces the costs on inventory holdings to the minimum. This article is devoted to justification of the need to use formation methods of production supplies' scope at domestic enterprises, which are widely used in countries with market economies, particularly in the USA, Britain and Japan. The problems of control over the formation of enterprise production supplies are outlined. It was revealed that the shortcoming of the current system of fixed orders is the formation of excessive supplies and costs or their lack. It was proved that the most effective control systems in terms of supplies stocking are the Anglo-American system 'Push' - 'according to the consumption' and the 'Pull' - 'just in time' and the last Japanese version - 'Kanban'. The advantage of the Japanese version is in minimization of purchase timing. Given the current economic conditions of management in Ukraine, it was proposed to use the traditional model 'Push', that developed during the twentieth century, with the improvement of the factors that ensure optimization of costs for inventory producing and holding.
L69|An Optimized Combination of a Large Grid Connected PV System along with Battery Cells and a Diesel Generator|Environmental, economical and technical benefits of photovoltaic (PV) systems make them to be used in many countries. The main characteristic of PV systems is the fluctuations of their output power. Hence, high penetration of PV systems into electric network could be detrimental to overall system performance. Furthermore, the fluctuations in the output power of PV systems make it difficult to predict their output, and to consider them in generation planning of the units. The main objective of this paper is to propose a hybrid method which can be used to control and reduce the power fluctuations generated from large grid- connected PV systems. The proposed method focuses on using a suitable storage battery along with curtailment of the generated power by operating the PV system below the maximum power point (MPP) and deployment of a diesel generator. These methods are analyzed to investigate the impacts of implementing them on the economical benefits that the PV system owner could gain. To maximize the revenues, an optimization problem is solved.
L69|ICT and R&D as inputs or efficiency determinants? Analysing Italian manufacturing firms (2007–2009)|Abstract Are Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Research & Development (R&D) productive inputs or efficiency determinants? This is the topic of this paper, which analyses a sample of 2691 Italian manufacturing firms over the period 2007–2009. Data are from a merged EFIGE–AIDA dataset. The empirical setting is based on a production function estimated through the stochastic frontier approach. ICT and R&D are used once as inputs, once as efficiency determinants. The results show that the elasticities of production with respect to ICT and R&D investments are quite high (0.08 for ICT and 0.04 for R&D) when they enter into the model only as inputs. We also documented that ICT and R&D contribute positively to explain the efficiency scores.
L69|Competitive Advantages In A Nanotechnology Value Chain|The value chain analysis is one of the most important methods for understanding the industrial world. The main task of the value chain that links producers and buyers consists in understanding where or how exactly the value added is generated. In the case of products incorporating nanotechnology, most of them are still in the trial phase into laboratories, but there are some examples of good practices where nanoproducts discovered their way to the market. This paper tries to present two cases of value chains for nanotechnologies applied to textiles by identifying the competitive advantages and focusing on getting some answers for a better understanding of the entire process from production to the final user.

L69|Indian Carpet Industry after Trade Liberalization. Problems and Prospects|This paper aims to examine the constraints and opportunities emerged for the Micro, small and medium enterprises in carpet industry after trade liberalization. The survey method was selected for this study. A structured questionnaire, containing both close and open ended questions was used for data collection. 65 carpet firms of Bhadohi District of Uttar Pradesh registered with All India Carpet Manufacture Association (AICMA) were surveyed. Liberalization has brought many opportunities for carpet industry apart from challenges. Findings of the present study show that liberalization gave access to new markets and increased demand of products. Increased cost of raw material, difficulty in ‘export facilitation’ and ‘legal-regulatory framework and difficulty in procuring funds from local financial institutions were identified as the major constraints for the carpet industry.
L69|The role of Services in Enhancing Indian Manufacturing Exports: A Firm Level Analysis, 2000-01 to 2011-12|In this paper, we try to examine and assess the contribution of services towards India’s manufacturing exports at the firm level. In other words, the role of services in shaping the international competiveness of the Indian Manufacturing Sector at the firm level is examined. Services are instrumental in connecting to the world market and can help firms to differentiate their products. However, only bits and pieces of the relation between services and exports have been analyzed in the earlier literature. Most of the earlier studies relating to services have explored the link between services and Total Factor Productivity. The relation between services and exports has not been explored at the firm level in case of India. This also gives a justification for conducting the present study. With now firm level databases available, it allows us to explore this part in details. For exploring this link, the firm level data was collected from the Centre for Monitoring of The Indian Economy (Prowess Database) for the years 2000-01 to 2011-12. The Manufacturing firms had used different types of services according to their needs and the expenditure for the all the different services were not the same. The expenses incurred by the manufacturing firms for services like business services, repairs and maintenance, Professional services, Research & Development and others etc. were added together to get total expenses on the services variable. Two alternative econometric methods (Panel Regression method and Tobit model) were used in our study. The findings confirm that services have contributed to enhanced export competitiveness of the Indian manufacturing firms. The paper looks at the firm specific factors like firm size, age, previous years export performance, group versus non-group, labor productivity and services that affected the export performance of the Indian manufacturing firms. The overall results show that the firm specific factors such as firm size, extent of use of services, group versus non-group firms, and previous years export performance played a positive role in improving the Indian manufacturing exports.
L69|The Impact of the Macroeconomic Environment on Pakistan’s Manufacturing Sector|This paper analyzes the impact of the macroeconomic environment on Pakistan’s manufacturing sector, emphasizing in particular the role of fiscal and monetary policies in shaping incentives for industrial investment. Arguably, Pakistan’s macroeconomic fundamentals in the last two decades have remained fragile, resulting in severe macroeconomic imbalances that have contributed to macroeconomic instability and hampered private investment in aggregate as well as in the manufacturing sector. Furthermore, macroeconomic stabilization policies have often failed to produce the desired results owing to the lack of coordination between monetary and fiscal policies. Pakistan’s economy has thus lived on borrowed money and time and on rent-seeking behavior. Although some recent macroeconomic indicators have improved slightly, fundamental weaknesses remain. In particular, the recent improvement in the current account deficit was driven largely by the high inflow of remittances, coupled with financial engineering such as loan payments from the International Monetary Fund, “friendly” money, European Union bonds, and Islamic sukuk. It is imperative to think about the consequences of a leveraged reliance on remittances in the aftermath of falling oil prices and global deflation. Prudent macroeconomic management aimed at consolidating public finances and controlling inflationary pressures is essential to boost industrial investment and yield sustainable growth.
L69|Impacts of a Micro-Enterprise Clustering Programme on Firm Performance in Ghana|Widely considered an important backbone of economies in developing countries, micro- and small enterprises face several growth constraints. The creation of industrial zones (IZs) with improved access to infrastructure and secure land tenure is a potential remedy to promote local economic development. We assess the effects of an intervention on business performance indicators that establishes IZs for micro-enterprises in Ghana based on firm-level data on 227 enterprises. The results show that the establishment of IZs leads to the creation of new firms, but for existing firms that relocated to the IZs the effects on firm performance are negative.
L69|Monopoly Power in Iranian Rubber and Plastics Industries: A Comparative|The main purposes of this article are the evaluation of competition and comparison of market power in rubber and plastics industries with two non-structural approaches. To meet this ends Bresnehan-Lau (1982) and Panzar-Ross (1987) models were used. Data in 4-digit industries for rubber and plastics sub-sectors over the period of 1995-2011 collected from Iran’s statistical center. Equations used in this study consist of supply-demand and reduced form revenue functions estimated with two stage least squares fixed effect (FE2SLS) and least square dummy variables (LSDV) methods respectively. Results indicated that the extent of conjectural variation coefficient was about θ=0.82 because of the fact that firms cooperate with each other, therefore there was imperfect competition structure in this sector. On the other hand, the sum of elasticity’s reduced form revenue with respect to input price was about H=0.81, so market structure was featured as a monopolistic competition. In addition, Comparative results of two approaches confirmed depletion of competition in Iranian rubber and plastics industries.
L69|Substitution or Overlap? The Relations between Geographical and Non-spatial Proximity Dimensions in Collaborative Innovation Projects| H ansen T. Substitution or overlap? The relations between geographical and non-spatial proximity dimensions in collaborative innovation projects, Regional Studies . Traditionally, economic geographers stress geographical proximity's positive impact on collaboration processes. However, effects of cognitive, organizational, social and institutional proximity dimensions have been emphasized recently. This paper examines the relations between geography and these non-spatial dimensions by distinguishing two mechanisms: the substitution mechanism, where non-spatial forms of proximity substitute for geographical proximity; and the overlap mechanism, where geographical proximity facilitates non-spatial proximity. The two mechanisms' importance is analysed in collaborative innovation projects in the Danish cleantech industry. Regression models are complemented by a qualitative analysis of the relationship between the geographical and institutional dimensions.

Das heißt, ein Blick auf die Umfrageergebnisse verdeutlicht, in welcher konjunkturellen Phase sich die Branche befindet.
L69|The Future Is Today|In 2010 the European Competitiveness Report showed some insights about the importance of the five key enabling technologies which are nanotechnology, biotechnology, micro-systems, advanced materials and photonics, emphasising the role of these technologies for a country’s competitiveness. European reports mentioned later six key enabling technologies, the number increased by adding a new one: advanced manufacturing systems. In a short time, the advances of technology generate faster growing and open new industrial directions that are difficult to predict. This paper focuses on a summary case study about the advanced manufacturing systems enabled by key enabling technologies trying to point out their importance for the value chain. Some experiences showed by European reports could inspire beginner countries like Romania. Even if the Romanian reality reflected by some statistical data is not optimistic, there is a very ambitious plan for next years to implement politics for setting key enabling technologies.
L69|Complex Evaluation Model of Corporate Energy Management|With the ever increasing energy problems at the doorstep alongside with political, economic, social and environmental challenges, conscious energy management has become of increasing importance in corporate resource management. Rising energy costs, stricter environmental and climate regulations as well as considerable changes in the energy market require companies to rationalise their energy consumption and cut energy costs. This study presents a complex evaluation model of corporate energy management, which can be used for identifying corporate challenges resulting from global energy crises and for seeking possible answers to them as well as enabling companies to evaluate their current energy management practices and identify the level of their energy consciousness. This model enables companies to rethink their energy management tasks and identify the most acute problems of their energy management practices.
L69|The Impact Of Industry Characteristics On Firms’ Export Intensity|The process of globalization of economies and markets has led firms to consider entry into foreign markets. Exporting is the simplest foreign market entry mode, but also the most common, not requiring high financial and human resources. Hence it is important to study the factors that can affect the firm’s export intensity, measure commonly used to assess the export performance. Several authors have studied the factors that influence the firm’s export performance, but few have addressed the relationship between industry characteristics and export intensity. Thus, the objective of the present study is to analyze the impact of industry characteristics (capital intensity, R&D intensity, labor productivity, export orientation, and concentration level) on the firm’s export intensity, seeking to add empirical evidence to this relatively neglected research area. Based on a sample of 1,425 Portuguese firms during the period 2008-2010, and using panel data estimation, the empirical results show that some industry characteristics (labor productivity, export orientation, concentration), as well as firm characteristics (labor productivity, size) are important determinants of a firm’s export intensity. In particular, we conclude that firm export intensity is positively affected by labor productivity (at industry and firm level), corroborating the idea that firms and governments need to direct their policies towards increased productivity in order to improve competitiveness in foreign markets.
L69|ICT and R&D as inputs or efficiency determinants? Analysing the manufacturing Italian firms over the 2007-2009|Are Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Research & Development (R&D) inputs or efficiency determinants? This is the topic of the paper which is developed by analysing a sample of 2691 Italian manufacturing firms over the period 2007-2009. The empirical setting is based on a production function estimated through the Stochastic Frontier (SF) approach. ICT and R&D are used once as inputs, once as efficiency determinants (Coelli et al., 1999). Results show that the rates of return of ICT and R&D investments are high (0.08 for ICT and 0.04 for R&D) when they enter into the model only as inputs. We also documented that ICT and R&D contribute positively to explain the efficiency scores.
L69|Agricultural commodities and processed products ratio in the Romanian international agrifood trade|Romania’s international agrifood trade increased significantly during the last decade, and mostly after the EU accession. Since 1990, the Romanian agrifood trade balance showed an almost continuous increasing deficit trend until 2008. In four years only, the trend reversed and in 2013, for the first time in the last two and a half decades, the agrifood trade balance turned positive. The present paper is analyzing the evolution of the trade evolution and its structure, separating the agrifood products in three categories: agricultural commodities, primarily processed products and secondary processed products. A higher ratio of processed products in exports is indicating an increased competitiveness, resulting from higher unit values incorporating more added value, and showing, at the same time, a higher development degree of the country’s food industry. The results for total trade show that the processed products represented at most 46% of the Romanian exports, and at least 63% of imports, indicating a low-competitive structure of the agrifood trade. The analysis is detailed for intra and extra-EU trade and by main partners and groups of products.

An understanding of the forces that are shaping and shifting the competitive landscape is useful not only in understanding the strategic positioning decisions of the firms in this industry, but also in understanding the dramatic structural changes that are currently occurring in the publishing production and distribution sector. We frame this discussion using the analytical concepts of value chains and Porter’s Five Forces.
L69|Growth Effects of Industrial Clusters|This article develops a simple methodology for calculation of growth effects of industrial clusters at national level and estimates the economic determinants of the clustersâ€™ size-class of production by using data on 354 individual industrial clusters in India. Gross value of industrial clusters is indirectly measured and growth effects are calculated within the National Income Accounting framework. Determinants are estimated by using the grouped data on size-class of value of production by clusters. Results show that industrial clusters contributed to Indiaâ€™s economic growth of manufacturing sector (or Indian economy) between 8 to 3 per cent (or between 1 to 0.4 per cent) in 2002â€“2003 and 2003â€“2004, respectively. Binary Logit estimates show that industrial clusters with modern small scale industries and traditional art and craft products, high and medium heterogeneity, high and medium potential for technology upgradation and exports and those which are market or resource based are the important determinants of size-class of production of clusters. Other things being equal, an improvement in these determinants may contribute to higher gross value added and maximization of economic growth by industrial clusters. This analysis is useful to calculate the determinants of probability of individual clusters belonging to larger size-class of production at the state level. Further, the approach is relevant and applicable to estimate growth effects of industrial clusters in other South Asian countries as well.
L69|Estimating the rebound effect of technological improvement in Iran?s industry sector|Rebound effect refers to the phenomenon that energy savings from improvement in energy efficiency are lower than expected due to unintended second-order effects. The main reason of improving energy efficiency is Technological improvement. According to Khazzoom formula, the rebound effect of improving technology is equal to price elasticity of demand so in this research natural gas demand function is estimated. In addition to the economic drivers (natural gas price, price of substituted energy factors, industry value added), there are number of exogenous factors that drive energy demand. This research therefore uses Structural Time Series Model to estimate natural gas demand in Iran`s industry sector during 1988 to 2009 and then Khazzoom rebound effect is calculated. Estimated short run and long run rebound effect in Iran`s industry sector are 63 percent and 133 percent respectively, with a generally increasing UEDT in a decreasing rate. UEDT has upward sloping but level of UEDT is fixed during the period of research so the model is ?smooth trend model?. Relating to the research findings improving technology in Iran`s industry sector reduces Natural gas consumption up to 37 percent in short run. But in long time period increases Natural gas consumption up to 133 percent. So in short run technological improvement can reduce consumption approximately but in long run price policy reform should be used simultaneously.

L69|Productivity spillovers among linked sectors|This paper estimates the impact of inter-sectoral linkages on productivity at the sectoral level. An exhaustive Chinese panel data set for capital, infrastructure and a sectoral agglomeration index is linked with an economic distance matrix derived from inter-sectoral transactions. The latter matrix can replace the conventional geographic distance matrix from spatial econometrics. The impact through spillovers is mixed—the direct impact passing to related sectors and back to the initial sector itself, and the indirect impact arising from changes in all sectors. The results suggest that (1) economic growth in a sector is driven by spillovers among sectors that are linked through flows of goods and services; economic distance plays a more important role in stimulating productivity spillover than spatial distance; a shorter economic distance transmits a larger productivity spillover between sectors; (2) infrastructure spillover improves labor productivity in linked sectors; (3) agglomeration diseconomies can be partially reduced by infrastructure investment.
L69|Economic analysis of alternatives for optimizing energy use in manufacturing companies|The manufacturing companies are one of the main consumers of energy. The increment in global warming and the instability in the petroleum oil market have motivated companies to find alternatives to reduce energy use. In the academic literature several researchers have demonstrated that optimization models can be successfully used to reduce energy use. This research presents the use of an optimization model to identify feasible economic alternatives to reduce energy use. The economic analysis methods used were the payback and the internal rate of return. The optimization model developed in this research was applied and validated using an electronic manufacturing company case study. The results demonstrate that the main variables affecting the economic feasibility of the alternatives are the economic analysis method and the initial implementation costs. Several scenarios were analyzed and the best results show that the manufacturing company could save up to $78,000 in three years if the recommendations based on the optimization model results are implemented.
L69|Logistics Management Methodology For The Improvement Of Small Businesses, Metodologia De Gestion Logistica Para El Mejoramiento De Pequenas Empresas|Small businesses generally lack financial resources to pay for a logistics consulting. This implies that management of processes within the organization becomes a problem for the employer or an opportunity for improvement. This paper presents a methodology of support to improve logistics operations of small businesses. The first step proposed is to make a diagnosis from a basis of indicators of procurement, warehousing, transportation, distribution, customer service, reverse logistics, social responsibility and logistics costs. Further tools are designed for each of the above areas that improve internal logistics problems of companies. According to the diagnostic results, the company should decide which of these tools meet their needs to find an improvement. The first results of this implementation are disclosed hereby.

While highlighting some of the basic flaws in the compilation of IIP data, an attempt has also been made to gauge at the output growth pattern of the industrial sector emerging from the estimates of IIP and the annual survey of industry (ASI). Our analysis reveals divergences between the output growth trend of these two datasets.
L69|Balancing Firm and Network-based Resources to Gain Competitive Advantage: A Case Study of an Artisanal Musical Instruments Cluster in Germany|The question of whether firms gain competitiveness through local networks and clusters becomes more relevant than ever as globalization proceeds. This is particularly true for traditional and craft-based clusters, districts and business networks. A central question emerging for these types of networks is: (How) can they build competitive advantage using local production systems and network ties as core resources? The present article aims at shedding light on this issue by presenting a case study of an artisanal cluster operating in the manufacturing of classical musical instruments. Focusing on a resource-based perspective and using a qualitative research approach, the paper explores the critical resources necessary for generating competitive advantage through local networking. It critically investigates how competitive advantage is gained for the network and which are the drivers of sustaining competitive advantage in a dynamic view.
L69|Social Capital Determinants of Preferential Resource Allocation in Regional Clusters|Regional clusters are known to facilitate firms in achieving higher levels of competitive advantage. This observation suggests that cluster firms manage to obtain better competitive resources than firms outside the cluster. The strong social ties in regional clusters are considered to be a crucial factor in the resource exchange between cluster firms. In this paper, we integrate this social perspective from the cluster literature with a recent stream in the resource-based view (RBV) literature. This stream seeks to explain the phenomenon of preferential resource allocation. That is, how can firms obtain better resources from a resource environment that is shared with competitors? Although preferential resource allocation has revealed to be a relevant concept, little is known about its actual antecedents. We introduce a conceptual framework that builds on the social interactions among cluster firms to explain the concept of preferential resource allocation. More specifically, we develop propositions on the antecedents of preferential resource allocation by building on the structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions of social capital theory, and a firm’ s embeddedness in a regional cluster. In so doing, this paper provides insights that may contribute to a better understanding of the competitive advantage of cluster firms, and it opens onto current streams in the RBV literature.
L69|Strukturentwicklungen im Handwerk|The skilled crafts are still an essential element in the German economy. The characteristics of these companies, however, have changed dramatically in recent years. Previously, medium-scale enterprises of approximately 5 to 49 employees dominated. In recent years, however, a polarisation of the skilled crafts spectrum has occurred. Partially due to the amendment of the Trades and Crafts Code in 2004, the share of small and one-person businesses has risen sharply. Additionally, larger-scale enterprises play an increasingly important role, and this development is only partially reflected in the statistical data.

L69|Why do electricity prices jump? Empirical evidence from the Nordic electricity market|The paper empirically explores the possible causes behind electricity price jumps in the Nordic electricity market, Nord Pool. A time-series model (a mixed GARCH–EARJI jump model) capturing the common statistical features of electricity prices is used to identify price jumps. By the model, a categorical variable is defined distinguishing no, positive and negative jumps. The causes for the jumps are then explored through the use of ordered probit models in a second stage. The empirical results indicate that the structure of the market plays an important role in whether shocks in the demand and supply for electricity translate into price jumps.
L69|Market Liberalization and Market Integration - Essays on the Nordic Electricity Market|This thesis consists of four self-contained papers related to the Nordic electricity market. Paper [I] examine how the reform of the Nordic electricity markets has affected competition in the electric power supply market, Nord Pool. The question is if the common power market has been competitive or if electric power generators have had market power during the period 1996 -2004. Moreover, since there was a stepwise evolution from national markets to a multinational power market, we also ask how the degree of market power has evolved during this integration process. The results show that electric power generators have had a small, but statistically significant, degree of market power during the whole period. However, studying the integration effect, i.e. how the market power has been affected by additional countries joining Nord Pool, it show that the degree of market power has been reduced and finally vanished as the market has expanded and more countries joined the collaboration. Paper [II] analyse how the deregulation of the Swedish electricity market has affected the price of electric power and how the change in electric power price, in turn, has affected consumers’ welfare. The result shows that the change in pricing principle of electric power following the deregulation has increased consumer welfare over the period studied (1996-2006), with welfare gains about 100 SEK per customer per year, indicating a three per cent welfare gain for the average customer. Paper [III] study whether (and to what extent) the multinational electricity market integration has affected the price dynamics at the Nordic power exchange. The results shows that a larger electricity market seems to reduce the probability of sudden price jumps, but also that the effect on volatility seem to depend on the characteristics, i.e. production structure, of the integrated markets. In Paper [IV] a two-stage study is conducted to investigate the extent to which shocks in the demand and supply for electricity translate into price jumps, and the extent to which this process is affected by the prevailing market structure. The main findings from the study is that whether demand and supply shocks translate into price jumps largely depends on the prevailing market structure, i.e. on how far the market works from capacity constraints. A notable feature of the empirical analysis is also that the marginal effects from positive demand and negative supply shocks on the jump probabilities are mostly insignificant and of small magnitude.

L69|Business Method Patents-International Developments|Business Method may be defined as â€œa method of operating any aspect of business enterpriseâ€ . A business method is classified as a process because it is not a physical object like a mechanical invention or chemical composition. Business Method Patents being usually process patent in nature and the same can be interpreted as new and useful process being patented under this kind of patents. A business method patent confers upon its holder a set of exclusive rights with respect to a particular manner in which a business operation can be carried out. A business method patent confers upon its holder a set of exclusive rights with respect to a particular manner in which a business operation can be carried out. It constitutes a special category of patents which are conferred for operating business in an innovative way. Business method patents are most commonly associated with electronic commerce and other computer related supported infrastructures for carrying business operations.
L69|The Consequences of Easy Credit Policy, High Gearing, and Firms’ Profitability in Pakistan’s Textile Sector: A Panel Data Analysis|This study uses panel data on 75 textile firms for the period 2000–09 to examine the consequences of an easy credit policy followed by high gearing, increased financing costs, and other determinants of corporate profitability. Five out of nine explanatory variables—including gearing, financing costs, inflation, tax provisions, and the industry’s capacity utilization ratio—have a negative impact, while the remaining four variables—working capital management, asset turnover, exports, competitiveness, and devaluation—have a positive impact on firms’ profitability.
L69|Modelli di business e competitività delle piccole imprese. L’industria italiana del mobile|"The article illustrates some of the key results of an analysis to measure the mediumterm competitiveness of SMEs (small and medium enterprises), with the aim of identifying and clustering their BM (business models) according to a specific set of key competitive factors; the combination of these factors describes the approach of each BM to its market segments and relative challenges. For the purposes of this paper, each BM is considered a ""stylized"" representation of the value chain structure and the organization of the activities needed to succeed in the marketplace. That approach enables us to examine the economic structure and competitive factors of those SMEs that are parts of networks of firms, especially in relation to small companies that operate as contractors for other companies and, which, in turn, outsource parts of their production. The result is a studied comparison of the efficiency and competitive ability of the production districts in the Italian furniture industry that we believe useful to the formulation of policies to improve their performance. :"
L69|Lean Thinking and Transferring Lean Management - The Best Defence against an Economic Recession?|Productivity growth is a fundamental means for society to improve its living standards. Productivity growth comes from technological change (new ways of producing goods and services) and better organisation of production (better ways of using available resources given available technology). Both processes operate simultaneously and, in practice, it is difficult to distinguish between the effects of each process. The processes are dynamic and affect individual activities differently over time. These years, manufacturing functions have been transferred rapidly and globally from mature countries to emerging countries. This paper is about the lean philosophy and the critical elements for successful transfer of lean management among sites and countries.

L69|Trade sustainability impact assessment (SIA) on the comprehensive economic and trade agreement (CETA) between the EU and Canada: Final report|Commissioned by the European Commission, the Final Report for the EU-Canada Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) on the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) provides a comprehensive assessment of the potential impacts of trade liberalisation under CETA. The analysis assesses the economic, social and environmental impacts in Canada and the European Union in three main sectors, sixteen sub-sectors and across seven cross-cutting issues. It predicts a number of macro-economic and sector-specific impacts. The macro analysis suggests the EU may see increases in real GDP of 0.02-0.03% in the long-term from CETA, whereas Canada may see increases of 0.18-0.36%. The Investment section of the report suggests these numbers could be higher when factoring in investment increases. At the sectoral level, the study predicts the greatest gains in output and trade to be stimulated by services liberalisation and by the removal of tariffs applied on sensitive agricultural products. It also suggests CETA could have a positive social impact if it includes provisions on the ILO’s Core Labour Standards and Decent Work Agenda. The study also details a variety of impacts in various “cross-cutting” components of CETA. It finds CETA would stimulate investment in Canada, and to a lesser extent in the EU; and finds costs outweigh the benefits of including controversial NAFTA-style investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions in CETA. It predicts potentially imbalanced benefits from a government procurement (GP) chapter. The study assumes CETA will lead to an upward harmonisation in intellectual property rights (IPR) regulations, particularly in Canada, which will have a number of effects. It predicts some notable impacts in terms of competition policy, as well as trade facilitation, free circulation of goods and labour mobility.

L69|Regional Knowledge and the Emergence of an Industry: Laser Systems Production in West Germany, 1975-2005|We analyze the emergence and spatial evolution of the German laser systems industry. Regional knowledge in the related field of laser sources, as well as the presence of universities with physics or engineering departments, is conducive to the emergence of laser systems suppliers. The regional presence of source producers is also positively related to entry into laser systems. One important mechanism behind regional entry is the diversification of upstream laser source producers into the downstream systems market. Entry into the materials processing submarket appears to be unrelated to academic knowledge in the region, but the presence of laser source producers and the regional stock of laser knowledge are still highly predictive in this submarket.
L69|Spatial Externalities and Regional Income Inequality: Evidence from China’s Prefecture- Level Data|Based on panel data of 282 prefectures in China from 1999 to 2004; we explore the relationship between market potential, employment density and per capita GDP by using a dynamic panel data approach. It is found that the externalities arising from market potential and employment density have a positive and significant effect on local income. Moreover, both absolute and standardized elasticity of market potential externalities are pronounced, which suggests that market potential has a greater impact on regional disparity.

L69|Copyright and endogenous market structure: a glimpse from the journal-publishing market|This article explores the journal publishing industry in order to shed light on the overall economic consequences of copyright in markets. Since the rationale for copyright is among others to promise some market power to the holder of the successful copyrighted item, it also provides incentives to preserve and extend market power. A regular trait of copyright industries is high concentration and the creation of large catalogues of copyrights in the hands of incumbents. This outcome can be observed as the aggregation of rights and is one of the pivotal strategies for obtaining or extending market power, consistently with findings in other cases. Journal publishing is no different in this respect from other copyright industries, and in the last decade has experienced a similar trajectory, leading to a highly concentrated industry in which a handful of large firms increasingly control a substantial part of the market. It also provides a clear example of the effect of copyright dynamics on market structure, suggesting that a different attitude should be taken in lawmaking and law enforcement.
L69|Rural Electrification and Manufacturing Firm Performance in Benin – An Ex-Ante Impact Assessment|Productive electricity use is widely believed to contribute to positive impacts of electrification projects. This paper investigates these impacts by comparing the performance of micro manufacturing enterprises in grid-covered and non-covered villages in Northern Benin. Using firm-level data, the empirical analysis employs a Propensity Score Matching. While beneficial impacts are found from firm creation after electrification, firms that existed before actually show a non-significantly inferior performance to their matched counterparts from a non-electrified region. Complementary measures that sensitize firms about the implications of a grid connection are recommended as important features of program design.
L69|How Do Gasoline Prices Affect Fleet Fuel Economy?|Exploiting a rich dataset of passenger vehicle registrations in 20 US MSAs from 1997 to 2005, we examine the effects of gasoline prices on the automotive fleet's composition. We find that high gasoline prices affect fleet fuel economy through two channels: shifting new auto purchases towards more fuel-efficient vehicles, and speeding the scrappage of older, less fuel-efficient used vehicles. Policy simulations suggest that a 10 percent increase in gasoline prices from 2005 levels will generate a 0.22 percent increase in fleet fuel economy in the short run and a 2.04 percent increase in the long run.

L69|Análise de arranjos para extração de óleos vegetais e suprimento de usina de biodiesel| This study aimed at the technical-economical evaluation of implanting some vegetal-oil extraction units in order to insert the family agriculture into bio-diesel production chain. Three project models (arrangements) for vegetal-oil extraction units at different sizes were proposed, using extraction by pressing and mixed extraction (extracting by either pressing or solvent) and different raw materials (castor-oil and soybean). For the size analysis, the oil production scales between 50/60 tons/day were used with real market data concerning investments, inputs prices of the process, raw materials and vegetal oil. For the economic analyses, the software BioSoft was used. The BioSoft is a program for supporting the decision-making process, which was developed through analyzing units of bio-diesel production, and it was adapted to evaluate units of vegetal oil extraction. It was concluded that the unit of chemical extraction producing castor and soybean oils shows more satisfactory results. However, this model presents less social return because the number of the families involved is lower, once, in using soybean, it operates with only 50% of raw material deriving from family agriculture.

L69|MEXICAN MAQUILA INDUSTRY OUTLOOK. A Quantitative Space-Time Analysis|The aim of this article is to analyse the current situation and the short and mid term outlook of the maquila export industry in Mexico. The purpose is to carry out an analysis of quantitative economic conjuncture, by conveniently combining the necessary elements. Therefore, we have used an empiric base- relevant information expressed in monthly statistical time series of the Mexican value added of export income charged by maquila service (VAECMS) in national and state levels- and quantitative methods (statistical-econometrics techniques). Under this framework, we present a methodological proposal in order to analyse ARIMA models with outliers and calendar effects, then we use a reduced model for the signal extraction. The trend-cycle component is the most suitable way to consider the underlying evolution. From this component and from the growth rate and inertial behaviour we are able to extract the major conclusions of the current Mexican export maquila situation in general as well as in detail in the principal states of the country.
L69|The Estimation of Technical Efficiency Effects Models with an Example Applied to the Thai Manufacturing Sector| This paper does two things. First, it presents alternative approaches to the standard methods of estimating productive efficiency using a production function. It favours a parametric approach (viz. the stochastic production frontier approach) over a nonparametric approach (e.g. data envelopment analysis); and, further, one that provides a statistical explanation of efficiency, as well as an estimate of its magnitude. Second, it illustrates the favoured approach (i.e. the â€˜single stage procedureâ€™) with estimates of two models of explained inefficiency, using data from the Thai manufacturing sector, after the crisis of 1997. Technical efficiency is modelled as being dependent on capital investment in three major areas (viz. land, machinery and office appliances) where land is intended to proxy the effects of unproductive, speculative capital investment; and both machinery and office appliances are intended to proxy the effects of productive, non-speculative capital investment. The estimates from these models cast new light on the five-year long, post-1997 crisis period in Thailand, suggesting a structural shift from relatively labour intensive to relatively capital intensive production in manufactures from 1998 to 2002.
L69|Finance and Industrial Dynamics (In French)|The transformations of the finance sector linked to the emergence of new actors (pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds…) and its globalization have changed the rules of corporate governance and the competitive context of industrial companies. The theme of the influence between finance and industry is not new in the economic literature. The first thesis of the influence of finance on industry born in the United States (with the Veblen thesis) and Europe (Hilferding, 1910) with the development of joint stock companies (corporations in the U.S.) and financial institutions. The recent transformations and crisis of capitalism show the relevance of the old theories of finance. In the first section of the paper we examines how arguments about the domination of finance on industry developed in the early 20th century are still relevant in modern capitalism with the debate of shareholder value. In a second part, we show that globalization is partly a myth because the shareholding structures are localized. Geography and institutions matter in finance for explaining the behaviors.
L69|Short-Run Oil Price Drivers: South America's Energy Integration|The aim of this paper seeks to analyse how the energy price's cojuntural behaviour and structural conditions affect the short-run and mid-run overview of the energy integration process in South America (SA). For these porpoise we - first describe the world-wide energy agenda and the effect of current oil price swings and the corresponding natural gas adjustment - next we discuss about the regional stakeholders perspective of energy integration. We used two methodological approaches - first we calculate the oil prices according to their structural conditions or fundamental - second we detect the right ARIMA model with outliers and calendar effects For the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price and the Henry Hub (HH) natural gas price. With this information we develop an analysis proposal based on their underlying growth rate and inertia.
