K16|Inversions in US Presidential Elections: 1836-2016|Inversions—in which the popular vote winner loses the election—have occurred in 4 US Presidential elections. We show that rather than being statistical flukes, inversions have been ex ante likely since the 1800s. In elections yielding a popular vote margin within one percentage point (which has happened in one-eighth of Presidential elections), 40% will be inversions in expectation. Inversion probabilities are asymmetric, in various periods favoring Whigs, Democrats, or Republicans. Feasible policy changes—including awarding each state’s Electoral College ballots proportionally between parties rather than awarding all to the state winner—could substantially reduce inversion probabilities, though not in close elections.
K16|Effects of Photo ID Laws on Registration and Turnout: Evidence from Rhode Island|We study the effect of photo ID laws on voting using a difference-in-differences estimation approach around Rhode Island’s implementation of a photo ID law. We employ anonymized administrative data to measure the law’s impact by comparing voting behavior among those with drivers’ licenses versus those without, before versus after the law. Turnout, registration, and voting conditional on registration fell for those without licenses after the law passed. We do not find evidence that people proactively obtained licenses in anticipation of the law, nor do we find that they substituted towards mail ballots which do not require a photo ID.
K16|Will Ukraine Be Able to Establish Real Property Rights?|Over time, the necessary economic reforms have become so obvious that they have become politically possible in most places. The great problem has become the establishment of real property rights. By and large, Central and Eastern Europe have managed to accomplish that not least thanks to support from the European Union. In the former Soviet Union, however, only Georgia succeeded in that endeavor. The big question today is whether Ukraine will manage to do so, or whether it will be caught in a low-economic-growth trap. The three main elements that are needed are independent courts, autonomous prosecutors, and a law-abiding law enforcement, while no old secret police structures should be allowed to sabotage them.
K16|Does Gerrymandering Violate the Fourteenth Amendment? Insight from the Median Voter Theorem|This paper argues that â€œgerrymanderingâ€ understood here to mean the intentional redrawing of legislative district boundaries to benefit a given party, robs opposition voters of implicit bargaining power.. Using the Median Voter Theorem and statistical examples, this paper argues that the presence of minority voters in a legislative district influences the majority partyâ€™s choice of candidate, whenever minority voters are present in sufficient number to pose a credible challenge. When, through gerrymandering, lawmakers insure that minority voters cannot mount such a challenge, they deny such voters equal protection under the law.
K16|Why Do Military Dictatorships Become Presidential Democracies? Mapping the Democratic Interests of Autocratic Regimes|This paper starts with the observation that almost all military dictatorships that democratize become presidential democracies. I hypothesize that military interests are able to coordinate on status-preserving institutional change prior to democratization and therefore prefer political institutions with strong veto players. Parallel civilian interests conversely suffer from coordination failure by being more diverse and les cohesive. The hypothesis therefore implies that most military democratizations are partially planned while most democratization events from civilian autocracy are either unforeseen or poorly planned. Exploring the characteristics of 111 democratization episodes between 1950 and 2015, I find a number of features broadly consistent with further theoretical predictions.
K16|Term limits and voter turnout|This paper studies the impact of term limits on voter turnout, using the recent introduction of term limits at the local government level in Portugal as a natural experiment. Although instrumental, expressive, and information-based theories of voter participation imply effects of term limits on turnout, this is clearly an under-researched topic. Applying a difference-in-differences approach to data at both the municipal and parish levels, we find strong evidence that the introduction of term limits increased voter participation. Our results contrast with previous findings for California and demonstrate that more research on this topic is clearly necessary.
K16|Descentralización (y centralización) sin representación: a propósito de la composición territorial del congreso colombiano|Este artículo explora la composición territorial del Congreso bicameral colombiano en las legislaturas del período 1991-2018. Ilustra la prevalencia y persistencia del fenómeno de los Departamentos sin senador, que ha afectado a jurisdicciones pequeñas y medianas en tamaño de población. Muestra que la composición de la Cámara de Representantes y la del Senado tienden a duplicarse, con predominio de las entidades territoriales más pobladas. Arguye que las reglas de composición del Senado no son inclusivas territorialmente y que conducen a una concentración geográfica excesiva del poder político, desaprovechando las posibilidades que ofrece el bicameralismo como mecanismo de balance de poderes en una democracia. Los problemas de representación política territorial en el centro no son intrascendentes: es allí donde se forja el marco legal de la descentralización y la centralización. El escrito analiza algunas propuestas y medidas dirigidas a encararlos. *** This paper explores the territorial composition of the Colombian bicameral Congress in the legislatures of the period 1991-2018. It illustrates the prevalence and persistence of the phenomenon of Departments without a Senator, which has affected small and medium-sized jurisdictions in population. It shows that the composition of the House of Representatives and that of the Senate tend to be similar, with predominance of the most populous territorial entities. It argues that the rules of composition of the Senate are not territorially inclusive and lead to an excessive geographical concentration of political power, missing out on the possibilities offered by bicameralism as a balance of power mechanism in a democracy. The problems of territorial political representation in the center are not inconsequential: It is there where the legal framework of decentralization and centralization is forged. The paper discusses some proposals and measures aimed at addressing such problems.
K16|Quorum Rules and Shareholder Power|This paper characterizes the equilibria of a costly voting game in which shareholders heterogeneous in both size and preferences strategically vote for or against a proposed resolution or withhold. It is shown that a minimum quorum generates (1) equilibria in which one or several shareholders form voting coalitions in favor of the resolution that is adopted (2) an equilibrium in which shareholders strategically abstain from voting and the resolution is rejected. The size of blockholders and their preferences (in favor or against the resolution) play a crucial role in the existence of equilibria, their nature, the size and the number of voters in coalitions. We derive conditions under which the dominant shareholder controls the meeting. We also examine how large shareholders influence the result of the vote. In particular, we analyze the interaction between blockholders and discuss the situations in which large shareholders jointly control annual meetings or form coalitions to counter the dominant shareholder.
