M11|Exchange Rate Shocks and Quality Adjustments|Do firms respond to cost shocks by reducing the quality of their products? Using microdata from a large Russian retailer that varies its offerings twice-yearly, we document that ruble devaluations are associated with a reduction in the observed material quality of products imported for resale, but that higher quality goods are also more profitable. We reconcile these facts using a simple multi-product sourcing model that features a demand system with expenditure switching, where more profitable products can be dropped more quickly after a cost shock. The estimated model shows that quality downgrading reduces average passthrough by 6% and has meaningful consequences for welfare.
M11|Building a Productive Workforce: The Role of Structured Management Practices|Firms' hiring and firing decisions affect the entire labor market. Managers often make these decisions, yet the effects of management on labor allocation remains largely unexplored. To study the relationship between a firm's management practices and how it recruits, retains and dismisses its employees, we link a survey of firm-level management practices to production and employee records from Brazil. We find that firms using structured management practices consistently hire and retain better workers, and fire more selectively. Good production workers match with firms using structured personnel management practices. By contrast, better managers match with firms using structured operations management practices.
M11|The ties that bind: implicit contracts and management practices in family-run firms|This paper investigates the impact of family CEOs on firm organizational choices and the causes and consequences of these decisions. We focus on second-generation (dynastic) family firms, collect new data on CEO successions for over 900 firms in Latin America and Europe and merge it with unique data on organizational choices, specifically, structured management practices. We use variation in the gender composition of the outgoing CEOs' children for identification. There is clear preference for male heirs: conditional on number of children, having at least one son is correlated with a 30pp higher likelihood of dynastic family succession. As the gender composition of the outgoing CEO's children is unlikely to affect decisions on mid-level managerial practices, we use it as an instrumental variable for family succession. Dynastic CEO successions lead to almost one standard deviation lower adoption of structured management practices, with an implied productivity decrease of about 10%. We rationalize this finding with a new conceptual framework that accounts for the importance of implicit employment commitments to employees of dynastic firms in determining the adoption of monitoring technologies. We find empirical evidence that, controlling for lower levels of knowledge and skills of family CEOs, concerns for reputation and ''family name'' can play a role in constraining investment in structured management practices. Overall, our empirical results shed new light on dynastic firms' persistent performance deficit and apparent lag in the adoption of structured management practices.

M11|What Drives Differences in Management Practices?|"Partnering with the US Census Bureau, we implement a new survey of ""structured"" management practices in two waves of 35,000 manufacturing plants in 2010 and 2015. We find an enormous dispersion of management practices across plants, with 40 percent of this variation across plants within the same firm. Management practices account for more than 20 percent of the variation in productivity, a similar, or greater, percentage as that accounted for by R&D, ICT, or human capital. We find evidence of two key drivers to improve management. The business environment, as measured by right-to-work laws, boosts incentive management practices. Learning spillovers, as measured by the arrival of large ""Million Dollar Plants"" in the country, increase the management scores of incumbents."
M11|The Effect of Productivity and Innovation on the Competitiveness of Batik SMEs in West Java Indonesia|Objective – This research aims to test the effect of productivity and innovation toward competitiveness of batik SMEs in West Java. Methodology/Technique – The study uses Partial Least Square (PLS) for data analysis, as well as an explanatory method and simple random sampling. Findings – The results of the data testing show that competitiveness is effected by productivity and innovation by 71.7%. Novelty – The objective of this study is to analyse the gap in productivity and innovation and its effect on the competitiveness of batik SMEs in West Java Indonesia. Batik centre in West Java was developed by the government in collaboration with the private sector to increase the level of production of batik SMEs. In reality, there is a gap in productivity between written batik and stamped batik. Written batik design innovations and production methods need to be improved to compete and survive in the batik industry. Porter (1995:5) describes competition as the core of the success or failure of firms. Productivity of written batik has declined in the past 5 years. From recent BPS data, processed by the Pusdatin Ministry of Industry 2017, the industry has declined by around 10% per year between 2012 and 2017. Type of Paper: Empirical
M11|A look at Airline Management as Event Management: About the challenging task of trying to run a profitable Airline|Warren Buffett once famously stated that airlines were infamous for destroying shareholder value . His hindsight proposition to better have taken the Wright brothers out of the sky violently surely was a pointed one, if not entirely serious. This paper seeks to shed some light on the challenges underlying the industry that Buffett blames as a value destroyer, and explain the difficulties most airlines have to tackle on a daily basis. The idea of aviation management as event management is the basis of this exploration of the airline industry, emphasizing the daunting task of offering an intangible product , created long before demand is certain, at a price that is lowest when the product itself is most difficult and costly and complex to produce. This underlying conundrum is one of the central challenges airlines need to confront when trying - hard at most times - not to actively destroy shareholder value.
M11|Managerial Quality and Productivity Dynamics|Which managerial skills, traits, and practices matter most for productivity? How does the observability of these features affect how appropriately they are priced into wages? Combining two years of daily, line-level production data from a large Indian garment firm with rich survey data on line managers, we find that several key dimensions of managerial quality, like attention, autonomy, and control, are important for learning-by-doing as well as for overall productivity, but are not commensurately rewarded in pay. Counterfactual simulations of our structural model show large gains from screening potential hires via psychometric measurement and training to improve managerial practices.
M11|Management and Shocks to Worker Productivity|The assignment of workers to tasks is an important feature of the organization of production within firms. We study how task allocation across workers changes in response to productivity shocks. Pairing hourly productivity data from a ready-made garments firm with granular data on exposure to particulate matter pollution, we show that productivity suffers as a result of pollution shocks; this effect is heterogeneous across workers and tasks. Managers respond by reassigning workers to tasks in which they perform better on average during shocks. This response is larger for managers who we identify, via survey-based measurement, as exhibiting greater managerial attention, and these same managers are also the ones who are most able to mitigate resulting productivity declines.
M11|A Bayesian approach for correcting bias of data envelopment analysis estimators|The validity of data envelopment analysis (DEA) efficiency estimators depends on the robustness of the production frontier to measurement errors, specification errors and the dimension of the input-output space. It has been proven that DEA estimators, within the interval (0, 1], are overestimated when finite samples are used while asymptotically this bias reduces to zero. The non-parametric literature dealing with bias correction of efficiencies solely refers to estimators that do not exceed one. We prove that efficiency estimators, both lower and higher than one, are biased. A Bayesian DEA method is developed to correct bias of efficiency estimators. This is a two-stage procedure of super-efficiency DEA followed by a Bayesian approach relying on consistent efficiency estimators. This method is applicable to ‘small’ and ‘medium’ samples. The new Bayesian DEA method is applied to two data sets of 50 and 100 E.U. banks. The mean square error, root mean square error and mean absolute error of the new method reduce as the sample size increases.
M11|Role of product promotion on consumers buying behaviors|The present research is focusing on the impact of product promotion on consumer’s buying behaviors. Brand image, persuasiveness and celebrity endorsement in the Promotion are the key factors, which raise the consumers’ intentions towards the product and buying behaviors. The buying behavior is strongly influenced by image of the product, which is built by the advertisers. The primary data of the study is collected through questionnaires and secondary data was collected through internet, journals and business magazines. A sample of 80 respondents was taken. The study explores that a creative and well-executed advertisement has always a great impact on the buying trends or purchasing behaviors of the consumers. At the same time quality of the product and price are also included with their strong impact on buying behavior of consumer. Likewise, to some extent the celebrity endorsement also matters in the buying behavior. Therefore, the study concludes that the positive impact of all these factors, on the buying behavior of the consumer proves the loyalty of consumer towards brand which helps in promotion of the advertised product and changes the buying behavior towards buying intentions.
M11|Cognitive reflection and economic order quantity inventory management: An experimental investigation|We use laboratory experiments to evaluate the effects of individuals' cognitive abilities on their behavior in a finite horizon Economic Order Quantity model. Participants' abilities to balance intuitive judgement with cognitive deliberations are measured by the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT). Participants then complete a sequence of five “annual” inventory management tasks with monthly ordering decisions. Our results show that participants with higher CRT scores on average earn greater profit and choose more effective inventory management policies. However these gaps are transitory as participants with lower CRT scores exhibit faster learning. We also find a significant gender effect on CRT scores. This suggests hiring practices incorporating CRT type of instruments can lead to an unjustified bias.
M11|Statistical Inference for Aggregation of Malmquist Productivity Indices|The Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) has gained popularity amongst studies on dynamic change of productivity of decision making units (DMUs). In practice, this index is frequently reported at aggregate levels (e.g., public and private rms) in the form of simple equally-weighted arithmetic or geometric means of individual MPIs. A number of studies have emphasized that it is necessary to account for the relative importance of individual DMUs in the aggregations of indices in general and of MPI in particular. While more suitable aggregations of MPIs have been introduced in the literature, their statistical properties have not been revealed yet, preventing applied researchers from making essential statistical inferences such as con dence intervals and hypothesis testing. In this paper, we will ll this gap by developing a full asymptotic theory for an appealing aggregation of MPIs. On the basis of this, some meaningful statistical inferences are proposed and their nite-sample performances are veri ed via extensive Monte Carlo experiments.
M11|Management Practises in Finnish Manufacturing Establishments: Evidence from FMOP|Abstract Data collected by the recently conducted Finnish Management and Organizational Practices Survey (FMOP) by Statistics Finland is used to examine the management practices in Finnish manufacturing establishments. The FMOP project was funded by the Strategic Research Council. This paper presents the descriptive statistics, some indicative international comparisons using poststratification weighted averages and a cross-regional comparison of the large areas of Finland. The management scores appear to be only slightly behind those of the US and approximately on par with those of Germany. This suggests that the management practices in Finnish manufacturing are on a comparatively high international level. We also find evidence of cross-regional differences in management quality in Finland with aggregate (employment weighted) but not unweighted management scores, which suggests that the differences in the allocation of employment between establishments may explain regional disparities in Finland. To analyse the statistical significance of the regional disparities in workforce allocation in greater depth, we utilize a moment-based estimation procedure that allows for statistical inferences using the Olley-Pakes decomposition. We find evidence of regional variations in the policy relevant allocation component.
M11|Lean management in the Hotel sector ? Opportunities and Threats|The lean concept has been identified with large companies, serial production, and the automotive industry. The approach is growing in popularity and the SME sector is increasingly using it. It is also gaining ground in the service sector. An ever-accelerating world does not always provide opportunities for understanding the principles of lean prior its introduction; consequently, the expected results rarely materialize. During my research in the service industry SME, the in-depth interviews, questionnaire queries, and on-site crawls (gemba walks) I have completed confirmed the existence of an illusory lean that originates from a misinterpretation of the principles. Lean is used as a tool and not as a philosophy. For this reason, it does not bring the expected results. Through hotel industry examples in my research, I present the development possibilities of the process and the potential dangers of misinterpreting lean use.
M11|A Portrait of U.S. Factoryless Goods Producers|This paper evaluates the U.S. Census Bureau’s most recent data collection efforts to classify business entities that engage in an extreme form of production fragmentation called “factoryless” goods production. “Factoryless” goods-producing entities outsource physical transformation activities while retaining ownership of the intellectual property and control of sales to customers. Responses to a special inquiry on the incidence of purchases of contract manufacturing services in combination with data on production inputs and outputs, intellectual property, and international trade is used to identify and document characteristics of “factoryless” firms in the U.S. economy.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
M11|Strategic delegation in procurement|In a firm organized into business units, we show when profitability increases if procurement is delegated to the division in charge of production. We highlight that our results are driven by the business unit having a different objective function than Headquarters. The profitability of procurement delegation is affected by the essentiality of production facilities to the activities of the firm, and by strategic distortions in both transfer and input prices. We also look at vertical separation of activities as an alternative to procurement delegation.
M11|Cognitive stress and learning Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) inventory management: An experimental investigation|We use laboratory experiments to evaluate the effects of cognitive stress on inventory management decisions in a finite horizon Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model. We manipulate two sources of cognitive stress. First, we vary participants' ability to order inventory from any decision period to only when inventory is depleted. This reduces cognitive stress by restricting the policy choice set. Second we vary participants' participation in a competing pin memorization. This increases cognitive load. Participants complete a sequence of five ``annual'' inventory management tasks, with monthly ordering decisions. Both sources of cognitive stress negatively impact earnings, with the bulk of these impacts occurring in the first year. Participants' choices in all treatments exhibit trends to near optimal policy adoption. But only in the most favorable treatment do the majority of choices reach the optimal policy. We estimate the learning dynamics of monthly order decisions using a Markov switching model. Estimates suggest increased cognitive load reduces the probability of switching to more profitable policies, and that more complex policy choice sets leads to a greater policy lock-in. Our results suggests that inexperienced individuals will perform more poorly when called upon to make inventory management situations in cognitively stressfully environments, and that the benefits of providing support and task simplicity is greatest when the task is first assigned.
M11|Decomposition analysis of corporate carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions in Japan: Integrating corporate environmental and financial performances|Recent empirical studies often support the positive relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) in terms of carbon dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and corporate financial performance (CFP). However, this depends on the measurements of CEP (the absolute and relative CEP) and CFP (accounting‐based and market‐based CFP). To understand the relationship structurally, based on the literature, this study proposes identity models that integrate CO2 and GHG emissions and financial factors. The models decompose CO2 (GHG) emissions into carbon intensity (GHG intensity), energy intensity, the cost‐to‐sales ratio, the total‐assets‐turnover ratio (TATR), leverage, and equity. The model of supply‐chain GHG emissions additionally adopts supply‐chain GHG intensity. As a decomposition method, this study uses the log‐mean Divisia index. As an application example of the CO2 model, this study targets Japanese manufacturing firms in 16 sectors from fiscal years (FY) 2011 to 2015. Results show that the change in CO2 emissions as of 2015 (−802.1 kilotonnes [kt]) is decomposed into 2922.5 kt for carbon intensity, −26036.3 kt for energy intensity, −6350.5 kt for the cost‐to‐sales ratio, −8495.6 kt for the TATR, −7912.3 kt for leverage, and 45070.1 kt for equity. Average values of relative contribution ratios are 20.6% for carbon intensity, 19.1% for energy intensity, and the remaining approximately 60% for financial factors. Among the 16 sectors, as of 2015, the change in total CO2 emission is statistically significantly positive for equity and significantly negative for the TATR and leverage.
M11|Corporate material flow management in Thailand: The way to material flow cost accounting|In recent years, material flow cost accounting (MFCA) has gradually been recognized in Asia by the standardization of ISO 14051 and 14052 and by the project of dissemination undertaken by the Asian Productivity Organization (APO). However, MFCA is still not used across the board. This study analyzes the characteristics of material flow (MF) management to facilitate the expanded use of MFCA. The research framework of this study investigates the degree of MF management and the sequential relationships among financial factors, MF management, and waste performance, based on a questionnaire survey of non-financial listed companies in Thailand. Fifty-eight percent of the respondent firms answer that they are managing MF information (self-rating). Meanwhile, 50%, 49%, 29%, and 24% of the firms actually disclose the amounts of total waste, hazardous waste, raw materials consumed, and recycled waste, respectively. The results of this study show that respondent firms with MF management (self-rating) are more likely to manage/disclose total waste, hazardous waste, and raw materials consumed than those without it. In terms of financial factors, cost ratio and profitability are likely to affect firm decisions regarding whether to manage the MF. Additionally, MF management is likely to decrease the hazardous waste ratio. The series of results shows that firms in Thailand are more likely to be concerned about hazardous waste management than resource efficiency. Therefore, hazardous waste should probably be thoroughly managed, as a preliminary step in the promotion of MFCA.
M11|Pengaruh Komunikasi Dan Kualitas Pelayanan Terhadap Kinerja Perawat Di Rumah Sakit Bhayangkara Palembang<BR>[The Effect of Communication and Service Quality on Nurse's Performance at Bhayangkara Hospital Palembang]|This study aims to determine and analyze the influence of communication and service quality on the performance of nurses at Bhayangkara Hospital Palembang. Sample of research is nurse of Bhayangkara Palembang Hospital counted 110 respondents by using purposive sampling method. The analysis of this research using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), which is operated through Lisrel Program. The results showed that Communication Variables and Service Quality have a positive and significant impact on the Performance of Nurse Hospital Bhayangkara Palembang. Communication Variables more dominant influence on the Performance of Nurse Hospital Bhayangkara Palembang in comparison of service quality variable.
M11|Does pre-play social interaction improve negotiation outcomes?|We study experimentally the impact of pre-play social interactions on negotiations. These interactions are often complex. Thus, we attempt to isolate the impact of several of its more common components: conversations, food, and beverages, which could be alcoholic or nonalcoholic. To do this, our subjects take part in a standardized negotiation (complex and simple) under six conditions: without interaction, interaction only, and interactions with water, wine, water and food and wine and food. We find that none of the treatments improve the outcomes over the treatment without interactions. We also study trust and reciprocity in the same context. For all-male groups, we find the same lack of superiority of interaction treatments over no interaction. For all-female groups, some very simple social interactions have a positive impact on trust.

M11|Strategic Demand Response to Dynamic Pricing: A Lab Experiment for the Electricity Market|Despite the efforts of restructuring power markets over the last decades, the lack of demand response in the retail electricity markets remains a significant concern. Possible demand response would help to reduce prices and volatility by better matching supply and demand through improved price signals. In this paper we develop a laboratory tool to experimentally investigate the demand response in the electricity market. The baseline treatment constitutes a two-period ‘wait-or-buy’ game with an exogenous first period, an automated supplier, and twenty subject buyers. While the seller offers a fixed number of a product in the market, consumers decide on purchasing the product immediately or waiting until the next period, taking (i) price uncertainty and (ii) inventory risk into account. This treatment captures demand response in the retail market with scarce products. We design an additional treatment by removing the inventory constraint and introducing a devaluation rule, where consumers only bear the price risk – thus mimicking the demand response in the electricity market. We find that in both retail and electricity market treatments consumers play on average the equilibrium predictions and buy strategically. However, there are systematic deviations from rationality in both settings, i.e., consumers buy too soon or wait too long.
M11|Research Trend Analysis for Supply Chain Management Using Topic Modeling|The aim of this study is to analyze the research trend for supply chain management(SCM). The supply chain management is a cross-disciplinary research field and challenges to research SCM are increasing due to the rapid development of information system.Topic modeling analyzes the words of the original texts to discover the topics and latent Dirichlet allocation(LDA) groups research papers in several relevant topics and finds the hidden topics in the literature. We collected research papers on the SCM from following scientific database: ACM Digital Library, EBSCO, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Springer Link, and Web of Science. Among them we analyze the abstract of the papers and identify the topic trends in the field of SCM. The major findings will be discussed in the Conference in details.

M11|Interpretive Structural Modeling Of Lean Principles To Retailing Businesses|Lean principles and its tools have been successfully applied to manufacturing and operations environments. The associated research literature and case studies have been published extensively. However, the same cannot be said for Lean principles to the retailing business. As such, the aim of this paper is to determine the indicators of the Lean principles toward retailing business in which the Lean principles should be focused. Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and Matriced? Impacts Croise?s Multiplication Appliquée a UN Classement (MIMAC) are used to develop the hierarchical structure of the relationships among Lean principles, and to analyses characteristics power of each Lean principles in applying to retailing businesses. The relationships and characteristics power of each Lean principles are used to determine indicators that are effective in improving retailing businesses. Results indicate that continuous improvement for customer value is an importance practices in enhancement of retailing businesses. This presents the understanding the Lean principles implementing in the retailing businesses. Further research is required to acquire more inputs from expert panel across range of the retail businesses.
M11|Lean Practices in some Divisions of the Hungarian SME Sector|A strong economy does not exist without an internationally competitive SME sector. But the resources of the SME sector and its management skills are often also limited. By developing this skills, the limited resources available can be utilized more efficiently, so the competitiveness of the companies could be improved.The lean approach as an attitude, common sense, does not require excessive resources, so they can be useful in the SME sector.This study analyses, how deeply the lean thinking are present in some division of the Hungarian SME sector, and make some comparisons between the divisions. A structured questionnaire was used for data collection. SMEs? representatives, mostly CEOs and managers from some divisions of the Hungarian manufacturing industry participated in the survey.Out of the results it shows that the level of the lean usage is low among the Hungarian SMEs, so there are development reserves in the usage of lean practices. Strengthening thinking in processes beyond the factory, employee involvement and related leadership development can lead to efficiency gains, but it is important to note that without external experts a wider improvement is not expected. This requires a change of leadership, and state incentives are needed to accelerate thisThe background of the research method was created to fit the available literature so that to be able to be used in other countries. With that, the available information basis can be expanded with a regional dimension, in case further studies are made.
M11|An empirical comparison study between DDMRP and MRP in Material Management|The objective of the following paper is to clearly outline the types of Manufacturing Planning and Control systems (MPC) that have characterized the last hundred years, but which are affected, in terms of functionality, the characteristics of the contexts and the decades in which they were designed. This led to the need to devise a new planning and control approach called Demand Driven Material Requirements Planning (DDMRP) that does not create a clear detachment from previous methodologies but takes the characteristics of each that is more suited to the current volatile and complex context. In this paper, the fundamental characteristics of the approach will be reviewed and the methodology that will be followed in the future implementation will be presented.
M11|The Effect of Compensation on the Performance of Police Hospital Employees in Bandung, Indonesia|Objective – The aim of this research is to test the correlation between the compensation variable to the performance of police hospital employees. The increasing trend of hospital patients in 2012 and 2013 indicates that competition among hospitals, particularly public hospitals, has increased. Therefore, as a hospital belonging to the classification of public hospitals, Bhayangkara Lv.(level) II Sartika Asih Bandung hospital should be able to improve its performance in order to compete with other public hospitals. Methodology/Technique – Overall achievement of performance objectives is still below target among hospitals, and the average performance on Bhayangkara Lv. II Sartika Asih Bandung hospital is no exception. This research uses descriptive research to examine 77 Bayangkara Lv.II Sartika Asih Bandung Police Hospital employees using proportional stratified random sampling. The analysis used in this research is a validity test, reliability test, simple linear regression analysis, coefficient determination, and T-test. Findings – The results of the determination coefficient test showed that compensation has an effect on employee performance (23.1% of Bhayangkara Lv. II Sartika Asih Bandung Hospital employees showed improved performance as a result of compensation). Novelty – The management of Bhayangkara Lv. II Sartika Asih Bandung Hospital should pay greater attention to the types of compensation provided to employees, to increase employee performance.
M11|New Productivity Concept Based on Local Wisdom: Lessons from Indonesia|Objective - This research aims to reveal the productivity culture existing in Rumah Makan Padang (RMP), located in Jakarta, with a view to generating a concept of productivity that is in line with RMP-based local wisdom. Methodology/Technique - An ethnographic method was employed to investigate the local perspective in the attempt to develop a new concept of productivity. Findings - The findings show that the concept of productivity existing in RMP differs from the contemporary concept of today's culture. Novelty - Whilst the conventional concept of productivity stresses on the material aspects which can be physically and financially measured with a productivity ratio of output toward input, the concept existing in RMP stresses not only on material aspects, but also spiritual aspects, to have lived in and been reflected from its uniqueness of work measurement, that is income per mato (IpM). The spiritual aspect in RMP includes a mutual belonging of the value of IDR 1, risk taking and profit sharing, proportional togetherness, spiritual leadership, hard work, bravery and willingness to sacrifice.
M11|Strategic Leadership Style and Commitment to Service Quality on Services Innovation in Local Enterprise Water Services|Objective - This study explores and examines the theoretical framework regarding the influence of strategic leadership styles that include transformational leadership style and transactional leadership styles as well as their influence on commitment to service quality and how leadership style influences service innovation in local enterprise water services. Methodology/Technique - The number of respondents in this study were 120 employees who were selected using a purposive sampling method and were represented by each section relating to the task of serving customers. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used to analyze the research data.Findings - The results show that transformational leadership style has an influence on commitment to services quality and service innovation. Novelty - Likewise, the transactional leadership style affects commitment to services quality, but it does not affect service innovation.
M11|Trust in Leadership and Affective Commitment as a Mediator between Servant Leadership Behavior and Extra-Role Behavior of Teachers|Objective - The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between trust in the leader and affective commitment as a mediator between servant leadership behavior and extra-role behavior. In addition, the study examines, whether person-organization fit has a moderating effect. Methodology/Technique - In total, 250 teachers of the border area responded to the research questionnaires, which were then analyzed using structural equation modeling with a partial least squares approach. Findings - The outputs of this study indicate an indirect influence between the principal servant leadership behaviors and extra-role behaviors among teachers, which was mediated by trust in the principal and the teacher's affective commitment to the principal. Furthermore, the results show a significant and direct relationship between servant leadership behaviors towards trust in the principal, affective commitment, and extra-role behaviors. Trust in the principal and teacher's affective commitment also had a significant and direct effect on extra-role behavior. However, the person-organization fit which moderates the effect of servant leadership behaviors on extra-role behaviors did not have a significant or direct effect on extra-role behaviors, in fact, it actually weakened the influence of servant leadership behaviors on extra-role behaviors. Novelty - The findings of this study suggest that trust in the principal and teacher's affective commitment has an important moderating effect which must be managed to strengthen the relationship between servant leadership behaviors and extra-role behaviors.
M11|All in the family? CEO choice and firm organization|Family firms are the most prevalent firm type in the world, particularly in emerging economies. Dynastic family firms tend to have lower productivity, though what explains their underperformance is still an open question. We collect new data on CEO successions for over 800 firms in Latin America and Europe to document their corporate governance choices and, crucially, provide causal evidence on the effect of dynastic CEO successions on the adoption of managerial best practices tied to improved productivity. Specifically, we establish two key results. First, there is a preference for male heirs: when the founding CEO steps down they are 30pp more likely to keep control within the family when they have a son. Second, instrumenting with the gender of the founder’s children, we estimate dynastic CEO successions lead to 0.8 standard deviations lower adoption of managerial best practices, suggesting an implied productivity decrease of 5 to 10%. To guide our discussion on mechanisms, we build a model with two types of CEOs (family and professional) who decide whether to invest in better management practices. Family CEOs cannot credibly commit to firing employees without incurring reputation costs. This induces lower worker effort and reduces the returns to investing in better management. We find empirical evidence that, controlling for lower skill levels of managers, reputational costs constrain investment in better management.
M11|Does pre-play social interaction improve negotiation outcomes?|We study experimentally the impact of pre-play social interactions on negotiations. These interactions are often complex.

For all-male groups, we find the same lack of superiority of interaction treatments over no interaction. For all-female groups, some very simple social interactions have a positive impact on trust.
M11|Learning from failure across products|Learning rates for the same or similar products differ significantly across firms. One reason for this heterogeneity may be that most firms are multiproduct firms and that they learn both within and across the products they produce and sell. Moreover, the organization of production and the technological design of (families of) products may affect the extent of learning across products. We study learning from failures within and across products in the US automotive industry, using safety recalls as a particularly costly form of product failure. We find that firms indeed learn from failure across products, but learning is faster if products use a common technological platform or are produced in a common plant. Severe product failures involving a supplier also lead to increased across-product learning. Our results shed light on the characteristics of firms' learning from failure across products and extend the existing literature, which typically studies learning at the firm or the product level and thus misses out on an important channel for learning in manufacturing contexts.
M11|Time Compression (Dis)Economies: An Empirical Analysis|To investigate time compression dis-economies (TCD), this study estimated time-cost elasticities using 459 oil and gas global investment projects (1997-2010). Results show that the average cost of accelerating investments is negative: a firm could cut $6.3 million in costs of a single project by accumulating asset stocks one month faster. About 88 percent of the projects exhibit negative time-cost elasticities with over 39 percent of unrealized economies of time compression. Only 12 percent of the projects are subject to TCD. These time inefficiencies or frictions do not negate the existence of TCD, but suggest they are less prevalent than assumed in the literature. Management experience, R&D investment, firm size, economic development and political stability are shown to be associated with greater time compression efficiency.
M11|Cover-Up of Vehicle Defects: The Role of Regulator Investigation Announcements|Automakers such as Toyota and GM were recently caught by the U.S. regulator for deliberately hiding product defects in an attempt to avoid massive recalls. Interestingly, regulators in the U.S. and U.K. employ different policies in informing consumers about potential defects: The U.S. regulator publicly announces all on-going investigations of potential defects to provide consumers with early information, whereas the U.K. regulator does not. To understand how these different announcement policies may affect cover-up decisions of automakers, we model the strategic interaction between a manufacturer and a regulator. We find that, under both countries' policies, the manufacturer has an incentive to cover up a potential defect when there is a high chance that the defect indeed exists and it may inflict only moderate harm. However, only under the U.S. policy does the manufacturer have an incentive to cover up a potential defect with significant harm, if there is only a moderate chance that the defect exists. We show that the U.S policy generates higher social welfare only for very serious issues for which both the expected harm and recall cost are very high and the defect is likely to exist. We make four policy recommendations that could help mitigate manufacturers' cover-ups, including a hybrid policy in which the regulator conducts a confidential investigation of a potential defect only when it may inflict significant harm.
M11|All in the Family? CEO Choice and Firm Organization|Family ﬁrms are the most prevalent ﬁrm type in the world, particularly in emerging economies. Dynastic family ﬁrms tend to have lower productivity, though what explains their underperformance is still an open question. We collect new data on CEO successions for over 800 ﬁrms in Latin America and Europe to document their corporate governance choices and, crucially, provide causal evidence on the eﬀect of dynastic CEO successions on the adoption of managerial best practices tied to improved productivity. Speciﬁcally, we establish two key results. First, there is a preference for male heirs: when the founding CEO steps down they are 30pp more likely to keep control within the family when they have a son. Second, instrumenting with the gender of the founder's children, we estimate dynastic CEO successions lead to 0.8 standard deviations lower adoption of managerial best practices, suggesting an implied productivity decrease of 5 to 10%. To guide our discussion on mechanisms, we build a model with two types of CEOs (family and professional) who decide whether to invest in better management practices. Family CEOs cannot credibly commit to ﬁring employees without incurring reputation costs. This induces lower worker eﬀort and reduces the returns to investing in better management. We ﬁnd empirical evidence that, controlling for lower skill levels of managers, reputational costs constrain investment in better management.
M11|Der Umgang kleiner und mittlerer Unternehmen mit den demografischen Herausforderungen: Eine Trendstudie|Das IfM Bonn untersucht anhand einer repräsentativen Trendstudie für den Zeitraum 2007 bis 2017, wie KMU dem demografischen Wandel begegnen. Demnach sind die KMU aktuell besser als 2007 über den demografischen Wandel informiert. Die Mehrheit der KMU hat ihre Absatzstrategie an die bereits alternde Bevölkerung angepasst und mehr Maßnahmen zum Erhalt der Arbeitsfähigkeit und zur Bindung von Arbeitskräften als 2007 ergriffen. Auf die erwartete Knappheit von Arbeitskräften reagieren sie mit einer Rekrutierung von Jüngeren sowie Frauen, Älteren und Zuwanderern. Unternehmen in strukturell schwachen Gebieten sind stärker vom demografischen Wandel betroffen. Die Wirtschaftspolitik sollte daher auch regionale Besonderheiten bei der Entwicklung von Unterstützungsangeboten beachten.
M11|Digitalization of Operations Management with Emotional and Intelligence Tools. Blockchain and IoT integration, the last disruption?|Digital advances and the emergence of disruptive technologies have dramatically changed the business models across sectors and operations economics. The scope of this paper is to contribute to analyze the current disruptive revolution in operations management in a digitalized global market focusing on the impact of blockchain technology and IoT integration. New intelligence tools and emotional analysis are contributing to add trust and promote digital expansion across different sectors. Given the high economic impact of the operations management on virtually all productive enterprises, the benefits of digitalizing operations have continuously increased productivity and enhanced international competitiveness. This paper studies the opportunities of what could be one of the last disruptions in operations management, the introduction of blockchain combined with IoT technology and emotional intelligence tools to automate, in a cryptographically verifiable process, activities in digital supply chain networks. Keywords: Blockchain, IoT, Supply Chain Network, Operations Management, Digital Policy Funding: The research leading to these results has received funding from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through SEMOLA project (TEC2015-68284-R) and from the Autonomous Region of Madrid through MOSI-AGIL-CM project (grant P2013/ICE-3019, cofunded by EU Structural Funds FSE and FEDER).
M11|Centralized versus decentralized inventory control in supply chains and the bullwhip effect|This paper constructs a model of a supply chain to examine how demand volatility is passed upstream through the chain. In particular, we seek to determine how likely it is that the chain experiences a bullwhip effect, where the variance of the upstream firm's production exceeds the variance of the downstream firm's sales. We show that the bullwhip effect is more likely to occur and is greater in size in supply chains in which inventory control is centralized rather than decentralized, that is, exercised by the downstream firm.
M11|Vendor selection and supply quotas determination by using the analytic hierarchy process and a new multi-objective programming method|In this article, we propose a new methodology for solving the vendor selection and the supply quotas determination problem. The proposed methodology combines the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for determining the coefficients of the objective functions and a new multiple objective programming method based on the cooperative game theory for vendor selection and supply quotas determination. The proposed methodology is tested on the problem of flour purchase by a company that manufactures bakery products. For vendor selection and supply quotas determination we use three complex criteria: (1) purchasing costs, (2) product quality, and (3) vendor reliability.

M11|The Internationalisation of Firms and Management Practices:A Survey of Firms in Viet Nam|This study examines the role of management practices in the internationalisation of domestic firms through directly exporting and/or supplying to local affiliates of multinationals. An original survey of manufacturing firms in Viet Nam was conducted, investigating their management practices such as human resource management and internationalisation status. The survey results shed light on similarities and dissimilarities among firms in several dimensions of management practices. Findings reveal that internationalised firms tended to be more enthusiastic about the formal training of production workers, the modernisation of production and operation, and product and process innovation. Differences in skills and experience requirements for newly employed managers were less recognizable, but internationalised firms tended to have managers who studied overseas. Furthermore, the use of public support to employee training, teamwork in production, and unionisation of employees did not show a significant difference between internationalised and non-internationalised firms.

M11|Retailers’ Responsibility towards Consumers and Key Drivers of Their Development in Poland|Multinational retailers are now very powerful and their activities could influence whole economies. In this paper, we investigate why they engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices towards consumers, how it fosters sustainable development, and what the role of institutions are in the process of developing CSR strategies. Changes that have taken place in Poland since 1989, when the transition process into a market economy started, constituted an excellent research field due to the fact that the retail market was not saturated at the beginning, consumers were only slightly protected by the law, and there were no institutions promoting the implementation of social responsibility standards by companies. Research involving analysis of secondary data drawn from retailers’ websites, CSR reports, and published data relating to the CSR institutions allowed the following: (1) identification of three stages of development in consumers’ conception of CSR characterized by the immoral, amoral, and moral management; (2) showing that these activities have a business case; and (3) explaining the role of institutions and competition in this process. It is also shown how multinational retailers could contribute to the sustainable development of less mature markets in which they invest.
M11|Strategy Implementation Style and Public Service Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Equity|Strategic decision-making theories suggest that organizations that combine rational and incremental strategy implementation styles are likely to perform better than those that emphasize a single style. To assess whether these arguments apply to the public sector; we explore the strategy implementation style and perceived service effectiveness, efficiency and equity of Turkish municipal government departments. Using fuzzy cluster analysis, we identify four distinctive though inter-related styles of strategy implementation in our sample organizations: logical-incremental; mostly rational; mostly incremental; and no clear approach. A logical-incremental and mostly rational style of implementation are associated with better effectiveness, efficiency and equity; with the absence of an implementation style associated with worse performance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
M11|The Functions of a Servant Leader|Servant leadership has been researched internationally and various types of favourable individual, team, and organisational outcomes have been linked to the construct. Different servant leadership measures have been validated to date and a clear distinction has been made between the theory of servant leadership and other leadership theories. However, it seems that research on the implementation of servant leadership within an organisation is still in need. The main functions of a servant leader are not yet conceptualised in the literature to help researchers or practitioners to implement servant leadership successfully within organisations. After conducting a systematic literature review, the main functions of a servant leader were identified. These functions were clustered into strategic servant leadership and operational servant leadership and supported by servant leadership characteristics and competencies as defined by current literature. The results of this study might help practitioners to develop servant leaders more effectively and assist organisations to cultivate a servant leadership culture within companies. Limitations and future research needs are discussed.
M11|Can Servant Leaders Fuel the Leadership Fire? The Relationship between Servant Leadership and Followers’ Leadership Avoidance|This study tested the effect of servant leadership on followers’ inclinations to strive for and, in contrast, to avoid leadership responsibility. Results from a study in the health care context, including two waves of data from 222 employees, revealed that servant leadership had a small but positive effect on followers’ leadership avoidance. This effect was influenced by followers’ implicit conception of an ideal leader. Specifically, servant leadership was found to reduce leadership avoidance when the congruence with the followers’ ideal leader prototype was high. Furthermore, followers’ core self-evaluations and affective motivation to lead mediated the relationship between servant leadership and reduced leadership avoidance. Implications of these patterns for theory and practice and avenues for future research are discussed.
M11|The Impact of Heavy Perceived Nurse Workloads on Patient and Nurse Outcomes|This study investigated the relationships between seven workload factors and patient and nurse outcomes. (1) Background: Health systems researchers are beginning to address nurses’ workload demands at different unit, job and task levels; and the types of administrative interventions needed for specific workload demands. (2) Methods: This was a cross-sectional correlational study of 472 acute care nurses from British Columbia, Canada. The workload factors included nurse reports of unit-level RN staffing levels and patient acuity and patient dependency; job-level nurse perceptions of heavy workloads, nursing tasks left undone and compromised standards; and task-level interruptions to work flow. Patient outcomes were nurse-reported frequencies of medication errors, patient falls and urinary tract infections; and nurse outcomes were emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction. (3) Results: Job-level perceptions of heavy workloads and task-level interruptions had significant direct effects on patient and nurse outcomes. Tasks left undone mediated the relationships between heavy workloads and nurse and patient outcomes; and between interruptions and nurse and patient outcomes. Compromised professional nursing standards mediated the relationships between heavy workloads and nurse outcomes; and between interruptions and nurse outcomes. (4) Conclusion: Administrators should work collaboratively with nurses to identify work environment strategies that ameliorate workload demands at different levels.
M11|Do managerial skills matter? An analysis of the impact of managerial features on performance for the Italian football|This paper studies the impact of a set of managerial features on performance in the top division of the Italian football league during seasons 2000/01-2009/10. Our set of coach characteristics includes indicators of skill, experience, innate features as well as empathy with the team. We find that some managerial features matter even when we control by club power and past results. Indeed, performance is positively correlated with the fact that the manager has experience abroad or has been a previous player of the team but negatively correlated with lack of previous managerial experience. Other features affect only some particular aspects of performance. In particular, Italian managers play a more defensive game in home matches while old managers are more defensive in away games. Also, changing a coach within the season has a negative impact on the defensive skill of the team in away matches.
M11|The new automobile modular platforms: from the product architecture to the manufacturing network approach|This paper analyses the key factors for the adoption of the new automobile modular platforms through an eclectic perspective linking the product architecture with the manufacturing network approach. An exploratory analysis of the European production networks of seven automobile manufacturers shows that the benefits of the modular platforms’ adoption depend on two factors: the degree of platform modularity and the manufacturing issues of each carmaker —product portfolio, production volumes and network size. The results indicate that the degree of modularity of the platform chosen should be aligned with the manufacturing issues; otherwise, benefits might not reach expectations

M11|Profit-oriented scheduling of resource-constrained projects with flexible capacity constraints|We consider a novel generalization of the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP). Unlike many established approaches for the RCPSP that aim to minimize the makespan of the project for given static capacity constraints, we consider the important real-life aspect that capacity constraints can often be systematically modified by temporarily assigning costly additional production resources or using overtime. We furthermore assume that the revenue of the project decreases as its makespan increases and try to find a schedule with a profit-maximizing makespan. Like the RCPSP, the problem is $NP$-hard, but unlike the RCPSP it turns out that an optimal schedule does not have to be among the set of so-called active schedules. Scheduling such a project is a formidable task, both from a practical and a theoretical perspective. We develop, describe, and evaluate alternative solution encodings and schedule decoding mechanisms to solve this problem within a genetic algorithm framework and we compare them to both optimal reference values and the results of a commercial local search solver called LocalSolver.
M11|Characterization Of The Of Red Fresh Tomato Value Chain In Mexico , Caracterizacion De La Cadena De Valor Del Tomate Rojo Fresco En Mexico|Agriculture is an important activity globally for its contribution to food production for human and livestock consumption. It is important to ensure quality at every stage of the process, from production to marketing, so that healthy products are provided and priced according to quality. Value Chain study becomes more important for its impact on the local economy. Therefore, it is important to study value chains considering the different participants in the chain links. The aim of this study was to perform the characterization of the Value Chain of fresh tomato in Mexico proposed by the National Council of Producers of Tomato NPO (Consejo Nacional de Productores de Tomate A.C.in Spanish). This was done through a documentary analysis that considers this product sector, as well as the identification and characterization of links involved in the production process and marketing. When the analysis of tomato Value Chains was completed, primary activities were identified, as well as support. In the link marketing a high dependence of intermediaries is required to get the product to the consumer

M11|New Generations and Employment – An Exploratory Study about Tensions Between the Psycho-social Characteristics of the Generation Z and Expectations and Actions of Organizational Structures Related with Employment (CABA, 2016)|"Generational studies have an important research tradition in social and human sciences.On the one hand, the speed of social change in the context of globalization imposes the need to research the transformations are identified both the subjectivity of the agents involved and its inclusion in the institutional matrix, specifically employment. Generation Z, (generally considered as the population group whose birth occurs after 1995) have unique psycho-social characteristics. Gen Z is characterized by a different set of values, beliefs, attitudes and ambitions that impact in their concrete action in organizational structures. On the other hand, managers often have to deal with generational differences in the workplace. Organizations have members who belong to different generations; they had never before faced the challenge of having such a diverse group of members. The members of each historical generation are characterized by a different set of values, beliefs, attitudes and ambitions that are manifest in their concrete action in organizational structures. Gen Z it’s the only one who can fully be considered ""global"", while its members were born in the consolidated context of globalization. Some salient features of the Generation Z can be summarized as follows. They’re the first fully born into a digital world. Social networks and technology are integrated into their lives. They are concerned about the challenges of the modern world (poverty, inequality, climate change, among others). They are self-expressive, more liberal and open to change. They often bore easily, with short attention spans. They do not like routine tasks. They want to achieve a good life-work balance and they are interested in a flexible work environment, as opposed to traditional work schedule. They are critical thinkers, who come with innovative and creative ideas to help. Research design considered methodological triangulation. Data was collected with two techniques: a self-administered survey with multiple choice questions and attitudinal scales applied over a non-probabilistic sample by reasoned decision. According to the multi-method strategy, also it was conducted in-depth interviews. Organizations constantly face new challenges. One of the biggest ones is to learn to manage a multi-generational scope of work. While Gen Z has not yet been fully incorporated (expected to do so in five years or so), many organizations have already begun to implement a series of changes in its recruitment and development. The main obstacle to retaining young talent is the gap between the expectations of iGen applicants and what companies offer. Members of the iGen expect not only a good salary and job stability, but also a clear career plan. Generation Z needs to have immediate feedback of their tasks. However, many organizations have yet to improve both motivation and monitoring practices. It is essential for companies to take a review of organizational practices anchored in the culture of the organization. Classification JEL: E24, J24, M11"
M11|Advanced Manufacturing: A New Policy Challenge|In 2016 the political system experienced significant disruption in part due to a working class voting block suffering from a long decline in American manufacturing, which became particularly acute in the decade of the 2000s. Manufacturing employment fell by one-third in this period, 64,000 factories closed, manufacturing capital investment and output suffered, and the productivity rate dropped. The U.S. had been systematically shifting production abroad, and experts began to realize as the next decade began that the decline in its production capability was starting to affect its innovation capacity — which had long been viewed as its core economic strength.
M11|Reverse Supply Chain Management – Theory and Practice|The traditional interest of researchers and practitioners in the field of supply chain management focuses on the movement of material flows from the initial producer to end customer in the chain. However, nowadays more and more products are returned to manufacturers or distributors. Hence, the concept of socalled reverse supply chains arises – these are chains that serve the flows of products and materials moving from the end customer to the initial producer. The article presents the essence and configuration of the reverse supply chains and examines the challenges facing their management. It discusses the role of the European and Bulgarian legislation and provides examples of the best practices in the management of reverse supply chains. The thesis is argued that the effective and efficient management of reverse supply chains provides a number of advantages and benefits for companies and stakeholders.
M11|Logistics Services, Technics and Software in Bulgaria from the Perspective of the Manufacturing and Trading Enterprises and Their Competitive Strategy|Logistics outsourcing is an increasingly common practice among manufacturing and trading enterprises. Being customers of the logistics sector, their perceptions of the supplied logistics technics, software services in Bulgaria, as well as the used logistics services by them, are important for the development of the logistics sector and logistics in our country. On the basis of empirical data this study evaluates the availability, quality and price of the supplied logistics services, technics and software from the point of view of the manufacturing and trading enterprises, the extent of usage of the different logistics services, as well as the existing differences between enterprises concerning their type, size and strategy. The competitive advantages that are achieved through the usage of some services are outlined too. The methods of descriptive statistics and statistical hypothesis testing are applied for data analysis. The existence of differences between the studied enterprises concerning their type and strategy is determined through t-test. The impact of the enterprisesï¿½ size on the used services is estimated trough the nonï¿½parametric equivalent of one-way analysis of variance - the Kruskalï¿½Wallis test, and the relationships between the different dimensions of competitiveness and the used logistics serï¿½vices ï¿½ through Spearmanï¿½s rank correlation coefficients. The study finds out that it is necessary to improve the ratio between quality and price of most services and the capabilities of logistics companies in relation to providing value-added services, management of distribution/procurement for their customers and total logistics packages. Evidences are brought fourth that enterprises using a variety of logistics services, besides the traditional transportation and ware housing, achieve a higher level of competitiveness concerning its different dimensions, especially those ones that have mainly a differentiating character.
M11|Impact of ISO 9001 Standard on the Quality Costs of Construction Projects in the Philippines|Since past two decades, ISO 9001 standard has shown its capabilities to lower cost, increase productivity, and satisfy stakeholders (customers) in the organizations. Although ISO 9001 standard has proven its benefits to different sectors in all over the world. But there is still debate among researchers and practitioners concerning the usefulness of applying ISO 9001 in construction projects. However, it seems that among different methods, quality cost analysis is an excellent technique to indicate how much ISO 9001 is able to improve effectively quality performance, and reduce costs in the projects. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to assess the effects of ISO 9001 implementation on quality cost in construction projects. For this aim, a literature review was conducted to design a structured questionnaire in a sample of the 67 respondents from ISO 9001:2008-certiﬁed projects of large-scale (AAA) construction companies in Metro Manila, Philippine. As a quantitative research, the inferential statistics analysis used to test the hypotheses of this study. Lastly, the results reported that ISO 9001 standard significantly affects the reduction of quality cost within construction projects in Metro Manila, Philippines.
M11|Effects of ISO 9001 on Non-Financial and Financial Performance in the Organizations: A Review|The main purpose of this paper was to specify the impact of ISO 9001 on financial and non-financial performance. For this aim, a comprehensive literature review was carried out on the scholarly published studies, which investigated empirically the effects of ISO 9001 standard on the organization's performance in different sectors. Subsequently, the ISO 9001 studies identified and selected carefully that were relevant to the objectives and criteria of the study with the aim of achieving the results and making conclusions. The analysis of the results of the empirical studies uncovered that ISO 9001 significantly affected production process (internal business process), while this standard was not correlated with the indicators of innovation and learning perspective at significant level. Furthermore, the systematic review of the existing literature provided enough evidence that the effectiveness of ISO 9001 on customer's results and financial performance were unclear and contradictory.
M11|Effectiveness and Challenges of Recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) in the Indian Hotel Sector|The present study tries of evaluate the effectiveness and challenges faced by adopting RPO practice in the India Hotel sector. The research objectives are driven from the purpose of the research which deals with distinct issues related to RPO and various perspectives of utilizing RPO. These objectives guided in identifying factors influencing the rationale for outsourcing the recruitment processes. The need for RPO has gained significance with the impact of organizational structure, stringent project deadlines, insufficient time for internal HR department for recruiting personnel, inefficiencies in integrating all stages of recruitment and expansion of geographies. The study is developed on building a theoretical framework which is prepared through analysing previous literature about outsourcing, and their utilization and efficiency in organizations. Mixed method approach has been followed to analyse with better validity and exploration of the context related to the effectiveness of RPO in the Indian hotel sector. The key findings indicated that the culture was positive influence on the usage of RPO in the organizations, in terms of adopting RPO during expansion of geographies and globalization. Also, the organizational structure was the major challenge in adopting these practices along with monitoring the outsourcing activities, lack of communication and inefficient HR practices.
M11|Principles and Contributions of Total Quality Mangement (TQM) Gurus on Business Quality Improvement|Over the past few decades, Total Quality Management (TQM) gurus have been developed certain theories in the area of business quality improvement, which caused a huge paradigm shift in improving the quality of products and services. The main aim of this paper was to discuss regarding the key roles of TQM gurus such as Deming, Crosby, Juran, Feigenbaum, Ishikawa, and others in improving business quality within different organizations in 20th Century. Thus, a systematic literature review was performed to specify the concept of TQM principles and philosophies from the aforementioned TQM gurus. However, the literature review was provided invaluable insight on the understanding of the main ideas and philosophies proposed by these TQM gurus.
M11|Quality Costing Technique: An Appropriate Financial Indicator for Reducing Costs and Improving Quality in the Organizations|Quality costing method is one of the total quality management (TQM) tools. This technique is also the most significant financial performance indicator, which can assist the companies to monitor and control their expenses related the quality of products and services during production process, in order to ensure that the firm is able to satisfy the requirements of the customers. Accordingly, the adoption of this method can cause that the companies save money and being more competitive in the market. However, the main purpose of this paper was to explore and discuss regarding the aspects of this TQM tool, and how it can detect unnecessary costs and maintain good quality for products and services with an aim to attain highest level of customer satisfaction in the organizations.
M11|Seven Basic Tools of Quality Control: An Appropriate Tools for Solving Quality Problems in the Organizations|Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa was first total quality management guru, who has been associated with the development and advocacy of using the seven quality control (QC) tools in the organizations for problem solving and process improvements. Seven old quality control tools are a set of the QC tools that can be used for improving the performance of the production processes, from the first step of producing a product or service to the last stage of production. So, the general purpose of this paper was to introduce these 7 QC tools. This study found that these tools have the significant roles to monitor, obtain, analyze data for detecting and solving the problems of production processes, in order to facilitate the achievement of performance excellence in the organizations.
M11|Activity Based Costing (ABC) as a tool for Lean Transformation: The Case of the Greek Power Public Corporation (PPC)|This research highlights the malfunctions and the inaccurate information of the conventional cost methods that are used nowadays in most Greek public companies. It poses as a research topic the resolution of the above mentioned problem with the development of a reliable and accurately informative cost system based on the ABC method, which will offer support to those companies concerning the amelioration of their total performance and function. This paper also shows the ability of the ABC costing method as a tool which contributes to the transition from a traditional public corporation to a lean corporation after the fulfillment of three fundamental points. First prevents distortions of the cost of activities of a company with the provision of exact measure of the cost of those activities then defines the non value added activities so it limits the wastefulness in a corporation and final introduces the mentality of lean thinking to the employees of the corporation, since each employee knows the flow of the action he performs, its cost and value. This paper includes a contrast on a theoretical basis of the traditional cost systems and the ABC method, presents an application of ABC and a case study of applying ABC to a Greek Public Company investigating its use as a lean tool that helps the saving of resources and the transition to a lean production model.
M11|Using ABC costing method with in a KPI- based framework to a Lean transformation of a Greek Public Company|This research paper deals with the investigation, whether from the results of the implementation of the ABC costing method to a public company, a suitable KPI framework can be created so that it functions as a useful tool which will contribute to the company‟s transition to a lean function. The subject of accurate measurement cost for the transition of a traditional Public Company to a lean Company has received little attention within management costing, since little empirical research has been performed on this subject. It seems that the reluctance to change an entrenched traditional costing system is fed by a lack of empirical evidence of the value the change may bring (Fullerton and Kennedy 2009). The aim of the study is thus to contribute to the overall knowledge on Lean thinking.
M11|Evaluating the Impact of Outsourcing Strategy on Procurement Performance of Selected Technical Universities in Ghana|Due to globalization, outsourcing has become one of the widely embraced strategies for delivering outstanding services in the educational sector. However, in spite of the increasing trend in outsourcing arrangements, there are inadequate literature underpinnings on how outsourcing activities affect the performance of educational institutions in Ghana. In order to bridge that gap, this research seeks to evaluate the effects of outsourcing strategy on procurement performance of some selected Technical Universities in Ghana. The main data collection instrument employed in this study is the structured questionnaire. The study employed the purposive and stratified sampling technique. The findings revealed that contracting, comprehensive outsourcing, licensing agreement and selective outsourcing strategies were main determinants of procurement performance of Technical Universities in Ghana. The study recommends that technical universities in Ghana should put more emphasis on training and information sharing in order to improve procurement performance. All procurement processes should be automated so as to reduce the error rates and discrepancies in the process and align the procurement procedures to the Public Procurement Act. This is because efficient procurement process could be used as a competitive advantage.
M11|Management as the sine qua non for M&A success|Measuring management practices robustly is difficult, which leaves an important element missing in identifying M&A success. This paper studies management practices as an unobserved (latent) variable using a standard microeconomic model. We show that our measure is the most important determinant of value creation in M&A deals: a one-standard-deviation increase in the measure almost doubles cumulative abnormal returns. Our results are robust to the inclusion of acquirer fixed effects, to a large set of control variables, and to several other sensitivity tests. We posit that any future study of M&A success should include a management component.
M11|An Empirical assessment of factors that influence the implementation of E-Procurement in Technical Universities in Ghana|The aim of this research was to assess factors that influences the implementation of e-procurement in Technical Universities in Ghana. This was as a result of the important role that e-procurement plays in ensuring an effective and efficient procurement system, though it has not been adequately incorporated in many businesses. The Study employed the Survey Method in the collection of data and questionnaires were the main data collection instrument. One hundred (100) respondents were purposively chosen from the selected Technical Universities. Kaiser-Meyer-Oklin and Barlett's test was used to test if the data obtained was suitable for factor analysis. The factor analysis results gave a four (4)-factor structure which explained 81.208% of the total variance. These factors and the rate at which they explained the total variance are as follows: ICT infrastructure (36.073%), public procurement regulations (20.141%), management commitment (16.156%) and staff competence (8.838%). The Study found out that the ICT infrastructure in the Technical Universities was not adequate. The Study made a recommendation that Technical Universities in Ghana should invest in their ICT infrastructure in order to derive the full benefits of e-procurements.

Backshoring of manufacturing activities and the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies|We investigate the relationship between backshoring of production activities and investments in digital manufacturing technologies, also known as Industry 4.0. We argue that Industry 4.0 supports backshoring of manufacturing activities: First, because productivity increases by I4.0 technologies can neutralize cost advantages of offshoring locations and make labour arbitrage less appealing. Second, because increased flexibility provided by I4.0 technologies offers an incentive for firms to locate production close to their European customers. The empirical test is based on a large dataset of more than 2,000 manufacturing firms. Backshoring is still a rare event with a share of no more than 4% of all firms. Descriptive statistics as well as regression results indicate a positive correlation between the adoption of I4.0 technologies and companies’ backshoring propensity.
M11|Revisiting Forecasting of Recessions via Dynamic Probit for Time Series by Kauppi and Saikkonen (2008)|In this work we first replicate the results of fully parametric dynamic probit model for forecasting US recessions from Kauppi and Saikkonen (2008) (which is in the spirit of Estrella and Mishkin (1995, 1998) and Dueker (1997)) and then contrast them to results from non-parametric local-likelihood dynamic probit model for the same data.
M11|Convexity, Disposability and Returns to Scale in Production Analysis|Adequate modelling of undesirable outputs is a key aspect for any performance analysis of economic systems. A nonparametric approach assuming jointly weak disposability of desirable and undesirable outputs inspired by Shephard (1974) has gained substantial popularity in addressing this issue. Recently, researchers were offered an alternative that is to use multiple scaling factors (rather than a single one as in the Shephardâ€™s (1974) approach) when imposing weak disposability in practice. In this paper we discover new properties and relationships between the two approaches, which in turn sheds some new light on the problem and offers reconciling solutions.
M11|Value Creation: Marketing-Operations View Point Of The Supply Chain|As the global boundaries shrink and vanish day by day, the logistics and supply chain nightmares of the multinational players go up day by day. This paper looks into the core aspects of marketing function along with the operations of the supply chain for the purpose of value creation in the eyes of customer. Value creation is the process of providing and delivering goods and services to the customers for which they are ready to pay for and also takes the product or service more towards its logical conclusion, in other words, it adds something to the product or service. The paper introduces the basic concepts of value creation from customers? perspective, it then goes on to relate the vital role the marketing-operations plays in various performance metrics of any supply chain network. These performance metrics are then detailed out from a qualitative and quantitative perspective. In the end, the paper does touch upon the areas of overlap and major concern for any organization with footprint across a big geographical region.
M11|Corporate Governance: Banking Sector and Economic Development|Corporate governance is concerned as the most important topic to be discussed by financial entities and economic institutions in developed and transition economic countries during the last decade especially several financial crisis took places around the world especially, the ninetieth was full of crises and scandals that highlighted the low quality of monitoring and related weak accounting system beside the poor experience and transparency. These crises and scandals made many shareholders and citizens to lose their wealth and due to that shareholders and citizens look for corporations applying corporate governance. Besides that, developed economic countries employ governance mechanisms aggressively in order to increase the investment possibilities in their corporations and territories. Overall, corporate governance has its role in economic reformation and economic development.
M11|Prerequisites of efficient decentralized waste heat recovery and energy storage in production planning|Abstract Following the scarcity of resources, rising energy prices, and an increasing awareness of the role manufacturing plays in the generation of greenhouse gas emissions, the usage of energy has more and more been considered in research on production planning and scheduling in recent years. Time-varying energy prices, which have been introduced to penalize energy usage during peak-demand periods and which are supposed to smooth energy demand, have added a new aspect to this stream of research. This article studies how the integration of a waste heat recovery system, which can convert industrial waste heat into electrical energy, along with an electrical energy storage system can balance the positive and negative effects of energy peak prices on the production plan in a serial multi-stage production system. After developing an appropriate model, we investigate how the use of the waste heat recovery system and the electrical energy storage system impact production planning. In a numerical analysis, we investigate under which conditions the recovery of waste heat combined with the opportunity to store energy provides practitioners with an efficient tool to lower total energy usage and to better react to time-varying energy prices, and thus to reduce total energy cost.
M11|Additive manufacturing technology adoption: an empirical analysis of general and supply chain-related determinants|Abstract Despite experiencing immense growth in the past decade, additive manufacturing (AM) technologies—colloquially known as 3D-printing—are still rarely used in industrial fabrication. Being at the interface between technology, innovation, behavioral science and operations management research, this paper identifies multifaceted factors that determine the decision to adopt AM technologies for the production of industrial parts. A review of the relevant literature revealed eight potential factors. These can be classified into four interdisciplinary categories: technology-related factors, firm-related-factors, market structure-related factors, and supply chain-related factors. Special focus is placed on the impact of supply chain-related issues, because there are indicatives that these aspects have an influence on the decision to adopt AM technologies since AM may offer distinct opportunities for both, the supply- and demand-side of a firm’s operations. No work in the field of manufacturing technology adoption has examined the role of such inter-organizational factors before. The results of an empirical study among 195 firms indicate that demand-side benefits and compatibility are the main determinants of AM technology adoption. This suggests that not only intra- but also inter-organizational factors should be considered when investigating the adoption of technological innovations. Furthermore, it is carved out that the adoption of AM technologies has an interdisciplinary nature.
M11|Optimal Management of Supply Disruptions when Contracting with Unreliable, Risk-averse, Suppliers|This paper investigates the optimal management of supply disruptions by a manufacturer who uses order inflation and/or investments in process reliability when contracting two risk-averse suppliers. We consider that these investments can be subject to moral hazard. Technically we solve a newsvendor optimization problem using a random capacity model of disruption. In such a model, the order size does not affect the average production but impacts the probability of disruption. When investments are verifiable we show that the manufacturer is more inclined to invest in the suppliers’ reliability and then refrain from using order inflation when the suppliers’ production costs and the cost of disposing of unwanted inputs are large. When investments are not verifiable we show that the order sizes can be used strategically as incentive devises due to the suppliers’ sensitivity to payoff dispersion. We show that the manufacturer does not always increase his reliance on order inflation and face less reliable suppliers once we introduce moral hazard. In some instances he induces suppliers to undertake larger investments in reliability by increasing the order size. In other instances he is able to reduce his reliance on order inflation.
M11|Should the most efficient firm invest in its capacity? A value capture approach|Recently, cooperative game theory and the stand-alone core have been introduced to value capture theory to establish lower and upper bounds on the profits of firms. Where within these bounds firms end up depends on many unobservable factors, including individual bargaining abilities and market-specific practices. Gans and Ryall (2017), in their survey of the recent papers using this theory, provide an example of a matching market in which the firm with the cost advantage might actually be worse off when it decides to expand its capacity to take over the full market. We show that this paradox is extremely persistent and can resist to most extensions of the model, including the presence of additional buyers that were not served originally and economies of scale for the expanding firm. By expanding, the firm now has to attract more consumers, which considerably limits its bargaining power.
M11|MBNQA Approach in Quality Management Supporting Sustainable Business Performance in Agribusiness|Despite attention being paid to quality management in the literature, little empirical research has been conducted on developing the link between adoption of quality management approach and business performance in agricultural enterprises, and moreover, only a few empirical studies have investigated this issue in Central and Eastern Europe. The conducted empirical survey examines the relationship between adopting the quality management approach and business performance from the perspective of agricultural enterprises in Slovakia. The empirical findings are based on 70 responses from agribusinesses in Slovak Republic. To measure the adopting of quality management approach the MBNQA model was used. The authors have used linear regression as an evaluation method. Based on the results it can be concluded the adopting of quality management approach is determined by ownership. The enterprises owned by the owner from abroad adopt the quality management approach more readily than the domestic ones. The size of the enterprise and type of production do not determine the adopting of quality management approach in the agricultural enterprises in the Slovak Republic. This study contributes to the European research that studies the relation between quality management and business performance of agribusinesses by means of an empirical investigation in agricultural organizations in a transition economy such as Slovakia.
M11|Measuring Quality in Automobile Aftersales: AutoSERVQUAL Scale|It is becoming more important to accurately measure the level of quality in services and especially automobile related services such as after sales service. This study aims to generate a survey to measure the service quality in automobile aftersales services, eventually to be called AutoSERVQUAL. The roadmap for this survey generation process starts by examining the service quality measurement scales in literature first and then continues by the adaptation process of SERVQUAL over automobile aftersales customers. Each and every step in survey generation processes is explained starting from expert interviews and finally statistical analyses. Starting with 45 candidate questions, the study offers a 28 item scale that can measure service quality in after sales car services with high reliability. The scale can be extended to cover aftersales services in general for any type of product and also could be used as input to other models such as QFD and MADM. The scale should also be empirically tested in other countries with specific requirements for after sales services.
M11|Correlations within the EFQM Business Excellence Model by Applying a Factor Analysis|Specialists in the field of business administration have tried over time to identify those elements or combination of elements which lead to a higher performance and excellence of companies. One of these models was created and it is applied by the European Foundation of Quality Management. This model defines nine elements, divided into enablers and results. Although this model is widely used in the evaluation of businesses, empirically there are still concerns regarding the characterization and correlations between the elements of the model and the connection with the performance of a company. This article aims to determine the correlations between the elements of the EFQM model based on the results of a research conducted in a clothing company in Romania. For this, the factor analysis was applied in order to determine both the correlations between the elements of the model and in order to group them in several strategic directions. Based on the results, there were determined three strategic directions. Out of these directions, one was oriented towards the external environment of the company, one was oriented towards the internal environment and the third one towards the brain of the company, who has the vision and the strategic thinking.
M11|Best Practices for Integrating the Romanian Small Farmers into the Agri-Food Chain|In the modern market economy, agri-food chains were imposed and strengthened due to unprecedented evolving recorded by supply and demand of food in recent decades, dynamic driven by market fragmentation, on the one hand, and specific processes of consumption and consumer emancipation, on the other hand. The objective of the paper aims to bring to the fore the best practices for support the Romanian small farmers to facilitate their access to the market, which is often dominated by large distribution networks. Reality has shown that financial support is not enough, even if farmers use modern and efficient technological systems, and that it is a need for an efficient integration of small producers in the agri-food sector. To highlight the best practices that can be used by Romanian small farmers were used information derived from: literature study on problems regarding the food sector; analysis of studies conducted by the consulting companies specialised in this field; analysing the consequences of recent legislation concerning the marketing of food products, namely its implementation in our country, especially in terms of small agricultural producers and their access to the Romanian market.
M11|The Three-Dimensional Approach of Total Quality Management, an Essential Strategic Option for Business Excellence|In a complex and dynamic business environment, managers widely appeal to modern methods and techniques that would help them cope with the competition and offer their customers new, attractive, good quality products and services and at competitive prices. In this context, total quality management is a viable and sustainable option that can systematically contribute to the consolidation of the capacity of organizations. The aim of this paper was to put forth a three-dimensional approach of total quality management and provide some concrete action ways through which organizations in Romania that implement total or partial quality management integrated systems would produce significant competitive advantages. The main research methods used were: the questionnaire, document analysis, applications offered by Word and Excel and the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, one of the most complete software packages with which we calculated means and standard deviations and determined and analysed correlations between variables and various quality parameters. In this research, have been identified the main key success factors, the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the systems, their causes and the necessary changes through which the three-dimensional approach of total quality management could become a preferred strategic option with a major positive impact upon business excellence. The most important results obtained are a three-dimensional approach of the Total Quality Management and a substantial number of certain proposals for the Romanian firms in order to achieve business excellence.
M11|Optimization of Inventory Management Logistic Model of the Machine-Building Enterprises|"The aim of this study is to develop the inventory management model based on Economic Order Quantity model using asymptotic perturbation methods. The simple asymptotic formulas for the ""perturbed"" order quantity has been obtained when cost per order, storage cost and product demand change slightly. As the results show, the total costs, which correspond to ""perturbed"" order quantities, are less than ones at economic order quantity. Decrease of logistics costs can improve the market competitiveness of the machine-building enterprises' products. Modeling the nature of cost increase and demand fluctuation using asymptotic formulas the machine-building enterprises will be able to make prompt adjustments to optimize logistics processes."
M11|Governance Impacts On Banking Performance|The importance of corporate governance and the essential role of banks as important financial institutions in a free capital market attract more attention of researchers and academicians to identify the relationship among corporate governance and banking performance. In the light of that, the paper seeks to specify the variables of corporate governance and banking financial performance through measuring the governance impacts variables on banking performance through an empirical study on banks during 2005-2014 in the Middle East. A strong relationship between these variables and banking financial performance is determined where is a positive relationship among the return on assets and the board of directors and on another hand a negative relationship is found between the banking performance and owner concentrations.
M11|Is Distance Dead? Face-to-Face Communication and Productivity in Teams|Has technology made face-to-face communication redundant? We investigate using a natural experiment in an organisation where a worker must communicate complex electronic information to a colleague. Productivity is higher when the teammates are (exogenously) in the same room and, inside the room, when their desks are closer together. We establish face-to-face communication as the main mechanism, and rule out alternative channels such as higher effort by co-located workers. The effect is stronger for urgent and complex tasks, for homogeneous workers, and for high pressure conditions. We highlight the opportunity costs of face-to-face communication and their dependence on organisational slack.
M11|Managers and Productivity Differences|We document that for a group of high-income countries the life-cycle earnings growth of managers relative to non managers is positively correlated with output per worker. We interpret this evidence through the lens of an equilibrium life-cycle, span-of-control model where managers invest in their skills. We use the model to quantify the importance of exogenous productivity differences and the size-dependent distortions emphasized in the misallocation literature. Our findings indicate that such distortions are critical to generate the observed differences in the growth of relative managerial earnings across countries. Distortions that halve the growth of relative managerial earnings, a move from the U.S. to Italy in our data, lead to a reduction in managerial quality of 27% and to a reduction in output of about nearly 7% --more than half of the observed gap between the U.S. and Italy. Cross-country variation in distortions accounts for about 42% of the cross-country variation in output per worker gap with the U.S. (Copyright: Elsevier)

M11|Breakthrough Effect of Combining Resource Management Models|Nowadays Russia is trying to overcome the difficult times, which are characterized by a complicated international situation, high level of turbulence in social and economic sphere and general uncertainty. In the conditions of extremely fierce competition, companies prefer to use a combination of business models with the aim to take the best from several concepts of management. The goal of this research is to analyze one of the model of modern resource management - “velocity” and to relate it to the current state of the Russian economy. Theoretical and practical aspects of the model are presented. Implementation of the “velocity” in the United Engine Corporation - Gas Turbines, Joint-stock Company is highlighted. This is one of the few examples of using above-mentioned concept in Russia. Summarizing, “velocity” can become a promising strategy in the context of the Russian economic situation and in general in the contemporary conditions of the world economic development.
M11|A note on “A multi-period profit maximizing model for retail supply chain management”|In this note we present an efficient exact algorithm to solve the joint pricing and inventory problem for which Bhattacharjee and Ramesh (2000) proposed two heuristics. The algorithm is based on a method proposed by Thomas (1970) and we show additional properties which can be used to arrive at an even more efficient algorithm. Furthermore, we point out several shortcomings in the paper by Bhattacharjee and Ramesh.
M11|Rational Inattention and Organizational Focus|This paper studies optimal communication flows in organizations. A production process can be coordinated ex ante, by letting agents stick to a prespecified plan of action. Alternatively, agents may adapt to task-specific shocks, in which case tasks must be coordinated ex post, using communication. When attention is scarce, an optimal organization coordinates only a few tasks ex post. Those tasks are higher performing, more adaptive to the environment, and influential. Hence, scarce attention requires setting priorities, not just local optimization. Our results provide microfoundations for a central idea in the management literature that firms should focus on a limited set of core competencies.
M11|Innovative Food Quality Models – Developed as an Interface for Modern Consumers and Sustainable Business|The intensive development of global markets correlated with the modern consumer’s demands led to a new complex approach concerning the food sector and its’ main determinants. Old market theories that describe the food market mechanisms as a simple three point process: “to produce – to sell – to buy” are now growing into elaborated models based on more determinants that have one common challenge: quality. Thus, the present study aims to highlight the importance of producers’ accountability in ensuring the quality of food products, by implementing standardize methods of production and by informing the consumers in a correctly and completely manner. In other words, the research focuses on quality management systems as defining instruments that can assure high-quality food products are being delivered at competitive prices to domestic and international markets. In this sense, food quality management principles are analyzed from the point of view of one of the biggest actors in the food industry, Mondelez International. Having as a starting point the interview results with the Procurement Innovation Manager in Quality, this paper manages to outline a consumer preference based model in developing new food products. The present conceptual model takes into consideration both quality specialist and consumer’s demands, in order to maintain the requirements of food management and safety systems and, simultaneously, to be flexible and optimize new food products according to modern consumer’s quality requirements: design.
M11|A Hazai Kézműves Bonbongyártás Technológiája És Költség Viszonya| Az élelmiszeripar egyik meghatározó szegmense az édességipar, legkedveltebb termékei közé tartozik a csokoládé, mely a világon szinte bárhol fellelhető, s a mindennapok elengedhetetlen részét képezi. Napjainkban a fogyasztói trendek folyamatosan változnak, az utóbbi pár évben megfigyelhető, hogy egyre nagyobb szerepet kapnak a kézműves alapanyagokból készült, magasabb minőségű, adalékanyagoktól, tartósítószertől és növényi zsiradéktól mentes, egészségesebb termékek, így a kézműves csokoládé. Fő célkitűzésem a kézműves csokoládéágazaton belül a bonbon előállítás jövedelemtermelő képességének a meghatározása. Vizsgálataim során egyaránt végeztem primer és szekunder adat- és információgyűjtést. A primer adatgyűjtés lefolytatása során ellátogattam 4 különböző hazai bonbonkészítő műhelybe, ahol a termelésre vonatkozó főbb adatokat (pl. technológia jellemzői, fajlagos ráfordítások, termelési költségek, hozamok) gyűjtöttem be. Kutatási eredményeim alapján megállapítható, hogy a kézműves bonbongyártás relatíve költségigényes tevékenység, melynek oka a jelentős alapanyag- és a magas hozzáadott értéket képviselő kézi munka ráfordítás mértéke. -------------------------------------------- One of the main segments of food industry is sweet industry, we could say it’s favourite product is chocolate, which can be found all across the world. It belongs to our daily life. Nowadays the consumer trends are changing continuously. In recent years it is seen that there is an increasing role of handmade ingredients, higher quality, as well as it is free of preservatives, additives, and plant based oils, therefore healthier products getting more attention like craftsman chocolate. The main objective of the articla is to identify the technology and costs of handmade chocolate bonbons. During my studies I’ve done primer and seconder data and information collecting based on national and international bibliography. During the primer data collection I have visited 4 different national bonbon manufactures, where I gathered the most important information about the production, such as main characteristics of technology, cost of production, yield, and inputs. Based on my research results, it can be stated that the manufacturing of handmade bonbons it’s an expensive business, and the reason of this is the high cost price of ingredients, and the high added value of manual work.
M11|A Vágócsirke Hizlalás Naturális Hatékonyságának Gazdasági Szerepe Egy Magyarországi Korszerű Telep Adatai Alapján| A tanulmány célja egy korszerű, modern technológiával rendelkező magyarországi vágócsirke hizlaló telep naturális hatékonysági mutatóinak és azok ökonómiai mutatókra gyakorolt hatásának vizsgálata, illetve azok hazai és nemzetközi viszonylatban való megítélése. A primer adatgyűjtés keretében a vizsgált telep 13 rotációjára (2012. augusztus és 2014. július közötti időszak) vonatkozó naturális és fajlagos ökonómiai adatait gyűjtöttük be. Vizsgáltuk az ágazatra jellemző naturális hatékonysági mutatók (pl.: elhullás, fajlagos takarmányfelhasználás, átlagsúly, brojler index) alakulását. Az adatok leíró statisztikai módszerekkel történő feldolgozását követően ökonómiai modellkalkulációt készítettünk. A gazdasági környezet változatlansága mellett (az input-, output árakat, valamint a fajlagos költségtételeket állandónak tekintettük) az egyes turnusok naturális hatékonysági mutatói voltak a változók. A tanulmány rávilágít arra, hogy a naturális hatékonyság milyen mértékben befolyásolja az ökonómiai mutatók alakulását. Továbbá megállapítható, hogy a vizsgált, korszerű technológiai háttérrel és szakmai tudással jellemezhető telep termelési mutatói és azon keresztül realizálható ökonómiai hatékonysága magasan a magyar átlag felett van. Ugyanakkor a nemzetközi összehasonlításban jelentős lemaradás mutatható ki. -------------------------------------------- The objective of this study is to examine the physical efficiency indicators of a Hungarian broiler farm with high quality technology, as well as their effects on economic indicators. Furthermore, it is to compare these figures at national and international levels. In primary data collection we collected physical and specific economic records of the investigated farm relating to 13 rotations (period between August of 2012 and July of 2014). We analysed the development of sector-specific physical efficiency (e.g. mortality, feed conversion ratio, bodyweight at slaughter, European Production Efficiency Factor). Economic model calculations were made after processing data applying descriptive statistical techniques. Physical efficiency indicators of each rotation were variable besides unchanged economic environment (input-, output prices and specific costs were considered as constant). The study highlights the extent to which physical efficiency can influence the economic indicators. Furthermore, results show that production indicators and economic efficiency of the examined farm with high quality technology and professional knowledge are significantly better than the Hungarian average figures. However, there is a substantial lag in international comparison.

It discusses how the process of completing the pitching template has enabled me to better organise and articulate my research plan. This letter provides support for the use of the pitching template to evaluate and assess research which is beyond the initial stages of development. This letter describes how the pitching process systematically enables a researcher to not only conceptualize a research plan, but also enables a researcher to critically evaluate and assess an already established research plan for greater clarity.
M11|Accounting truth and its assurance in entities from the Republic of Moldova|The multiple users will not be able to make correct decisions, unless the information provided by accounting is exact and transparent. Otherwise we cannot state that it communicates the accounting truth with regard to the activity of a company. The accounting truth is determined by several factors, like the accounting technique, the principles and the qualitative characteristics, the accounting normalization and the audit. The objective of the study is to provide a general analysis of these factors, as well as to investigate the manner in which these support the assurance of the accounting truth in the Republic of Moldova (RM) in the context of the IFRS concept of true and fair view, also relying on practical examples from the banking system. The results of the study show that the accounting truth in RM entities is ensured to a large extent, due to the positive impact of these factors. At the same time, there is still room for improvement in theoretical matters of accounting and financial reporting, as well as for the development of the accounting legal framework, with the purpose of expanding the financial analysis potential of the disclosed information. The situation of the banking system shows that, if no adequate attention is paid to the operative and strategic analysis of the financial position and results, including based on audit, economically destructive phenomena can take place, both at entity-level, and at country-level.
M11|Performance management through budgets. Drafting and launching the company’s sales budget|In the economic activities enterprises set goals which, if achieved, enable performance improvement. In this regard, it becomes necessary to develop forecasts mentioned in budgets, which are used as tools for enterprise performance management. Creating an effective budget system, closely related to the medium and long-term plans of the company, is the key to profitable economic activity, which allows to find the right path to achieving the proposed objective and to promptly detect any obstacles. The budget is thus a strategy to improve performance by achieving better productivity, more efficient money spending, and to motivate employees to fulfil the budgetary provisions. In the process of budgeting, the starting point is the sales budget, based on the sales program to which the company aims. Within it, the quantity, the selling price and the projected turnover are broken down into different time periods. Preparing a budget of marketing expenditures constitutes a logical consequence of the commercial activity as defined in the sales budget, thus allowing the establishment of the costs for the sale of the company’s products and the commercial margin.
M11|Procurement and Operations Management in the Logistics Systems of Manufacturing Companies in Bulgaria|The management of inbound and internal material flows has an effect on the performance of manufacturing companies‘ logistics systems and consequently on customer satisfaction and competitiveness. The study reveals the characteristics and weaknesses of procurement and operations management in manufacturing companies in Bulgaria and outlines the prospects for their improvement. An analysis is carried out of different dimensions of these areas using indicators calculated on the basis of empirical data. The impact of company size on procurement and operations practices is examined and those practices that are positively related to competitiveness are brought out. The study finds out that manufacturing companies in Bulgaria generally follow the world trends in the management of inbound and internal material flows but there are some problem areas that need to be improved. More competitive are those companies that reflect the real demand in procurement and operations strategies and policies and realize the strategic role of suppliers. Small companies, and to a lesser extent middle ones, lag behind in the application of contemporary strategies, policies and methods in the areas of procurement and operations. It is necessary for them to make improvements, for which they need a high degree of knowledge about the existing and applied by leading companies methods and achievements in the area of logistics, and to increase the competence of employees in procurement and operations.
M11|Evaluation of distribution and customer service in the logistics systems of manufacturing companies in Bulgaria|The article reveals the characteristics and problems of distribution and customer service in manufacturing companies in Bulgaria and outlines the prospects for their improvement. An analysis is carried out of different dimensions of these areas using indicators calculated on the basis of empirical data. The impact of company size on distribution and customer service is examined and those practices that are positively related to competitiveness are brought out. The study finds out that manufacturing companies in Bulgaria generally apply the world practices in distribution and customer service but there is some lag in definite areas. It is necessary for small and medium companies to make improvements directed towards the development of a logistics strategy consistent with products and markets, the formulation and implementation of a distribution policy offering differentiated service for different groups of customers with the aim to optimize costs.

M11|The Financial Impact of a Withdrawn ISO 9001 Certificate|Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to assess to what extent the loss of the ISO 9001 certification affects the decertified firms’ financial performance. Design/methodology/approach – Using standard event-study methods, this paper matches a sample of 143 Portuguese companies that lost their ISO 9001 certification with similar non-event counterpart firms (according to return-on-assets and size) and compares the performance of these two groups of firms using financial data collected from the AMADEUS database. Findings – Results show no statistical significant differences in the financial performance (as measured by return-on-assets, return-on-sales, and sales growth) between companies that lost their ISO 9001 certification and their matched firms. Although the literature suggests that certification improves firms’ performance and that the benefits of certification may last over long periods of time, this paper’s results suggest that, after decertification, companies do not exhibit over or underperformance in their operations vis-à-vis comparable firms that do not undergo the same event. Originality/value – As far as the authors are aware, this is the first study assessing the impact of ISO 9001 certificate withdrawal on the decertified firms’ financial performance.
M11|Implementing Cost Calculation Using Abc Method|Cost information system plays an important role in every organization in the decision making process. An important task of management is to ensure control over operations, processes, sectors and, not ultimately, on costs. Although at the goals of an organization compete more control systems (production control, quality control etc.) cost information system is important as it monitors the results of the others. As a result, the detailed analysis of costs, calculation of production cost quantification of losses, estimating the efficiency of the work provides a solid basis for financial control. Considering the importance of cost in production units, our articles focuses on the possibility of implementing cost calculation using the ABC method in such a company. Our works consists in case study based on specific data extracted from production plan developed in 2015. By applying the ABC method in the calculation of specific products the results obtained show that the company could improve some production areas by identifying those products which contribute to losses.
M11|Transactional Leader In Romanian Private Banking System|From a managerial point of view, all the media means of professional communication, socialization and interaction emphasize entrepreneurial success stories. One of the modern concerns of all current researchers is to underline the place and role of leaders in the institutional framework. The leadership is perceived as a support pillar in maintaining any business. The analysis of this phenomenon is extremely extensive, starting with the culture of a company, the purpose of its existence and comprises aspects concerning the employees motivation and the degree of identifying themselves with the organizational objective. A constant concern in analyzing this phenomenon is retaining the employees and encouraging them to bring added value to the organization where they perform their daily activities. Nevertheless, the Romanian banking system in Timişoara seems to display a strong resistance towards change. The leadership of this industry is comprised of people with great managerial abilities. The transactional method, manifested by the leader in the Romanian private banking system in Timişoara, seems to be the main phenomenon at the basis of their daily activity. The manager – leader hypothesis is slowly taking shape. Due to the resistance to change, generated by the educational model, from a managerial point of view, the balance is strongly tilting towards the managerial traits at the expense of the leadership ones. We are still at the stage where the tolerance towards liberty, uncertainty, are some of the traits of the leader in the Romanian private banking system in Timişoara, which are poorly identified at the management level of this very important segment of activity.
M11|Incorporating The Rural Areas’ Particularities In The Water Supply Management Systems In Romania|The existence of the safe water supply and sewerage systems, especially in the rural areas of Romania, are mandatory for the insurance of the public health. In this context, a series of Romanian regional water and sewerage services suppliers developed Total Quality Management Systems, starting with the implementation of multiple ISO standards and in response to the need for answering to high requirements, both for constant development / modernization of the infrastructure and expansions to new consumers, as for the permanent improvement of the water supply, sewerage and wastewater treatment’s quality. The Total Quality Management Systems inter-relate a series of quality components, all of them functioning in a unitary–integrated way, using specific rules and procedures for assuring the increase of the delivered services’ quality and performance. The results begin to be seen on all areas of the concerned water suppliers’ activity: from the operational field to the commercial, staff’s performance, environmental and customer care ones. one of the main fundaments of the monetary creation – aspect which is indissolubly related to the idea of evolution, more precisely, to the idea of economic development.

M11|A Probabilistic Approach To Setting Weights In A Weighted-Average Product Evaluation|This paper presents a procedure that estimates how markets perceive a product. A weighted-average approach is used as a model for the product perception. Since this approach requires weights to be assigned to product features, and the weights are unknown and vary among customers, the procedure focuses on estimating expected weights of the entire market – such weights are representative weights. The estimation is performed by constructing a confidence interval for the weights. Further, a more accurate location of the weights in the interval is proposed, the accuracy being based on additional information regarding inferior products. This information suggests that if a product is inferior, its value must be low. Therefore, the weights from the interval which minimize the value of an inferior product are suggested, the minimization serving as an approximation of what low value means. Since a minimization is involved, its existence and uniqueness is discussed.
M11|Grundzüge einer industriell-kollaborativen Wirtschaftsform|"To date, the sharing economy in Germany has concentrated in the field of Consumer to Consumer (C2C). Now, however, sharing concepts are increasingly being offered and used in the manufacturing industries (Business to Business (B2B)) for capital goods. Due to the digital transformation on the one hand, and the widespread establishment of the sharing culture on the other, it is argued that new sharing concepts will diffuse in the manufacturing sector. This phenomenon is here described as ""industrial collaborative economy"". Since an expansion of this culture of sharing to the manufacturing sector would have very high social, economic and policy relevance, this paper describes the current state and diffusion of these concepts in manufacturing. Finally, a new typology is presented to describe this new phenomenon and for creating an own understanding of the Sharing Economy in manufacturing. Die sich in Deutschland etablierende Tauschkultur schlägt sich bislang als Sharing Economy vorrangig im ""Consumer-to-Consumer-(C2C)""-Bereich nieder. Konzepte des Teilens und Tauschens finden mittlerweile aber auch Einzug in die Industrie auf ""Business-to-Business""-Ebene (B2B) und beziehen sich auf Investitions- und Nutzungsgüter. Durch den digitalen Wandel einerseits und die sich etablierende Tauschkultur andererseits wird davon ausgegangen, dass sich auf Tausch basierende Konzepte, die in diesem Papier unter dem Begriff der ""industriell-kollaborativen Wirtschaft"" subsumiert werden, in Zukunft auch in der Industrie stärker verbreiten werden. Eine Ausweitung der Tauschkultur auf die industrielle Wirtschaft wäre von sehr hoher gesellschaftlicher sowie wirtschaftspolitischer Relevanz. Mittels einer entwickelten Typologie wird versucht, ein eigenes Verständnis für das Teilen und Tauschen von Industriegütern zu schaffen sowie eine industrielle Sichtweise in die Diskussion über die Sharing Economy einzubringen."

M11|Influence of Benefits Realization Management on Business Strategies and Project Success in Pakistan’s Construction Projects|Benefits realization management (BRM) practices are supposed to be the one of the key promising solution for developing business strategies and for project success. This concept is evaluated in the perspective of Pakistan’s construction industry where the project managers keen to develop the business strategies in order to reduce the gap between effective planning and project executions. The objective of the study is to examine the impact of BRM practices on business strategies and project success in the Pakistan’s construction industry. The project success measured by the project output, project goals and the project customer, while BRM practices measured by the project planning, project review, project realization and project strategy. The results of Model-1 show the influence of success dimension factors on project success which reveals that, out of four dimension factors, 3 success factors positively associated with the project success, while schedule goals have a negative relationship with the project success. The results of Model-11 show the influence of BRM practices on project success in three different regression paths. In the first regression path, 7 BRM item shows their significant relationship with the project success, out of which 2 of them having a negative relationship with the project success while remaining 5 of them having a positive relationship with the project success. In the second regression path, out of four BRM factors, three have a positive relationship with the project success, while the remaining BRM factor shows a negative association with the project success. Finally, in the third regression path, the aggregated value of BRM practices tends to show the positive relationship with the project success in the Pakistan’s construction projects. The results of Model-111 indicate BRM practices have a positive relationship with the business strategy in the construction industry; however, the intensity of BRM practices is comparatively low to influence business strategy as compared to larger influence of BRM practices on project success. The study conclude that BRM practices deem desirable for project success i.e., there is required a strong policy vista to device policies in order to strengthen the capabilities of project managers to fore see the future challenges across the construction industry.

M11|Sustainable Development of a Dairy and Grocery Sub Complex in Novosibirsk Region|The research reviews the promising directions of sustainable development of a dairy and grocery sub complex of agribusiness in the region. As a result of the analysis and generalization of theoretical research by the scientists, the theoretical basis for sustainable development of a dairy and grocery sub complex of the region was refined, which is considered in the context of the processes of globalization and integration of the Russian economy into the world space in terms of labor productivity growth. The methods of calculation of parameters of milk production in the region were developed, taking into account the growth of labor productivity, as well as the mechanism of distribution of profits from the sale of dairy products. The proposed distribution mechanism will allow raising additional funds in the field of milk production, which currently does not participate in the distribution of profits from milk processing and sale of dairy products. Proposals on updating the departmental target program “Development of dairy cattle breeding in Novosibirsk region for 2014-2020” were submitted in order to ensure the necessary funding for the modernization of livestock farms and their equipment with modern machinery. The introduction of advanced technology and equipment will allow increasing milk production, improving its quality, and reducing the influence of the human factor due to growth in labor productivity. A milk production forecast through to 2020 in Novosibirsk region was developed.
M11|Declining Nutrient Intake in a Growing China: Does Household Heterogeneity Matter?|This paper uses Chinese household data for 1989–2009 to explain why mean nutrient intake has declined despite economic growth. We focus on household heterogeneity in nutrient intake response to increases in household income allowing for its endogeneity. A quantile instrumental-variable fixed-effects panel estimation shows that rising income tends to reduce inequality in macronutrient intake in both urban and rural areas in 2004–09. This is driven by increases in nutrient intake for the urban nutrient poor and falls in nutrient intake for the rural nutrient non-poor. On the other hand, fluctuations in prices of meat, eggs, and oil increase nutrition poverty.

M11|A Study on the Effects of Client Company Information on the On-Site Logistics and Processes in a Supply Chain: A New Design Approach using Quality Function Deployment|Recently, manufacturing companies have to construct supply chains considering the contingencies of global clients. In order to meet global demand, companies are required to quickly grasp the information which is disseminated in the supply chain. This study focuses on business to business (B to B) manufacturing model in a supply chain. Generally, manufacturing companies which supply the products to client companies engaged in B to B structures deliver the products according to the client companies’ order. Manufacturing companies subsequently deliver the product depending on the order specifications that determine the delivery time, the order quantity, the order quality and so on. Therefore, the orders requisitioned by client companies might cause some impacts on the operations in the companies engaged in B to B structures in the supply chain. We suggest a new approach to solving the operation problems using Quality Function Deployment (QFD). QFD is a powerful methodology and is effective in organizing manufacturing information and setting the quality of design. A case study is given to show the implementation of the proposed methodology.

M11|Is Self-Regulation Sufficient? Case of the German Transparency Code|The German pharmaceutical industry is stepping ahead with its implementation of a new transparency disclosure code for cooperation between pharmaceutical companies and health care professionals (HCPs) and health care organisations (HCOs). In Germany, this transparency code (“Transparenzkodex”) is applicable since January 2015, and data will be publicly available around mid-2016. No empirical work has been done that addresses the impact of the transparency code on cooperation between HCPs, HCOs and the pharmaceutical companies, including the possibilities of competitive analysis of the available data. In this paper, we interviewed experts from 11 pharmaceutical companies representing small, medium-sized as well as multinational corporations which represent 80% of the German pharmaceutical market. Besides interviews, the authors designed a game to evaluate possible financial investments in key opinion leaders. The market can be regarded as a zero sum game. By allowing public identification of such key HCPs and HCOs, the amount spent on them might increase and not decrease. In a way, the transparency code may foster more and not less spending; in our simulation game, the financial investment in marketing key HCPs and HCOs exceeded sustainable limits.

M11|Advertising between Archetype and Brand Personality|The aim of the paper is the alignment of C.G. Jung’s (1954) archetypes and Aaker’s (1997) brand personality framework in the context of advertising. C.G. Jung’s theories had a tremendous impact on psychology. David Aaker and his daughter Jennifer are seen by many as the branding gurus. Despite the fact that both frameworks refer to persons/personalities there is no publication linking the two frameworks. Our research tried to fill this gap by developing a joint framework combining Jung’s and Aaker’s attributes and apply it by analyzing two distinctively different TV commercials from Asian hotel chains. A total of 102 Executive MBA students had to watch both TV commercials and then conduct an Archetype (C.G. Jung) Indicator test and rate Brand Personality (Aaker) traits of the two commercials. Results show that there is common ground. This has implications for advertisers who may want to specify an archetype and related personality attributes for their promotional campaigns. Game changers in the hospitality sector may want to be seen as Outlaw whereas established hotel chains may position themselves as Lover with personality attributes such as welcoming, charming, and embraced.

M11|Understanding Collaboration in Integrated Forms of Project Delivery by Taking a Risk-Uncertainty Based Perspective|Background: Cross-discipline team collaboration between the project ownership team, design team and project delivery team is central to effective management of risk, uncertainty and ambiguity. A recently-developed framework that was developed to provide a visualisation tool to enable various project procurement and delivery forms has been adapted to answer the research question How can uncertainty best be managed in complex projects? Methods: The research involved reviewing transcribed recorded interviews with 50 subject matter experts that was originally analysed using axial coding with Nvivo 10 software to develop the framework that the paper refers to. It extends analysis to focus on risk and uncertainty previously reported upon in that study. Results and Conclusions: The adaptation presents a hypothetical partnering and alliancing project collaboration map taken from a risk and uncertainty management perspective and it also refines its focus on coping and sensemaking mechanisms to help manage risk-uncertainty in a practical and ‘how to do’ manner. This contributes to theory by extending the relationship based procurement (RBP) framework from taking a purely procurement theory focus to being applied in a risk-uncertainty project management theory domain. It also provides a practice contribution by explaining how the RBP mutation to a collaboration and risk-uncertainty management framework may be applied.
M11|Value of Uncertainty: The Lost Opportunities in Large Projects|The uncertainty management theory has become well established over the last 20–30 years. However, the authors suggest that it does not fully address why opportunities often remain unexploited. Empirical studies show a stronger focus on mitigating risks than exploiting opportunities. This paper therefore addresses why so few opportunities are explored in large projects. The theory claims that risks and opportunities should be equally managed in the same process. In two surveys, conducted in six (private and public) companies over a four-year period, project managers stated that uncertainty management is about managing risk and opportunities. However, two case studies from 12 projects from the same companies revealed that all of them had their main focus on risks, and most of the opportunities were left unexploited. We have developed a theoretical explanation model to shed light on this phenomena. The concept is a reflection based on findings from our empirical data up against current project management, uncertainty, risk and stakeholder literature. Our model shows that the threshold for pursuing a potential opportunity is high. If a potential opportunity should be considered, it must be extremely interesting, since it may require contract changes, and the project must abandon an earlier-accepted best solution.

M11|Successful Control of Major Project Budgets|This paper differs from scientific papers describing current research. In line with the theme of this special issue, it challenges conventional risk management practice against the background of former research results successfully finished decades ago. It is well-known that conventional practice frequently results in budget overruns of large projects. International reviews document that. Severe delays of schedules are also well-known. This paper describes successful research results from almost three decades ago, which successfully challenges this severe problem and has led to new practices. The research involved is an unusual mix: Scandinavian researchers from psychology, statistical theory and engineering economy. The resulting procedure has been widely used since around 1990 and challenges conventional procedures. The procedure is documented to be able to yield statistically correct prognoses, when the “rules of the game” have been correctly followed. After a short summary of the basic situation, this paper summarizes the research, followed by some resulting experiences, focusing on two recent studies each of 40 infrastructures and other major projects. In both sets, the actual final cost largely equaled the expected project cost. This result is a marked change from international past and present experience. Finally, the need for further research and progress is discussed.
M11|Strengthening the Energy Policy Making Process and Sustainability Outcomes in the OECD through Policy Design|This study investigates the nature of the energy policy making process and policy priorities within the OECD in order to identify opportunities for improvement in these processes and to improve sustainability outcomes. The Qualitative Content Analysis methodology is used, investigating governance and energy policy making alongside energy policy goals and priorities within eight OECD nations. A congruous energy policy making process (policy cycle) is discovered across the assessed nations, including the responsible bodies for each stage of the policy cycle and the current energy policy priorities. A key weakness was identified as a disconnect between the early stages of the policy cycle, issue identification and policy tool formulation, and the latter stages of implementation and evaluation. This weakness has meant that the social aspects of sustainability goals have been less developed than environmental and economic aspects and a heavy burden has been placed on the evaluation phase, risking a break down in the policy cycle. An additional “policy design” stage is proposed including a sustainability evaluation process prior to decision making and implementation, in order to remedy these identified shortcomings.
M11|The Effects of Traditional and Electronic Word-of-Mouth on Destination Image: A Case of Vacation Tourists Visiting Branson, Missouri|The effects of integrated word-of-mouth (WOM), both traditional and electronic, on tourism products are yet to be fully investigated. The current study aims to assess the effects of and differences between traditional WOM and electronic WOM, between personal WOM and commercial WOM, and between positive and negative WOM on a destination image. Results of the study indicate that traditional WOM had a greater influence on destination image compared to electronic WOM. Personal traditional WOM had a greater influence on destination image compared to electronic personal WOM and commercial WOM. However, negative WOM exerted less influence on the destination’s image compared to positive WOM while negative electronic WOM had a greater influence on destination image compared to negative traditional WOM.
M11|Farmer-Entrepreneurs, Agricultural Innovation, and Explosive Research and Development Cycles|Private sector research and development (R&D) in food processing has seen a growing share of agricultural R&D. This paper analyzes market and technological links between farmer-entrepreneurs and food processing firms. It is shown that processing sector R&D tends to display explosive cycles. To avoid explosive cycles, the processing sector sets the R&D growth path and its target. Dynamic adjustments are related to the shadow price of R&D and farm output price. In equilibrium, the effects of increases in technological innovations (e.g., at the farm level, in public agricultural research, from entrepreneurial talent, in processing sector R&D, and in the price of final goods) on agricultural price and output are positive. The patent race does not affect steady-state agricultural price and output, nor processing sector R&D; it only reduces the opportunity cost of R&D.
M11|Challenges in Cost Estimation under Uncertainty—A Case Study of the Decommissioning of Barsebäck Nuclear Power Plant|Cost estimation is an important part of project planning. Over the years different approaches have developed, taking uncertainty into account in the cost estimation processes in order to tackle the dynamic nature of projects. However, when implementing these approaches, some challenges have been revealed. The aim in a cost estimation process is to establish a realistic overview of the total project costs and its uncertainties. Even though tools and methods for taking uncertainty into account are implemented, projects with cost overruns are often seen. In this paper we look into some challenges with the practice in cost estimation processes and identify possible improvements to overcome them. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate better solutions to some of the major weaknesses identified in current cost estimation practice. We use a case study of decommissioning of Barsebäck Nuclear Power Plant to illustrate how to overcome these challenges. First of all, this is an interesting case with challenges related to the project and the cost estimation process, given the complexity in the situation and that very few have experiences related to decommission of nuclear power plants. Second, we applied an approach that is not yet commonly used to develop cost estimates for this kind of projects. The paper concludes that it is possible to improve the results of uncertainty analysis of cost estimates. A well prepared process, with a suitable group of experts that go through a well-structured process, focusing both on risks and opportunities and using a top-down approach can compensate for some of the challenges related to cost estimation under uncertainty.
M11|The Effect of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations on Academics’ Entrepreneurial Intention|This work investigates entrepreneurial intentions among academic scientists. Drawing from the literature on entrepreneurial behavior, it contributes to delineate the differences in motivations that are correlated with entrepreneurial intention to those that are considered to be linked to entrepreneurial behaviors. By disentangling the concept of motivations in its ultimately basic constructs of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, we investigate how these two different types of motivations are related to the formation of entrepreneurial intention at the level of academic scientists. Through a survey conducted at the University of Ferrara—one of the leading universities in Italy in terms of technology transfer and scientific production—findings reveal that while academic entrepreneurial intention seems to be mostly driven by intrinsic motivations, the effect of extrinsic motivations, which are regarded as a main antecedent of entrepreneurial behavior among scientists, are largely mediated by academic positions, work environment and different combinations of these two factors. This work therefore highlights the importance of social norms in the investigation of entrepreneurial intention in academia.
M11|Drafting an Effective Ethical Code of Conduct for Professional Societies: A Practical Guide|Academic, medical, and research communities are struggling to quickly and effectively address unethical conduct within their professional ranks. Without a policy in place, individuals and institutes are subject to convoluted procedures and unnecessary consequences. In addition to policies geared to prevent harassment and assault, it is important to protect the ethical basis for research and provide a set of guidelines for how professionals treat each other, students, and trainees. Since drafting a policy of this nature is complex, 10 guidelines are provided as a framework for how to draft, implement, and establish an ethical code of conduct. Further implications for nonprofit societies and professional societies in particular are discussed.

The essential psychometric properties of the LPI are investigated using both the LPI normative database, with nearly 2.8 million respondents, as well as reviewing pertinent findings of several hundred studies conducted worldwide by scholars utilizing the LPI in their research. Issues of both reliability and validity are considered, with the conclusion that the LPI is quite robust and applicable across a variety of settings and populations.
M11|Linking HRM Practices and Institutional Setting to Collective Turnover: An Empirical Exploration|The present study addresses the relationship between human resources management (HRM) practices and employee turnover by taking into account the influence of socioeconomic environment. Data was collected at company level with an international sample of 830 companies from 12 countries (Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom, Brazil, Switzerland, China, France, Italy, Poland, Germany, South Africa, and Spain). A division into four bundles of human resources (HR) practices is introduced: remunerative, communication, developmental, and well-being practices. The influence of the socioeconomic environment was factored in by including the institutional setting in terms of the level of coordination as a country-level variable. The results showed that collective turnover is related to both a country’s institutional determinants and to company HR practices. Remunerative HR practices may have a negative influence in terms of enhancing turnover, particularly within countries high in coordination. HR well-being practices are the most beneficial practices in terms of reducing employee turnover. Our study adds to our knowledge on the relation between HR practices and turnover from an international perspective. It complements the empirical knowledge on the effectiveness of HRM practices in a cross-national setting and supports the notion that the institutional context should be given more attention when studying HR effectiveness.
M11|What Is Public Agency Strategic Analysis (PASA) and How Does It Differ from Public Policy Analysis and Firm Strategy Analysis?|Public agency strategic analysis (PASA) is different from public policy analysis because public agency executives face numerous constraints that those performing “unconstrained” policy analysis do not. It is also different from private sector strategic analysis. But because of similar constraints and realities, some generic and private sector strategic analysis techniques can be useful to those carrying out PASA, if appropriately modified. Analysis of the external agency environment (external forces) and internal value creation processes (“value chains”, “modular assembly” processes or “multi-sided intermediation platforms”) are the most important components of PASA. Also, agency executives must focus on feasible alternatives. In sum, PASA must be practical. But public executives need to take seriously public value, and specifically social efficiency, when engaging in PASA. Unless they do so, their strategic analyses will not have normative legitimacy because enhancing public value is not the same as in some versions of public value or in agency “profit maximization”. Although similarly constrained, normatively appropriate public agency strategic analysis is not “giving clients what they want” or “making the public sector business case”. PASA must be both practical and principled.
M11|University Knowledge Transfer Offices and Social Responsibility|Numerous studies and reviews about University Knowledge Transfer Offices (UKTO) have been written, but there are few that focus on Social Responsibility (SR). We present a systematic review of the research on both fields. We consider not only logics from agency theory and resource-based view, but also the dynamic approach from institutional theory, as they aim to generate sustainable economic and social value. The evolution of Knowledge Transfer Offices depends on their role as brokers of collaborations among different stakeholders, according to their mission and capacity to confront the innovation gap. We follow the line of SR viewed as a response to the specific demands of large stakeholders. Building upon recent conceptualizations of different theories, we develop an integrative model for understanding the institutional effects of the UKTO on university social responsibility.

M11|製品開発における問題解決行動は日中韓企業でどう異なるか？ : 調査結果の分析と３か国への提言|本稿では，日本・中国・韓国のエンジニア個人を対象にしたアンケート調査データに基づいた分析を行い，以下の点を析出した．まず第1に，製品アーキテクチャのタイプ，開発組織の構造，ならびに担当業務内で発生した問題の間に，整合性が高い関係が日中韓３か国でみられる．つまり，インテグラル・アーキテクチャ寄りの日本と韓国では，複数部門からエンジニアが参加する形で開発組織が編成され，「仕様変更」「不具合」の二大問題が発生する割合が大きい．これは，モジュラー・アーキテクチャ寄りの中国とは好対照である．第2に，担当業務内で発生した最難関問題について現場レベルで問題解決が行われる度合は，日本＞韓国＞中国の順である．しかし，担当業務内で発生した最難関問題を解決する際の労働時間配分をみてみると，「上司と打合せをする時間」が韓国＞中国＞日本となっている．この結果は，職務経験年数の短さに起因して，韓国のエンジニアが問題解決に必要な知見を欠いており，それを補うために上司に依存する度合が高いことを示唆している．また担当業務外で発生した問題を解決する際の能動性は，「納期遅れ」を除くすべての問題に関して日本＞中国＞韓国であった．この結果もまた，韓国エンジニアの職務経験の短さから説明できるであろう．第3に，仕事に関する意識については，日本において，「現在の会社に勤め続けたい」の得点が最大で，「もっと条件のよい会社に転職したい」「降格の不安がある」「解雇の不安がある」の得点が最小であった．また，韓国の勤続指向が最低で，解雇・降格不安，転職志向が最大であった．さらに，能力評価・業績評価に対する納得度は，いずれも中国で際立って高く，日本・韓国では同等に低い．以上より，韓国エンジニアの職場定着指向の低さ，評価納得度の低さが目立つ結果となっている．
M11|製品開発におけるアイデア創出，コンセプト策定，および人材マネジメント：日中韓比較|本稿は，日中韓３か国の製造業およびソフトウェア業の企業に対する質問紙調査データの分析結果である．この調査の最大の特徴は，製品開発における製品のアイデア出しや製品コンセプト策定などの「上流工程」（フロントエンド）と人材マジメントとの関連に焦点を絞ることにある．このように焦点を絞ったのは，そこに従来の研究では明らかにされてこなかった空白領域があり，なおかつ実務的にも製品開発の成果を決定づける重要なプロセスにほかならないからである．この調査で得た特に重要な論点を，日本を中心にまとめると以下の通りである．(1)日本において，製品開発の全工程を一貫して製品開発エンジニアが主導する割合が，3か国の中で最も高い．(2)上流工程主導者の職務経験に関しては，マーケティング・営業経験者の割合が3か国の中で最も低い．(3)製品企画担当者の位置づけについては，「技術者に近い」とする回答割合が3か国で最も高く，「経営企画に近い」とする回答割合が3か国で最も低い．(4)開発した製品の市場での成功と失敗とが処遇に反映される度合は，3か国中で最も低い．また，長期的インセンティブ付与（＝ポストによる処遇）に重点が置かれている．以上の結果の含意は，次のように考えられる．(1)調整作業がより多く必要になると考えられるインテグラル・アーキテクチャ製品の場合，同一の主導者が一貫して開発全工程を主導する開発スタイルは有効である．したがって，日本企業がインテグラル・アーキテクチャを堅持する限り，この開発スタイルを不用意に変えるべきではない．(2)しかしその一方で，日本企業の開発スタイルは，負の側面をも持つ．すなわち，製品開発の全工程を一貫して製品開発エンジニアが主導し，上流工程主導者にマーケティングもしくは営業の職務経験が「ない」という状況は，上流工程に市場ニーズの情報が入りにくい構造になっていることを意味する．(3)したがって求められる改革は，「技術もわかる」マーケティング担当者と「市場もわかる」製品開発エンジニアの育成であり，その協業体制の構築である．
M11|Supply Chain Competency And Its Effect On Performance: A Fuzzy-Set Analysis|With organizations concentrating on their core competencies, the role of suppliers and supply chain management has assumed greater importance. The objective of this study was to come up with a composite variable of supply chain competency (SCC) based on different constituent factors, namely, supplier involvement, length of supplier relationship, use of IT, and logistics integration and to analyze its relationship and that of the individual factors with a firmâ€™s supply chain performance (SCP). Survey data was collected from 187 organizations in Brazil, Korea and India. Fuzzy-set methodology was employed to determine causation i.e., whether SCC and other factors were necessary or sufficient cause for SCP. The findings indicate that SCC is both a necessary and sufficient cause for SCP which establishes its importance as an explanatory variable for SCP
M11|A Practical Management System For The Effective Use Of Offshore Software Project Opportunities|A qualitative, grounded theory research was conducted to explore and deepen the understanding of how middle and low level managers can initialize and manage information technology (IT) outsourcing projects. The study involved 17 managers and leaders working in Ukraine in offshore software development companies. A grounded theory was utilized to analyze data from participants to identify the interrelationship among seven core categories including: (a) project communication, (b) employee training, (c) flexible organization, (d) strategic communication, (e) team unit, (f) transparent management, and (g) vendor adaptability. The study results indicate that applying a combination of concepts in the new theory as strategies allow managers to overcome barriers and achieve the realization of opportunities beyond traditional benefits in outsourcing. Such opportunities include achieving value-added results, vendor motivation, improved software quality, efficiency and timely delivery, organizational growth potential. The study highlighted the importance of referring a practical management system with characteristics of easily understandable and imaginable management approaches. The study also raised public awareness of the specific outsourcing landscape in Ukraine formed by that countryâ€™s cultural, technological, and political situation. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge on a practical management system in outsourcing although its scope was constrained by limited resources
M11|The Role Of Finance In Quality Principles|Creating a financial advantage is important in todayâ€™s competitive business world. When looking at critical reasons for success, a great deal can be learned by the role finance plays in a quality movement. Each quality movement has priorities. Financial managementâ€™s importance varies by program. In some quality movementâ€™s, financial management is very important and dictates to the group financial objectives. While other programs see financial management less important using a focus on quality or end users. Of key interest, is finding out the proper financial focus. The 50 articles reviewed for this study are a subset of research completed by Aboelmaged (2010) whose review of over 417 journal articles resulted in eight definitions for Six Sigma. An ingredient absent from each definition was finance. This resulted in a need to understand the role finance plays within the design and application of the Six Sigma program. The research found that applying a balanced approach to financial measurements is integral to the success and longevity of the Six Sigma program.

M11|Perspectives Of Directive And Research Groups, On Knowledge Management. A Case Study, Perspectivas De Los Grupos Directivos Y De Investigacion Sobre La Gestion Del Conocimiento: Un Estudio De Caso|The generation of knowledge is inherent to individuals who work in organizations or universities. And, it has been an implicit activity in their mission. The aim of this study was to determine if there were differences on the perception of the main elements of knowledge management between the teacher researchers integrated into research groups called academic bodies and management teams of a higher education institution. The research design was a holistic case study with a single unit of analysis made through questionnaires and interviews. Statistically the population groups do not differ significantly with regard to their perceptions about the elements of the knowledge management, but a more detailed analysis to identify differences at the level of the dimensions, coupled with the results from the interviews, which indicate marked differences of both groups. We conclude that it is necessary to build of a formal structure of the knowledge management program so in that way, they can integrate the elements that today work independently.
M11|Applying The Theory Of Constraints To The Logistics Service Of Medical Records Of A Hospital / Teoría De Las Limitaciones Aplicada Al Servicio De Logística De Documentación Clínica De Un Hospital|Management of patient records in a hospital is of major importance, for its impact both on the quality of care and on the associated costs. Since this process is circular, the prevention of the building up of bottlenecks is especially important. Thus, the objective of this paper was to analyze whether the Theory of Constraints (TOC) can be useful to the logistics of medical records in hospitals. The paper is based on a case study conducted aboutthe 2007-2011 period in the Medical Records Logistics Service atthe Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena in Seville (Spain). From April 2008, a set of actions in the clinical record logistics system were implemented based on the application of TOC principles. The results obtained show a significant increase in the level of service and employee productivity, as well as a reduction of cost and the number of patients complaints. / La gestión del archivo de historias clínicas en un hospital tiene trascendencia por su incidencia en la calidad asistencial y en los costes. Este es un proceso circular, por lo que prevenir la aparición de cuellos de botella es especialmente importante. De esta forma, el objetivo de este trabajo es analizar si la Teoría de las Limitaciones (TOC) puede ser útil para la logística de historias clínicas. El trabajo se centra en un estudio de caso sobre el Servicio de Logística de Documentación Clínica del Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena de Sevilla en el periodo 2007-2011. Desde 2008 se desarrolló un conjunto de actuaciones en dicho servicio basado en la aplicación de principios TOC. Los resultados obtenidos muestran un aumento significativo del nivel de servicio y de la productividad de los empleados, así como una reducción del coste y del número de reclamaciones de los pacientes.
M11|Improving Supply Chain Information Sharing Using Design For Six Sigma / Mejorar El Intercambio De Información De La Cadena De Suministro Mediante El Diseno˜ Para Six Sigma|Accurate and reliable information is needed to support decision-making processes. Due to the large number of participants typically involved in supply chain operations, organizations often find thatitis difficult to effectively share information within a supply chain; hence, this research examined ways to improve information sharing within supply chain operations for one marine transportation services organization. An action research, case study approach used the Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) methodology to design an information technology solution that effectively communicates information between the layers within the supply chain regarding the movement of materials via inland tank barges. The comparative analysis of verification and baseline measurements conducted suggests this project was successful because the new process fulfilled the needs of the work environment for which it was designed. For the organization that participated in this research, the successful adoption of the new approach for information sharing improved communication and decision making within their supply chain. / Este trabajo se fundamenta en la necesidad de contar con información precisa y fiable en los procesos de toma de decisiones. Debido al gran número de personas que suelen participar en las operaciones de la cadenade suministro,las empresas se encuentranconque resultadifícil compartir información de manera efectiva en estas operaciones. En este trabajo se examinaron las maneras de mejorar el intercambio de información en estas operaciones en una empresa de servicios de transporte marítimo. Para ello, se realizó el estudio de un caso en el que se empleó la metodología de Diseño para Six Sigma (DFSS) para obtener una solución que permita la comunicación eficaz de la información entre las distintas etapas de la cadena de suministro con respecto al movimiento de materiales en aguas interiores a través de barcazas cisterna. El análisis comparativo de las medidas que se realizaron sugiere que este proyecto tuvo éxito gracias a que el nuevo proceso se ajusta a las necesidades del entorno de trabajo para el que fue diseñado. La puesta en marcha del nuevo enfoque para el intercambio de información mejoró sustancialmente la comunicación y la toma de decisiones dentro de la cadena de suministro de esta empresa.
M11|Continuous Quality Improvement Programs – Part I: Survey, Critical Analysis And Future Research Directions|In practice, the diversity of management philosophies, quality programs, and quality tools has resulted in many quality consulting firms to be established most often offering the same product under a different packaging. This continual repackaging of quality programs for marketing purposes has led to confusion and resulted in organizations often abandoning a specific quality program in favor of another, although programs could be complementary in nature. In an attempt to assist organizations in making informed decisions with respect to the choice of continuous quality improvement programs (CQIPs), we survey and critically analyze the landscape of research on CQIPs, highlight similarities and differences between the underlying quality philosophies, and discuss the limitations of the current generic designs of CQIPs; namely, Just-in-Time (JIT), Benchmarking, Kaizen, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Business Process Reengineering (BPR), and Six Sigma. Our analysis of the literature revealed that, with the exception of Six Sigma, most published design and implementation procedures of CQIPs ignore a problem definition phase, most programs ignore performance measurement and evaluation as a formal phase along with the specification of the relevant criteria according to which performance is to be assessed, most programs lack the explicit integration of auditing, monitoring, control and feedback mechanisms, most published research on quality programs tend either to ignore the explicit integration of quality tools or to refer to a very limited number of potential tools without any guidelines as to which phases they could be used at, most continuous quality improvement programs lack a theoretical grounding in management theories as well as conceptual models, and no published research formally integrates critical success factors into the design methodology of a quality program. In this paper, we attempt to address this last methodological problem by proposing a classification of critical factors of CQIPs that could be used to assist managers in designing and customizing specific programs to their specific environments. In addition, we discuss the potential benefits of hybridization of quality philosophies and programs whereby several quality philosophies, concepts, programs, and tools are coherently integrated into a hybrid CQIP for the purpose of improving quality and reducing waste. Finally, we outline some future research directions.
M11|Managing supply chain risks and vulnerabilities through collaboration: Present and future scope|Risk is everywhere and part of every operation. Therefore, today, risk management is becoming critical part of the organizations’ long term goals. Capabilities to managing diverse risks are considered important attributes that differentiate a successful business from others. To acquire such capabilities, firms are increasingly pursuing multiple risk management strategies. Although significant work has been done in the area of supply chain risk management, the research lacks a unified framework exploring relationship between risk perception, risk management, collaboration and firm performance. We further highlight that the agri-food industry plays a critical role in many countries through the provision of employment, income and contribution to economic development. However, this industry is largely untapped in the extant literature of supply chain risk management. The current paper attempts to bridge these gaps in the existing literature. The analysis is based on a pilot test comprising five semi-structured interviews with the managers of firms at different nodes within the Australian citrus supply chain. The findings suggest that the firms are highly vulnerable to various risks due to perishable nature of products, uncertain weather conditions, changing consumer preferences and stringent and rapidly changing food safety regulations. Based on the results of study and insights from the existing literature, we propose a conceptual framework to examine the relationship between perceived risks, risk management and firm performance. Our framework also examines the moderating role of collaboration in managing risks and improving firm performance in a supply chain. The framework is underpinned by the key assumptions of contingency theory and relational view. This paper provides theoretical contributions by integrating and extending contingency theory and relational view from organizational studies into supply chain network perspective. The findings of the paper also enhance managers’ understanding of divergent risks and appropriate risk management measures to mitigate them. Specifically, this paper emphasizes for a strong vertical and horizontal collaboration among the firms within the supply chain. This paper contributes to the extant literature in the field of supply chain risk management as well as agri-food supply chains by investigating the risks faced in supply chains and how they determine the risk management strategies undertaken by firms to maintain or enhance performance. The paper adopts holistic approach, as opposed to the many past studies which focus on either supply side risks or demand side risks. In doing so, this paper extends the unit of analysis from dyadic to a network perspective.
M11|Sustainable supply chain management: A brief literature review|This paper aims to provide a brief review of the sustainable supply chain management literature. Supply chain management involves the extraction, production, transportation, and recycling of materials and products, which all have major impacts on the multiple dimensions of sustainable development—economic, environmental and social. Sustainable supply chain management has evolved in the literature to incorporate a combination of these dimensions. The paper starts by presenting an overview of supply chain management and sustainability. Then different dimensions of the area are discussed along with some research gaps which can offer new avenues for future research. While sustainable development requires the consideration of social, environmental and economic dimensions concurrently, the extant literature has predominantly dealt with one or two dimensions, namely the economic and environmental. Furthermore, sustainability has been misinterpreted as green or environmental practices by many scholars with the general oversight of the social dimension. This would result in an appeal for future research to address the social sustainability and investigate the interconnections among all three dimensions and the potential trade-offs or win-win-win scenarios. This research agenda could assist in reaching true sustainability as an inevitable necessity. Despite all valuable efforts, we still may not know much about the dynamics in various industries at the organizational, regional and global levels. The priorities in most cases are still unclear for practitioners and policy makers. Hence several opportunities exist for research in order to help create a more sustainable future.
M11|Factors Affecting Inefficiency Level: Stochastic Frontier Analysis of Public Utility Firms in Japan|The main purpose of this study is to investigate what types of internal and external factors affect technical inefficiency in public utility firms. We consider governance structure and business diversification strategy as internal factors and governmental intervention and competition as external factors. By using 1106 observations comprised of Japanese public utility firms from 1989 to 2002, we estimate the stochastic frontier production function. The main findings are as follows: (i) The governance factor has an important effect on a firmâ€™s inefficiency. As ownership by foreign shareholders and investment funds increase, the technical inefficiency of a public utility firm decreases. (ii) A business diversification strategy increases inefficiency, though the magnitude of increase is relatively small. (iii) Governmental intervention does not have a clear effect on inefficiency. (iv) The monopoly level shows a quite clear effect on a firmâ€™s inefficiency. Overall, our empirical results suggest that internal factors such as governance structure and ownership by foreign shareholders and investment funds, and external factors such as monopoly level are factors especially important to the reduction of technical inefficiency in public utilities.
M11|The Importance Of Integrated Logistics For The Company`s Succes On The Market|In ourdays, logistics is considerd to be an important competitive advantage. Total logistics is according importance to all logistics elements in general, mostly to the fact that they are linked between. The concept of integrated administration of material resources corresponds to the philosophy of the following models: “Business Process Reengineering” and “Lean Production”. The main advantages offered by lean production are: high productivity, low costs and short time and also improved quality. Any economic activity is profit orientated. Logistics can contribute to increasing financial performance of the comapany.
M11|The 5th National Logistics and Supply Chain Conference|The 5thNational Logistics and Supply Chain Conference (ULTZK) held in Mersin Divan Hotel on the 26-28 May 2016. A number of academics, logistics service receiver company representatives (manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, etc.), logistics service provider company representatives (transport, logistics, storage, etc.), non-governmental organization representatives, and the relevant public institution and organization representatives participated to the conducted panels and sessions. In those sessions Logistics General Issues; Supply Chain Management; Logistics Costs; Urban Logistics; Mathematical Modelling; Maritime Logistics and Port Management; Green Logistics; Hazardous Substances Logistics; Logistics and Foreign Trade; Logistics Facility Site Selection; Logistics Current Issues; Air Logistics; Vehicle Routing; Logistics and Administrative Logistics Issues; and Logistic Village issues were covered. In broad terms, the conference was highly informative and provided significant out comes to its participants.
M11|Resource Slack, Innovation Ambidexterity, and Quality Performance: Knowledge Heterogeneity Perspective|Resource slack and innovation ambidexterity can both be represented and connected conceptually with heterogeneous knowledge structure. Hypothesizing with the logic of knowledge heterogeneity, the present study empirically examined ambidexterity’s mediation effect in the relationship between two forms of resource slacks (i.e., human and financial resources) and product quality. Companies in Taiwanese manufacturing industry were located based on the random inspection conducted by the Department of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the Government in 2011, and surveyed. Our findings demonstrated that slack resource is only an indirect factor for product quality evaluated by internal developers and producers (i.e. development and delivery processes) and external customers (product-specific quality). Specifically, first, different resource slacks influence differently on ambidexterity; second, both exploration and exploitation positively influence quality of innovation; third, ambidexterity plays a significant mediator’s role that may strategically alter the relationship between slack and quality. Research has paid increasing attention to ambidexterity (i.e., exploration and exploitation) in organizational innovation. Mostly, however, focus on the influencing factors leading to possible ambidextrous design or implementation of innovation. Few have examined ambidexterity’s effects on specific dimensions of innovation as outcomes.
M11|An Application Related to Logistics Social Responsibility Evaluation with DEMATEL and ELECTRE Methods|The issue of environment becomes one of the privileged areas determined in the framework of social responsibility when national and international ethical scandals are experienced in various sectors. Therefore, to analyze activities of logistics firms in the framework of social responsibility theme gains importance while evaluating the activities in terms of their environmental effects. In regard to this important aspect, the purpose of this study is determined as to specify and prioritize the criteria which logistics firms should take into account while performing their social responsibility activities then to select the logistics firm which has the highest level of social responsibility. In this manner, DEMATEL method is used for weighting the criteria and ELECTRE method is used for firm selection. Analysis results show that “breakdown of fleet composition” criteria is the most important logistics social responsibility criteria while C firm has the highest level of social responsibility.
M11|Multiple Criteria Inventory Classification for Storage Assignment and a Case Study|Warehouse management has been turned into a more complicated issue depending on dynamics pertain to customer, good, speed and cost. It’s an inefficient and difficult approach to control all the stored items at the same level. Based on these; the main purpose of this study is bringing in a policy for warehouse management with the help of ABC Analysis via submitting the goods to inventory based classification. The goods will be assigned to slots according to their distances to the I/O point (Input/output point) by considering their importance orders at the end. In this context, DEMATEL method is utilized besides the Multi Criteria ABC Analysis methods used in literature. Initially Multi Criteria Decision Making techniques with weighted linear optimization, and in the following in order to make these calculations more accurate, calculation of cross evaluation of goods has been made in the literature. However, when we consider the calculation of cases which has increased numbers of goods, classification will be pretty hard. Thence, only cross evaluation points of goodsexceeding a threshold value when we apply DEMATEL method are calculated and applied to classification. On a model warehouse, mentioned techniques are benchmarked and it is shown that the approach, which is offered by us, reached similar or better results than the approaches in the literature in less time.
M11|Informational Frictions and Practice Variation: Evidence from Physicians in Training|Substantial practice variation across physicians for seemingly similar patients remains an unresolved puzzle. This paper studies physicians in training to explore the behavioral foundations of practice variation. A discontinuity in the formation of teams reveals a large contribution of relative experience in the size of practice variation. Among the same physician trainees, convergence towards a common practice differs by practice environment, with more convergence in specialist-driven services. Rich trainee characteristics and training histories, including the practice styles of prior supervising physicians, explain little if any variation. These findings suggest a major role for informational frictions in the origins of practice variation.
M11|Procrastination in Teams|Naively present-biased agents are known to be severe procrastinators. In team settings, procrastination can represent a form of free-riding that, in excess, can jeopardize a team's ability to meet a deadline. Here we show how naivete and present bias, despite their reputations, can be desirable traits in a teammate, enabling a team to optimize its performance while eliminating inefficient free-riding. These benefits emerge only from a more flexible specification (in comparison to existing models) as to how naive players reassess prior beliefs upon confronting present bias. By allowing the 'depth' and 'direction' of such reassessments to vary, our model links present-biased discounting theories to the recently-revived interest in modeling non-Bayesian reactions to null events, while offering a distinct approach reminiscent of level-k reasoning. Key themes from our results include the value of behavioral diversity, the opposite effects of 'introspection' and 'extrospection' on motivation, and that under- and over-thinking can both undermine efficiency.
M11|Innovation Activity Of Family Business In South-West Planning Area|The family business in Bulgaria occupies a considerable place among companies that operate in all sectors of the economy. It contributes significantly the economic development of different regions in the country and collaborates reducing the unemployment and creating jobs, as well as providing flexibility of the market. What is typical for the family business is that it boasts high responsibility towards the outcome. Not only the product or service quality is particularly important for the family business but also is the companies’ reputation among the customers. In this sense, the proper and effective management of innovation activity is essential and significant. In this regard, the objective of this article is to analyze the innovation of the family enterprises from the South-west planning area.
M11|Integrated Modeling for Location Analysis|Delivery of products and services relies on well-managed operations. In designing large-scaled supply chain and service systems, locations of key facilities are a critical decision, as these facilities form the backbone of operations of these systems. For example, a key to effective supply chain management is the deployment of a structurally well-designed facility network, consisting of plants, warehouses, retail stores, etc. The aim of the study of facility location is to develop analytical methodologies to inform the planning decisions for evaluating and selecting siting plans for these facilities that ensure both convenient provision of (or access to) products and services by customers and users, as well as efficient operations (i.e., low operating costs). design.
M11|Last-mile Supply Network Distribution in Omni-Channel Retailing: A Configuration-Based Typology|This monograph develops a configuration-based typology that describes last-mile supply network (LMSN) distribution configurations in omni-channel retailing. The goal is to integrate relevant terms that have been used disjointedly with fragmented bodies of theory to describe the various forms of LMSN. A review of the academic and practice literature was conducted and complemented with secondary observations to identify the key configuration dimensions. Established guidelines for typology and theory building (e.g., Doty and Glick, 1994) were employed to develop the typology. The proposed typology comprises four ideal archetypes: Simple LMSN, Hyperlocal LMSN, One-Stop LMSN, and Protean LMSN. The four are described along the dimensions of: (1) network structure, (2) network flow, (3) relationship governance, and (4) service architecture. Referred to here as the SHOP typology in LMSN, each archetype is associated with one or more core logistics capabilities elaborated upon in a capability profile for each archetype. The typology identifies useful LMSN patterns and enables scholars to develop models and theories based on the four configurations and relate their findings to a specific configuration or across them, rather than expanding efforts on separate and unconnected studies. Notwithstanding, it incorporates elements of the omni-channel context that updates the previous â€œchainâ€ centric typology developed by Boyer and Hult (2005), and serves as a stepping-stone toward improved insights on what drives, facilitates and inhibits â€œfitâ€ potential of LMSN configuration. The research output enhances managersâ€™ understanding of the various forms of LMSN distribution configurations and assists in the identification of possible routes to establish configuration footprints across different LMSN forms to support their omni-channel retailing strategies. Further study can identify the critical contingency factors influencing configuration choices.
M11|To Extend or Not to Extend: Advantages and Disadvantages of Brand Extension Strategy|Launching new products is one of the most used strategies for companies to grow. While line extension is the less risky one, more companies are using the strategy of brand extension as offering more opportunities for the business. The following article is intended to present the strategy of brand extension with its advantages and disadvantages. The purpose is to drive the attention of the management to what they can achieve while entering more categories with the same brand and which are the main risks they have to try to prevent or overcome and how they can do so. The main advantages being investigated are transferring of the brand associations to the new product, increased brand awareness, decreased marketing budget, economies of scale, increased brand visibility, consumer acceptance, prolonged brand life cycle, increased brand equity. On the other hand the company should be careful against diluting the image of the parent brand, adding negative associations, cannibalization, increased consumer expectations and the possibility of increased costs. By maximizing the first ones and minimizing the second group the brand can find place amongst some of the best practice examples which are to be seen in the article.
M11|Collaboration between Logistics Service Providers and the Bulgarian Manufacturing and Trade Enterprises|In strategy realisation manufacturing and trade enterprises perform a complex mix of activities, including logistics. They can de­cide whether to do them independently or to outsource to specialised organisations. This practice is common for the logistics and these organisations are called logistics service provid­ers. They perform different solutions for man­agement of the material flows across the supply chain – usually transport and warehousing ser­vices. This partnership is extremely important because the negative impact of the inadequate realisation is on the company that outsource and for the whole supply chain. That is why the abilities of the logistics service providers determinate overall performance of the supply chain. In the article are encompassed the main aspects of the interaction between logistics ser­vice providers and Bulgarian manufacturing and trade enterprises. By conducting a survey the main characteristics of this collaboration are re­vealed. The results show that the logistics ser­vice providers have high level of orientation and they are flexible to the needs of their customers and variety of technological facilities exist for achieving active partnership, unfortunately all of this in not fully used
M11|Digital Marketing|The purpose of the article is to research and structure the major concepts used today for the digital marketing decisions. Digital marketing is an integral part of the digital transformation of the modern organization. Some of the terms describing the phenomenon express the growing importance of mobile technologies (e.g. mobile marketing). Others refer to the changing role of customers in their interaction with the companies (e.g. inbound marketing). There are also terms that define the need to create content attracting customers to companies’ products and services in the numerous online and offline communication channels. The variety of concepts can be organized as terms describing different forms of Internet and non-Internet marketing and integrating terms. The latter group like inbound marketing, content marketing, augmented reality or real-time marketing can be practiced across various channels. Concept structuring contributes to the digital marketing decision-making process. The practice of both large and small companies proves that marketing strategy and its customer-centricity should lead the digital technologies implementation and the integration of systems, processes, departments and people.
M11|Digital Business Transformation|The purpose of the article is to research dif­ferent approaches for studying the “digital trans­formation of business” phenomenon. The article supports the understanding that digital transfor­mation often leads to destructive innovations which change the competitive environment as a result of the emergence of new dynamically developing companies. However, it creates also opportunities for the business expansion of the existing companies. Digital transformation is an organizational change that arises from the tremendous devel­opment and application of digital technology in business. Possible ways of structuring the pro­cess of change are presented based on the survey of publications by leading researchers and consultant companies. Despite the differ­ences, the predominant position is that success depends on changes in strategy, leadership and organizational culture. The priorities for the digital transformation of the business model, customer relations and business processes depend on the peculiarities of the production and services that firms offer. The article gives examples for digital decisions of companies on the Bulgarian market.
M11|The Cost Structure - Key Element in the Development of Product Policy|In the context of accelerating globalization, organizations need to face increasingly high challenges related to competitiveness. However a permanent adaptation to the impact of environmental factors involves actions that imply significant costs with a great impact on the profitability of the organization. In this regard, planning the launch of new products or services requires a strategic approach, a structural analysis of the costs and the identification of opportunities to increase optimization with the aim of increasing the effectiveness of the product policy.
M11|Considerations Regarding the Quality Management of Banking Services|Efforts that Romanian banking institutions must make to increasing the competitiveness of services are becoming increasingly difficult to sustain and lead to a price - quality ratio to be properly appreciated. Quality of services is the most important aspect in banking too. Banks being aware of the quality problems also lead to the appearance and requirement of some area working standards to respond to requests and expectations on increasing internal or external customer satisfaction and ways that they can become competitive in a market increasingly diversified and demanding. This paper aims to present the key aspects of the quality system , the main operational elements and the sequence of steps for implementing the quality assurance system in banking activities.
M11|Managerial Ship Procedures in Case of Oil Pollution in Maritime Transport|Sea oil spills produce unfortunate environmental damage with huge impact on sea life, humanhealth and economic prejudices for interconnected communities and industries. As prevention isbetter than to cure, specific managerial procedures in case of oil pollution are prepared,implemented and communicated by shipping companies. Ship oil pollution emergency plan(SOPEP) is a prevention plan carried on board by almost all commercial ships, which technicallysynthesize the managerial procedures in case of oil pollution. This paper present an overview onpollution emergency plans (SOPEP), emphasizing useful guidelines for establishing an efficient SOPEP.
M11|Оцінка Ефективності Процесів Проектної Будівельної Організації<BR>[Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Processes of Construction Design Company]|Доведено, що під впливом змін, що відбуваються, проектні організації вимушені адаптувати свої системи управління, диверсифікувати послуги, освоювати суміжні сегменти, а також підвищувати ефективність і оптимізувати витрати. Обґрунтована необхідність оцінки ефективності процесів проектної організації з точки зору класифікації витрат за доцільністю витрачання (продуктивні і непродуктивні). Запропонована універсальна процесна модель проектної організації, що дозволяє представити діяльність організації у вигляді сукупності взаємозв’язаних процесів. Запропоновані показники оцінки витрат процесів проектної організації. Введений інтегральний показник, який розраховується як різниця між сумою продуктивних витрат на забезпечення якості процесів проектної організації і сумою непродуктивних витрат в проектній організації, і характеризує ефективність управління процесами в проектній організації. Розроблена універсальна процесна модель проектної організації, яка є впорядкованим за певним принципом набором процесів з вказівкою основних зв’язків між ними. It is proved that under the influence of the changes taking place, design organizations have to adapt their management, diversify services, develop adjacent segments, and increase efficiency and optimize costs. The necessity of evaluating the effectiveness of the design process in terms of classification of expenses according to the feasibility of spending (productive and unproductive) is grounded. The universal process model of construction design organization that can provide the organization as a set of interrelated processes is proposed. The indicators for assessing the costs of design processes are proposed. The integral index, which is calculated as the difference between the amount of productive expenditure to ensure the quality of the project and the amount of overhead in the project organization and describes the effectiveness of management processes in project organization is introduced. A universal process model design organization, which is an arranged according to certain principles set of processes, indicating the major connections between them is developed.
M11|Bayesian Process Networks: An approach to systemic process risk analysis by mapping process models onto Bayesian networks|This paper presents an approach to mapping a process model onto a Bayesian network resulting in a Bayesian Process Network, which will be applied to process risk analysis. Exemplified by the model of Event-driven Process Chains, it is demonstrated how a process model can be mapped onto an isomorphic Bayesian network, thus creating a Bayesian Process Network. Process events, functions, objects, and operators are mapped onto random variables, and the causal mechanisms between these are represented by appropriate conditional probabilities. Since process risks can be regarded as deviations of the process from its reference state, all process risks can be mapped onto risk states of the random variables. By example, we show how process risks can be specified, evaluated, and analysed by means of a Bayesian Process Network. The results reveal that the approach presented herein is a simple technique for enabling systemic process risk analysis because the Bayesian Process Network can be designed solely on the basis of an existing process model.
M11|Identification of A Set of Appropriate Critical Success Factors for Successful TQM Implementation in Construction, and Other Industries|Total quality management (TQM) is a management philosophy that emphasizes on non-stop quality improvement within all aspects of the organizations. Its main aims are to satisfy customers and survive in the market. Thus, it is very vital to specify the factors that cause implementing TQM successfully. Specially, the identification of the TQM critical success factors (CSFs) is more important in the construction firms than other industries, because the majority of construction organizations are confusing related to TQM CSFs, and often they do not develop a proper framework with right and essential factors for TQM implementation. Numerous studies showed construction companies usually fail to implement TQM and achieve performance excellence at project and enterprise levels. The main purpose of this study is to determine these factors as critical success factors of TQM implementation in construction industry. For this aim, the study carried out an extensive literature review to specify the most frequently used CSFs from TQM frameworks of 37 empirical studies in different industries, in order to propose a set of appropriate TQM CSFs. So, Pareto analysis was employed to analyze comprehensively the 37 TQM frameworks. Finally, the findings of this study revealed the seven CSFs, which are as most vital elements in developing an effective model for successful TQM implementation in construction industry.
M11|Impact of ISO 9001 Certification on the Projects' Success of Large-Scale (AAA) Construction Firms in the Philippines|The general aim of the study was to identify the effects of ISO 9001 certification on project success, and its main criteria into large-scale construction companies in Metro Manila, Philippines. For this aim, the research was conducted an in-depth literature review for identifying the main variables first. Subsequently, a survey questionnaire was designed, and distributed randomly among 67 managers working in ISO 9001:2008-certified projects of large-scale construction firms. Then the descriptive and inferential statistics analysis employed, in order to find the results and conclusions. Finally, the findings revealed that ISO 9001 certification can significantly affect the construction project success and its main criteria, except time length of projects in Metro Manila, Philippines
M11|Effectiveness of Quality Management System (QMS) on Construction Projects|Quality management system (QMS) provides generic guidance and requirements for establishing an appropriate quality management procedure, in order to lower cost, increase productivity, customer's satisfaction, and market share in the organizations since the last two-decade. In construction industry, it can assist the companies to achieve successfully their objectives, and ensure that all phases of construction project consistently meet client's requirements (need). The main aim of this article was to evaluate the impact of QMS implementation on main factors of construction projects in Metro Manila, Philippines. For this intention, the study was conducted an in-depth literature review from different books, journals, and websites, in order to understand profoundly quality management system, identify the characteristics of the vital factors of construction projects, and the findings of empirical studies concerning the effects of QMS on construction projects. Subsequently, a questionnaire was designed based on previous studies and then distributed randomly among the 37 managers with the aim of collecting data. Finally, the analysis of data was accomplished by descriptive statistics to find the results and conclusion. The findings have shown that the implementation of QMS can be affected mostly on customer's satisfaction, followed by cost, and time respectively, while minimum effectiveness of QMS was on scope (quality) through QMS implementation in construction projects in Metro Manila.
M11|Zarządzanie operacyjne<BR>[Operational Management]|Polish Abstract: Zarządzanie operacyjne składa się z zarządzania procesami i zarządzania projektami. Zarządzanie procesami dotyczy zarządzania łańcuchem sekwencyjnych, powtarzalnych działań, których celem jest zaspokojenie oczekiwań wewnętrznych lub zewnętrznych klientów. Zarządzanie procesami obejmuje: analizy, doskonalenie oraz stosowanie usprawnionych procesów (Benner i Tushman, 2003, s. 240). Zarządzanie projektami dotyczy natomiast ciągów niepowtarzalnych czynności. Jest to dziedzina, która zajmuje się zastosowaniem wiedzy, umiejętności, narzędzi, technik i metod do osiągnięcia założonych w projekcie celów i spełnienia jego wymagań (Project Management Institute, 2008, s. 6). Zarządzanie operacyjne pojawiło się w literaturze przedmiotu na przełomie lat 50. i 60. XX wieku, choć jego historia sięga czasów rewolucji przemysłowej. Dotyczy w dużej mierze zarządzania procesami i obejmuje wszystkie działania związane z zarządzaniem czynnikami produkcji i zasobami przeznaczonymi do wytwarzania produktów i usług oraz dostarczania ich do klientów (Slack, Chambers i Johnston, 2010, s. 4-12). Na przestrzeni lat można wyróżnić różne rodzaje praktyk operacyjnych, do których należą: praca rzemieślnicza (ang. craft-based work) oraz specjalizacja pracy (ang. specialized work) (Brown i in., 2001, s. 21). Przed rewolucją przemysłową produkcja odbywała się English Abstract: Operational management consists of process management and project management. Process management applies to chain management of sequential, repetitive activities whose purpose is to satisfy the expectations of internal or external customers. Process management includes: analysis, improvement and application of streamlined processes (Benner and Tushman, 2003, p. 240). Project management concerns strings of unique activities. It is an area that deals with the application of knowledge, skills, tools, techniques and methods to achieve the goals set in the project and meet its requirements (Project Management Institute, 2008, p. 6). Operational management appeared in the literature of the subject at the turn of the 1950s and 1960s, although its history dates back to the industrial revolution. It relates to a large extent to process management and covers all activities related to the management of production factors and resources dedicated to the production of products and services and their delivery to clients (Slack, Chambers and Johnston, 2010, pp. 4-12). Over the years, different types of operational practices can be distinguished, which include craft-based work and specialized work (Brown et al., 2001, p. 21). Before the industrial revolution, production took place

Drucker to the Development of Management Theory]|"Polish Abstract: Peter Ferdinand Drucker (1909-2005) jest uważany za jednego z pionierów teorii zarządzania, wizjonera lub ojca współczesnego zarządzania. Drucker urodził się w Wiedniu w 1909 roku, w 1933 roku przeniósł się do Londynu, a w roku 1937 wyemigrował do Stanów Zjednoczonych, gdzie w 1942 roku został wyk ładowcą nauk politycznych i filozofii w Bennington College, Vermont. Napisał ponad 30 książek, w tym wiele międzynarodowych bestsellerów, prowadził też stałą rubrykę w gazecie „Wall Street Journal"" oraz publikował w magazynie „Harvard Business Review"". Współpracował zarówno z największymi korporacjami międzynarodowymi, jak i z małymi przedsiębiorstwami, instytucjami rządowymi, szpitalami, kościołami i uniwersytetami. Druckera interesowała praktyka zarządzania - podejmował próby ustalenia, co się na nią składa, uwzględniając złożoność zmian zachodzących w gospodarce i ich wpływ na zarządzanie organizacjami. Jego publikacje nie są zgodne z przyjętym w czasach, gdy pracował, akademickim sposobem dokumentowania badań empirycznych. Nie wskazywał konkretnych źródeł, nie zamieszczał informacji o zastosowanych narzędziach badawczych ani nie formułował hipotez. English Abstract: Peter Ferdinand Drucker (1909-2005) is considered one of the pioneers of management theory, visionary or father of modern management. Drucker was born in Vienna in 1909, in 1933 he moved to London, and in 1937 he emigrated to the United States, where in 1942 he became lecturer of political science and philosophy at Bennington College, Vermont. He wrote over 30 books, including many international bestsellers, ran a regular column in the ""Wall Street Journal"" and published in the Harvard Business Review. He cooperated with the largest international corporations as well as with small enterprises, government institutions, hospitals, churches and universities. Drucker was interested in the practice of management - he made attempts to determine what is involved in it, taking into account the complexity of changes taking place in the economy and their impact on the management of organizations. His publications are not consistent with the one adopted at the time he worked, the academic way of documenting empirical research. He did not indicate any specific sources, did not include information about the applied research tools or formulate hypotheses."
M11|Entgrenzung von Organisation und Arbeit? Interorganisationale Fragmentierung als Herausforderung für Arbeitsrecht, Management und Mitbestimmung. Einleitung zum Schwerpunktheft|Die Artikel des Schwerpunktheftes setzen an verschiedenen inhaltlichen Dimensionen und Ebenen dieser Fragmentierung an: Auf der Arbeitsebene ist der Beitrag von Gabriele Fassauer und Silke Geithner angesiedelt, der die inner-organisatorische Bewaeltigung von Co-Konfiguration durch Auftragsmanager behandelt. Auf Basis der Taetigkeitstheorie beleuchten die Autorinnen die Co-Konfiguration zwischen Kunden und Produzenten, indem sie die Grenzarbeit von Auftragsmanagern im Zentrum interorganisationaler Leistungserstellung sichtbar machen, um den Anforderungen von Kunden, Zulieferern und den unternehmensinternen Arbeitsgruppen gerecht zu werden. Die Mitbestimmungspraxis von Betriebsraeten im Umgang mit quasi-externalisierter Arbeit ist Gegenstand von gleich zwei Aufsaetzen mit je unterschiedlicher Blickrichtung. Der Artikel von Markus Hertwig, Johannes Kirsch und Carsten Wirth zielt auf die Erkundung des Umgangs des Betriebsrats mit Onsite-Werkvertraegen in strukturationstheoretischer Perspektive. Fuer die Ernaehrungs- und Getraenkeindustrie zeigen sie verschiedene Praktiken auf, die in verschiedenen Typen des Umgangs von Betriebsraeten mit Onsite-Werkvertraegen verdichtet werden, die zwischen Kooperation und Konfrontation, zwischen Ablehnung und Akzeptanz angesiedelt sind. Karina Becker thematisiert aus einer sozialkritischen Perspektive den Gesundheits- und Arbeitsschutz fuer Werkvertragsbeschaeftigte in der Pflege. Dabei interessiert sie sich insbesondere fuer die rechtlichen Sekundaermachtpotenziale der Betriebsraete sowie deren etwaige Verschiebungen innerhalb des Feldes des Arbeits- und Gesundheitsschutzes. Auf diese Weise wird die Reichweite staatlicher Mindestschutzvorschriften im Betrieb bzw. im Haushalt als Verhandlungsgegenstand der Mitbestimmung thematisiert. Auf der Mesoebene zwischen Organisationen und (arbeits-)rechtlichem Rahmen setzen Isabell Hensel, Jochen Koch, Eva Kocher und Anna Schwarz mit einer interdisziplinaeren Einordnung online vermittelter Arbeitsauftraege und Werke an. Sie deuten neue Formen der Arbeitserbringung („Crowdworking“) in ihrer Vielgestaltigkeit, d.h. auch und gerade hinsichtlich von Potenzialen, die jenseits einer allfaelligen Prekarisierung angesiedelt sein koennen. Hierbei greifen sie zum einen auf die Organisations- und Managementtheorie zurueck, zum anderen benutzen sie das Arbeitsrecht, um das Spektrum von Crowdworking in einem Regelkreis aus Autonomie und Kontrolle, Flexibilitaet und Stabilitaet zu ordnen. Auf der Makroebene diskutiert Andreas Buecker die Regulierung der multipolaren Arbeitsbeziehungen und insbesondere des sog. drittbezogenen Personaleinsatzes, indem er bestehende Quellen des Arbeitsrechts (AEntG, MiloG, ArbSchG, BetrVG) auf Anwendbarkeit prueft, um regulative Luecken zu praezisieren. Zugleich thematisiert er die Rolle von Leitbildern im Diskurs der Rechtsfortbildung. Im Ergebnis argumentiert er fuer eine Fortentwicklung des Arbeitsrechts, um ueber den klassischen bipolaren Arbeitnehmerbegriff hinaus auch mehrpolige Rechtsbeziehungen erfassen zu koennen und die Betroffenen nicht schutzlos zu stellen. Hieran knuepfen zwei Debattenbeitraege an, um die derzeitige Konstruktion des Arbeitsrechts auf den Pruefstand zu stellen. Ebenso wie Buecker setzen sowohl Christiane Brors als auch Wolfgang Daeubler am grundsaetzlich bestehenden sozialen Schutzbedarf in mehrpoligen Arbeitsbeziehungen an, blicken aber gleichsam etwas optimistischer in die Zukunft. Brors haelt das zweipolige Arbeitsverhaeltnis nach wie vor fuer den richtigen Anker, um den Schutz abhaengig Beschaeftigter zu gewaehrleisten und zeigt auf, dass bestehende Ansaetze, insbesondere im Rahmen des Rechts der Leiharbeit, ausbaufaehig sind. AEhnlich sieht es Daeubler, der gleichermassen im Arbeitsrecht wie im Recht der Selbststaendigen ausbaufaehige Konstruktionen sieht. Deutlich wird dabei aber, dass gerade im letzteren Bereich der Gesetzgeber gefragt sein koennte, ueber den Typus der arbeitnehmeraehnlichen Person den Schutz von Selbststaendigen zu verbessern. Darueber hinaus macht Daeubler deutlich, dass gerade beim Crowdsourcing ein Problem in der Internationalitaet der Rechtsbeziehung liegen koennte.
M11|Entgrenzung und Grenzarbeit in Co-Konfiguration: Eine taetigkeitstheoretische Perspektive (Blurred boundaries and boundary work in co-configuration: An activity theoretic perspective)|Wir diskutieren die Herausforderungen, die sich aus einer co-konfigurierten Leistungserstellung fuer Beschaeftigte ergeben. Co-Konfiguration bedeutet, dass verschiedene Partner (z.B. Unternehmen, Kunden, Zulieferer) gemeinsam Produkte herstellen, die im Arbeitsprozess den Kundenbeduerfnissen angepasst werden. Sie stellt damit eine Form entgrenzter Leistungserstellung dar, bei der Akteure verschiedener Organisationen eingebunden sind. Dabei muessen Grenzen hinsichtlich der individuellen Arbeitsleistung der Beteiligten (z.B. Arbeitszeit, Arbeitsaufgaben) als auch in Bezug auf deren Zusammenarbeit (z.B. Verantwortlichkeiten, Arbeitsteilung) je nach Prozessverlauf neu ausgehandelt werden. Der Beitrag zielt darauf ab, diese Entgrenzung und die damit verknuepfte Grenzarbeit sowie deren Herausforderungen und Belastungspotential analytisch greifbar und empirisch sichtbar zu machen. Dazu werden taetigkeitstheoretische Ueberlegungen angewendet, entsprechende Erkenntnisse anhand eines Fallbeispiels aufgezeigt sowie Schlussfolgerungen abgeleitet. (In this paper we discuss the work-related challenges of co-configuration. Co-configuration refers to manufacturing processes where different partners (e.g. manufacturers, customers, suppliers) work together in order to produce products and services that are frequently adapted to the needs of the customer. As partners from different organizations are intensely involved in this process, co-configuration blurs the boundaries of traditional forms of production. In this vein, we argue that co-configuration poses particular challenges for employees. Thus, the boundaries of the individual working processes of employees (e.g. time, tasks) as well as their collaboration (e.g. division of labor, responsibilities) must be regularly adapted according to the stage of the production process. We argue that this is accomplished through a particular form of boundary work. In our paper we show how co-configuration blurs boundaries of the production process and describe the challenges of boundary work for employees. We also seek to elucidate how boundary work might become a work-related strain. We do so by applying cultural-historical activity theory and using empirical data from a case study of a manufacturing company.)
M11|The diversity of European manufacturing plant roles in international manufacturing networks|It is generally assumed that Western European (WE) plants belonging to multinational companies are more developed and have higher competence levels than their Central and Eastern European (CEE) counterparts. Nevertheless, empirical evidence on the plant level is very scarce. Thus, a sample of 291 manufacturing subsidiaries from 14 European countries is used to test this general statement. We argue that the clear distinction between the two regions is gradually changing with diverse plant roles coexisting in both European regions that reflect different development paths or strategies. Our results show that while less competent plants based on low cost factors are still more prevalent in CEE, a considerable group of highly competent plants is also emerging in the region that use their access to local skills and knowledge to become knowledge hubs within their networks. Nevertheless, highly competent WE plants still preserve a unique position within the multinational’s network.

M11|Application of Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making Methods on Six Sigma Projects Selection|Six sigma method widely applied in production and service businesses is known as a project-oriented method. In six sigma method, selection of the prior project among others can be considered as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. The conducted literature review has revealed that there is a large number of methods to select six sigma projects. It is more appropriate to use fuzzy multi-criteria decision making methods in project selection since evaluation criteria of six sigma projects include uncertainties. The aim of this study is to select the most appropriate project as a result of evaluating the projects by Fuzzy VIKOR, Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy COPRAS as methods of fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making and integrating the ranking scores obtained from each method by Copeland method. The proposed method has been implemented in a large scale production company, operating in Aydın ASTİM Organized Industrial Zone.

The focus of the study - the term ""intermediary"", associated with a fairly narrow functionality respective companies and even the negative socio-economic effects. The paper analyzes the range of issues that are in the organization's area of ??responsibility - a system integrator of complex capital-intensive project. The study shows how the qualification of a commercial practice is not based on the economic analysis of economic activity, but relies on the terminology associated with negative socio-economic effects, is fraught with the risk of erroneous legal conclusions."
M11|Impact of the Customers’ and Governments’ Demands on Complex Food Supply Chains|Food crisis are always of big concern for the consumers and governments. Complex supply chains make it more difficult for all actors involved to manage such a crisis. Companies in the food industry must respond now not only to the concerns of customers about the food safety, but also to their need for fresh and healthy products. Together with governments, to enforce regularly the legislation, customers affect the way food actors conduct their business, and can have a great impact on the food supply chain. In order to answer these needs, companies have to modify their supply chains and operate with more transparency, taking into account the demands for traceability. The objective of this article is to analyze how customers and governments trigger more transparency from the food companies and supply chains, the opportunities and challenges of implementing and communicating transparency and traceability.
M11|Increasing Absorptive Capacity to Improve Internal and External Knowledge Transfer in Multinational Companies: A Multiple Case Study Approach|This study investigates how the absorptive capacity could be increased to improve internal and external knowledge transfer in subsidiaries of multinational companies. We look at the way in which the literature on absorptive capacity has evolved, and how it links the internal and external knowledge transfer. Based on 3 case studies conducted at Romanian subsidiaries of multinational companies, we find some patterns, which could explain how the successful knowledge flows should be managed within the multinational company and outside of it, in the supply chain network.
M11|The Importance of Digital Adoption for Small and Medium Enterprises: Comparative Study of Romanian Service and IT&C SMEs|Service enterprises constitute significant drivers of growth for developed countries as well as countries in development. The global economy in combination with the fast paced development of technology in the digital era create opportunities for companies that realize the importance of the service-technology convergence phenomenon, also known as the service economy 3.0.In the case of the Romanian economy, SMEs and the service sector contribute significantly to the country’s economic growth and our study aims to uncover opportunities for Romanian service SMEs to further their chances of succeeding on the global service market through adoption of digital technologies. We find that it is of utmost importance for Romanian service SMEs to bridge the digital divide through furthering their knowledge of network effects and digital ecosystems that can ultimately result in developing core competencies that help them remain relevant on the global services market.
M11|Creativity, Innovation and the Perspectives of Management|This paper aims to analyse the perspectives of management starting from the current challenges and the future environmental conditions. Business models will facilitate the disappearance of the border between professional and personal life and companies will consider the improvement plan regarding the welfare of the employees and improvement measures for the monitoring, control and evaluation processes to help boost performance. Thus, the importance of the share capital and the interpersonal relationships will increase, and the human resources departments will redefine their priorities given the fact that it will be possible for the organizational network of tomorrow to be made up of employees belonging to a global network. Therefore, companies’ employees will take courses and programmes regarding the learning and development of the organizational culture, and the companies’ management will have permanent access to the evolution of employees. Actually, the main issue to be discussed here is represented by the ratio between corporate behaviour and non-corporate behaviour and the way in which the combination between these two will contribute to the increase of the organisational performance. Technology will facilitate the disappearance of the demarcation between “life at work” and “life outside of work”. Complex strategies that will identify the competence sets needed by the company will contribute to finding candidates suitable for company tasks. In the future, we can talk of people management specialists who will need increasingly more financial, analytical, marketing and risk management competences. Companies will seek to promote and support networks of people and “The Y Generation” (which considers individuals who desire “not to get lost in the crowd”, but, on the contrary, they wish to be noticed, to matter within the contexts where they evolve and, at the same time, to have a harmonious development), a fact which will require the use of technology as an interface between professional life, social life, personal life and spiritual life with an emphasis on options, the antimonopoly thinking and the process of encouraging the use of innovation within the management field.
M11|Generation Y – The Management Conversion Paradigm|The Romanian private banking system organizational structure faces major mutations. The boss-subordinate management paradigm is gradually becoming obsolete. The boss- subordinate relationship between managers and their employees is being gradually replaced by a collegiality type of relationship. Even if the transactional leader type continues to dominate, the inspirational leader type is spreading already. The purpose of our paper is to emphasize the advanced position of the managerial paradigmatic conversion in Romanian private commercial banks. The mutual adaptation of employees from a hierarchical perspective is one of the ways to ensure the development of a long term banking institution. We have identified the employee’s perception from the Romanian private banking system regarding the leadership style of their superior using the questionnaire LBDQ XII. Despite of having identified that statistically there are no major perceived differences from one banking institution to another, from ” expectations” point of view, we have found that generational differences are statistically significant. We consider that the organizational culture of Romanian private banking, as the main support pillar of perception uniformity, will significantly change once the number of employees from the Millennial generation increases in the total number of employees in this activity field.
M11|ISO 9001 Performance: A Holistic and Mixed-Method Analysis|The aim of this paper is to analyse the impact of the ISO 9001 Standard on organizational performance from a holistic theoretical perspective, using a mixedmethod analysis. More specifically, the qualitative study considers the impact of the adoption of ISO 9001 on the general performance of certified companies. The quantitative study analysed the effect of ISO 9001 on productivity, business value and increase on sales. A holistic and integrative theoretical approach was adopted, bringing together aspects of the Contingency Theory, the Institutional Theory and the Resources-Based View (RBV). This theoretical perspective was used in a broad empirical study, using a mixed-method analysis combining the use of qualitative and quantitative methods. The study focused on Portuguese companies from different sectors of activity. The qualitative study confirmed that ISO 9001 was a demand from the market thus conferring a competitive advantage to organizations and it was also clear that without ISO 9001 these would not enter the market. From the quantitative perspective, data obtained indicate a correlation between ISO 9001 and the size of the organizations. Nevertheless, the analysis also showed that some relationships between ISO 9001 and improved performance were not significant and mostly it seems they depend on the sector of activity considered.
M11|Topic Detection in Korean SCM Research Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation|The supply chain management(SCM) is a cross-disciplinary research field and challenges to research SCM are increasing due to the rapid development of information system. We investigate the SCM research papers using latent Dirichlet allocation(LDA) to detect common and/or hidden topics and trends among Korean researcher in SCM. Topic modeling analyzes the words of the original texts to discover the topics and the LDA groups articles in several relevant topics and finds the hidden topics in the literature. In this research we searched RISS(www.riss.kr) and NDSL(www.ndsl.or.kr) database using keywords and collected academic papers on SCM between 2010 and 2014. Among them we analyze the abstract of the papers that were published by domestic authors to identify the topic trend in the field of SCM. The major findings will be discussed in the conference in details.
M11|The Intellectual Development of Supply Chain Management: 1996 ? 2015|Supply chain management aims to provide the coordination and execution of planning and decision-making in multi organization-wide production and distribution. This study intended to identify the intellectual development of supply chain management in the last two decades using the author co-citation analysis. The author co-citation analysis is frequently used to produce maps of prominent authors and identify the intellectual structure of the research field.In this research, we have collected 749 academic papers on the supply chain management from the year 1996 to 2015. With these papers, we analyze the references of the papers for the author co-citation analysis method. Then, we produced a correlation matrix of the major author co-citation matrix and conducted multi-variate analysis such as factor analysis and clustering analysis. The major findings including the intellectual structure of supply chain management will be discussed in the conference in details. The limitation of the research and suggestion for further research will also be presented.
M11|Comparative analysis of fuzzy multi-criteria decision making for location selection of Textile plant in Turkey|Due to the increasing competition in the market, taking right decisions about the location selection for businesses is very important. The wrong choice of location for businesses may cause to large losses even bankruptcy. Textile sector is the first sector for which the location selection is quite important. The location selection of a textile factory is generally one of the most important decisions. The textile sector is considered the locomotive of domestic trade in Turkey. The purpose of this study is to describe the application of two Fuzzy Multi Criteria Decision Making (FMCDM) methods named Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy VIKOR for solving location selection problem of textile factor, which is located in Istanbul European side and looked for second location in Turkey. We used twelve criteria for FMCDM, which are determined from literatures and practical investigations. The methods of fuzzy set theory, linguistic value, Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy VIKOR are used to consolidate decision-makers? assessments about criteria weightings. Besides a sensitivity analysis is carried out for the Fuzzy TOPSIS method.
M11|Explanatory and predictive power of the adaptive learning model: average and heterogeneous behavior in a newsvendor context|Abstract The newsvendor problem is an economic decision problem with an interesting degree of complexity while still providing a quite simple and intuitive normative solution. Therefore, one should expect that decision makers find the optimal solution at least when they learn over time and become familiar with the problem. However, this is not the case. On average, decision makers in newsvendor settings tend to order too little when confronted with high-profit goods and too much in the case of low-profit goods. This inefficiency is well documented through a variety of laboratory experiments assuming symmetric demand functions and is known as pull-to-mean effect. We analyze data from an experiment that is based on an asymmetric demand function and are able to discriminate among the possible focal points, namely, mean demand, median demand, and the middle of possible demand. Interestingly, the result is not a pure pull-to-mean effect. We show that the adaptive learning model is able to better explain the ordering behavior than the models of anchoring and insufficient adjustment, demand chasing, the regretting newsvendor, reference dependence, or bounded rationality not only on the aggregate but also on the individual level. In particular, we find out that the top ranking of the adaptive learning model is not the result of mixing individual behavior according to the explanatory models with less parameters. Furthermore, we are able to improve the explanatory and predictive power of the adaptive learning model by modifying the demand indicator that is used.
M11|Management of recycling operations for iron and steel making slags|Abstract Iron and steelmaking slags constitute important by-products of iron and steel production. Since slags are indispensable to iron and steel making processes, established recycling alternatives can be used to convert accruing slags to secondary resources, such as road construction materials, cements and fertilizers. The potential of a recycling alternative depends on a multitude of technical, economic and ecological influencing factors. In short-term production planning, the concurrence of these factors leads to the question how slags are to be recycled. The focus of this contribution is set on developing an adequate recycling planning approach based on techno-economic modelling. By combining activity analysis and flowsheet simulation, a modelling methodology is derived, which allows to model mechanical recycling processes characterized by particle size distributions. Further, management accounting and price functions are used to describe the occurring recycling costs and revenues for secondary resources, which are characterized by regional market structures. The developed concept is incorporated into a decision model, which is used in an illustrative example.
