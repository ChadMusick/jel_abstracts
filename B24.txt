B24|El equivalente general en la génesis del dinero de Marx: el dinero como criatura del Estado|En la Génesis del dinero Marx expone sin éxito la postulación del equivalente general, una laguna en su teoría del valor que ha motivado considerable literatura. En este documento de trabajo planteamos una alternativa al método dialéctico para explicar el surgimiento y naturaleza del dinero, la cual presenta cierta coherencia con algunas observaciones históricas respecto al mismo realizadas por el propio Marx. La integración con la Teoría del Dinero del Estado nos permite interpretar la teoría laboral del valor como una teoría monetaria del valor-trabajo, acorde con las relaciones y dinámicas capitalistas. A través de las nociones de la forma de valor y el concepto de trabajo abstracto, analizaremos cómo la teoría laboral del valor es esencial para comprender el pleno empleo con estabilidad de precios en un sistema de producción fragmentado, caracterizado por las quiebras empresariales y el papel jugado por los bancos privados en la endogeneidad de la oferta monetaria. Finalmente, sugerimos el mecanismo del Trabajo Garantizado como estabilizador del valor de la moneda, mitigando los efectos de la financiarización de la economía y las apuestas fallidas de los bancos.
B24|Theories of value and ultimate standards in Sraffa's notes of summer 1927|The group of manuscripts titled 'Notes/London, Summer 1927/Physical real costs, etc.' (D3/12/3) is recognized as extremely important for the reconstruction of the evolution of Sraffa's thought after the articles published in 1925 and 1926. The present paper is aimed at analysing some relevant passages and ideas expressed by Sraffa in those manuscripts. We shall focus, in particular, on Sraffa's arguments about the existence of two different theories of value, with different aims: one aimed at determining the value of large aggregates of commodities, such as the national product, the necessary consumption and the social surplus, and the other aimed at determining the price of a single commodity, separately from the others. In Sraffa's view, if the values of many commodities are to be determined simultaneously, then the theory cannot dispense with an ultimate standard of value. That idea led Sraffa toward the conception (or the rediscovery) of the physical real cost.
B24|Sraffa on Marshall's Theory of Value in the Cambridge Lectures: Achievements in an Unfinished Criticism|In his Cambridge lectures, Sraffa argues that classical political economy and marginalist economics present two alternative theoretical structures. This was a major achievement reached during the preparation of the lectures. The understanding of these two theoretical structures was however still unfinished: as known, he had already identified the need for simultaneous determination of prices and distribution - a result comprehensibly not made explicit in the lectures; but the critical implications of this result for the interpretation of Marshall's position were probably not yet evident to Sraffa. He in fact still accepted the Marshallian thesis that classical political economy and marginalist economics identified two single alternative “ultimate standards of value”. Sraffa’s failure to also overcome this limitation of the debate on the ultimate standard bears witness to his, albeit critical, initial adherence to the Marshallian theoretical framework. The road towards Production of Commodities was open but still unfinished.
B24|Capital, Non-Capital and Transformative Politics in Contemporary India|Kalyal Sanayal’s work on postcolonial capitalism has been influential in many strands of critical social theory. In this brief note, I investigate three key components of his argument and find them wanting. In particular, I show that the evolution of land ownership in India does not support the claim that the primitive accumulation of capital is one of the important processes in operation in contemporary India. On the contrary, the evidence suggests that the process of primitive accumulation has been arrested or significantly slowed down. In addition to the critical comments on Sanyal (2007), I indicate towards an alternative framework that is better able to explain the key features of contemporary India.
B24|Karl Marx: An early post-Keynesian? A comparison of Marx's economics with the contributions by Sraffa, Keynes, Kalecki and Minsky|"This paper compares Marx's economics with those by Sraffa, Keynes, Kalecki and Minsky. The paper takes an ""ex post"" view on the matter and rather looks at the output side of the respective authors, but not at the input side. This means no attempt is made at studying in a systematic way, if and to what extent Sraffa, Keynes, Kalecki and Minsky were individually influenced by Marx's work. First, the relationship between Marx's theory of value and Sraffa's reformulation of the classical theory of prices and distribution is reviewed. Then the relationship between Marx's and Keynes's monetary theory is examined relying on an interpretation of Marx's theory of value as a ""monetary theory of value"". Next, some light is shed on the Marx-Kalecki connection focusing on Marx's theory of simple and extended reproduction and the built-in, although not fully elaborated ""principle of effective demand"" and the related theories of distribution and accumulation. Finally, Marx's and Minsky's views on financial instability and crises are scrutinised. It is concluded that Marx should not be considered as an ""early post-Keynesian"" but rather as an important forerunner of modern post-Keynesianism, with certain similarities, but also some important differences, and several areas of compatibility."
B24|Der spezifische Liberalismus von Hayek im Spektrum des Neoliberalismus|Friedrich August von Hayek hat der Nachwelt ein breites theoretisches Werk hinterlassen. Ein durchgängiger Wesenszug darin ist sein spezifischer Liberalismus, der durch einen negativen Begriff von Freiheit bestimmt ist. Damit verbunden ist Hayeks ausgeprägter methodologischer Individualismus. Doch Hayek polarisiert, und zwar nicht nur zwischen Anhängern und Gegnern, sondern auch innerhalb der Vertreter des neoliberalen Spektrums. Der Beitrag geht der Frage nach, in welchem Grade Hayek selbst die Verantwortung dafür trägt, indem Inkonsistenzen in seinem Denken aufgezeigt werden. Eine Konsequenz davon ist, dass Hayek zwar für verschiedene Varianten des Neoliberalismus als Bezugspunkt dient, aber die Heterogenität des modernen Neoliberalismus noch vertieft hat. Ob Hayek ein Ordoliberaler oder ein Marktradikaler ist, bleibt eine Frage, die bestenfalls tendenziell zu beantworten ist Ein einheitliches Denkkollektiv im Anschluss an Hayek existiert jedenfalls nicht, ebenso wenig wie ein homogener Neoliberalismus.
B24|Kapitalismus versus Marktwirtschaft. Karl Marx und Fernand Braudel|Since the beginning of the finance crisis, the notion of capitalism and the adjective capitalistic are more and more employed in public discourse without making an attempt to define it. In contrast, the concept of market economy is less used. We try in this paper to differentiate both concepts by going back to the approaches by Karl Marx (1818-1883) and Fernand Braudel (1902-1985). Marx does not use the term capitalism but only capitalistic production, while Braudel argues on the basis of a wealth of empirical evidence that one has to differentiate between capitalism and market economy, because he sees a contrast between them. For this reason, he has different view of a capitalistic economy as Marx has. JEL classification: B14, B24, P10, P16, P5
B24|'Wage', 'Salary' & 'Remuneration': A Genealogical Exploration of Juridical Terms & Their Significance for the Employer's Power to Make Deductions from Wages|The Supreme Court in Hartley v King Edwards VI College (2017) has confirmed that an employee who refuses to work in accordance with his contract forfeits his right to be paid for the duration of the breach. The decision extends to professional employees paid a periodic salary the principle established in Miles v Wakefield MDC (1987). The present article sheds new light on these decisions by situating them within a broader debate concerning the function of the wage and the proper relationship between work and payment. Drawing on insights from economic theory, and engaging in a genealogical analysis of legal concepts, the article shows how this debate has, over time, conditioned the use of concepts such as the 'wage', 'the salary' and 'remuneration' in legislation and case law concerning deductions. It shows that the legal concept of the 'wage' is closely related to the economic idea of the wage as the price of a commodity, while the legal concepts of 'salary' and 'remuneration' are more closely analogous to the economic idea of the wage as the cost of subsistence. The courts' tendency to confuse these concepts, and to analyse the employer's power to deduct as a right to withhold wages for non-performance of the contract, tells us much about the implicit assumptions underpinning cases such as Miles and Hartley, and how they have shaped the path of the law.

B24|Le mode de production asiatique et la Chine. Retour sur la pertinence d'un concept biaisé|Proposed in 1859 by Karl Marx in onder to characterize India, the concept of an Asiatic mode of production was widened to explain the whole Asia stagnation in the 19th century. Severely criticized for political reasons during the 20th century, its economic relevance was rarely put into question. Indeed, in China's case, economic growth is frequently impeded by local governments actions, what could, at least in part, rehabilitate Marx's analysis.

In particular, during the Sixties, his reexamination of the concepts of productive activities and rents allow him to argue that the social and political hegemony of the redistributive coalitions constitutes the greatest structural weakness of Italy and the most important cause of inequalities and lack of inclusion.
B24|Sraffa on non-self-replacing systems: a note|In two passages of Production of Commodities, Sraffa states very concisely that the analysis presented also applies to viable economic systems in which the means of production consumed are not fully replaced. This aspect of the book has been nearly ignored for a long time, and only in the last two decades have some scholars begun to discuss it in depth. Since these scholars basically rely on the terse references to non-self-replacing systems appearing in Sraffa’s published works, however, a question is left pending in their contributions—what exactly was Sraffa’s position as regards the nature and relevance of those systems? The present note seeks to shed light on this question by systematically examining the pertinent passages of Sraffa’s unpublished manuscripts. On the basis of this examination, the final section briefly comments on some debatable aspects of current renditions of Sraffa’s theory.
B24|On the Origins of Piero Sraffa’s Equations. New Evidence Following Pierangelo Garegnani’s Lead|The paper investigates the origins of the equations which form the structure of Piero Sraffa’s Production of Commodities by means of Commodities. Following an interpretation first developed by Pierangelo Garegnani in a paper that highlighted the importance of a manuscript headed ‘Notes Lon-don, Summer 1927 (Physical Real Costs etc.)’, we single out new evidence relevant to the reconstruction of the path which led Sraffa to conceive his equations. In particular, we stress how Sraffa came to pay special attention to the case of a subsistence economy (‘a community that produces just what is sufficient to keep it going’) and how this led him to shift his attention from the idea of reducing heterogeneous physical costs to an ‘absolutely necessary commodity’ to the determination of exchange ratios by the solution of systems of simultaneous equations.
B24|Sraffa’s Silenced Revival of the Classical Economists and of Marx|The standpoint of the old classical economists as well as of Marx “has been submerged and forgotten since the advent of the ‘marginal’ method” – to borrow Sraffa’s own words. The neoclassical (or ‘marginal’) paradigm, in fact, triumphantly dominated over the twentieth century (and is still dominating even now). A serious step towards the rehabilitation of the paradigm of the old classical economists was made by Sraffa (1951) with his remarkable ‘Introduction’ to Ricardo’s Principles, his seminal 1960 book Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities (PCMC) followed a few years later, as a logical completion of his long-standing work. The paper here proposed argues that Sraffa’s 1960 contribution has so far been mainly interpreted and used as a highly powered tool for destroying the foundations of neoclassical theory from a logical point of view, with the confident belief that attacking the logical side of the theory would have been sufficient to bring about its definite dismissal, which, instead, did not happen. As a consequence of all this, the revival of the classical economists and of Marx – which is one of the most characterizing feature of Sraffa’s 1960 contribution – was automatically silenced and this very fact precluded Sraffa’s theoretical framework from being used in a constructive way as a real alternative ‘vision’ to that proposed by the neoclassical market-centered paradigm. The aim of the paper is to underscore the crucial importance of Sraffa’s revival referred to above, by emphasizing its usefulness in providing a genuine alternative perspective and a radically different representation of the economy, compared with that provided by neoclassical theory. An attempt will be made to show the main features of the Sraffian framework in providing such an alternative ‘vision’ which, it will be argued, is now much needed, not least for suggesting far more sensible alternative economic policies than those so far pursued in the ceaseless turmoil of present day world economies.
B24|American Radical Economists in Maoâ€™s China: From Hopes to Disillusionment|American radical economists in the 1960s perceived China under Maoism as an important experiment in creating a new society, aspects of which they hoped could serve as a model for the developing world. But the knowledge of â€˜actually existing Maoismâ€™ was very limited due to the mutual isolation between China and the US. This paper analyses the First Friendship Delegation of American Radical Political Economists (FFDARPE) to the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China in 1972, consisting mainly of Union for Radical Political Economics (URPE) members, which was the first visit of a group of American economists to China since 1949. Based on interviews with trip participants as well as archival and published material, this paper studies what we can learn about the engagement with Maoism by American radical economists from their dialogues with Chinese hosts, from their on-the-ground observations, and their reflection upon return. We show how the visitorsâ€™ own ideas conflicted and intersected with their perception of the Maoist practice on gender relations; workersâ€™ management and life in the communes. We also shed light on the diverging conceptions of the role for economic expertise between URPE and late Maoism. As the first in-depth study on the FFDARPE we provide rich empirical insights into an ice-breaking event in the larger process of normalization in the Sino- U.S relations, that ultimately led to the disillusionment of the Left with China.
B24|"Der Begriff ""Arbeit"" beim frühen und beim späten Karl Marx"|"Der Begriff ""Arbeit"" hat im Marx'schen Werk einen deutlichen Wandel vollzogen. In seiner Frühphilosophie verband Marx eine Aufhebung der Arbeit mit dem Übergang zu einer kommunistischen Gesellschaft. Mit der Ausarbeitung seines Hauptwerkes ""Das Kapital"" sagte er dagegen, dass Arbeit eine ""ewige Naturbedingung"" menschlicher Existenz sei, die nur ihre Form verändern könne. In seiner späteren Theorie der Arbeit findet sich zudem ein immanenter Widerspruch: Marx entgeht, dass sich der Begriff der Arbeit nicht von der Form der Vergesellschaftung durch die menschliche Sprache trennen lässt. Unter Rückgriff auf zeitgenössische Autoren von Marx können diese Versäumnisse der Theorie aufgedeckt und ""Arbeit"" neu interpretiert werden."
B24|Karl Marx's thoughts on functional income distribution - a critical analysis|Keynes, following the tradition of Marx, argued that all values are created by labour and profits. However, functional income distribution between wages and profits is explained differently. In Marx's explanation of functional income distribution, wages are given as a basket of goods needed for the reproduction needs of the working class. Profits are then the remaining part of income creation. Given the capital stock, the profit rate can be calculated. The paper shows that Marx's explanation of functional income distribution has several theoretical and practical shortcomings. The Keynesian paradigm in the tradition of the original Keynes provides an alternative. Here the profit rate is given by processes in the financial market, and, among other things, by the interest rate. Monopolistic or oligopolistic structures, following the tradition of Kalecki, can also influence the profit rate. In addition, financialisation can push up the profit rate. Given the capital stock the consumption basket of workers depends on the level of productivity and the profit rate explained in a Keynesian and Kaleckian way.
B24|La determinación de los precios en la teoría económica de Sir James Steuart|Resumen: Este artículo tiene como objetivo interpretar la teoría de los precios de Sir James Steuart. Para tal fin, se adopta la perspectiva clásica de los precios de producción, razón por la cual es necesario introducir hipótesis que justifiquen en Steuart la existencia de un excedente productivo y su norma de distribución. Sin embargo, los precios son determinados por los comerciantes y no por los productores, a través de un proceso teórico que implica distinguir dos etapas analíticas: por un lado, el acto privado del comerciante que determina los precios de venta y, por otro lado, el acto colectivo o competitivo que determina los precios de compra o de mercado. Al final se muestra que, si bien se puede justificar un análisis de los precios desde una perspectiva clásica, Steuart conserva su lugar en la tradición mercantilista. / Abstract : The aim of this paper is to interpret James Steuart’s theory of prices. To achieve this purpose, specials hypothesis about the surplus and his distribution rule are included into the classical theory of production prices. However, prices are determined by merchants and not by manufacturers, through a theoretical process that involves two analytical stages: on the one hand, the private act of the merchant determines the sales prices and, on the other hand, the collective or competitive act of the merchants determines the purchase prices. Although it is possible to demonstrate an affiliation of Stueart's thinking to the classical approach, he continues as a mercantilist economist.
B24|The Recurrence of Long Cycles: Theories, Stylized Facts and Figures|Basic innovations and their diffusion, the expansion or contraction of the level of economic activity and the volume of international trade, rising sovereign debts and their defaults, conflicts and the outbreak of wars, are some of the major phenomena appearing during the downswing or upswing phases of long cycles. In this article, we examine the extent to which these phenomena constitute stylized facts of the different phases of long cycles which recur quite regularly in the turbulent economic history of capitalism. The main argument of this paper is that the evolution of long cycles is a result of the long-run movement of profitability. During the downswing of a long cycle, falling profitability induces innovation investment and the associated with it 'creative destruction' of the capital stock that eventually set the stage for the upswing phase of a new long cycle.
B24|Regularities in Prices of Production and the Concentration of Compositions of Capitals|Recent developments in price of production models have proposed a hypothesis on the structure of the input coefficient matrices to explain the empirical near-linearity and monotonicity found in prices as a function of income distribution - the tendency towards zero of subdominant eigenvalues. The objective of this paper is twofold: First, based on the behavior of observed eigenvalues, the paper shows that they cannot explain by their own the regularities found in prices of production. Second, it is shown theoretically and empirically the existence and relevance of an additional force acting on the input matrix and the labor coefficient vector: the concentration of industries' vertically integrated compositions of capital around their average. It is argued that the combined effect of these two factors produces the empirical regularities in relative prices. The tendency of the vertically integrated labor to means of production proportions to cluster around their average reveals the existence of an economic force acting on the structure of technology of observable economies and calls for an explanation. The paper relies on the US 1987- 2007 Input-Output accounts, at the highest disaggregation level (between 370-466 sectors), for the empirical evidence in this paper.

Introduction to Michel Husson's 'Value and Price: a critique of neo-Ricardian Claims' Capital and Class Vol 42, Issue 3, 2018, pp 509-516"" Michel Husson originally published this landmark article in French as Manuel Perez (1980). It thus offers a new generation of Marx scholars a resource which academic Marxism has rejected, except for a minority tradition in which this article played a foundational role: the opportunity to understand, and grapple with, Marx’s own economics. This introduction aims to explain, to such new readers, the key role which Husson’s article played in advancing our understanding of Marx’s theory of value. It appeared nine years after Paul Samuelson (1971) pronounced Marx’s value theory a failure, and three years after English Marxist Ian Steedman (1977) formally endorsed this verdict. Husson set out the first, and in many ways the most comprehensive concise rebuttal of these claims."
B24|Growth, Exploitation and Class Inequalities|This paper provides a formal dynamic analysis of exploitation, class inequalities and profits. A stylised model of a capitalist economy with two classes - workers and capitalists - is considered which extends Roemer [26, 27]. First, a dynamic generalisation of a key Marxian insight is provided by proving that the profitability of capitalist production is synonimous with the existence of exploitation. Second, it is shown that, in a competitive environment, asset inequalities are fundamental for the emergence of exploitation, but they are not sufficient for its persistence, both in equilibria with accumulation and growth, and, perhaps more surprisingly, in stationary intertemporal equilibrium paths. Finally, it is shown that labour-saving technical progress may yield persistent exploitation by ensuring the persistent abundance of labour.
B24|Garegnani, Ackley and the years of high theory at Svimez|In the late 1950s, Svimez was an influential research centre on Italian economic and regional policies. It was advised and visited by top international development experts and by leading Italian economists. Pierangelo Garegnani, fresh from his seminal Ph.D. thesis on capital theory at Cambridge, wrote a report for Svimez, published in 1962, on the relevance of Keynes’ theory for economies at an intermediate stage of development, like Italy. Interestingly, in 1963 Gardner Ackley published a similar report for Svimez. The theoretical parts of Garegnani’s report were published in English in 1978-79 and 2015. In a final applied section, which has not yet been published, Garegnani estimates that a fuller utilisation of productive capacity would have allowed for the creation of 550 thousand additional jobs without problems relating to the balance of payments. In this section, Garegnani also raises several interesting theoretical issues. Ackley’s report is an econometric explanation of the Italian ‘economic miracle’ based on a demand-led growth supermultiplier model – a theoretical approach re-discovered by Bortis and Serrano, and recently taken up by Marc Lavoie and others. A comparison between these two genuine Keynesian approaches looks very promising.
B24|Capital as a Social Process: A Marxian Perspective|This paper analyzes the very important notion of capital from a Marxian perspective as opposed to a neoclassical one. It is argued that when capital is viewed as a historically determined social process (relation), rather than as a thing or a collection of things, it tends to assume certain specific forms more often than others depending on the particular stage of economic history. Capital thus refers simultaneously to social relations and to things. Given this frame of reference, notions such as money and property capital are more easily accommodated and consequently are not written off as financial or fictitious capital—not real capital—because they “produce nothing.” The paper also focuses on Marx’s important analysis of the time of production and the turnover of capital in terms of the production of surplus-value (profit). It then examines Marx’s equally important and prescient analysis of how the turnover speed of capital is affected by the time of circulation of commodities (the realization of surplus-value) and the growing use of credit (in its various forms) in the capitalist system. Finally, the paper turns its attention to the economic role of time as it relates to interest-bearing (loan) capital and Adam Smith’s important distinction between productive and unproductive labor—one whose clear comprehension rests on viewing capital as a social construct.
B24|The Structure and Content of Das Kapital|Karl Marxâ€™s magnum opus, Das Kapital, presents an analysis of the long run dynamics of a mature capitalist economy. The analysis is conducted at two primary levels of abstraction â€“ â€˜capital in generalâ€™ (where competition between individual capitals is abstracted from) and â€˜many capitalsâ€™ (where the phenomenon of competition between individual capitals is introduced) â€“ and the presentation is organized into three volumes. In terms of structure, the analysis in the first two volumes is located at the level of â€˜capital in generalâ€™, and the analysis in the third volume is located at the level of â€˜many capitalsâ€™. In terms of content, the first volume analyses the production and accumulation of surplus value, the second volume investigates the problems of realization of surplus value, and the third volume analyses the mechanisms that lead to the distribution of surplus value into income streams of different fractions of the ruling class â€“ as profit of enterprise, commercial profit, interest and rent (and monopoly profit more generally). The three volumes together give a comprehensive picture of the workings of a mature capitalist economy and highlights its long run, contradictory tendencies.
B24|A Unified Marxist Approach to Accumulation and Crisis in Capitalist Economies|An economic crisis in capitalism is a deep and prolonged interruption of the economy-wide circuit of capital. Crises emerge from within the logic of capitalismâ€™s operation, and are manifestations of the inherently contradictory process of capital accumulation. The Marxist tradition conceptualizes two types of crisis tendencies in capitalism : a crisis of deficient surplus value and a crisis of excess surplus value. Two mechanisms that become important in crises of deficient surplus value are the rising organic composition of capital and the profit squeeze; two mechanisms that are salient in crisis of excess surplus value are problems of insufficient aggregate demand and increased financial fragility. This paper offers a synthetic and synoptic account of the Marxist literature on capitalist economic crises.

B24|Appropriation and subversion: pre-communist literacy, communist party saturation, and post-communist democratic outcomes|Twenty-five years after the collapse of communism in Europe, few scholars disagree that the past continues to shape the democratic trajectories of postcommunist states. Precommunist education has featured prominently in this literature’s bundle of “good” legacies because it ostensibly helped foster resistance to communism. The authors propose a different causal mechanism—appropriation and subversion—that challenges the linearity of the above assumptions by analyzing the effects of precommunist literacy on patterns of Communist Party recruitment in Russia’s regions. Rather than regarding precommunist education as a source of latent resistance to communism, the authors highlight the Leninist regime’s successful appropriation of the more literate strata of the precommunist orders, in the process subverting the past democratic edge of the hitherto comparatively more developed areas. The linear regression analysis of author-assembled statistics from the first Russian imperial census of 1897 supports prior research: precommunist literacy has a strong positive association with postcommunist democratic outcomes. Nevertheless, in pursuing causal mediation analysis, the authors find, in addition, that the above effect is mediated by Communist Party saturation in Russia’s regions. Party functionaries were likely to be drawn from areas that had been comparatively more literate in tsarist times, and party saturation in turn had a dampening effect on the otherwise positive effects of precommunist education on postcommunist democracy.
B24|Don’t mess with my smokes: cigarettes and freedom|Considerations of objective-value freedom and status freedom do impose constraints on policies that restrict access to cigarettes. As to the objective-value freedom, something of value is lost when anti-alcohol policies lead to pub closures interfering with valued life styles, and a similar, though weaker, argument can be made for cigarettes. As to status freedom, non-arbitrariness requires consultation with vulnerable populations to learn what might aid them with smoking cessation.

B24|Cambio estructural y desindustrialización en México./ Structural Change and desindustrialisation in Mexico|En este artículo se hace un análisis de la economía mexicana que en las últimas décadas se transformó y sufrió cambios de gran magnitud en su estructura productiva y sectorial, convirtiéndose en una economía abierta, estancada y expulsora de trabajo hacia los Estados Unidos. Se demuestra como con la apertura en los años noventa y la competencia del exterior, se fortaleció la insuficiencia dinámica de la industria y se acentuó la terciarización precoz de la economía mexicana. Lo que trajo consigo una acelerada desindustrialización y la consecutiva absorción espuria del trabajo. En esta perspectiva se hace una revisión de los principales conceptos de la teoría del desarrollo sobre la naturaleza del cambio estructural y se analiza el comportamiento de la economía mexicana durante el periodo./ This paper presents an analysis of the Mexican economy. The Mexican economy has transformed and suffered major changes in its productive and sectorial structures during recent decades. Becoming an open, stagnant economy that expels labor towards the US. This demonstrates how as the nineties began along with foreign competition, the dynamic failure of the industry was strengthened and early outsourcing of the Mexican economy deepened. Which resulted in an accelerated deindustrialization and consecutive spurious absorption of labor. This point of view reviews the main concepts of development theory which describes the nature of structural change and analyzes the behavior of the Mexican economy during that period.
B24|Una visión crítica del problema de indeterminación de la distribución del ingreso en el sistema económico de piero Sraffa./ A critical view of the problem indeterminacy of distributionincome in the system Sraffa economic Piero|El modelo de Piero Sraffa (1960) propone una indeterminación de origen en la distribución del ingreso, la cual tiene implicaciones importantes pues su arbitraria determinación modifica los precios relativos entre los bienes. Este trabajo muestra que al incluir las ecuaciones de producción, y el modelo económico de demanda de Ramsey (1928), la indeterminación del sistema de Sraffa (1960) desaparece siempre y cuando haya pleno empleo del factor trabajo. Sin embargo, sigue siendo cierto que los precios relativos de las mercancías en relación a los salarios se determinan en una variante de la teoría del valor trabajo./ The model by Piero Sraffa (1960) proposes an indeterminacy in the distribution of income, which has important implications since its arbitrary determination modifies relative prices among goods. This paper shows that when we include equations of production and the Ramsey´s 1928 model of demand for goods, the indeterminacy of the Sraffian system disappears provided where there is full employment of labor. Relative prices of goods in terms of wages are determined as a variant of the labor theory of value, nonetheless.
B24|Economic theory in IMEMO|(The Soviet period) The article deals with the history of economic research at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This history is analyzed in the context of the Soviet and world economic science. The specific nature of Soviet economic theory is characterized as well as a special position of IMEMO, in its function of the leading think-tank in the field of world economy and international relations. Two main directions of theoretical work of IMEMO economists are identified: transition from the facts and statistical data towards a revision of dogmatic Marxism, and from Western theories to original ideas and practical recommendations. The connection of the theory and applied expertise is given a special attention.
B24|Ideology, Class and Factional Struggles in the Mid and Late 1920s in Soviet Russia – Nikolai Kondratiev’s Tragic Fate|The introduction of the “socialist revolution, socialism, public property” paradigm and its ideological role for the establishment of the capitalist way of production in ÕÕ c. is studied. A situational analysis is made of the class and inter-factional struggles in Soviet Russia in the middle and in the second part of the 20s. The study analyses the class struggle between the large centralized state monopolistic capital on the one hand, and the small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises on the other, as well as their factional representation in the political life of that period. It reveals the advantages of the factional struggle of Stalin’s centrist faction and the importance of his ideologeme for the “establishment of socialism in a particular country”. It also shows how class struggle influences the tragic life of the outstanding Russian economist Nikolai Kondratiev.
B24|The Economic Problem of a Community: ontological reflections inspired by the Socialist Calculation Debate|Implicitly, the Socialist Calculation Debate is about the connection between neoclassical theory and reality. It involves several ontological presuppositions, with wide-ranging implications. Our purpose is to discuss one of these presuppositions. We want to scrutinise the view, implicit in the ‘market socialist’ arguments, that things have economic roles or functions independently of the social environment in which they exist. ‘Primary factors’ and techniques of production are taken to exist independently of social arrangements; jointly with consumer preferences, they are supposed to define the economic problem of a community. In analysing this view, we borrow from F. A. Hayek, complementing his reflections with those of Donald Davidson, Willard Quine, and Tony Lawson. We also discuss a second problem, which follows from the first: if, in contrast with market socialists’ view, the economic roles of things depend holistically on complex social processes, how can we compare alternative forms of economic organisation?
B24|The Impossibility of Democratic Socialism: Two Conceptions of Democracy|Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny (1994) have used Public Choice analysis to criticize market socialism. Peter J. Boettke (1995) and Peter T. Leeson and Boettke (2002) have argued that F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom (2007 [1944]) constituted a form of Public Choice analysis as well, in particular presaging an application of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem to democratic socialism. This essay demonstrates that additionally, Hayek's book adumbrated the distinction between liberal or limited democracy and illiberal or totalitarian democracy. This distinction between two conceptions of democracy provides another means of criticizing democratic socialism. The democratic political system and socialist economic system are fundamentally incompatible, making democratic socialism impossible, in the sense that democracy cannot fulfill for socialism what democratic socialists expect from it. Democratic socialism will fail, not because those in power will betray their trust or abuse their power, but because the fundamental institutional constraints of democracy are incompatible with socialist economics.

Vishny (1994) have used Public Choice analysis to criticize market socialism. Peter J. Boettke (1995) and Peter T. Leeson and Boettke (2002) have argued that F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom (2007 [1944]) constituted a form of Public Choice analysis as well. Boettke and Leeson say that Hayek adumbrated a form of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. This essay shows that Hayek was joined by John Jewkes in presaging a form of the Arrow theorem. In addition, this essay expands on the analysis by Boettke and Leeson, elucidating the broader implications which the Arrow theorem has for democratic socialism in particular. Democratic socialism is demonstrated to be impossible, in the sense that it cannot successfully accomplish the goals of its advocates. This is because the Arrow theorem implies that democratic political institutions are fundamentally incompatible with socialist economics.
B24|Labor Economics in a Planned Economy: F. A. Hayek and John Jewkes on the Impossibility of Democratic Socialism|Milton Friedman (1962) is associated with the claim that political and economic freedom cannot be distinguished (cf. Lawson and Clark 2010), using the famous example that there can be no freedom of speech where the government owns the printing presses. Less well-known is F. A. Hayek's example, drawn from labor economics, used to illustrate the same principle. Hayek was joined in this by his less well-known colleague, John Jewkes. Hayek and Jewkes argued that without a freely operating price system, central economic planning cannot function without compulsory regimentation of labor. Similarly, no state may simultaneously fix “fair” wages and demand a given pattern of productive output and employment. It is impossible to both achieve income equality and accomplish an economic plan. Hayek's and Jewkes's examples help explain why democratic socialism is impossible, in the sense that it cannot accomplish what its advocates desire.
B24|The Foreign Policy of a Democratic Socialist Regime: From Intervention to Protection to Warfare|Discussions of democratic socialism have focused on whether that system is compatible with domestic civil liberties. Less attention has been paid to its foreign policy implications. Despite the widespread acceptance of the democratic peace hypothesis, democratic socialism would be incompatible with peaceful foreign relations. Economic intervention and economic planning – even democratic – cannot be successful without insulating the domestic economy from foreign competition. This implies economic nationalism and autarky. Moreover, democratic socialism is often justified by the notion that the democratic will of the people should be absolutely sovereign. Such a conception of democracy has no place for constitutional limits on power. Such an unlimited democracy would soon prove illiberal and liable to be captured by a demagogic authoritarian dictator, and this would only exacerbate the deleterious foreign policy consequences of economic nationalism. Democratic socialism is therefore incompatible with the cosmopolitan and humanitarian values of democratic socialists.
B24|The Freedom of the Prices: Hayek's Road to Serfdom Reassessed|Recent debate has centered around the contemporary relevance and even the original validity of F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom. Was it directed against command socialism only or against welfare-state interventionism as well? Should the book even be read anymore? This essay takes a step back from the dichotomy between socialism and interventionism and explores two specific ideas of Hayek's which deserve renewed attention: first, his claim that economic liberty is the fundamental liberty and that political liberty is merely secondary in value. Second, Hayek's conception of the rule-of-law, which has implications for contemporary command-and-control regulation. Furthermore, that Hayek's philosophical conception of the rule-of-law in the Road to Serfdom is related to his economic theory of prices in “The Use of Knowledge in Society.” While Hayek's specific target in the Road to Serfdom was command socialism, his book embodied arguments which are more widely applicable and relevant today.
B24|Marxismo ecológico: un recuento crítico del estado del arte|En el presente documento de trabajo se efectúa una revisión crítica de las principales aportaciones hechas por los autores ligados a la corriente científico-política del marxismo ecológico. En primer lugar, se ensaya una definición de lo que actualmente puede entenderse por marxismo ecológico. En segundo término, se realiza una descripción de las principales teorías y conceptos nacidos a partir de esta corriente, privilegiando aquellas que abordan las temáticas de depredación y contaminación ecosistémicas yendo más allá de la simple interpretación exegética de los textos de Marx y Engels. Finalmente, en tercer lugar, se desarrolla una evaluación crítico-comparativa, provisional, de las distintas teorías y conceptos abordados en la sección dos, haciendo especial énfasis en los tópicos más polémicos y relevantes para la política concreta de nuestra época histórica. In this working paper I undertake a critical review of the main contributions developed by the authors associated with the scientific and political school of thought known as Ecological Marxism. First of all, I try to propose a definition of what can be understood today by Ecological Marxism. Secondly, I describe the main theories and concepts originated by this school of thought, giving preference to those that take into account topics like depletion of resources and pollution, going further than the exegetical interpretation of Marx and Engels. Finally, I develop a critical and comparative evaluation of the different theories and concepts reviewed, emphasizing the most controversial and significant issues related to the concrete politics of our time.
B24|Sistema mundial y formas de capitalismo: la teoría marxista de la dependencia revisitada|This paper underscores the significance of the Use Values that Latin America produces, which contributes to a reduced and focalized increase in productivity, and allows an unequal interchange with developed economies. This generates a modality of Capitalism—Dependent, which presents peculiarities in its reproduction, that the Marxist Dependency Theory aims to explain. En este escrito se pone de manifiesto la significación de los valores de uso que produce América Latina, lo que propicia una elevación reducida y focalizada de la productividad y abre paso al intercambio desigual con las economías desarrolladas. Todo esto genera una modalidad de capitalismo, el dependiente, que presenta particularidades en su reproducción, las que la teoría marxista de la dependencia busca explicar.
B24|Risking Capitalism|The growing centrality of risk management in pro-market governance raises important questions regarding how risks are produced, and why? Who and what is included in, and excluded from, risk management, and why? And, what is the relationship between the rise of risk management and neoliberalism? Charting the relationship between risk, contemporary capitalism and its neoliberal modes of governance, Risking Capitalism, addresses these questions by examining - both analytically and empirically - diverse meanings and practices of risk management across a range of scales and themes, ranging from austerity to climate change to housing and debt. The authors investigate the relationship between shifts in contemporary capitalism and the ways in which neoliberal forms of risk management have emerged, been reproduced and normalized, and, transformed historically.
B24|Accounting for Inequality|Pikettyâ€™s study of capital and inequality, especially the distribution of the national income through a â€œcapital-labor split,â€ is examined and compared with a model developed from data sets from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Pikettyâ€™s inclusion of executive supersalaries as labor income is questioned as over-estimating laborâ€™s share of national income distribution and laborâ€™s role as a causal factor in the intensification of inequality.
B24|Long Waves of Capitalist Development : An Empirical Investigation|In this paper, I investigate the phenomenon of long waves of capitalist development from two perspectives. First, I look for evidence of long waves of economic growth taking the dates for turning points of long waves from the historical literature (Mandel, 1995). Using historical data for 20 capitalist countries from the Maddison-Project, I find that the growth rate of real per capita GDP (and real GDP) is significantly higher in the upswing than in the downswing phase of long waves. I interpret this as evidence of long waves of economic activity. Second, I revisit the method used by Gordon, Weisskopf and Bowles (1983) to identify long waves, using historical data on the U.S. economy from Dumenil and Levy (2013). I use this definition of long waves to test their hypothesis that business cycle downturns are â€˜reproductiveâ€™ during the upswing phase and â€˜non- reproductiveâ€™ during the downswing phase of long waves. I find evidence in support of the hypothesis.
B24|The modern revival of the Classical surplus approach: implications for the analysis of growth and crises|The paper reviews the main elements of Modern Classical Theory in view of the analysis of contemporary societies and in particular: the recovery of the Classical and Marxist “surplus approach” as a solid foundation for the analysis of social conflict; a demand-led theory of the level and growth of output based on the rejection of Say’s Law and the recovery of the notion of “external markets” put forward by Rosa Luxembourg and Kalecki, as the framework for the investigation of growth and crises in different historical phases of capitalism; the dismantling of the analytical core of Marginalism and of its laissez-faire policy prescriptions; and finally, the rejection of methodological individualism and of subjectivism in economic analysis and the preservation of the analytical methods of the Classical economists and Marx. In this regard, the paper underlines some differences with other heterodox schools, but also convergence with endogenous money theory and with systemic views of technical change.
B24|Fairness and Utilitarianism without Independence|In this work we reconsider Harsanyi?s celebrated (1953, 1955, 1977) utilitarian impartial observer theorem. Departing from Harsanyi?s individual-centered approach, we argue that, when societal decisions are at stake, postulates must not be drawn from individualistic behavior. Rather, they should be based on societal norms. Hence, notions like societal fairness should explicitly be taken as the guiding principles. Continuing this line of thinking, we state and prove a utilitarian result that, rather than the independence assumption, is based on the notion of procedural fairness and on similar treatment of societal and individual lotteries.
B24|Post-Communist Capitalism: Still Elusive|The failure of communism prompted Central and East European nations to opt for capitalism. Yet the central-planning heritage, especially the traces the latter has left in the people's minds, has rendered capitalism's rules hardly applicable in the newly emerged market economies. The difficulty has been further compounded by the effects of the recent global economic crisis, which has severely dented the trust in capitalism as a whole, especially the liberal American-type, where unrestricted financial markets make the rule.
B24|The language of class in China|Over half a century after the 1949 revolution, China is again being radically transformed, this time from a variant of state socialism to a variant of state capitalism. The country’s double path dependency – on the one hand, from pre-reform Chinese socialism, and on the other, from its newly endorsed globalization – distorts or limits its transition to capitalism, a transition project that is no longer tentative or politically hidden. Yet this project still cannot be openly embraced in official statements due to the enshrined commitment of the People’s Republic to socialism and the enduring attachment of the Chinese people to revolutionary and socialist traditions. This peculiar disjunction causes some extraordinary difficulties, not just in the articulation of class politics, but also in the way class politics operate in practice. The weakness, if not the complete absence, of an independent working class movement in China cannot be explained by repression alone. Multiple impediments to class consciousness and stronger labour mobilization arise from contradictory social changes and their confusing messages. In people’s subjective perceptions, when the ambiguity involved in a ‘socialist’ state taking a capitalist path is set aside, the contrast between visible gains in material prosperity and past scarcity hampers even the most ardent critics of the market transition. Such contradictions function dialectically to stabilize an otherwise crisis-ridden process, in the context of a formerly (and officially still) communist party undergoing a profound self-transformation. The refusal of the language of class, to be discussed in this essay, is a titanic act of symbolic violence on the part of the Chinese state, committed as part of a political strategy to make way for ‘reform and opening’. The tactic is also evident in official phrases such as ‘socialist market economy’, ‘primary socialist stage’, or ‘socialism with Chinese characteristics’ – all of them largely devoid of socialist content. By the same token, China’s working men and women need an alternative vocabulary as a politico-ideological weapon for articulating their situations and demands. At issue is thus not only the way the concept of class is diluted or muted in China’s de-revolutionized polity; it is also about the way in which the lack of a language of class based counter-hegemony helps to explain the lack of counter-hegemonic organizational capacity. To say this is not to endorse the views of those who imagine that class conflicts can somehow be overcome outside the realm of political economy. The damage caused by the kind of identity politics which involves discursive political attacks on ‘class essentialism’ are manifest. The alarming retreat from both gender equality and ethnic peace in China, following the imposed denial of class, makes this powerfully clear. In that light class continues to be what the renewal of a multi-dimensioned, universal struggle for liberation ultimately depends on.
B24|Theories of finance and financial crisis: Lessons for the Great Recession|This paper presents an overview of different models which explain financial crises, with the aim of understanding economic developments during and possibly after the Great Recession. In the first part approaches based on efficient markets and rational expectations hypotheses are analyzed, which however do not give any explanation for the occurrence of financial crises and thus cannot suggest any remedies for the present situation. A broad range of theoretical approaches analyzing financial crises from a medium term perspective is then discussed. Within this group we focused on the insights of Marx, Schumpeter, Wicksell, Hayek, Fisher, Keynes, Minsky, and Kindleberger. Subsequently the contributions of the Regulation School, the approach of Social Structures of Accumulation and Post-Keynesian approach, which focus on long-term developments and regime shifts in capitalist development, are presented. International approaches to finance and financial crises are integrated into the analyses. We address the issue of relevance of all these theories for the present crisis and draw some policy implications. The paper has the aim to find out to which extent the different approaches are able to explain the Great Recession, what visions they develop about future development of capitalism and to which extent these different approaches can be synthesized.
B24|The Complex Roots of Deprofessionalization: A Case Study of New Public Management|While it might appear to be self-evident that the trend toward New Public Management (NPM) in the public administration systems of many Western countries is an outgrowth of neo-liberalism, the case of Swedish education suggests that policies can have widely different and counterintuitive sources. Ideas on teaching and education from both the left and right of the political spectrum paved the way for NPM in the Swedish school system. Unless political actors on the left acknowledge the shared responsibility for the rise of NPM it will not be possible to rectify and amend the shortcomings of such arrangements in schools and other public services.
B24|The Structure of the Models of Structural Change and Kaldor's Facts: A Critical Survey|Although structural analysis was one of the central subjects in economics, its importance fell by the wayside, especially after aggregate macroeconomic growth models became popular in the 20th century. However, structural analysis has been revived recently and a new research agenda has emerged: to examine whether structural change can be reconciled with Kaldor's facts. This is an interesting agenda from both the theoretical and empirical point of view. Since Kaldor's facts are thought of as a sort of balanced growth path, this concept is extended so as to reconcile structural change with Kaldor's facts. In this study, we review the multi-sectoral models in which structural change can be reconciled with Kaldor's facts. We demonstrate that the common feature of all reviewed multi-sectoral models of structural change is that they are regarded as natural extensions of the one-sector model of growth and then somehow transformed into the one-sector model. However, we assert that it is not an adequate treatment of multi-sectoral models when structural change is focused. The transformation of multi-sectoral models into the one-sector model assumes a homogeneous capital but capital consists of heterogeneous commodities in modern capitalist economies. It reminds us of the lessen of the Cambridge capital controversies that the properties obtained by the one-sector model do not necessarily hold in multi-sectoral models when capital consists of heterogeneous commodities and the choice of techniques is allowed. From the empirical point of view, it is one of the important characteristics that the change in the composition of physical capital is systematically related to income growth. However, the models in which only homogeneous capital is included cannot focus on the characteristic. Whether or not structural change can be reconciled with Kaldor's facts in the models with heterogeneous capital is still an open question.
B24|Non-Western Marxist Traditions in Northeast Asia|Of the many origins and traditions of Marxism around the world, some are distinctly non-Western. For example, Maoism, certain schools of Japanese Marxism, and Stalinism have evolved differently from Western anti-neoliberalism. Among them, Japanese Marxists developed various original forms of Marxism, and the most important traditions were Koza-ha and Ronoha schools that originated from the pre-war period. This paper first discusses its influence on South Korean two debates on Korean capitalism, and then, discusses Chinese Marxism which has three special traditions. Some of them resonated with other forms of Asian Marxism. This resonance may have been formed by the essentially similar socio-political situation created by the backwardness of their countries.
B24|Neoliberalism, ‘Digitization’, and Creativity: the Issue of Applied Ontology|The paper extends Foucault’s analysis of neoliberalism in The Birth of Biopolitics. More specifically, I construct and defend an anti-Husserlian approach to the labour process with the objective of investigating how collectively generated forms of intellectual labour have been appropriated under capitalist relations of production. I also interrogate the way that different notions of (computational) applied ontology influence both the nature of and our very conception of social creativity. What, quite wrongly, has been thought of in Spinoza as pantheism is simply the reduction of the field of God to the universality of the signifier, which produces a serene, exceptional detachment from human desire. In so far as Spinoza says—desire is the essence of man, and in the radical dependence of the universality of the divine attributes, which is possible only through the function of the signifier, in so far as he does this, he obtains that unique position by which the philosopher—and it is no accident that it is a Jew detached from his tradition who embodies it—may be confused with a transcendent love. This position is not tenable for us. Experience shows us that Kant is more true, and I have proved that his theory of consciousness, when he writes of practical reason, is sustained only by giving a specification of the moral law which, looked at more closely, is simply desire in its pure state, that very desire that culminates in sacrifice, strictly speaking, of everything that is the object of love in one’s human tenderness—I would say, not only in the rejection of the pathological object, but also in its sacrifice and murder. That is why I wrote Kant avec Sade. (Lacan, 1979: 275-6) But it is like the story of the Resistance fighters who, wanting to destroy a pylon, balanced the plastic charges so well that the pylon blew up and fell back into its hole. From the Symbolic to the Imaginary, from castration to Oedipus, and from the despotic age to capitalism, inversely, there is the progress leading to the withdrawal of the overseeing and overcoding object from on high, which gives way to a social field of immanence where the decoded flows produce images and level them down. Whence the two aspects of the signifier: a barred transcendent signifier taken in a maximum that distributes lack, and an immanent system of relations between minimal elements that come to fill the uncovered field (somewhat similar in traditional terms to the way one goes from Parmenidean Being to the atoms of Democritus). (Deleuze and Guattari,1987: 290-1). Marx was vexed by the bourgeois character of the American working class. But it turned out that the prosperous Americans were merely showing the way for the British and the French and the Japanese. The universal class into which we are merging is not the revolutionary proletariat but the innovative bourgeoisie. (McClosky, D. 2009)
B24|George Orwell and the Incoherence of Democratic Socialism|George Orwell's famous fictions, Animal Farm and Nineteen-Eighty Four were intended to advocate democratic socialism by portraying undemocratic forms of socialism as totalitarian. For Orwell, democracy was a political institution which would limit the abuse of power. But there are several problems with democratic socialism which ensure its failure. In Orwell's novel A Clergyman's Daughter, Orwell's views of economics and politics are inconsistent and conflicting in a way that ensures democratic socialism will not succeed on Orwell's terms. Democratic socialism in general is criticized according to F. A. Hayek's Road to Serfdom and John Jewkes's The New Ordeal by Planning, whose arguments differ crucially from those against market socialism by Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny. An economic analysis of the political institutions of democratic socialism shows that democratic socialism must necessarily fail for political (not economic) reasons even if nobody in authority has ill-intentions or abuses their power.
B24|Two Opposing Economic-Literary Critiques of Socialism: George Orwell Versus Eugen Richter and Henry Hazlitt|Orwell's famous fictions, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four criticized totalitarian forms of socialism from a Public Choice perspective, assuming that socialism would work as an economic system as long as the proper political institutions were in place to curb the potential for the abuse of power. This is contrasted with two novels by others who took the opposite approach: Richter's Pictures of the Socialistic Future and Hazlitt's Time Will Run Back. These two assumed that the political implementation of socialism would be perfect but that socialism would necessarily turn totalitarian because of the problem of economic calculation. These novels assumed away the Public Choice problem of institutions and the abuse of power and focused on the political implications of socialism as a purely economic system. Contrasting these two sets of novels shows how the Austrian and Public Choice schools criticize socialism in two entirely different ways.
B24|George Orwell as a Public Choice Economist|George Orwell is famous for his two final fictions, Animal Farm (Orwell 1945a) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (Orwell 1949a). These two works are sometimes understood to defend capitalism against socialism. But as Orwell was a committed socialist, this could not have been his intention. Orwell's criticisms were directed not against socialism per se but against the Soviet Union and similarly totalitarian regimes. Instead, these fictions were intended as Public Choice-style investigations into which political systems furnished suitable incentive structures to prevent the abuse of power. This is demonstrated through a study of Orwell's non-fiction works, where his opinions and intentions are more explicit.

B24|Ludwig M. Lachmann contro la Scuola di Cambridge<BR>[Ludwig M. Lachmann against the Cambridge School]|While in the early 1930s Keynes and Hayek were the major figures in a heated academic debate about money and capital, in which Keynes also and especially involved the Italian Piero Sraffa, it might seem at first sight that the Austrian economist set aside an organic demolition of the ideas expressed in 1936 by his rival in the General Theory. But the ‘Austrian knight’ of a new Vienna-Cambridge debate, in the subsequent decades, was the German economist Ludwig M. Lachmann (1906-1990), a student of Hayek at LSE during the 1930s and later a professor in Johannesburg and New York. Lachmann was one of the protagonists of the Austrian revival after 1974 and the founding leader of the ‘hermeneutic stream’, opposed by the Rothbardian stream. Lachmann, defending Keynes’s subjectivism and expectation theory, revived the Vienna-Cambridge controversy, criticising not Keynes but his followers, in particular the ‘new’ Cambridge School, developed by Joan Robinson and Piero Sraffa. Lachmann’s life sight was to build a new economics paradigm, centred on the idea of market process, expectations and kaleidic society (Shackle).
B24|Una stagnazione secolare? Italia, Giappone, Stati Uniti, 1950-2015<BR>[Towards a secular stagnation? Italy, Japan, United States, 1950-2015]|This paper discusses the hypothesis of secular stagnation. Firstly, the debate on stagnation, from Alvin Hansen (1938) to Marxists and more recent interpretations is illustrated. Then, the demographic and macroeconomic trends of Italy, Japan and the United States are examined in relationship with the secular stagnation hypothesis.
B24|В Память Об Академике Богомолове<BR>[In Memory of Academician Bogomolov]|The paper shows some of the most important points in life and work of Oleg Timofeevich Bogomolov, a great Russian economist and an Academician of AS USSR and RAS. Even though in his 88-year long life Oleg Timofeevich was considered one of the best Soviet and Russian scientists and awarded many prizes, his work has so far not had corresponding social impact. This especially applies to his opinions and papers written in the period of perestroika and market reforms, when his warnings were largely ignored, although they proved to be prophetic. В статье показаны основные даты жизни и работы Олега Тимофеевича Богомолова, великого русского экономиста, академика АН СССР и РАН. Хотя в течение почти 88-летней жизни Олег Тимофеевич слыл за одного из лучших советских и российских учёных, даже приобрел не мало признаний и наград, его работы как правило не имели должного общественного влияния. Особенно подчёркиваются его положения и работы в период перестройки и рыночных реформ, когда его предупреждения не были приняты, хотя и оказались пророческими.
B24|Claudio Napoleoni e il Capitale monopolistico di Baran e Sweezy (Claudio Napoleoni and Monopoly Capital by Baran and Sweezy)|The article introduces the present issue, which focuses on Marxist interpretations of the crisis. The author describes and puts into context Claudio Napoleoni’s interpretation of the labour theory of value and Baran and Sweezy’s Monopoly Capital. The article highlights how Napoleoni’s interpretation, which was at the time very unconventional, was later substantiated by the publication of new material by the two US economists (Sweezy in particular). The author concludes with some reflections of the applicability of Napoleoni’s ideas to the current stage of capitalism.
B24|Il capitale monopolistico di Baran e Sweezy e la teoria marxiana del valore (Monopoly Capital by Baran and Sweezy and Marx's Theory of Value)|The text is the transcript of a lecture given on 12 May 1973 by Claudio Napoleoni, as part of a course on Economic and financial policy at the University of Turin. The lecture, edited by Riccardo Bellofiore, concerns Baran and Sweezy’s Monopoly Capital and its relation to Marx’s theory of value.
B24|Crisi e centralizzazione del capitale finanziario (Crysis and Centralization of Financial Capital)|The possible nexus between economic crises and what Marx and Hilferding referred to as “centralisation” of capital is one of the themes raised by the “great recession”. The article reviews the main studies devoted to such a nexus, comparing the Marxist and mainstream economic literature. A double causal relation is analysed: both concerning the role of centralisation in feeding the contradictions of the capitalist system and its recurrent crises, and the impact of these crises on the very process of centralisation.
B24|Sylos Labini su Marx: implicazioni per la politica economica (Sylos Labini on Marx: economic policy implications)|This article considers Sylos Labini’s works on Marx (Sylos Labini, 1991; 1994). It places the Italian economist’s assessment of Marx in the context of the former’s wider economic production (both previous and subsequent to the 1991 article) and the debate that followed his “Carlo Marx: è tempo di un bilancio”. Such article, written right after the fall of Berlin’s Wall, attempted at developing a fair assessment of Marx’s thought, seen as one of the most important Classical economists and, from many points of view, a precursor of Keynes. Sylos Labini criticised Marx’s political position and what Sylos perceived as his “unethical behaviour”. On the contrary, he held Marx the economist in great regard.
B24|Causality and interdependence in Pasinetti’s works and in the modern classical approach|The formal representation of economic theories normally takes the shape of a model, that is, a system of equations which connect the endogenous variables with the values of the parameters which are taken as given. Sometimes, it is possible to identify one or more equations which are able to determine a subset of endogenous variables priory and independently of the other equations and of the value taken by the remaining variables of the system. The first group of equations and variables are thus said to causally determine the remaining variables. In Pasinetti’s works, this notion of causality has often been emphasized as a formal property having the burden of conveying a profound economic meaning. In this paper, we will go through those works of Pasinetti where the notion of causality plays a central role, with the purpose of contextualizing it within the econometric debate of the Sixties, enucleate its economic meaning, and show its connections with other fields of the modern classical approach.
B24|Engaging Geopolitical Economy|Two-volumes: This work advances geopolitical economy as a new approach to understanding the evolution of the capitalist world order and its twenty-first century form of multipolarity. It revives and redeploys the idea of uneven and combined development (UCD) as a way of uniting the understanding of domestic and international developments, and the struggles of classes and nations, into a single perspective as critical to this task. Geopolitical economy, as developed in VOLUME 30A, sheds light on the nature of contemporary international tensions as never before. VOLUME 30B then advances geopolitical economy as a new approach to the study of international relations and international political economy. Following upon the theoretical limitations exposed in Volume A, the analytical limitations are explored in this volume.
B24|Some Unsettled Issues in a Second Phase of the Cambridge-Cambridge Controversy|The aim of this paper is to clear up some issues in a second phase of the Cambridge-Cambridge capital theory controversies, when the neoclassical argument was chiefly conducted in terms of the Walrasian specification of capital in intertemporal and temporary general equilibrium models. It is held that the response by the neoclassical side in that phase has not been as satisfactory to rebut the implications of reswitching and capital reversing as some neoclassical scholars have argued. The reason for this can be traced in the overlooking of the implications of the redefinition of equilibrium implied in those models.
B24|Changing Distribution of Land and Assets in Indian Agriculture|Government reports in India indicate that big farms are losing land in terms of absolute area as well as percentage of land. To understand the nature of accumulation I estimate the distribution of assets of cultivator households and distribution of land of operational landholdings, and examine how they change over time. It is found that the top fifteen percentiles of holdings have lost land share, the bottom fifty percentiles have gained land share. The share of assets of top fifteen percentiles cultivator households has gone up, the bottom fifty percentiles has also gained assets share. Distribution of land and assets of fifteen major states has been estimated. The paper discusses the possible causes and implications of these observations.
B24|Specifics of Operational funding of enterprises under centrally planned economy ? theory and praxis in Czechoslovakia before 1989|This paper deals with the system of operational funding of enterprises in a centrally planned economy. The analysis focuses on the case of Czechoslovak Socialist Republic before 1989. A tool analyzed in the paper ? credits for constantly revolving working capital ? had played the main role in the planned Czechoslovak economic system. These credits for constantly revolving working capital can be described as specific frameworks for loans based on forecasts and plans of volume of production made by Czechoslovak state institutions. The system had created inefficiencies in the economy and its heritage seriously influenced processes in the period of transformation after 1989, as the paper concludes.
B24|Monopoly capital and capitalist inefficiency| This paper examines the arguments and assertions of Baran's and Sweezy's Monopoly Capital: An Essay on the American Economic and Social Order (1966) by assessing the degree of economic efficiency or inefficiency in how surplus value and economic surplus were created by 16 major capitalist economies during the 2000s using data envelopment analysis (DEA). After assigning a score to the degree of economic efficiency/inefficiency for each country, one can then assess which factors influence the degree of efficiency/inefficiency. This paper finds empirical support for many of the arguments put forth by the authors, Baran and Sweezy, as well as others regarding the inefficiency of the use of some forms of economic activity to help absorb economic surplus and to create surplus value.
B24|Credit, Indebtedness, and Speculation in the Marxian Paradigm: A Critical Analysis|This paper contends that, in Chapters XVII, XXIX, XXX, and XXXI of Volume III of Capital, Marx develops an incisive conceptual framework in which excessive credit creation, indebtedness, and speculation play a critical and growing role in the reproduction of social capital on an extended basis; however, given the decentralized and anarchic nature of capitalist production, the credit system does so in a highly erratic and contradictory manner which only postpones the inevitable day of reckoning. The paper also highlights Marx’s relatively neglected but highly important analysis of the separation of ownership from management in the advanced capitalism of his day, England, and its modern-day implications for excessive risk-taking and debt-fueled speculation up until the eve of the crash. More importantly, the paper argues that in Vols. II and III Marx implicitly connected the expanding role of credit [which he associated with the development of capitalism] to a significant reduction in the turnover period of capital, thereby boosting the rate of surplus-value, and countering in a highly erratic and contradictory manner, the fall in the rate of profit. The growing role of credit has been relatively ignored in the Marxian literature as an important counteracting factor to the law of the declining rate of profit. It is not mentioned at all by Marx in his famous Chp. XIV, Vol. III of Capital where he discusses other important counteracting forces, nor by Engels [in this particular context] who edited both Vols. II and III.
B24|Karl Marx on wage labour: From natural abstraction to formal subsumption|Marx develops two different theories of the employment relationship: in one it results from a contract for the sale of a commodity, in the other from a contract establishing a social relationship. According to the first, the worker sells a commodity, which is conceived as a flow of abstract labour springing from a stock of labour power. This commodity seems to be a ‘natural’ abstraction with the properties of a productive force. Exploitation occurs when the value of labour power is lower than the value-creating capacity of abstract labour. According to the second theory, the employment relationship is based on a transaction establishing the conditions for the worker’s subordination to the capitalist and the subsumption of his productive capacity under capital. This is an illuminating anticipation of the modern theory which considers the employment contract as an institution generating an authority relationship. It is not liable to criticisms of essentialism, hyposta-tization or naturalism and is able to sustain a consistent and realistic theory of exploitation, which explains it as being based on the power relationship the worker undergoes in the production pro-cess. Now abstract labour is seen not as a productive force, but as a social relationship, and is con-sidered an abstraction that is real in a socio-historical sense rather than in a natural sense
B24|Theories of finance and financial crisis – Lessons for the Great Recession|This paper presents an overview of different models which explain financial crises, with the aim of understanding economic developments during and possibly after the Great Recession. In the first part approaches based on efficient markets and rational expectations hypotheses are analyzed, which however do not give any explanation for the occurrence of financial crises and thus cannot suggest any remedies for the present situation. A broad range of theoretical approaches analyzing financial crises from a medium term perspective is then discussed. Within this group we focused on the insights of Marx, Schumpeter, Wicksell, Hayek, Fisher, Keynes, Minsky, and Kindleberger. Subsequently the contributions of the Regulation School, the approach of Social Structures of Accumulation and Post-Keynesian approach, which focus on long-term developments and regime shifts in capitalist development, are presented. International approaches to finance and financial crises are integrated into the analyses. We address the issue of relevance of all these theories for the present crisis and draw some policy implications. The paper has the aim to find out to which extent the different approaches are able to explain the Great Recession, what visions they develop about future development of capitalism and to which extent these different approaches can be synthesized.
B24|The Romanian identity as a mosaic of „good qualities and flaws”. Emic and Ethnical perspectives|The inter-war period of the last century has marked an effort of characterising the Romanian identity. The papers which have approached such a subject were plenty, the authors being mainly personalities of Romanian culture. Polemics did not miss the perspectives of approaching the issue were different, aspects which offered a plus of credibility to the field approached. The Romanians were presented as a mosaic of „good qualities and flaws”, the number of qualities and flaws depending from author to author, like the historical, psychological and sociological motivations involved.
B24|Dreams of order and freedom : debating trade management early 17th century England|The catharsis produced by the early 1620â€™s trade crisis had a significant impact on the way economic themes were regarded by public opinion in England. As a result, those who analyze the ideas put forward in the documents written during that period â€“ be they printed pamphlets or official memoranda â€“ are left with the impression that an adequate supply of money was the undisputed primary concern as regards economic administration. However, as already stressed by Barry Supple, monetary administration only occupied a prominent position in the political agenda of early 17th century England during times of crisis â€“ that is, when the kingdom was faced with a perceived threat of demonetization. This paper tries to show that, during the first two decades of the 17th century, concern with an inflow of bullion and a positive balance of trade was only of secondary importance, being normally overshadowed by a more fundamental aim: promoting a well-ordered structure for the economic relations of the kingdom, according to specific views of what constituted proper trade management. This approach encompassed both foreign and domestic activities, and found its most evident manifestation in the debates about free trade and monopolies which permeated the whole of James Iâ€™s reign.
B24|Legge del valore, legge dello scambio e problema della trasformazione: una nota|Marx’s analysis of the determination of the general rate of profit and of the associated relative prices is based on the conceptual distinction between law of value and law of exchange. The law of value states that simple, necessary abstract labour is the substance and measure of the value of commodities and is fundamental in the analysis of the social relations of the capitalist economy, i.e. for the analysis of the creation of surplus-value; it therefore represents the theoretical framework within which the problem of the distribution of surplus-value among the different capitals may be approached, i.e. the law of exchange must be taken into consideration. The analytical mistakes surrounding the marxian solution of the problem have given the way to the critics of the labour theory of value to question its relevance and coherence as a tool for the analysis of the capitalist mode of production. The aim of the present note is simply to show that it is possible to frame the relationship between law of value and law of exchange along marxian lines while determining in a coherent way the rate of profit and the corresponding relative prices of commodities in such a way that the proportionality between profits and surplus-labour is retained. Actually this is the main result of the “New Interpretation” of the marxian transformation problem which is obtained by defining the conservation of value in terms of the net product and not the gross one and the value of labour power in terms of generalized (or unallocated) purchasing power. This interpretation of the problem is therefore in contrast with the neoricardian one which is based on the refutation of the role of the law of value different from that of the determination of the relative prices of the commodities.
B24|Da MEGA à MEGA2: breve história da edição crítica das obras de Karl Marx|This paper discusses the attempts to publish a historical-critical edition of the works of Karl Marx, the Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe (MEGA): the first one, which was led by David Riazanov in the 1920's and 1930's, and the second one, the MEGA2 project which begun in the 1970's and is still in course of publication. The paper presents these two editions and discusses their impact on the interpretation of Marx's economic and philosophical thought.
B24|Capital circulation and the explanation of economic change by Marschak, Frisch and Leontief|We analyze a series of macroeconometric models developed in the years of high theory by Marschak, Frisch and Leontief. These models share an explanation of growth, cycles and fluctuations (“economic change”), based on the analysis of the circulation of capital goods among producers. They disaggregate the macroeconomic production function so as to introduce multiple producers and capital goods. We show that these models offer two main explanations of economic change: one is based on the spread of technological change through the producers’ exchanges network; the other is based on the coordination problems between producers in the capital circulation process.
B24|Credit, Indebtedness, and Speculation in the Marxian Paradigm: A Reassessment|This paper argues that, in Chapters XXIX and XXX of Volume III of Capital, Marx develops an incisive conceptual framework in which excessive credit creation, indebtedness, and speculation play a critical and growing role in the reproduction of social capital on an extended basis; however, given the decentralized and anarchic nature of capitalist production, it does so in a highly erratic and contradictory manner which only postpones the inevitable day of reckoning. The paper also draws important parallels between Marx's analysis of debt-fuelled crises and the events leading up to the subprime debacle of 2007-08. Finally, the paper contends that had Marx lived to re-write Vols. II and III, he would have explicitly connected the expanding role of credit [which he associated with the development of capitalism] to a significant reduction in the turnover period of capital, thereby boosting the rate of surplus-value, and countering in a highly erratic and contradictory manner, the fall in the rate of profit. The growing role of credit has been ignored in the Marxian literature as an important counteracting factor to the law of the declining rate of profit. It is not mentioned at all by Marx in his famous Chp. XIV, Vol. III of Capital where he discusses other important counteracting forces, nor by Engels [in this particular context] who edited both Vols. II and III.
B24|Globalizacija i investicije - put realizacije kapital-odnosa|Globalizacija temeljena na neoliberalistickim nacelima diktira manje razvijenim zemljama i ekonomsku i druge politike. Pojava nerazvijenosti, što se javlja u nacionalnim gospodarstvima manje razvijenih zemalja, postaje dominantna. Financijski, trgovacki i industrijski kapital je isprepleten u funkciji odnosa kapitala. Takvo stanje onemogucuje razvojne tendencije manje razvijenim zemljama. Rješenje se traži, i ponekad privremeno nalazi, u privlacenju stranih investicija, ali one su samo posjetitelji odnosne zemlje dok se ne pojave nove mogucnosti u nekoj drugoj zemlji. Kada multinacionalne korporacije odu iz odnosne zemlje, ostavljaju pustoš i vecu bijedu nego što je bila prije njihova dolaska. Gubitak nacionalne štednje povecava ovisnost manje razvijenih zemalja o interesima multinacionalnih korporacija koje imaju podršku vlastite nacionalne (razvijene) države. Internacionalizacija nacionalne štednje cini tu štednju instrumentom kapital-odnosa i cesto je koristi kako bi povecao svoju efikasnost, ali ne i efikasnost zemlje u kojoj je štednja ostvarena. Na temelju neoliberalnih nacela nije moguce pokrenuti razvoj manje razvijenih zemalja. Zaostajanje manje razvijenih zemalja, u vrijeme kada znanost postaje osnovna poluga razvoja, pogubna je za buducnost njihovih gracana.
B24|The struggle for legal reform after communism|"The working paper contains an extended review essay of Zdenĕk Kühn, ""The Judiciary in Central and Eastern Europe: Mechanical Jurisprudence in Transformation?"" (2011). The central thesis of the book is that 'there is a deep continuity in the methods of legal reasoning employed by lawyers in the region, starting in the era of Stalinist Communism, continuing through the era of late Communism of the 1970s and 1980s and up to the current post-communist period'. In this respect the book's analysis is retrospective, starting in the late nineteenth century, when the Central European legal culture emerged within the 'Austrian legal tradition'. It provides a rich analysis of legal thinking, institutional practices, and expert as well as public discourse concerning judges, courts and judicial process over the course of the whole of the twentieth century in the region. The book's central argument concerns our time, however. The continuity of Central European legal thinking is, according to Kühn, 'manifested in the problems of the first two decades after the collapse of Communism'. In this regard the book turns to the present and future of Central Europe and becomes missionary, offering a diagnosis together with a prescription. The cure lies, essentially, in catching up with the West and adopting its 'new European legal culture'. More concretely, Kühn argues empathically for the empowerment of the judiciary, which would in his view correspond to the development in the West throughout the second half of the last century. The result is rather ambiguous. On the one hand, the book is engaging and worth reading for anyone interested in post-communist Europe and its past. The book however serves as an interesting exhibit in the gallery of post-communist legal culture, rather than an accomplished study thereof. In what follows I will firstly introduce the book and then turn to its problematic features, which relate to the (still) prevailing discourse concerning post-communism in Europe."
B24|Nueva fase de desarrollo y determinantes de la acción estatal frente a la crisis del neoliberalismo: hacia una visión socioespacial|Este trabajo contribuye a la discusión orientada a superar las insuficiencias de la literatura sobre el Estado y su accionar en la reproducción y el desarrollo económico, a la luz de la emergencia de una nueva fase de desarrollo del capitalismo, o capitalismo del conocimiento, y de la actual crisis del neoliberalismo. En polémica con el institucionalismo –en tanto que referente teórico abarcador–, se aportan elementos para avanzar en la integración de las dimensiones política y económica de la teoría del Estado, en torno al concepto gramsciano de Estado ampliado. Con base en ello, se intenta adelantar en la integración de la dimensión espacial a partir de los aportes más avanzados de la corriente espacial-escalar, para finalmente aproximarse a los determinantes actuales de la acción estatal propios del capitalismo del conocimiento, particularmente desde la perspectiva de los países en desarrollo, determinantes que, al mismo tiempo, constituyen lineamientos de acción estatal de salida a la crisis.
B24|Finance and crisis: Marxian, institutionalist and circuitist approaches|Most mainstream neoclassical economists completely failed to anticipate the crisis which broke in 2007 and 2008. There is however a long tradition of economic analysis which emphasises how growth in a capitalist economy leads to an accumulation of tensions and results in periodic crises. This paper first reviews the work of Karl Marx who was one of the first writers to incorporate an analysis of periodic crisis in his analysis of capitalist accumulation. The paper then considers the approach of various subsequent Marxian writers, most of whom locate periodic cyclical crises within the framework of longer-term phases of capitalist development, the most recent of which is generally seen as having begun in the 1980s. The paper also looks at the analyses of Thorstein Veblen and Wesley Claire Mitchell, two US institutionalist economists who stressed the role of finance and its contribution to generating periodic crises, and the Italian Circuitist writers who stress the problematic challenge of ensuring that bank advances to productive enterprises can successfully be repaid.
B24|"Lange's 1938 model: dynamics and the ""optimum propensity to consume"""|" Oskar Lange's 1938 article ""The Rate of Interest and the Optimum Propensity to Consume"" is usually associated with the original IS-LM approach of the late 1930s. However, Lange's article was not only an attempt to illuminate Keynes's main innovations but the first part of a wide project that included the development of a theory of economic evolution. This paper aims at showing that Lange's article can help in illuminating critical aspects of this project: in particular, Lange's idea that a synthesis between Kaldor's and Kalecki's theories and that of Schumpeter, might have been possible and that it represented (in intentions) a ""modern"" and consistent reconstruction of the Marxist theory of the business cycle. Section 2 clarifies Lange's early reflection on dynamics. Section 3 centres on Lange's 1938 static model and indicates the effects of a change of saving on investment. Section 4 suggests a dynamic reconstruction from which are addressed important arguments raised by Lange in a series of papers written between 1934 and 1942."
B24|Continental Visions: Ann Seidman, Reginald H. Green, and the Economics of African Unity in 1960s Ghana|The paper presents the history of the contribution of two American economists to a radical cause: the establishment of a socialist and politically united Africa. The setting is 1960s Ghana which under Kwame Nkrumah, the man who led the country to independence from British colonial rule, emerged as the epicentre of this Pan-African vision. Ann Seidman and Reginald H. Green became, as members of the research team on ‘The Economics of African Unity’ established at the University of Ghana in 1963, the most sophisticated and systematic advocates of Nkrumah’s economic argument for continental planning and political union. The paper argues that Green and Seidman’s support for Pan- Africanism was rooted in an attempt to question radically the applicability of mainstream economic theory to African conditions, and find an alternative framework to conceptualise African trade, institutions and economic integration. Ultimately the vision associated with Nkrumah and economists like Green and Seidman failed to gain any significant political legitimacy and ended in 1966 with Nkrumah’s overthrow. Yet, it is argued that the story of the ‘economics of African unity’ is a useful departure point to deepen our understanding of the relationship between economics and political imagination in postcolonial Africa.
B24|The History Of Sociological Research On Occupations And Professions In The Ussr 1960-80s: Ideological Frameworks And Analytical Resources|The article analyzes of the content and context of research on occupations and professions in Soviet sociology from 1960 to the 1980s. It describes the key topics of observations of professional groups, gives definitions of occupations and professions in Soviet social sciences, and analyzes ideological and censorship restrictions for research and publishing. Sociology of occupations and professions as a separate disciplinary field appeared in Russia only in the late 1990s. Before this time, these topics were integrated into social structure and social stratification observations, research of the working class, intelligentsia, industrial sociology and sociology of organizations. From the 1960s Soviet sociologists searched for new explanatory models and they decided that socio-professional groups were the best criterion for a Soviet social structure description. During 1970-80s researchers of Soviet social structures debated about the place of professional groups. This article analyzes these and other features of sociology of occupations and professions in the USSR. The analysis is based on the bibliographical observations and interviews with Soviet sociologists. This project was supported by Science Foundation of NRU HSE.

B24|Credit, The Turnover of Capital, and the Law of the Falling Rate of Profit: A Critical Note|This paper argues that the total turnover period of capital, comprising both its time of production and circulation, has been almost totally ignored in the Marxian literature as an important counteracting factor to the law of the declining rate of profit. It is not mentioned at all by Marx in his famous Chapter XIV, Vol. III of Capital where he discusses other important counteracting forces, nor by Engels (in this particular context), who edited both Vols II and III of Capital. Moreover, this note contends that had Marx lived to re-write Vols II and III, he probably would have explicitly connected the expanding role of credit (associated with the development of capitalism) to a significant reduction in the turnover period of capital, thereby boosting the rate of surplus value, and countering, in an highly erratic, and contradictory manner, the fall in the rate of profit.
B24|El Papel de los Muertos en el Cerebro de los Vivos: Metáforas en las Revoluciones Francesas (1789-99, 1848-51, 1870-71), Iraní (1977-81) y Bolchevique (1917-1924)<BR>[The Role of the Dead in the Living Brain: Metaphors in French Revolutions French (1789-99, 1848-51, 1870-71), Iran (1977-1981) and Bolshevik (1917-1924)]|This paper work assesses the key aspects of a framework for research on revolutions. Our approach includes a heuristic based on an idea suggested by Marx in the 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte: “The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living”. From this maxim of Marx advance on conventional interpretations by postulating that the language and metaphors are a challenge in several respects: (1) The brain is a physical basis for understanding key political revolutions, (2) advances in neuroscience and language (Lakoff/Johnson/Narayanan) have allowed the reconstruction of conceptual frameworks in various fields, including philosophy, mathematics and politics (3) The language expressed in songs, text, flags, emblems, illustrations, slogans, speeches and rumors is key to represent and demonstrate loyalty to the idea of revolution and, more crucially, to “make” the revolution, (4) Metaphors are a powerful rational action in revolutionary processes. One interpretation of these can contribute to decipher, for example, how the brain are activated in neural systems that link past and present, how to operate the symbolic frameworks of language to influence political opinion, how metaphors interact with processes artificial simulation or how metaphors evolve in a revolution from simple metaphors.

Its aim integrates the debate theories of growth, income distribution, inequality and differences between the extremes income and income of the majority.

B24|Sraffa’s price equations in light of Garegnani and Pasinetti - The ‘core’ of surplus theories and the ‘natural’ relations of an economic system|Within the rich literature that has flowed from Sraffa’s framework of Production of Commodities by means of Commodities a prominent position is occupied by the research programmes carried out independently by two authoritative exponents of this school: Pierangelo Garegnani and Luigi Pasinetti. Certain specific features of their approaches might lead one to perceive them as alternative to one another. Yet, when analysed through a constructive perspective, one discovers not only a common origin and methodology, but also strict complementarity in analysing the main characteristics of industrial systems.
B24|Ludwig M. Lachmann Against the Cambridge School. Macroeconomics, Microfoundations, Expectations, Rate of Profit, Equilibrium and Innovations|While in the early 1930s Keynes and Hayek were the major figures in a heated academic debate about money and capital, in which Keynes also and especially involved the Italian Piero Sraffa, it might seem at first sight that the Austrian economist set aside an organic demolition of the ideas expressed in 1936 by his rival in the General Theory. But the ‘Austrian knight’ of a new Vienna-Cambridge debate, in the subsequent decades, was the German economist Ludwig M. Lachmann (1906-1990), a student of Hayek at LSE during the 1930s and later a professor in Johannesburg and New York. Lachmann was one of the protagonists of the Austrian revival after 1974 and the founding leader of the ‘hermeneutic stream’, opposed by the Rothbardian stream. Lachmann, defending Keynes’s subjectivism and expectation theory, revived the Vienna-Cambridge controversy, criticising not Keynes but his followers, in particular the ‘new’ Cambridge School, developed by Joan Robinson and Piero Sraffa.
B24|Two translators: Gramsci and Sraffa|Through the Prison Notebooks and the papers left by Sraffa, it is possible to attempt a reconstruction of the intellectual paths taken by the two authors and discover unexpected convergences, as well as obvious differences. The key concept employed here is that of the 'translatability of scientific languages'. From this concept, Boothman has argued, stems the ‘open’ character of Gramsci’s Marxism. The theme of the translatability of languages is also present in Sraffa: in a Note written after the important theoretical turning point of the summer of 1927, he states his intention to write a book that will consist in the translation of Marx into English, that is in the translation of the ‘metaphysics’ of Hegel into that of Hume. It can be shown that issues that have a prominent importance in Gramsci’s thought help us to understand the meaning and importance of Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities.
B24|The Invisible Foot|This article pays homage to E. K. Hunt who was a founding member of URPE who helped build chapters on several campuses in western states. Much of the authorâ€™s own research work over the past forty years was an attempt to strengthen criticisms Hunt voiced long ago about markets and blind spots in mainstream economic theory. The article reviews work inspired by Hunt regarding externalities, endogenous preferences, the Coase theorem, and an alternative to the market system known as participatory planning.
B24|On Marxâ€™s Law of the Falling Rate of Profit: Disentangling Some Entangled Variables|This paper argues that Marxâ€™s law of the falling rate of profit applies to the problematic of choice of technique in the context of accumulation of capital, and not to the problematic of choice of technique in the context of technological change or new innovation as such. In this context, Marxâ€™s â€œthe law itselfâ€ is correct. It is, however, true that Marx does confuse the two contexts at times; but here he seems to be following in the footsteps of Ricardo, who had also made an identical mistake.
B24|Простой русский инженер: социальные портреты субъектов труда в интерьере сибирских промышленных предприятий . Usual russian engineer: social portraits of subjects of work in the interior of the siberian industrial enterprises |На данных социологического обследования, проведенного на четырех сибирских предприятиях ОПК, осуществлена попытка построить типологию инженеров, отличающихся по типу, уровню и траекториям субъектности, которую можно представить в виде некоего континуума – транс-субъектности – от полного отсутствия субъекта труда до ярко выраженного его присутствия. Рассматривается проблема субъектности человека труда в связи с типом социальных структур предприятий (организаций). Автор полагает, что в современных древовидных, вертикально-иерархических структурах присутствует гипосубъектность работников, имеет место явление «смерти субъекта». Альтернативой выступает ризомная структура, позволяющая «воскресить» субъекта – продуктивного труженика, уменьшить его жесткую фиксацию в системе и придать его социальному действию нелинейный, процессуальный характер. Прослеживая эволюцию трактовок понятий «субъектность» и «субъект», автор приходит к выводу о том, что полноправного социального агента, актора, двигателя исторических и общественных процессов преждевременно списывать со счетов и что ему по-прежнему может принадлежать главная трансформирующая роль в контексте динамики современных социальных процессов. В данном исследовании эмпирическим объектом и референтом такого активного, действующего, самореферентного социального агента, способного противостоять властным дискурсам, а также давлению капитала и господствующим социальным этическим машинам, являются инженерно-технические работники современных российских промышленных предприятий. Актуальность в изучении данной социальной группы работников обусловлена, по мнению автора, необходимостью активизации наиболее креативной части тружеников отечественной промышленности как основного социального капитала производящей экономики, воссоздание и укрепление которой видится сегодня чрезвычайно важной. At the base of sociological case study done at four Siberian enterprises of military-industrial complex was made a test to construct a typology of workers that vary for different types and trajectories or strategies of subjectivity and can be viewed as kind of continuum – trans-subjectivity – which is characterized by the absence of the subject or by its full manifestation. The relations between phenomenon of subjectivity of the workers and type of social structures of enterprises (organizations) is the problem viewed in this article. The author supposes that in the modern tree-vertical-hierarchical structures dominates hypo-subjectivity of workers – phenomenon of the «death of the subject». An alternative is the rhizome structure which allows to «resurrect» the subject – productive worker and to reduce its firmly fixation in the system and to make his social action non-linear. At the base of sociological case study done at four Siberian enterprises of military-industrial complex was made a test to construct a typology of workers that vary for different types of subjectivity. Checking the evolution of interpretations of the concepts of «subjectivity» and «subject», the author concludes that a full-fledged social agent, the actor, the engine of historical and social processes is premature to write off, and that he may still have the main role in the context of transforming dynamics of contemporary social processes. Empirical referent of study and such an active acting, self-referential social agent capable of withstanding discourses of the power, as well as the pressure of capital and the prevailing social ethic machines are engineering and technical personnel of modern Russian industrial enterprises. Relevance in the study of the social stratum of workers due to the author's opinion, the need to enhance the most creative group of workers of the domestic industry, as the main social capital of productive economy, rebuilding and strengthening of which is seen today is extremely important.
B24|Necessary prices and necessary income distribution in classical political economy. A bridge with the notions ‘just’ prices and ‘just’ wage|Production prices are those exchange-values which, if adopted, put each industry in the conditions to repeat its production process. In this sense they appear as necessary prices. This notion is here compared with that of ‘just’ price, studied by the older moral philosophers (more so than by economists). Production prices appear thus as that concept that comes closer to the notion of just price. On similar grounds, some recent results, which have emerged within the classical and post-Keynesian approaches, have been employed here to envisage the elements that characterize a ‘necessary’ income distribution configuration and a ‘necessary’ level of the rate of interest.

En el presente ensayose muestra que este diagnóstico es equivocado, dado que se tergiversa el contenidode la teoría del valor clásica (una teoría del intercambio y no una macroeconomía),no ayuda a percibir la originalidad de la teoría del valor de Marx (un enfoquemonetario y no uno real) y malinterpreta la solución de Sraffa contenida en sumercancía patrón.

Para tal propósito se llevará a cabo una revisión de literatura que partirá de las influencias de los clásicos y Marx en la economía del desarrollo. Asimismo, se rescatarán las aportaciones de varias de las figuras destacadas de cada escuela, con el fin de ir hilando las conexiones teóricas entre ambos enfoques de la economía del desarrollo. Además, se incidirá en el concepto de desarrollo, el origen del subdesarrollo de la periferia, las barreras hacia el desarrollo y las estrategias de desarrollo defendidas por estructuralistas y neomarxistas.
B24|"Decentralization and veiled corruption under China's ""rule of mandates"""|This paper shows why corruption is especially difficult to detect under China’s system of decentralized authoritarian rule, which I call a “rule of mandates.” Local officials must pursue high priority political targets but have immense discretion over which laws to implement. A relative standard for corruption consequently arises since non-implementation of laws may be mandate-serving or may be corrupt; and determining which requires extra information on why non-implementation occurred. The theory is supported by evidence from original survey and case research on the implementation of the village elections law. I discuss implications for anticorruption efforts, development patterns, and future research.
B24|Why do pluralistic media systems emerge? Comparing media change in the Czech Republic and in Russia after the collapse of Communism|A quarter century after the collapse of Communism in the former Eastern bloc, a wide range of scholarly projects have been undertaken to compare and theorize processes of media change in the region. One question that scholars have sought to address is: what were the factors that crucially impacted how these media landscapes evolved? This essay aims to contribute to this debate by juxtaposing media change in two selected cases: the Czech Republic (as a best-case scenario in terms of convergence with the Western model) and Russia (as a scenario where convergence has been limited). Based on secondary analysis of a wide range of sources, the essay systematically exposes 11 crucial differences between the two countries and illustrates how these have impacted the processes of media change. The conclusion sets out how these findings could serve as a starting point and source of inspiration for future comparative research.
B24|Is there room for bulls, bears and States in the circuit?|The central focus of this book is the relationship between money, the sphere of production, and the State. It explores how best to adapt the fundamental ideas of the circulationist perspective to achieve a better understanding of the financialisation of the production processes within contemporary capitalist economies. Importantly, the expert contributors illustrate that the true challenge ahead is to address how these new emerging forms can be eventually tamed, a challenge that the recent financial crisis has forcefully proven essential.
B24|The fate of social sciences in Soviet Russia: the case of Isaak Il’ich Rubin|Research within the history of economic thought has focused only little on the development of economics under dictatorship. This paper attempts to show how a country with a relatively large and internationally established community of social scientists in the 1920s, the Soviet Union, was subjected to repression. We tell this story through the case of Isaak Il’ich Rubin, a prominent Russian economist and historian of economic thought, who in the late 1920s was denounced by rival scholars and repressed by the political system. By focusing not only on his life and work, but also that of his opponents and institutional clashes, we show how the decline of a social science tradition in Russia and the USSR emerged as a process over time. We analyze the complex interplay of ideas, scholars and their institutional context, and conclude that subsequent repression was arbitrary, suggesting that no clear survival or career strategy existed in the Stalinist system due to a situation of fundamental uncertainty. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how the Stalinization of Soviet social sciences occurred as a process over time.
B24|The Oomph in economic philosophy: a bibliometric analysis of the main trends, from the 1960s to the present|In this essay, I quantitatively analyze the significance of scholarship in economic philosophy since the 1960s. In order to do so, I examine, through the number of publications and citations, the evolution of the main trends in economic philosophy over a fifty years period. This paper will develop a better conception of how the pathways of major debates, in particular rhetoric of economics (RoE) versus realism in economics (RiE), helped economic philosophy achieve its present status in economics. Viewed through this lens, it is clear that the main trends in the recent history of the discipline have emerged out of the concerns of non-mainstream economists since the 1980s.
B24|Capital's Pons Asinorum: the Rate of Turnover in Karl Marx's Analysis of Capitalist Valorisation|This article aims to shed light on the role played by the ‘rate of turnover’ of capital within the Marxian analysis of the working laws of capitalism. Oddly enough, that concept has been neglected by the most part of Karl Marx’s scholars and exegetes, as is demonstrated proved by the small number of scientific works dealing with it. Yet, the rate of turnover plays a crucial role in Marx’s economic thought, since it allows Marx to address the impact of the improvement in finance, transportation and means of communication on the capitalist process of creation (and realization) of surplus-value. As we are going to show, the new manuscripts from the MEGA2 philological edition of Marx’s writings may provide some useful insights. Against this background, the goal of the paper is twofold: first, to bridge the gap in the literature concerning the economic thought of Marx; second, to provide a rigorous (and general) definition of the notion of the ‘rate of turnover’ of capital. This will also allow us: to redefine the concept of the ‘annual rate of profit’; to define a new linked concept – that is, the ‘temporal composition of capital’; and to add a further element in the debate on the counter-tendencies to the law of the tendential fall in the general rate of profit.
B24|The Money of the Mind and the God of Commodities – The real abstraction according to Sohn-Rethel|According to Sohn-Rethel there is a “secret identity” between commodity form and thought form. Commodity exchange is a real abstraction – embodied in money – and constitutes a social a priori which reflects itself in the conceptual abstraction, i.e., in the abstract thought typical of commodity-producing societies: philosophy (in ancient Greece) and modern science (in capitalism). However, the theory of Sohn-Rethel has a fundamental flaw: its exclusive identification of the real abstraction with the sphere of circulation results in the ontologization of labor which, on the contrary, is a capitalist specificity and the original source of the abstraction in this society.
B24|Hilferding over Marx: A Political Economy Viewpoint of Struggles in the Left 1900-1933 and the Modern Revival|Abstract: Recent heterodox economic literature makes reference to Hilferding’s “Finance Capital” and Lenin’s “Imperialism” as early insights on the phenomenon of Financialization of capital. In this regard ideas which became dominant in the left during the first decades of the previous century are applied in the explanation of the current crisis, as well as the understanding of contemporary capitalism from a methodological, analytical and political standpoint. This paper traces the underlying argument of the Monopoly model and its main political applications in the first three decades of the 20th century, in an effort to draw rough historical analogies with its revival in contemporary literature. It is argued that the Hilferding model, from which Lenin’s ”Imperialism” is derived, has very little or nothing to do with Marx’s economics but much to do with the neoclassical theory of Monopoly and Oligopoly. This theoretical association abolishes labor value theory from the analytical framework and with it any possibility of inherent breakdown (depression) in capitalist accumulation. Consequently political economy was pushed to the background and the confrontations between Lenin and Kautsky and subsequently Trotsky, Bukharin and Stalin were fought around political and geopolitical considerations a factor which played important part in the outcome. But the most astonishing historical fact is that the revolutionary flood which shook Europe until 1930 gave place to the dominance of the extreme right when circumstances were most favorable for the left in the years of the “great depression”. Drawing from this it is argued further that the main analogy between the 1930s’ and the present is that both back then and now the left is attempting to intervene in a depression environment without a depression theory. Disproportional growth between sectors was the cause of crisis in Hilferding, a contradiction which under the dominance of “Finance Capital” would be resolved and capitalism would move to an “organized stage”. In the same fashion disproportional growth of the financial sector relative to the corporate sector, which emerged following the “great stagflation”, is the cause of the present crisis for contemporary heterodox literature. Crisis can be resolved through state regulation in this line of thought, since Financialization of capital is understood independently from the inherent contradictions of profit motivated growth. In the absence of a depression theory this part of heterodox economics has drifted in a “witch hunt” on whether capital will resolve the crisis introducing a new era of “regulated capitalism” or power shifts in favor of financial capital will preserve the present state of affairs. In the meantime, economic policy suggestions and the political agenda is surrendered in the hands of mainstream economics and right wing politics.
B24|Causality and interdependence in Pasinetti's works and in the modern classical approach|The formal representation of economic theories normally takes the form of a model, that is, a system of equations which connect the endogenous variables with the values of the parameters which are taken as given. Sometimes, it is possible to identify one or more equations which are able to determine a subset of endogenous variables priorly and independently of the other equations and of the value taken by the remaining variables of the system. The first group of equations and variables are thus said to determine causally the remaining variables. In Pasinetti’s works this notion of causality has often been emphasized as a formal property having the burden to convey some deep economic meaning. In this work, we will go through those Pasinetti’s works where this notion of causality plays a central role, with the purpose to contextualize it within the econometric debate of the Sixties, to enucleate its economic meaning and to show its connections with other fields of the modern classical approach.
B24|The ‘new golden age of accumulation’, the new depression and the greek economy|The purpose of this paper is to delve into the deeper causes of the current crisis and its detailed manifestation in the case of the Greek economy. The major argument of the paper is that the root cause of the crisis is fundamentally identified in the declining profitability which past a point leads to a stagnant mass of real net profits thereby discouraging investment spending and leading to rising unemployment. In the case of the Greek economy, this crisis of profitability has been aggravated by the contraction of its major productive activities, that is, manufacturing and agriculture. The contraction of these activities not only worsened the crisis but furthermore paved the way for the development of different forms of its expression; that is, mounting debt and unprecedented high rates of unemployment bringing the whole society into a stalemate.
B24|La Direction centrale de la statistique et la Balance de l’économie nationale de l’URSS en 1923—24<BR>[The Central Statistical Administration and the Balance of the National Economy of the USSR, 1923—24]|In 1918 the Central Statistical Administration (TsSU) was founded with the support of Lenin. Pavel Illich Popov was its first director (1918-1926). TsSU proceeded to the merging and centralization of the former decentralized statistical system of the zemstva (local governments) inherited from Tsarist regime. Between 1918 and 1928, i.e. during the civil war and the NEP, TsSU was at the heart of Soviet Statistics but it came to be controlled and eventually absorbed by Gosplan afterwards. At the TsSU Popov defended his view of social statistics as being a device for the revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat in the political sphere while resting on strong scientific foundations in accordance with international standards. Rooted in Russian statisticians’ tradition, the objectivity and scientific nature of the works issued by the TsSU was Popov’s credo. In 1926, Popov exposed his views in a collective book he edited and published by the TsSU, The Balance of the National Economy of the USSR, 1923―24. In The Balance was exposed for the first time the modern principles of national accounting and intersectoral macroeconometric analysis. According to Popov, these were the relevant devices for social engineering in the NEP. Against “utopian” authors, Popov stressed the importance of founding social engineering and planning on economic theory and political economy. He thus explained how his statistical balance was an outgrowth of Quesnay’s Tableau économique and Marx’s schema of reproduction. Our article aims at examining Popov’s specific contribution as well as identifying its stakes and its significance in the economic debates during the 1920s.

B24|El aporte del pensamiento de Karl Polanyi a la cuestión ambiental|Gran parte de la literatura referida a la historia del pensamiento económico y al vínculo específico entre economía y naturaleza, traza un recorrido histórico que va desde las primeras discusiones entre las escuelas precursoras de la economía moderna, los economistas clásicos y algunos críticos no economistas -provenientes de las ciencias naturales y actualmente postulados como precursores de la economía ecológica-, para luego arribar a la contemporánea discusión entre economistas ambientales de raíz neoclásica y los denominados economistas ecológicos. Sin embargo, hasta el momento son contados autores los que destacan el rol de la obra de Karl Polanyi en ese recorrido. El objetivo de este trabajo es resaltar que el pensamiento de Karl Polanyi es notablemente provechoso a la hora de pensar el vínculo entre sociedad, economía y naturaleza. Recuperar la obra de Polanyi, la idea de economía como proceso institucionalizado, su alegato inapelable contra la posibilidad de una economía autoregulada por el mercado, la potencialidad destructora de las mercancías ficticias y el peligro de la economía desincrustada, puede resultar de gran utilidad en el análisis de la actual crisis ecológica y sobre todo en la necesidad de constituir una democracia global que afronte estos problemas.
B24|Reconceptualizing Capitalism|This paper analyzes the nature of capitalism by critically employing Marxâ€™s comments in Capital on forms of subsumption of labor. It argues that to the extent that property owners employ wage laborers to produce for the market for a profit, they are capitalist, even if they may not reinvest their profit in technology. In this situation, wage-labor is formally subsumed under capital. The transition from this stage to real subsumption of labor, which signifies capitalist development with technological change, is not, however, automatic, as Marx tended to assume. It is mediated by class struggle, which occurs in the context of geographically varying factors, such as state interventions. Uneven development, seen as the uneven transition to real subsumption, is partly a product of place-specific outcomes of class struggle. The paper thus emphasizes the relation between class struggle and dynamics of capitalism including technological change. The conceptual arguments are illustrated with empirical evidence from India. The implications of the arguments for radical development theory and politics are also briefly explored.JEL classification: P16, O53, O14, B24
B24|The specificity of manufacturing in Marx's economic thought| This article examines Marx's approach to manufacturing and the extent to which manufacturing could be considered to have a special place in Marx's economic thought, especially in relation to accumulation and growth. The important 'progressive' features of manufacturing that can be found in Marx's writings and which are discussed here include: division of labour; socialisation of labour; mechanisation; increasing returns to scale; learning-by-doing; technological advancement; and overall, superior potential for cumulative productivity increases. These insights anticipate some of the thinking around the specificity of manufacturing found in twentieth-century structuralist development economics and some heterodox schools of thought such as Kaldorian approaches. This article suggests an interpretation of Marx as having a two-dimensional conceptualisation of activity specificity, with not only sectoral but also 'technological--organisational' dimensions, where these two dimensions are not fully independent of each other.
B24|Electronic Resources and Heterodox Economics| The idea of measuring scientific relevance by counting citations is gaining influence among economists, and thanks to the electronic bibliographic resources now available the procedure has become relatively simple and fast. However, when it comes to putting the idea into practice many problems emerge. This paper uses four of the principal bibliographic electronic resources (EconLit, JSTOR, Web of Science and Scopus) to test the practical applicability of this method to the case of the five theoretical schools classified as 'Current Heterodox Approaches' in JEL code B5.
B24|Karl Marx: Herakles oder Sisyphos?Eine philosophische und ökonomische Untersuchung|Die Diskussion um Karl Marx ist lange Zeit nur ideologisch positionell geführt worden. Wer sich nicht als Gegner oder Befürworter der Marxschen Lehre erklärte, hatte es schwer, in dieser Diskussion Gehör zu finden. Im letzten Viertel des vorigen Jahrhunderts hat jedoch sowohl in philosophischer als auch wirtschaftswissenschaftlicher Hinsicht eine neue Art der Auseinandersetzung mit den Werken von Karl Marx begonnen. Dabei haben die Kontrahenten sowohl auf marxistischer als auch auf nichtmarxistischer Seite viel ideologischen Ballast beiseite geräumt, und in manchen Positionen hat man sich auch in inhaltlicher Hinsicht angenähert. Trotzdem ist die Diskussion in einem wichtigen Aspekt fragmentarisch geblieben. Auch wenn marxistische und nichtmarxistische Ökonomen nun eine gemeinsame Sprache gefunden haben, so gilt das weit weniger für Philosophen und Ökonomen. Charakteristischerweise zeigt sich das an der Rolle Hegels. Während viele Philosophen dazu neigen, Marx von Hegel her zu verstehen, tendieren Ökonomen und auch der Ökonomik nahestehende Philosophen dazu, Hegel zu vernachlässigen oder ihm allenfalls eine verwirrende oder störende Rolle im Marxschen Denken zuzugestehen. In unserem Essay wollen wir daher herausarbeiten, dass der Bezug zu Hegel und zu der Tradition der Philosophie überhaupt ein konstitutiver Bestandteil der Marxschen Theorie und gerade auch ihres ökonomischen Teils ist. Dabei versuchen wir nichts weniger als eine Gesamteinschätzung der Marxschen Lehre und ihrer oft verwirrenden Vielschichtigkeit zu geben. Im Einzelnen werden wir auf Marx’ Hegelbezug und den historischen Materialismus mit seinen Grundbegriffen, den Produktivkräften und Produktionsverhältnissen eingehen. Von daher werden wir eine Einschätzung von Marx’ Analyse der kapitalistischen Produktionsweise geben und dabei versuchen, ihre qualitativen und quantitativen Aspekte gesondert herauszuarbeiten. Zentrale Aussagen der Marxschen Ökonomik wie die Arbeitswertlehre und das Gesetz vom tendenziellen Fall der Profitrate werden wir im Licht der modernen Wirtschaftswissenschaften diskutieren. Dabei werden auch wichtige Einsichten von Marx hinsichtlich der Umwelt- und Rohstoffprobleme, vor denen wir heute stehen, zur Sprache kommen. Nicht zuletzt gehen wir auf die Konsequenzen ein, die sich aus Marx’ Ansatz für das Problem der Gerechtigkeit und der Einkommensverteilung ergeben. Und schließlich wollen wir erklären, woher bei Marx das notorische Defizit einer politischen Theorie rührt.
B24|Resquicios de materialismo histórico en la historia económica española|Este artículo hace un repaso de la influencia del materialismo histórico en la historia económica mediante el estudio del caso español. Un análisis de oferta y demanda de ideas muestra que durante las décadas de 1960 y 1970 hubo un florecimiento del marxismo y el materialismo histórico. Durante el decenio de 1980 este enfoque seguía siendo importante; sin embargo, durante los años 1990, las escuelas de historia trataron de parecer neutrales y quisieron relegar el marxismo. En cualquier caso, a pesar del rechazo teórico a esta tendencia historiográfica --expresamente residual--, ésta sigue influyendo en la historia económica y se encuentra implícitamente en el corazón de muchas investigaciones que no se consideran marxistas.

B24|El tiempo, el éter que lo cubre todo : un análisis de la temporalidad en la economía política de Karl Marx|Resumen: Desde joven Marx descubrió que el tiempo era central en la comprensión y análisis tanto de la vida individual como colectiva, por ello quiso introducir en toda su obra, de forma recurrente y crítica, la temporalidad como elemento fundamental para analizar los fenómenos económicos, políticos y sociales. El artículo presenta tres modos como Marx utilizó el tiempo en sus análisis de la economía política: como unidad de medida del valor en el plano abstracto, como forma de dividir en el plano real el tiempo de trabajo y el tiempo libre del obrero y como elemento de análisis del tiempo cíclico del capital industrial (tiempo de producción y tiempo de circulación). Abstract : Since young Marx discovered that time was central to the understanding and analysis of both individual and collective life. For this reason, he wanted to introduce temporality in a recurring and critical manner throughout his work, as a key to analyze economic, political and social phenomena. This paper presents three ways in which Marx used time in their analysis of the political economy: as a unit of measure of value in an abstract sense, as a way of dividing laborer’s work time and leisure time in a real sense, and as an element of analysis of the cyclical time of industrial capital (production time and circulation time).
B24|Competition in Maurice Allais’ works|Competition is a keyword in the works of Maurice Allais. From analytical point of view, competition, as differentiated sector with multiple enterprises under perfect competition, coexist with a non-differentiated sector with single nationalized company. Moreover, competition is not spontaneous but organized by law. Planning competition allows for a balance between market’s forces and state’s regulation. From doctrinal point of view, competition is an alternative to laissez-faire and central planning. The works of Maurice Allais are presented in the intellectual context of his time (Lippmann, International Center for Renovation of Liberalism). In the footsteps of Walter Lippmann and Louis Rougier, Maurice Allais lays the foundations of a new economic liberalism based on competition rather than on private property (Jacques Rueff ).

B24|Bento de Jesus Caraça e a Integração Europeia|Bento de Jesus Caraça was a prominent figure in the Portuguese society in the interwar and post-world war II period. His public intervention had a political dimension that embraces a doctrinal reflection on Europe, namely concerning the relations between Portugal and Europe, taking the latter as a cultural, not a political entity. In this context, he was a critic to the different projects of European integration, which came about in this period, including those designed by the left intellectual and political circles. Despite being a Marxists with great interpretative originality, his position on European integration topics stood close to Comintern’s.
B24|Historical demography in Hungary: A history of Research|In sketching an outline of historical demography in Hungary, two successive periods can and must be considered in relation to two territories. One of these lasts from the Middle Ages to the end of the First World War; this is the historical Kingdom of Hungary, namely the whole area of the Carpathian Basin, and the greater part of today’s Croatia. This territorial approach has two advantages and two minor disadvantages. Its most important advantage is that it seems to be congruent with the geographical area in which the relevant social and demographic processes took place from the Middle Ages to the early twentieth century, and to which the integrated sources refer. In addition, demographic research within this framework (and this is the second advantage) makes the region a kind of laboratory of demographic analysis, since it offers a wider range of comparisons compared to other European countries owing to the great cultural, economic and geographical variety of the Carpathian Basin. Related to this are disadvantages, though these are far less important from a professional point of view. These arise from the fact that nowadays sources are spread across archives held in seven different countries, and from the fact that scientific publications and documents written over the last 80 to 90 years are written in several different languages; indeed, Latin, German and Hungarian, which were necessary for understanding earlier sources, may no longer be sufficient. The second territory and period to be investigated by historical demography in Hungary is the one that has existed from 1920 to the present day. Demographic processes since then have (to much of an extent) taken place within this territory, and sources suitable for the reconstitution of these are also created following the administrative structure of this area. From what has been said so far, it can be clearly inferred that a basic question for Hungarian historical demographic research is the chronological framework used for its analysis. The development of the population in Hungary can be divided into three basic periods. The first division line is demarcated by the acceleration of the disintegration of the traditional demographic system and the beginning of the demographic transition which took place around the 1870s.2 Naturally, these division lines are flexible. In the economically and socially underdeveloped peripheries – especially in the mountainous regions of the Carpathians – and in the social groups abandoning their old social and demographic patterns more slowly (for example gypsy communities) this turning point slips to a later date.

B24|Is the Falling Rate of Profit the Driving Force Behind Globalization?|This paper examines critically the role of the law of the tendency of the falling rate of profit in the geographic expansion (globalization) of competitive capitalism. It contends that Marx did not believe there was an iron-clad connection between the falling rate of profit and globalization; in addition, it argues that Marx believed that the capitalists’ insatiable search for colonial markets was driven by their desire to overcome recurrent (and growing) realization problems in the home market arising from deficient aggregate demand on the part of both workers and capitalists.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B24|Heterodox Economics – A Dynamic Phenomenon|All that has been proven to be thorough from the previous strains of thought has been continuously polished and integrated in what we call the dominant economic theory. Yet, there have been countless debates and contradictions regarding the economic ideas in mainstream (which includes classical and neoclassical economics and Keynesianism), the majority of the opponents arguing that these do not offer sufficient explanations for the understanding or anticipating macroeconomic phenomena and also, do not solve the problem of major differences between social classes. The most impetuous objections regarding the above have led to the appearance of different strains of economic thought, philosophies and theories that have merged under the umbrella of heterodox economics, a reactive movement, which denies the validity and viability of the ideas within the dominant economic theory.
B24|Marxian-Radical Economics. A Heterodox Approach|Marxism emerged from the confrontation between the German philosophy, classic English economics and the French socialism. It was a philosophy, a scientific method, a new vision of economics, an economic policy and an economic system alike. The Marxian economic strain of thought was assimilated not only by its advocates, but also by the critics of this radical current: in defence of capitalism, Keynes and Schumpeter both start from Marx’s work. Starting from the work of classic economists, Marx assumes the valuable scientific elements from the dominant economic theory, but emphasizes the historical, gnosiological and class limits of the classic doctrine. Although he uses the instruments provided by the classics, the German scientist defines his own personal notional system and comes to excel in terms of abstraction. Operating with his own concepts, Marx builds up an infallible logic, which is impossible to turn over if one does not infirm the starting point of the analysis itself – the labour theory of value.

In this first set the economic and social history of the United States is shown to be a “system of movement,” i.e. a logical and mathematic progression of events which may be analyzed according to a set formula. The model proposed demonstrates that the citizen’s individual “consciousness” is writ large in the macro-economic statistics of this unique economy and thereby made available for inspection at other levels of reality.
B24|The Profit Rate in the Presence of Financial Markets: a Necessary Correction|This is a prepublication version of the article by the same name in the Journal of Australian Political Economy. It should be cited as “Freeman, A. 2012 'The Profit Rate in the Presence of Financial Markets: a Necessary Correction'. Journal of Australian Political Economy, Number 70, Summer 2012, pp 167-192” In the past two decades the number, variety, and monetary value of marketable financial instruments have grown by orders of magnitude. While traditional equities have certainly grown in number and value, the greatest growth has taken place in securities since the turn to securitized lending in the 1970s. This is probably the single most significant development in what many writers term ‘financialisation’. This article argues that these assets, when they function as money-capital, enter into the equalization of the rate of profit. They constitute part of the capital advanced by the capitalist class as a whole and should therefore be included in the denominator of the rate of profit. In the two main world financial markets at least – the UK and the US - The resulting measures of the rate of profit reveal a general, systematic and virtually uninterrupted decline in the rate of profit in these countries since the late 1960s. The paper then re-examines the definition of the rate of profit found in Marx’s writings on the subject and argues that it confirms the inclusion of financial instruments in both the concept and measure of the general rate of profit as defined by Marx.

B24|Revisiting the socialist calculation debate: the role of markets and finance in Hayek’s response to Lange’s challenge|In the early twentieth century, a range of writers produced visions of a socialist economy whose distinguishing characteristic was an allocation of resources using a ‘technical’ perspective. In the 1930s, Oskar Lange took up the challenge of Ludwig von Mises’ claim of the ‘impossibility’ of constructing a socialist economy on such an engineering basis. He readily acceded to the need for efficiency calculations to be made in value terms rather than using purely natural or engineering criteria, but claimed that these values could emerge without a market for capital goods, and without private ownership of capital. Friedrich Hayek replied stressing the dynamic aspects of competition in the context of the capital market; the latter is to be seen as a discovery procedure wherein production possibilities must not be taken for granted. Thus, socialist calculation is impossible because of the absence of those markets for capital and risk that evaluate the success or failure of different investment decisions under capitalism. Appraising this debate, we emerge with two findings. First, Lange's contribution was based on a one-sided, static conception of the capitalist economy, and therefore of the construction of a socialist alternative. Second, the Austrian approach only surreptitiously concedes the key role of finance in its defence of the dynamic properties of capitalism. And yet it is the very gyrations and instability emerging from the financial sector in capitalism that was one of the central factors motivating the search for an alternative engineering method of allocation in the first place. The latter point invites us to reconsider the place of finance in various schools of economics in mainstream thinking.
B24|Michal Kalecki and Rosa Luxemburg on Marx’s schemes of reproduction: two incisive interpreters of capitalism|Both Rosa Luxemburg and Michal Kalecki utilised Marx’s scheme’s or reproduction as the starting point of their analysis of economic dynamics. However, Luxemburg did not realise that they were not meant to serve as models of capitalist growth, but rather to show that the conditions for stable growth were unachievable. Luxemburg was an early proponent of the stagnationist thesis which was popularised by Kalecki, Steindl, Baran and Sweezy. She argued that capitalist economies were doomed to stagnate unless markets outside the capitalist arena could be utilised, although she also acknowledged the importance of government expenditure on armaments. Kalecki, while acknowledging some of the limitations of her analysis, was able to extend it to incorporate the main elements of modern capitalist growth.
B24|Harmonic and Conflict Views in International Economic Relations: a Sraffian view|Research on the recent European financial crisis has prompted exploration of the harmonic and disharmonic views of international economic relations. The former, more liberal view is based on the Ricardian and Neoclassical trade theories. The latter is derived from pre-Smithian mercantilist conflict views of international trade. Here we investigated the contribution that Sraffian theory can offer the latter stream of thought. This contribution cannot be underestimated since it provides a rigorous analytical rebuttal of the Neoclassical theory of international trade and capital flows and supports the existence of absolute advantages, which are a source of potential trade conflict between nations. Kaleckian theory may also vindicate mercantilist attention to trade surplus. A disharmonic view of the international economic relations also springs from Political Realism, a major tradition in political science. Mercantilism and Political Realism converge in International Political Economy (IPE), a field that arose in the early 1970s as an attempt to bridge the gap between the disciplines of international economics and international relations. The nationstate is at the centre of Mercantilism and IPE. The Classical and Marxist approaches are not on easy terms with the notion of nation-state, so that it was also impossible to avoid this topic. This paper is a preliminary exploration of the complementarity of the Classical conflict view of income distribution and the disharmonic traditions of IER in opposition to the harmonic beliefs of economic and political liberalism

Un enfoque desde la teoría laboral del valor|Este artículo analiza la dinámica del crecimiento económico a partir de lo que se denomina como eficiencia productiva de la inversión, la cual relaciona el ratio capital-trabajo, expresión de la mecanización, con la productividad laboral. Partiendo de la hipótesis de que existe una tendencia a su descenso, lo que trae consigo una caída de la productividad del capital, se muestran las implicaciones sobre el proceso de crecimiento económico desde los fundamentos de la teoría laboral del valor. El marco analítico sustenta que la inversión obedece al propósito de aumentar el beneficio relativo, para lo cual debe reducir los costes mediante un aumento superior de la productividad respecto de los salarios. En consecuencia, se justifican los límites del crecimiento a partir de la influencia de la tasa de ganancia sobre la inversión.
B24|Money in the Grundrisse|The chapter on Money in the Grundrisse shows clearly that the presentation of the nature, properties and functions of money is opposed to the monetary theory of Utopian socialism. Marx emphasizes easily that the exchange value spontaneously objectifies itself in a money distinct from the commodity, but he needs to establish that the distribution of labour activities is mediated by the exchange of labour products under commodity mode of production, to make appear the confusion at the core of the Proudhonians’ reform between exchange of living labour and exchange of labour products and then, the necessity that money embodies itself in a specific commodity.
B24|Education, Growth And Distribution: Classical-Marxian Economic Thought And A Simple Model|This paper examines the interaction between education, growth and distribution from a classical-Marxian perspective. It first briefly examines classical-Marxian ideas on the relation between education and growth and income distribution. Drawing on these ideas to the extent that they are relevant for contemporary capitalist economies, it then develops a simple dynamic model of growth and distribution to analyze the effects of the spread of education on profitability, accumulation, distribution and growth.
B24|Essays on a positive theory of economic growth|"Departing from the conventional approach to economic growth, these papers collected here tackle the growth problems in capitalist economy, open economy and socialist economy with a novel definition of representative agent's preference: utility is function of both consumption and capital stock (or wealth). As essays one and two demonstrate, this modeling of preference captures the essential of Max Weber's ""spirit of capitalism"" and John Maynard Keynes¡¯s ""psychology of capitalist society"". Results derived from this modeling are in striking contrast to the conventional wisdom: different nations with different capitalist spirit tend to have different consumption, capital stock and endogenous rates in the long run; inflation affects steady state capital accumulation, and high inflation may lead to high rate of endogenous growth. Essays three and four extend this approach to the case of open economy. Foreign asset accumulation, foreign direct investment, and domestic fiscal and monetary policies are studies in the light of the new model. Essays five and six justify why we should define socialist planners' objective function in both consumption and capital accumulation. The regular phenomena in socialist economy, such as investment hunger, expansion drive, political investment cycles, and endogenous investment cycles, can be more sensibly understood within this positive framework than with the normative Cass model."
B24|Is Globalization Inevitable in the Marxian Paradigm?|This paper examines Marx's views on globalization and its supposed inevitability, and contends that they underwent a substantial evolution and revision after the publication of the Communist Manifesto. In the case of China, a prime example of the Asiatic mode of production, Marx even doubted whether globalization (capitalism) would ever be able to accomplish its historical mission of developing the forces of production and creating the material conditions for a higher mode of production, viz., Communism. While in the Russian case, he seriously entertained the notion that it could bypass the hardships and vicissitudes of capitalism and forge its own unique path to socialism. If accepted, this interpretation represents a serious challenge to the universality and validity of Marx's materialist conception of history.
B24|Profits and Exploitation: A Reappraisal|This paper provides a mathematical analysis of the Marxian theory of the exploitation of labour in general equilibrium models. The two main definitions of Marxian exploitation in the literature, proposed by Morishima (1974) and Roemer (1982), respectively, are analysed in the context of general convex economies. It is shown that, contrary to the received view, in general these definitions do not preserve the so-called Fundamental Marxian Theorem (FMT), which states that the exploitation of labour is synonymous with positive profits. A new definition of Marxian labor exploitation is proposed, which is shown to preserve the FMT in general convex economies, in equilibrium.
B24|A ‘Walrasian Post-Keynesian’ model? Resolving the paradox of Oskar Lange's 1938 theory of interest|This paper investigates Oskar Lange’s 1938 article, “The Rate of Interest and the Optimum Propensity to Consume”, with the intention of providing a thorough interpretation of this rather obscure work. We explore in depth Lange’s theory of interest and its relationship with both Keynes’ General Theory (1936) and Hicks’ synthesis (1937), developing two graphical models that show the non-linearity of Lange’s investment function as well as the consequentiality of his equilibrium solution. Through an unedited manuscript, we also reconstruct Lange’s beliefs about the chronic sub-optimality of the capitalist economy and his scientific endorsement of the socialist economy. We conclude that the purposes of Lange’s article predate and are independent of the General Theory. They consisted of a theoretical generalization and analysis of institutional data, intended to separate economic theory from the tacit assumption of a capitalist economy.
B24|Competition|Volume III contains entries on the development of major fields in economics from the inception of systematic analysis until modern times. The reader is provided with succinct summary accounts of the main problems, the methods used to address them and the results obtained across time. The emphasis is on both the continuity and the major changes that have occurred in the economic analysis of problematic issues such as economic growth, income distribution, employment, inflation, business cycles and financial instability. Each Handbook can be read individually and acts as a self-contained volume in its own right. It can be purchased separately or as part of a three-volume set.
B24|El excedente económico<BR>[The economic surplus]|In the present paper will work analytically the category of economic surplus. It will use the theoretical framework of technology system developed by Leontief to expose a clear form as to distinguish it from other concepts such as the net product.
B24|La teoría clásica de la renta y de la distribución<BR>[The classical theory of income and distribution]|This paper will discuss the classical theory of income developed by David Ricardo to understand not only its origin, also the role it plays in the stagnation of capitalist development. Also, since it will clarify the factors behind economic surplus allocation between social classes. In our analysis we follow Benetti, using the Leontief’s technological scheme.
B24|Classical vs. Neoclassical Conceptions of Competition|This article discusses two major conceptions of competition, the classical and the neoclassical. In the classical conception, competition is viewed as a dynamic rivalrous process of firms struggling with each other over the expansion of their market shares. This dynamic view of competition characterizes mainly the works of Smith, Ricardo, J.S. Mill and Marx; a similar view can be also found in the writings of Austrian economists and the business literature. By contrast, the neoclassical conception of competition is derived from the requirements of a theory geared towards static equilibrium and not from any historical observation of the way in which firms actually organize and compete with each other.
B24|Notes and Discussions - The Issue of the Stability of Capitalism in Recent Literature|The definition of capitalism is the focus of a wide-ranging debate raised by W. Sombart. The author indicates his own definition according to which capitalism is a system characterized by ‘‘free choice of activity for economic subjects; private property of the means of production competition’’. This definition prescinds from the concepts of capital and waged work, and while placing itself in a field that is rather far from Marxism yet does not prevent Vito from acknowledging the ongoing substantial changes of the system due to the process of industrial concentration. The author discusses the positions expressed on this issue by some coeval economists. Vito denies that such phenomena as trade unions, industrial concentration, state intervention, business forecasts and the economic crisis itself, may prelude to the fall of capitalism or to its transformation into a socialist system. In his opinion, many of the changes occurring in modern capitalism may help to make it more socially acceptable and equitable.

B24|De l'exclusion à la discrimination. Une généalogie historique, philosophique et politique|Democracy was constructed with keeping women back: there is no systematic statement excluding them, yet for a long time democracy was held to be applicable only to men. It did not exclude, but it was ?exclusive?: ?Neither citizens nor workers ?precious half of the Republic? as Rousseau says ? such was the dream of the democratic man with regard to women.? Genevi?ve Fraisse reviews the long journey from 1830 to current times that led to the progressive inclusion of women in the democratic system. From their integration into the democratic ?whole? was born the process of discrimination against women, a process that consists of separating while judging, and also the fact that there are two democratic governments, the domestic one and the political one. The philosopher emphasizes how Europe was a driving force with respect to equality between the sexes, the fight against discrimination and the potential contradictions inherent in policies based on gender mainstreaming ? although such contradictions cannot, she feels, be avoided. Her views go beyond an identity-based approach, and are situated on the side of praxis in such a way as to formulate the problems centred on the history of equality and women?s liberation.

B24|A note on Ricardo’s ‘invariable measure of value’|This paper presents an alternative to both Sraffa’s and his critics’ interpretations of the nature of Ricardo’s search for an ‘invariable measure of value’. It points out that Ricardo recognised two causes of change in the relative values of commodities: (i) changes in the labour content of commodities and (ii) changes in the distribution of income. However, he characterised the first change as the real change and the second change as only an apparent change. The article argues that Ricardo believed that the apparent changes are solely due to the arbitrary nature of the numéraire and would disappear if the commodities were measured against an ‘invariable measure of value’.
B24|Land Conflicts, Property Rights, and the Rise of the Export Economy in Colombia, 1850–1925|This research attempts to explain the poor performance of the Colombian economy in the world markets during the late nineteenth century. Based on data on exportable production at the municipal level in 1892, coffee production in 1925 and of public land allocation and land conflicts during the nineteenth and twentieth century, we found that the greatest obstacle that faced Colombian export development was the weakness of settlers´ property rights in the frontier lands. The quantitative results show that in the absence of land conflicts, the municipality´s exportable production would have been at least twice as muchas that observed.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B24|Paul Boccara's analysis of global capitalism. the return of the Bourbons, and the breakdown of the Brussels / Paris neo-liberal consensus|Globalization and monopolies lead towards stagnation. Paul Boccara emphasized this since the early 1970s. Some other great political economists of the instability of the international order, like Rosa Luxemburg and Otto Bauer, foresaw the dark clouds of major inner-capitalist wars on the horizon, and in the light of our analysis, we are not too far away from such dark times, if the logic of 'madness' called contemporary globalization is not corrected. Boccara, over the last decades, provided a coherent framework of analysis, which reached similar policy prescriptions, independently from the Steindl/Kalecki approach in political economy. A Boccaran worldview would hold that the contradictions of global capitalism increase over time, if markets are left for themselves. Boccara is right in stressing that this system is, as he puts it, 'mad' because its logic of profitability is reaching its climax. Capitalism as a system, which puts making money before and against people lives, needs to be questioned. It is really futile to speak of 'morality' and 'transparency' without attacking the logic of the system.
B24|Desenvolvendo a solidariedade no caminho da transição: um ensaio sobre a teoria do socialismo a partir de Marx|Developing the solidarity in the path to transition: an essay on the socialism theory based on Marx - According to the main ideas that one may extract from Marx?s works on a transition theory, the socialism would be an intermediate stage for a superior system ? the communism ? made possible only after the complete development of the productive forces, capitalism?s ?historical mission?. This thesis represents one of Marx?s biggest controversies and history has demonstrated that the reproduction and the expansion of the capitalism have not been limited by the advance of the technique ? and that neither a transition process would emerge from a sudden revolutionary reaction. In this work, we put on discussion some aspects of Marx?s thought, his transition theory and the current process of crisis of the reproduction of the capitalist relations of production. In the conclusions, a series of experiences of self-management with the heading of solidarity economics are discussed.
B24|"Valore e costo reale di produzione. Un riesame del problema, dopo la ""New Value Controversy"""|"Has the Marxian concept of economic value an objective foundation? In the light of the ""New Value Controversy"" which opposed neo-Marxist and Sraffian theorists, the author of this essay, a critical Marxist, reconsiders Marx’s labour theory of value. Attention is paid to the Marxian analysis of capital, value and surplus value. The truthfulness of the crucial but unproven Marxian assumption of equality of new value and living labour is questioned. A matrix model describing the productive structure of a capitalist system is used for this purpose. Marx’s labour theory of value is then examined in relation to the theories of capital and investment, which deal with value in process. Some recent suggestions to improve the reckoning of real costs of production are analysed. A draft of a labour-and-capital theory of value is outlined. And as a measure of value a ""monetary expression of value"" (MEV) is proposed, instead of the ""monetary expression of labour time"" (MELT)."
B24|Labor Theory of Value and the Uncertainty in Capitalist Economy|This article aims to offer a reply to Steedman’s critique of Marx’s labor theory of value. Although this critique having been there for about three decades, the anti-critiques from Marxists are up to date flawed with fatal limitation, losing sight of an important dimension of labor theory of value, i.e., without taking it as a theoretical tool of understanding the uncertainty rooted in capitalist mode of production. The first part of this article reviews the controversy initiated by Steedman. Part 2 discusses Marx’s dual theory of market value and Rubin’s interpretation. Our view is that, if Rubin’s interpretation is accepted, a refutation of Steedman’s critique towards Marx will be impossible. Part 3 of this article explores the possible reconstruction of market value in the perspective of the dynamics in the pivoting of market value. We concludes that, the relationship between the standard condition of production and value is not, as argued by Steedman, of deterministic and one-directional character. For Marx, labor theory of value is applied to analyze the uncertain relation between the means and the end, the condition and the result of capitalist production. Meanwhile, another reply is attempted towards the negative comment on labor theory of value made by contemporary evolutionary economist such as Hodgson. In our view, Marx’s labor theory of value is not irrelevant as claimed by Hodgson to the main topics of evolutionary economics such as variety and “natural selection.” It is through labor theory of value that Marx explains the co-evolution of technology and economy.
B24|Income distribution, persistent unemployment, and the classical growth cycle:evidence from South Africa|I formulate and calibrate a small 3D classical growth cycle model to explain the rise of income inequality, growth stagnation and the persistence of unemployment in South Africa between 1970-2005. This model exhibits interactions between economic growth, the employment rate, and the rate of profit. Simulation of the estimated model produces an underlying 59-year growth cycle for the South African economy, which is close to the one observed in the data. I find that the South African economy entered a phase of employment-enhancing growth in output around 2005, implying an estimated 37-year depression of the labour market.
B24|Elements for a Classical Theory of Equilibrium and Disequilibrium Prices|This paper intends to present an unconventional approach to the classical theory of relative prices based on recent developments and current limitations. Using the work of Carlo Benetti, Christian Bidard y Edith Klimovsky (Bidard and Klimovsky, 2006) as a conceptual framework that generalizes the classical theory of production prices, this analysis provides explanations for both equilibrium and disequilibrium cases. Accordingly, this paper depicts the importance of this new theoretical model, its initial hypothesis, structure, main properties and proficiency for explaining economic dynamics.
B24|Trends in Value Theory since 1881|Abstract: This is a prepublication version of an article which originally appeared in the World Review of Political Economy. Please cite as Freeman, A. 2010. ‘Trends in Value Theory since 1881’, World Review of Political Economy Volume 1 No. 4, Fall 2010. pp567-605. The article surveys the key ideas and currents of thinking about Marx’s value theory since he died. It does so by studying their evolution, in their historical context, through the lens of the Temporal Single System Interpretation (TSSI) of Marx’s ideas, an approach to Marx’s theory of value which has secured significant attention in recent years. The article explains the TSSI and highlights the milestones which led to the evolution of its key concepts.
B24|A comment on hollander on Sraffa and the 'Marxian dimension'|The contribution by Professor Hollander (2000) discusses Marx's influence on Sraffa's thought. While enquiries into this matter certainly have a historical and biographical interest, the paper steps beyond this kind of interest. In fact, in this article, Professor Hollander maintains that this influence caused a bias in Sraffa's interpretation of Ricardo (pp.192-97).1 However, such a claim on Professor Hollander’s part requires a demonstration that Sraffa’s conclusions were indeed led astray by the alleged influence.2 This is therefore the central question, and will be taken up in the present comment. Only in the conclusion will I touch briefly on the question of whether the claim of a Marxian influence on Sraffa’s interpretation of Ricardo is indeed correct from a biographical and historical point of view.

B24|Relations of Production and Modes of Surplus Extraction in India|This paper uses aggregate-level data, as well as case-studies, to trace out the evolution of some key structural features of the Indian economy, relating both to the agricultural and the informal industrial sector. These aggregate trends are used to infer: (a) the dominant relations of production under which the vast majority of the Indian working people labour, and (b) the predominant ways in which the surplus labour of the direct producers is appropriated by the dominant classes. This summary account is meant to inform and link up with on-going attempts at radically restructuring Indian society. JEL Categories: B24, B51

B24|The foundation of Marx’s concept of value in the Manuscripts of 1844|The aim of this paper is to show how Marx’s Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, which stand as his first systematic study of classical economists, transform the concept of labour as it had been developed by political economy against mercantilism and physiocracy. The current interpretations of the Marxian theory of value are first reviewed. The analysis of the Manuscripts then shows that the contribution of Hegelian philosophy lies in the definition of social labour in total opposition to the orthodox conception. This issue leads to a re­examination of the significance of these Manuscripts for the Marxian concept of value and its source, general and abstract labour.
B24|L'incongruence de la prétendue correction par Ladilaus von Bortkiewicz de la méthode de calcul des prix de production de Karl Marx|We emphasize the importance of competition and of the distribution of capital between sectors in the analysis of the transformation of values in production price. It is generally admitted that the fundamental Marxist equalities (the sum of prices is equal to the sum of values and the sum of the surplus is equal to that of profits) are incompatible with simple reproduction (L. von Bortkiewicz). This conclusion is erroneous and the process of transformation – generalized to inputs – is operational if we assume – within a bi-linear model – a fluidity of capital between sectors.

Posteriormente, se examina la relación dinámicaentre la composición orgánica del capital y la proporción entre las ramas.

B24|Los impuestos en la teoría de los precios de reproducción|ResumenEl objetivo de este artículo es presentar un modelo clásico de precios de reproducción, en el cual se supone que los capitalistas deben pagar un impuesto físico sobre la producción. El modelo permite mostrar las propiedades de una economía en la cual se distinguen tres empleos del excedente social: la acumulación, el consumo improductivo y el pago de impuestos, distinguiendo al mismo tiempo la situación de equilibrio y la de desequilibrio. Estas propiedades permiten caracterizar las diferentes trayectorias que esta economía puede tomar en un estudio de la dinámica capitalista.AbstractThe aim of this paper is to present a classical model of prices of reproduction, which it we assume that the capitalists must pay a physical tax on the production. The model shows several properties concern an economy in which three employment of the social surplus are possible: the accumulation of capital, the unproductive consumption and the payment of taxes, distinguishing at the same time equilibrium and the disequilibrium situations. These properties allow characterizing the different trajectories that the economy can take in a study of capitalist dynamics.
B24|Sraffa And The Question Of Equilibrium|"Hahn's (1982) influential critique of Sraffa (1960) crucially rests on his conclusion that ""the only falsifiable entailment of the Sraffa equations is the postulate of a uniform rate of profit"". This paper argues that the uniformity of the rates of profit in Sraffa’s system is not an assumption but rather a logical necessity of a system that determines its prices internally. It also shows that Hahn incorrectly identifies Sraffa’s sectoral rates of profit with commodities’ ‘own rates of profit’ of the intertemporal general equilibrium theory. This mistake lies at the heart of Hahn’s claim that Sraffa’s theory is a special case of the general equilibrium theory."

The Political Economy of Wealth helps (1) to overcome some theoretical limitations encountered in Socio-Ecological Economics, (2) to develop a critical perspective on neoclassical theory of environmental values, as well as a new justification of value incommensurability, and (3) to move toward a new research agenda that aims to study interactions between the economy and the environment from a socio-historical perspective.

The main goal of this paper is to characterize a specific topic of his thought: the nature of his economic ideas, namely the way he intermingled those ideas with both his Marxian wisdom and the introduction of econometrics in Portugal.

It is argued that none of their arguments dispel previous criticisms of the temporal single system interpretation�(TSSI). Indeed the paper confirms the suggestions of many critics that, as the missing parts of the TSSI theoretical constructs are provided, in particular the Monetary Expression of Labour Time, the TSSI rests on inconsistency and arbitrary assumptions.
B24|Social Democratic and Socialist Policies| In this Working Paper, also an entry for the International Encyclopedia of Public Policy, John King begins with a brief discussion of the meaning of ‘socialism’ and ‘social democracy,’ from their nineteenth-century origins down to the present day. He then discusses socialist economic policies under six headings: the case for public ownership; the importance of macroeconomic stability; the demands of social justice; arguments for tax reform; the need for environmental sustainability; and the obligation to exercise international responsibility. He concludes that socialist and social democratic policies offer a genuine intellectual alternative to neoliberalism.
B24|New Critical Perspectives on the U.S. and the Post-WWII Global Economy: Brenner, Harvey, and Pollin|In the current economic crisis, left and progressive political economics has enjoyed renewed attention and credibility, both inside and outside of academia. In this paper, Merlin Chowkwanyun surveys recent contributions to this literature by Robert Brenner, David Harvey, and Robert Pollin, summarizing key arguments and identifying research questions and heuristics for further inquiry. The author considers how these contributions might help to forge more fruitful dialogue between analyses of social movements and economic structures, too often studied apart. The paper stresses the importance of retaining the robust critical power of the left critique while avoiding the fatalism, sectarianism, and “automatic” theories of social change that have bedeviled the left’s recent past.
B24|A Short Guide to Long-Run Time-Phased Systems of Production|The paper discusses briefly several long-run systems of production vis-à- vis alternative theories of value and distribution stated by Marx, classical- neoricardian, post-Leontief-neoclassical, and post-Keynes-Sra¤a authors during the last hundred and fifty years. All the systems of production considered in the paper have in common the circular production of commodities by means of commodities. A distinctive characteristic of these systems is the standard of value in terms of which the wage rate and the prices of commodities are expressed. In particular, the logical structure of the systems of prices of production implies that diferent standards of value imply diferent theories of value and distribution both real and monetary in character. Methodological pluralism suggests that distinct theories of value and distribution refect diferent scientific/normative economic paradigms. It appears that dialectics is needed in order to trascendinter-paradigmatic debate.

Este estudio se propuso analizar la interacción entre exclusión social y acción colectiva en América Latina a través de una aproximación experimental en campo, y examinar algunos mecanismos de comportamiento individual y de grupo que pueden afectar la cooperación. Específicamente, analizó el comportamiento de los individuos frente a problemas de confianza, acción colectiva e incertidumbre en diferentes niveles de heterogeneidad y exclusión social. El conjunto de experimentos fue diseñado para medir las actitudes individuales con respecto a preferencias sociales (confianza, reciprocidad, cooperación y acción colectiva), preferencias hacia el riesgo (riesgo, ambigüedad y aversión a la pérdida) y cómo el grado de heterogeneidad y la exclusión social afectan las posibilidades para lograr acciones que generen mayores beneficios para los grupos. El diseño experimental se basó en cuatro actividades: un juego de la confianza, un juego de bienes públicos, tres juegos midiendo actitudes individuales hacia el riesgo, ambigüedad y pérdida y un juego de riesgo compartido.Con el fin de obtener una muestra representativa de 500 participantes en cada ciudad yaplicar diseño experimental de forma homogénea, se establecieron pasos metodológicosprecisos. Este documento presenta la metodología utilizada en este proyecto, permitiendo observar su desarrollo en campo. En primer lugar, describe el proceso de convocatoria y los mecanismos para llevarlo a cabo. Luego, presenta la planeación de una sesión, los detalles del protocolo y el proceso paso a paso de una sesión experimental. Finalmente, resume las recomendaciones y conclusiones generales para el trabajo de campo de un proyecto con los anteriores requerimientos."""
B24|Competencia en un contexto de consolidación financiera: una aplicación al caso colombiano|Con el proceso de consolidación bancaria de los últimos años, el número de entidades financieras ha caído y su cuota de mercado ha aumentado. De acuerdo con la teoría estructural de la organización industrial, un incremento en la concentración de una industria eleva el poder de mercado de los jugadores y presiona al alza la fijación de precios (mark-up). Sin embargo, estudios realizados bajo el Nuevo Enfoque Empírico de la Organización Industrial (NEIO) desvirtúan este paradigma. En este trabajo se utiliza este enfoque para evaluar el grado de competencia de los bancos colombianos en el mercado de crédito entre 1994-2006. La estimación de un modelo no estructural permite concluir que, a pesar de la reciente tendencia de consolidación de la banca, las entidades han mantenido una conducta competitiva y el mercado de crédito en Colombia se ubica en una situación de competencia superior al equilibrio tipo Cournot-Nash. Este resultado es consistente con los hallazgos de otros estudios que han evaluado el grado de competencia bancaria desde el lado de los depósitos.
B24|MARX Y EL DINERO; ¿Cuál es el Camino?|El objetivo del presente ensayo es entrar en la discusión sobre de un tema tan especial en la teoría económica como es el dinero. Para esto, se analizará una teoría de vital importancia en el estudio de la economía, es decir, la teoría propuesta por Karl Marx, en la cual el dinero es de gran importancia para entender el desarrollo de la economía. Donde Marx se aparta de los economistas clásicos pues para él ellos se equivocan al tratar de buscar la medida del valor sin incluir el dinero.
B24|Evaluating the impact of average cost based contracts on the industrial sector in the European emission trading scheme|The inception of the Emission Trading System in Europe (EU-ETS) has made power price more expensive. This affects the competitiveness of electricity intensive industrial consumers and may force them to leave Europe. Taking up of a proposal of the industrial sector, we explore the possible application of special contracts, based on the average cost pricing system, which would mitigate the impact of CO2 cost on their electricity price. The model supposes fixed generation capacities. A companion paper treats the case with capacity expansion. We first consider a reference model representing a perfectly competitive market where all consumers (households and industries) are price-takers and buy electricity at the short-run marginal cost. We then change the market design assuming that large industrial consumers pay power either at a single or at a nodal average cost price. The analysis of these problems is conducted with simulation models applied to the Northwestern European market. The equilibrium models developed are implemented in the GAMS environment.
B24|Prospettive e limiti dell'Economia quantitativa|L'economia politica è, tra le scienze umane, quella che maggiormente sperimenta l'attrazione verso i metodi quantitativi e in particolare verso la matematica e la statistica. Recentemente questa attrazione si è fatta ancor più forte che in passato, al punto che non è raro trovare, tra gli economisti, dei teorici che amerebbero vedere l'economia considerata come un ramo della matematica applicata. Ma sarebbe davvero utile convogliare l'economia tra le scienze naturali o addirittura spingerla al ruolo di un ramo della matematica applicata? Una attenta riflessione porta ben presto alla constatazione che il rapporto tra economia e matematica è molto più complesso di quanto possa sembrare a prima vista. L'autore sottolinea che ci sono almeno quattro caratteristiche che differenziano l'economia politica dalle scienze naturali: l'oggetto di studio; la finalità della ricerca economica, tesa ad influenzare l'oggetto di studio; la sua caratteristica di disciplina per certi aspetti positiva e per altri aspetti normativa; il coinvolgimento dei giudizi di valore. Per illustrare queste differenze e inquadrare la dimensione autonoma dell'economia politica, l'autore ricorre ad una rassegna critica delle opinioni di alcuni economisti di rilievo, che hanno dedicato contributi all'argomento qui in discussione. Specifici riferimenti vengono fatti a Marshall, Keynes, Hicks, Morishima e - tra gli economisti maggiormente presenti nelle nostre discussioni - a Sraffa e Sen, ai quali ultimi l'autore si sente più vicino.
B24|Revolutionaries, barbarians or war machines?; gangs in Nicaragua and South Africa|The view of gangs as proto-revolutionary vanguards has continued to inform the analyses of many gang researchers over the past few decades. During the course of our own research on gangs in respectively a poor neighbourhood in Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, and a coloured township in Cape Town, South Africa, we have found considerable empirical resonance between Fanon's vision and the real-life discourses of many of the gangsters that we have interviewed and spent time with. Although narratives of fighting with the authorities, only stealing from the rich (or the racially dominant), and protecting local communities and neighbourhoods have long been features uncovered by research on gangs, we found these to often be actively framed in explicitly revolutionary terms. Nicaraguan gang members, for example, frequently compared their behaviour with the actions of the Sandinista revolutionary regime, while gangs in post-Apartheid South Africa explicitly justified themselves as ANC-inspired forms of resistance against institutionalised racism. We wish to propose that gangs are a phenomenon that can be understood using Deleuze and Guattari's concept of the 'war machine'. This captures not only the ambiguities of gangs, but also the underlying similarities between gangs that have emerged in very different contexts, each with their own localised histories of accumulation and marginalisation. In doing so it allows us to better understand what it is that gangs and their violent practices really represent, and what relation they have, if any, to revolution.
B24|Sen’s Capability Approach as a new social-liberal paradigm (In French)|The goal of this paper is to show that Amartya Sen’s idea can be rooted in the social-liberal paradigm. Combining the respect of an unconditional freedom and the research of a real equality, Sen, thanks to the Capability Approach, proposes a framework for a new theory of justice.
B24|Tenant, Landlord, and Risk: Revisiting the Debate on Japanese Capitalism|Moritaro Yamadaâ€™s Analysis of Japanese Capitalism (1934) characterized the Japanese economy in that time. First, it highlighted the duality of the modern sector, whose productivity was relatively high, and the traditional sector, whose productivity was relatively low. Second, it argued that the paternalistic risk-bearing mechanism worked in the traditional sector. Third, it discussed that while the stability of society and the continued stagnancy of productivity had been symbiotic conditions, this structure was disintegrating. The work provoked intense debate among Japanese Marxian economists to understand the Japanese economy. However, classical economics then did not have the analytical tools for a twosector economy, duality, risk sharing, and dynamic transition in the growth path, which led to the ambiguity of Yamadaâ€™s description and confusion in the debate. We place his argument on duality and risk sharing in an analytical framework, and rephrase its implications.
B24|Was Jules Dupuit a Market Socialist: A Retrospective Note on Marginal Cost Pricing|This paper examines the extent to which Dupuit preceded Hotelling in the theory of marginal cost pricing and the relation of marginal cost pricing to the Pigou–Robinson definition of exploitation, Coase’s multipart pricing, and the Kaldor compensation principle. Tsuneki’s partial rehabilitation of Hotelling’s proof of MC pricing is partially endorsed. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2008
B24|Costos de transacción, un hallazgo no tan reciente. Aproximaciones a la teoría de los costos de circulación de Karl Marx|"Resumen: Los aportes de la escuela neoinstitucionalista son reconocidos hoy como uno de los mayores en el campo económico; esto debido a que en su análisis económico del mercado incluyen una gama de aspectos que son fundamentales en la toma de decisiones de las empresas y los agentes llamado costos de transacción. Lo paradójico es que parte de este ""gran hallazgo"" ya había sido expuesto un siglo antes por Karl Marx en el segundo tomo de El Capital, Crítica de la Economía Política y aun no ha sido reconocido. La contribución de Marx sobre costos de Circulación es enorme, pues define, clasifica y propone soluciones a dichos costos de una manera rigurosa y novedosa, incluso aventajando a las propuestas actuales; lo extraño es que esta propuesta teórica no ha sido reconocida por ninguno de los economistas que trabajan en el tema. Abstract: The contributions of the neoinstitutionalist school are recognized today like one of the more important in the economic field; this due that include a range of aspects that are fundamental in the taking of decisions of the companies called Transaction Costs in their economic analysis of the market. The paradoxical thing is that this ""great discovery"" it had already been exposed before one century by Karl Marx in the Second book of The Capital, Critic of the Political Economy. Marx´s contribution about the Costs of Circulation it is enormous, because it defines, it classifies and it proposes solutions to this expense in a rigorous and novel way, even leading to the current proposals. The strange thing is that this theoretical proposal has not been recognized by none of the economists that work in the topic."
