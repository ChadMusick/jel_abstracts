J31|Local Labor Markets in Canada and the United States|We examine local labor markets in the U.S. and Canada from 1990 to 2011 using comparable household and business data. Wage levels and inequality rise with city population in both countries, albeit less in Canada. Neither country saw wage levels converge despite contrasting migration patterns from/to high-wage areas. Local labor demand shifts raise nominal wages similarly, although in Canada they attract immigrant and highly-skilled workers more, while raising housing costs less. Chinese import competition had a weaker negative impact on manufacturing employment in Canada. These results are consistent with Canada's more redistributive transfer system and larger, more-educated immigrant workforce.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J31|Desigualdad e informalidad en América Latina: el caso del Brasil|En este artículo se presenta el estudio de la relación entre la evolución de la desigualdad y la de la informalidad laboral durante la década del 2000 en Brasil. Aunque la meta primordial del trabajo es dilucidar la contribución del proceso de formalización experimentado durante toda la década, esta se debe analizar junto con otros factores relacionados. Para realizar este análisis y establecer la contribución de cada factor se presenta una serie de ejercicios de descomposiciones econométricas a partir de microdatos de las encuestas de hogares. Los ejercicios de descomposición considerados se basan en la combinación de técnicas de reponderación junto con estimaciones de modelos de función de influencia recentrada (expresión que en inglés se traduce como recentered influence function y se conoce por la sigla RIF). Se encuentra que el proceso de formalización considerado en forma aislada tuvo una incidencia igualadora mediante el aumento de los ingresos de las personas que pertenecen a los ventiles más bajos.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J31|Firms and Labor Market Inequality: Evidence and Some Theory|We review the literature on firm-level drivers of labor market inequality. There is strong evidence from a variety of fields that standard measures of productivity — like output per worker or total factor productivity — vary substantially across firms, even within narrowly defined industries. Several recent studies not that rising trends in the dispersion of productivity across firms mirror the trends in the wage inequality across workers. Two distinct literatures have searched for a more direct link between these two phenomena. The first examines how wages are affected by differences in employer productivity. Studies that focus on firm-specific productivity shocks an control for the non-random sorting of workers to more and less productive firms typically find that a 10% increase in value=added per worker leads to somewhere between a 0.5% and 1.5% increase in wages. A second literature focuses on firm-specific wage premiums, using the wage outcomes of job changers. This literature also concludes that firm pay setting is important for wage inequality, with many studies finding that firm wage effects contribute approximately 20% of the overall variance of wages. To interpret these findings, we develop a model where workplace environments are viewed as imperfect substitutes by workers and firms set wages with some degree of market power. We shoe that simple versions of this model can readily match the stylized empirical finding s in the literature regarding rent-sharing elasticities and the structure of rim=specific pay premiums<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J31|Disadvantage and discrimination in self-employment: caste gaps in earnings in Indian small businesses|Abstract Using the 2004–2005 India Human Development Survey data, we estimate and decompose the earnings of household businesses owned by historically marginalized social groups known as Scheduled Castes and Tribes (SCSTs) and non-SCSTs across the earnings distribution. We find clear differences in characteristics between the two types of businesses with the former faring significantly worse. The mean decomposition reveals that as much as 55 % of the caste earnings gap could be attributed to the unexplained component. Quantile regressions suggest that gaps are higher at lower deciles, providing some evidence of a sticky floor. Finally, quantile decompositions reveal that the unexplained component is greater at the lower and middle deciles than higher, suggesting that SCST-owned businesses at the lower and middle end of the conditional earnings distribution face greater discrimination.

J31|The increase of the gender wage gap in Italy during the 2008-2012 economic crisis|Abstract The Italian gender wage gap is lower than in other European countries, however it increased during the 2008-2012 economic crisis, while in most countries it decreased. This paper finds that the main cause of this increase is the 2010-11 public sector wage freeze, which was introduced as an austerity measure by the Italian government. We estimate the level of the gender wage gap as if the wage freeze had not been implemented, applying a counterfactual analysis. We find that the wage freeze accounts for more than 100% of the increase of the wage gap, while other factors in sum reduced the wage gap. The paper also examines the evolution of the gap from 2004 to 2012 using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and a quantile decomposition. The gender wage gap is found to be unexplained by observed characteristics. After 2010 it is particularly high in the upper part of the wage distribution, indicating the existence of a glass ceiling in addition to a sticky floor.
J31|Entrepreneurship versus joblessness: Explaining the rise in self-employment|A large share of the workforce throughout the developing world is self-employed, and this proportion has increased in recent decades. Assessments of this development vary, with pull factors such as high returns to capital contrasted with push factors such as barriers to more desirable salaried jobs. Using a long panel dataset from Ghana, we empirically investigate the changing structure of earnings in self-employment relative to salaried work. Our analysis allows workers to sort into self-employment for different reasons, including expected earnings differentials and endogenous capital accumulation whilst highlighting constraints that workers may face. We estimate a correlated random coefficient model using IV-GMM, taking into account the endogeneity of sector choice and capital accumulation. We find that returns to productive characteristics in self-employment have increased significantly between 2004 and 2011 whilst self-employment has attracted increasingly skilled workers. This points against the negative view of self-employment as an occupation of last resort.
J31|The Equality Multiplier: How Wage Compression And Welfare Empowerment Interact|We explore how more wage equality fuels the generosity of the welfare state via political competition in elections, and how a more generous welfare state fuels wage equality via empowerment of weak groups in the labor market. Together the two mechanisms may generate a cumulative process that explains how equality multiplies, and why countries with more equal distributions of market outcomes also have stronger welfare states. The complementarity between wage setting and welfare spending can explain why almost equally rich countries differ so much in economic and social equality among their citizens.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J31|The relationship between profit-sharing schemes and wages: Evidence from French firms|The article tackles the impact of profit sharing plans (PS) on compensation policies in the French context. Using a sample of 1,143 firms from surveys of the Ministry of Labour, the authors draw up a typology based on a mix of PS plans including cash-based PS, deferred PS and the intensity of deferred plans (additional employer and employee contributions). Our results indicate that profit sharing does not seem to be considered as a way to reduce wages. Cash-based PS-oriented and high-deferred PS policies are not significantly linked to lower wages; but only firms with high-deferred PS policies are related to significantly higher wages.
J31|Educational Mismatch in the Czech Labour Market|Educational mismatch in labour markets is a phenomenon that has been widely analysed, mainly with respect rising concerns about possible oversupply of graduates. Similarly to most European countries, the Czech Republic has experienced a boom in tertiary education in the last decade. The incidence and the determinants of over- and undereducation vary substantially depending on both the approach of the mismatch measurement and the data source applied. Educational mismatch also reflects in wage levels. First, overeducated workers have lower wages and undereducated workers have higher wages compared to workers with the same education whose jobs match their education. Second, overeducated workers earn more and undereducated workers earn less than their co-workers with exactly the required level of education. The effects are qualitatively the same regardless the data source or approach applied but their sizes differ slightly according to the approach and data applied.
J31|The linkages between formal and informal employment growth in Tunisia: a spatial simultaneous equations approach|Abstract This paper examines the links and interactions between the formal and informal employment growth as well as their determinants in 264 Tunisian delegations from 1996 to 2013. The empirical analysis based on non-spatial and spatial simultaneous equations models reveals that an increase in the informal employment growth in industry is positively associated with an increase in the formal employment at the same delegation, and vice versa. For the construction activities, the results show that the formal and informal sectors are opposite. With respect to agglomeration externalities, we find positive effects of local competition on employment growth for both formal and informal sectors. Furthermore, we find that formal employment is higher in delegations with higher average monthly wage and high levels of net migration.

J31|The sources of wage growth in a developing country|Abstract What are the sources of wage growth in developing countries? In the USA, general labor market experience is the key source of wage growth, with job seniority playing a smaller role. By contrast, in Indonesia, the 10-year return to seniority is 24 to 28 %, which is higher than the return to experience. Furthermore, we estimate a 35 % return to 10 years of tenure in the formal sector, with no significant return to tenure in the informal sector. The difference in the sources of wage growth in Indonesia versus the USA may be a reflection of Indonesia’s lower level of development. JEL codes: J3, O1

J31|The Great Reversal in the Demand for Skill and Cognitive Tasks|What explains the current low rate of employment in the US? While there has been substantial debate over this question in recent years, we believe that considerable added insight can be derived by focusing on changes in the labor market at the turn of the century. In particular, we argue that in about the year 2000, the demand for skill (or, more specifically, for cognitive tasks often associated with high educational skill) underwent a reversal. Many researchers have documented a strong, ongoing increase in the demand for skills in the decades leading up to 2000. In this paper, we document a decline in that demand in the years since 2000, even as the supply of high education workers continues to grow. We go on to show that, in response to this demand reversal, high-skilled workers have moved down the occupational ladder and have begun to perform jobs traditionally performed by lower-skilled workers. This de-skilling process, in turn, results in high-skilled workers pushing low-skilled workers even further down the occupational ladder and, to some degree, out of the labor force all together. In order to understand these patterns, we offer a simple extension to the standard skill biased technical change model that views cognitive tasks as a stock rather than a flow. We show how such a model can explain the trends in the data that we present, and offers a novel interpretation of the current employment situation in the US.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J31|Cashier or Consultant? Entry Labor Market Conditions, Field of Study, and Career Success|We analyze the early labor market outcomes of U.S. college graduates from the classes of 1974 to 2011, as a function of the economic conditions into which they graduated. We have three main findings. First, poor labor market conditions substantially disrupt early careers. A large recession at time of graduation reduces earnings by roughly 10% in the first year, for the average graduate. The losses are driven partially by a reduced ability to find employment and full-time work and partially by a roughly 4% reduction in hourly wage rates. Second, these effects differ by field of study. Those in majors with typically higher earnings experience significantly smaller declines in most labor market outcomes measured. As a result, the initial earnings and wage gaps across college majors widen by almost a third and a sixth, respectively, for those graduating into a large recession. Most of these effects fade out over the first 7 years. Those in higher paying majors are also slightly less likely to obtain an advanced degree when graduating into a recession, consistent with their relative increase in opportunity cost. Our third set of results focuses on a recent period that includes the Great Recession. Early impacts on earnings are much larger than what we would have expected given past patterns and the size of the recession, in part because of a large increase in the cyclical sensitivity of demand for college graduates. The effects also differ much less by field of study than those of prior recessions.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J31|Firms and the Economics of Skilled Immigration|Firms play a central role in the selection, sponsorship, and employment of skilled immigrants entering the United States for work through programs like the H-1B visa. This role has not been widely recognized in the literature, and the data to better understand it have only recently become available. This chapter discusses the evidence that has been assembled to date in understanding the impact of high skilled immigration from the perspective of the firm and the open areas that call for more research. Since much of the U.S. immigration process for skilled workers rests in the hands of employer firms, a stronger understanding of these implications is essential for future policy analysis, particularly for issues relating to fostering innovation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J31|Trade liberalization and gender inequality|Women consistently work less in the labor market and earn lower wages than men. While economic empowerment of women is an important objective in itself, women's economic activity also matters as a condition for sustained economic growth. The political debate on the labor market impacts of international trade typically differentiates workers by their educational attainment or skills. Gender is a further dimension in which the impacts of trade liberalization can differ. In a globalizing world it is important to understand whether and how trade policy can contribute toward enhancing gender convergence in labor market outcomes.
J31|Market competition and executive pay|Deregulation and managerial compensation are two important topics on the political and academic agenda. The former has been a significant policy recommendation in light of the negative effects associated with overly restrictive regulation on markets and the economy. The latter relates to the sharp increase in top executives' pay and the nature of the link between pay and performance. To the extent that product-market competition can affect the incentive schemes offered by firms to their executives, the analysis of the effects of competition on the structure of compensation may be informative for policy purposes.
J31|Can immigrants ever earn as much as native workers?|Immigrants contribute to the economic development of the host country, but they earn less at entry and it takes many years for them to achieve parity of income. For some immigrant groups, the wage gap never closes. There is a wide variation across countries in the entry wage gap and the speed of wage assimilation over time. Wage assimilation is affected by year of entry, immigrant skill, ethnicity, and gender. Policies that facilitate assimilation of immigrant workers provide support for education, language, and employment. Such policies can also reduce barriers to entry, encourage naturalization, and target selection of immigrants.
J31|Management Practices, Workforce Selection, and Productivity|We study the relationship among productivity, management practices, and employee ability using German data combining management practices surveys with employees' longitudinal earnings records. Including human capital reduces the association between productivity and management practices by 30%-50%. Only a small fraction is accounted for by the higher human capital of the average employee at better-managed firms. A larger share is attributable to the human capital of the highest-paid workers, that is, the managers. A similar share is mediated through the pay premiums offered by better-managed firms. We find that better-managed firms recruit and retain workers with higher average human capital.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J31|La incidencia de la migración sobre las diferencias salariales de género en Colombia|En este artículo se muestra que en las ciudades colombianas la brecha salarial entre hombres y mujeres varía al tener en cuenta el lugar de origen de las mujeres. En particular, el estudio evidencia que el diferencial salarial es mayor entre los hombres que siempre han residido en la ciudad y las mujeres que provienen de zonas rurales, en comparación con el presentado cuando se compara a hombres y a mujeres que han vivido desde su nacimiento en una ciudad. Lo anterior sugiere que las remuneraciones al trabajo de las mujeres rurales en los núcleos urbanos son fruto de una doble penalidad por parte del mercado laboral: una por ser mujeres y otra por provenir de un municipio rural. Un resultado adicional del documento se obtiene al dividir la población por percentiles de ingreso, pues allí se observa que las diferencias salariales se profundizan en los percentiles de ingresos bajos, afectando en mayor medida a las mujeres migrantes. ****** This paper analyzes the gender wage gap among rural-urban migrants in 13 cities and their metropolitan areas in Colombia. In particular, it is demonstrated that the difference between male and female wages are wider when the comparison is made exclusively with the rural-born women. This suggests that wages paid to rural women are consequence of a double penalty; one for being women and another one for coming from a rural district. An additional observation in the article is obtained from taking a centile approach, in which it is observed that gender wage gap is not uniform across the population income, with higher differentials at the bottom.

J31|Immigration, Jobs, And Employment Protection: Evidence From Europe Before And During The Great Recession| In this paper we analyze the impact of immigrants on the type and quantity of native jobs. We use data on 15 Western European countries during the 1996–2010 period. We find that immigrants, by taking manual-routine type of occupations pushed natives towards more “complex” (abstract and communication) jobs. This job upgrade was associated to a 0.7% increase in native wages for a doubling of the immigrants' share. These results are robust to the use of an IV strategy based on past settlement of immigrants across European countries. The job upgrade slowed but did not come to a halt during the Great Recession. We also document the labor market flows behind it: the complexity of jobs offered to new native hires was higher relative to the complexity of lost jobs. Finally, we find evidence that such reallocation was larger in countries with more flexible labor laws.
J31|Racial discrimination in the U.S. labor market: Employment and wage differentials by skill|In the U.S. the average black worker has a lower employment rate and earns a lower wage compared to his white counterpart. Lang and Lehmann (2012) argue that black–white wage and employment gaps are smaller for high-skill workers. We show that a model combining employer taste-based discrimination, search frictions and skill complementarities can replicate these regularities, and estimate it using data from the U.S. manufacturing sector. We find that discrimination is quantitatively important to understand differences in wages and job finding rates across workers with low education levels, whereas skill differences are the main driver of those differences among workers with high education levels.
J31|Decomposition of regional wage differences along the wage distribution in Portugal: the importance of covariates|Unlike previous studies, in this paper we estimate the contribution of covariates for the regional wage decomposition components along the wage distribution employing a method first described in 2009 by S Firpo, N Fortin, and T Lemieu ( Econometrica 77 953–973). We consider the case of Portugal, a country with persistent and large regional wage gaps. We find that education, occupation, and firm size are the most important factors in explaining the growing importance of the composition effect. The wage structure effect, in turn, is mainly determined by differences in reward for experience and tenure. Moreover, we conclude that the importance of these covariates for both effects is not equal along the wage distribution.

J31|A Stata package for the application of semiparametric estimators of dose–response functions|In many observational studies, the treatment may not be binary or categorical but rather continuous, so the focus is on estimating a continuous dose– response function. In this article, we propose a set of programs that semiparametrically estimate the dose–response function of a continuous treatment under the unconfoundedness assumption. We focus on kernel methods and penalized spline models and use generalized propensity-score methods under continuous treatment regimes for covariate adjustment. Our programs use generalized linear models to estimate the generalized propensity score, allowing users to choose between alternative parametric assumptions. They also allow users to impose a common support condition and evaluate the balance of the covariates using various approaches. We illustrate our routines by estimating the effect of the prize amount on subsequent labor earnings for Massachusetts lottery winners, using data collected by Imbens, Rubin, and Sacerdote (2001, American Economic Review, 778–794).

J31|The Labour Market Effects of Immigration and Emigration in OECD Countries|In this paper, we simulate the labor market effects of net immigration and emigration during the 1990's in all OECD countries. To accomplish this, we are the first to employ a comprehensive database of migrant stocks, grouped by education level and country of origin/destination, for the years 1990 and 2000. Due to the much higher international mobility of college graduates, relative to all other individuals, we find that net migration flows are college-intensive, relative to the population of non-migrants. Using the consensus aggregate model of labor demand and supply we simulate the long-run employment and wage effects of immigration and emigration. We use a range of parameter values spanning most of the estimates in the literature. In all cases we find that immigration had a positive effect on the wage of less educated natives. It also increased or left the average native wages unchanged and had a positive or no effect on native employment. To the contrary, emigration had a negative effect on the wage of less educated native workers and it contributed to increase within country inequality in all OECD countries. These results still hold true when we correct for the estimates of undocumented immigrants, for the skill-downgrading of immigrants, when we focus on immigration from non-OECD countries, and when we consider preliminary measures of more recent immigration flows for the period 2000-2007.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J31|My Wage is Unfair! Just a Feeling or Comparison with Peers?|This paper analyzes the nexus between income comparisons and perceptions of unfair pay. We apply a large German household survey and conduct wage regressions to conclude whether individuals who perceive their wages as unfair earn significantly lower wages than fairly paid individuals with similar characteristics. We find that unfairly paid individuals earn significantly less than fairly paid counterparts. This suggests that unfairness perceptions with respect to wages are based on sound income comparisons with peers. We also contribute findings to the literature on reference points. When asked about a subjectively fair amount in Euros, unfairly paid individuals tend to claim much higher wages than fairly paid individuals with identical characteristics. Wage claims, thus, rest on additional factors.
J31|Polarization or Upgrading? Evolution of Employment in Transitional Russia|This paper discusses the structural change in the Russian employment and explores whether the evolution of employment in 2000—2012 followed the scenario of progressive upgrading in job quality or brought about the polarization of jobs in terms of their quality. Jobs are defined here as occupation-industry cells and their quality is measured through relative earnings and education levels. Using detailed micro-data from a few complementary large scale surveys, we rank all jobs according to the earnings and educational criteria and divide these distributions into 5 quintiles. At the next stage, we explore dynamic changes in job quality and socio-demographic characteristics of workers in different quintiles. The paper rejects the polarization scenario and confirms the upgrading hypothesis.
J31|Sexual orientation and labor market outcomes|Studies from countries with laws against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation suggest that gay and lesbian employees report more incidents of harassment and are more likely to report experiencing unfair treatment in the labor market than are heterosexual employees. Gay men are found to earn less than comparably skilled and experienced heterosexual men. For lesbians, the patterns are ambiguous: in some countries they have been found to earn less than their heterosexual counterparts, while in others they earn the same or more. Both gay men and lesbians tend to be less satisfied with their jobs than their heterosexual counterparts.
J31|Does increasing the minimum wage reduce poverty in developing countries?|Do minimum wage policies reduce poverty in developing countries? It depends. Raising the minimum wage could increase or decrease poverty, depending on labor market characteristics. Minimum wages target formal sector workers—a minority of workers in most developing countries—many of whom do not live in poor households. Whether raising minimum wages reduces poverty depends not only on whether formal sector workers lose jobs as a result, but also on whether low-wage workers live in poor households, how widely minimum wages are enforced, how minimum wages affect informal workers, and whether social safety nets are in place.
J31|Efficient markets, managerial power, and CEO compensation|The escalation in chief executive officer (CEO) pay over recent decades, both in absolute terms and in relation to the earnings of production workers, has generated considerable attention. The pay of top executives has grown noticeably in relation to overall firm profitability. The pay gap between CEOs in the US and those in other developed countries narrowed substantially during the 2000s, making top executive pay an international concern. Researchers have taken positions on both sides of the debate over whether the level of CEO pay is economically justified or is the result of managerial power.
J31|Immigrants and entrepreneurship|Immigrants are widely perceived to be highly entrepreneurial, contributing to economic growth and innovation, and self-employment is often viewed as a means of enhancing labor market integration and success among immigrants. Accordingly, many countries have established special visas and entry requirements to attract immigrant entrepreneurs. Research supports some of these stances, but expectations may be too high. There is no strong evidence that self-employment is an effective tool of upward economic mobility among low-skilled immigrants. More broadly prioritizing high-skilled immigrants may prove to be more successful than focusing on entrepreneurship.

J31|Utilising self-report data to measure racial discrimination in the labour market|Although economists have developed a series of approaches to modelling the existence of labour market discrimination, rarely is this topic examined by analysing self-report survey data. After reviewing theories and empirical models of labour market discrimination, we examine self-reported experience of discrimination at different stages in the labour market, among three racial groups utilising U.S. data from the 2001-2003 National Survey of American Life. Our findings indicate that African Americans and Caribbean blacks consistently report more experience of discrimination in the labour market than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. At different stages of the labour market, including hiring, termination and promotion, these groups are more likely to report discrimination than non-Hispanic whites. After controlling for social desirability bias and several human capital and socio-demographic covariates, the results remain robust for African Americans. However, the findings for Caribbean blacks were no longer significant after adjusting for social desirability bias. Although self-report data is rarely utilised to assess racial discrimination in labour economics, our study confirms the utility of this approach as demonstrated in similar research from other disciplines. Our results indicate that after adjusting for relevant confounders self-report survey data is a viable approach to estimating racial discrimination in the labour market.

J31|An Estimation Of Worker And Firm Effects With Censored Data|In this paper, we develop a new estimation method that is suitable for censored models with two high dimensional fixed effects and that is based on a sequence of least squares regressions, yielding significant savings in computing time and hence making it applicable to frameworks in which standard estimation techniques become unfeasible. We propose to apply this estimation method to investigate the role of firms in individual wage variation. Using a longitudinal match employer‐employee dataset from Spain, we show that the analysis of wage determination can be misleading when wages are censored. In particular, the role of firm wage policies in wage dispersion is overestimated by more than ten percentage points, while the role of time‐invariant individual characteristics is underestimated by fifteen percentage points. Hence, controlling for censored wages appears to reinforce the idea that when explaining individual wage dispersion, what workers ‘are’ is more important than what workers ‘do’.
J31|Medición del valor agregado del hogar: nuevos enfoques para el caso peruano|Aun cuando las diferentes medidas convencionales del Producto Bruto Interno (PBI) muestran el desempeño económico del país, el cálculo de éstas no considera el significativo valor de los bienes y servicios producidos dentro del hogar. A través de la Encuesta Nacional del Uso de Tiempo (ENUT) 2010, la presente investigación trata de estimar el valor asociado al tiempo dedicado a las labores del hogar en el Perú bajo distintos enfoques discutidos en la literatura académica. Los resultados arrojan que el Producto Bruto del Hogar (PBH) constituye un monto significativo del PBI que oscila entre los 65,000 y 129,000 millones de nuevos soles de 2010, lo que representa entre 16% y 31% del PBI. Asimismo, los resultados son concluyentes respecto a la participación mayoritaria de las mujeres dentro del PBH: en promedio, alrededor de 60% y 70%. Finalmente, este documento concluye sobre los desafíos de implementación de políticas públicas que permitan reducir las desigualdades en la contribución del tiempo dedicado a las tareas del hogar encontradas.
J31|Efficient Learning And Job Turnover In The Labor Market| This article nests a continuous‐time learning model a ̀ la Jovanovic (Journal of Political Economy 92 (1984), 108–22) into a directed on‐the‐job search framework. We prove that the socially efficient allocation is separable, that is, the workers' value functions and optimal controls are independent of both the distribution of workers across their current match qualities and the unemployment rate. We characterize the dynamics of job transitions in the efficient allocation. Furthermore, when the matching technology is linear, our numerical results show that increasing the vacancy creation cost and the speed of learning have ambiguous effects on the unemployment rate and aggregate job transition.
J31|The Determinants of Rising Inequality in Health Insurance and Wages, Second Version|What has caused the rising gap in health insurance coverage by education in the U.S. over the last thirty years? How does the employment-based health insurance market interact with the labor market? What are the effects of social insurance such as Medicaid? By developing and structurally estimating an equilibrium model, I find that the interaction between labor market technological changes and the cost growth of medical services explains 60% to 70% of the gap. Using counterfactual experiments, I also evaluate the impact of further Medicaid eligibility expansion and employer mandates introduced in the Affordable Care Act on labor and health insurance markets.
J31|Dynamic Education Signaling with Dropout Risk, Third Version|This paper analyzes a dynamic education signaling model with dropout risk. Workers pay an education cost per unit of time and face an exogenous dropout risk before graduation. Since low-productivity workersâ€™ cost of education is high, pooling with early dropouts helps them avoid a high education cost. In equilibrium, low-productivity workers choose to endoge- nously drop out over time, so the productivity of workers in college increases as the education process progresses. We find that the exogenous dropout risk generates rich dynamics in the endogenous dropout behavior of workers, and the maximum education length is decreasing in the prior about a worker being highly productive. We also extend the baseline model by allowing human capital accumulation.
J31|The Impact Of Gender Wage Gap On Sectoral Economic Growth – Cross-Country Approach|We propose an empirical analysis of testing the relationship between gender wage gap and economic growth. The study takes into account 12 manufacturing sectors in 18 OECD countries for the period between 1970 and 2005.We use industrial statistics (EU KLEMS, 2008) on female and male wages that distinguish between wages paid to different groups of workers classified according to skill level: high, medium and low. We estimate augmented production function where the male-female wage differentials constitute a potential channel influencing growth (positively or negatively). Our research is motivated by the ambiguous results of previous empirical studies (e.g.: Seguiono, 2000; Busse and Spielmann, 2006; Seguino, 2011; Schober and Winter-Ebmer, 2011). Our main findings indicate that gender wage gap for high, medium and low-skilled workers is negatively correlated with sectoral growth. This results are confirmed in a number of robustness checks.
J31|Regional Structure Of Wages In Poland Over The Period 1995-2009|In this paper, we test empirically for the increasing returns-based agglomeration and investigate the impact of the economic integration with the European Union on regional wage inequalities in Poland. In our study, we use the wage data for 16 Polish regions over the period of 1995-2009. Our results are consistent with the predictions of the core-periphery models of the New Economic Geography. In particular, we find that wages decrease as one moves away from the Mazowiecki capital region, as well as from the border with Germany.
J31|Can sustainable poverty reduction be achieved with little or no economic growth? The case of Jamaica|Can poverty decline with little growth in real GDP? This paper examines the case of Jamaica, where the poverty headcount halved between 2003 and 2007 despite real per capita GDP growth of just 1.1 percent per year, by analyzing the factors contributing to the observed reduction in poverty using household and labor force surveys. It sets out by providing a sectoral, demographic, and spatial picture of the evolution of poverty and finds that poverty reduction has been broad based, benefitting both rural and urban areas. Nearly three quarters of the poverty reduction is attributed to growth in average household consumption, which outpaced GDP growth due to large remittance inflows, and one quarter to narrowing inequality. In turn, around half of the reduction of inequality is explained by narrowing returns to education and declining sectoral wage gaps.
J31|Efficiency of Collective Bargaining in the Public Sector: a Natural Experiment|In this paper I develop a two-stage bargaining model determining wages and employment and apply it to the public sector. Solving the model leads to structural wage and employment equations that I estimate using data from the public sector in Iceland. Nested in the model are the major collective bargaining models (right-to-manage and efficient contracting). The model can be empirically tested to distinguish between the bargaining models. Significant changes were made to collective bargaining contracts in the public sector in Iceland at the same time the bargaining process was decentralized, which provides for a natural experiment. The model is estimated for the period before the changes were made and again after the changes had taken root. The result is that the bargaining power of unions has changed between the two periods and the bargaining structure has become more inefficient with the changes in the collective bargaining contracts.
J31|Wages and Labour Productivity: the role of Performance-Related Pay in Italian firms|This paper analyses the role of Performance Related Pay (PRP) agreements on labour productivity and wages. Its main contribution is thus to investigate the effects of PRP on both dimensions, i.e. productivity and distribution, whereas most of the studies of related literature are restricted to one of those aspects. All estimates are performed for a large sample of manufacturing and service Italian firms with more than five employees and a restricted sample including only unionised firms. It allows us to focus on a relevant feature of industrial relations represented by worker representation and its role in local wage setting in the Italian economy. The expected positive link between PRP and firm performance has been confirmed in all estimates, also controlling for a rich set of covariates. Furthermore, the comparison of productivity estimates with those for wages allows us to ascertain that payments by results might be not only rent-sharing devices, but schemes that substantially lead to efficiency enhancements. These findings have been validated by a number of robustness checks, also taking into account endogeneity by using instrumental variables and the treatments of 3SLS. The paper argues that well designed policies, that circumvent the limited implementation of PRP practices, would guarantee productivity improvement. The real effectiveness of these measures would not be weakened under union governance.
J31|For Love or Money? Motivating Workers|An analysis of the ability of employers to provide care and attention as a way to motivate their employees is done. Workers not only compare their wages, as pointed out in previous literature, but also compare the socio-emotional resources provided by their employer. This provides important evidence against one-dimensional comparisons of relative wages relevant to worker productivity. [PIDE Working Papers].

J31|Manufacturing skill-biased wage inequality, natural resources and institutions|We use an extensive dataset on occupational wages to measure the manufacturing skill premium and evaluate the importance of the main drivers in literature plus the effects of natural resources and institutions. Results, regarding a panel of 21 countries between 1987 and 2003, suggest the manufacturing skill premium of technologically advanced countries: (i) increases with tertiary enrolment, net FDI and the quality of governing institutions; (ii) decreases with the centralization of wage negotiations and the use of unskilled workers by geographically-diffuse natural resource re-exportation activities. In less advanced countries, the skill premium: (iii) augments with net FDI, scale effects, the centralization of wage negotiations, and scarcity of skilled workers absorbed by concentrated resource activities; (iv) decreases with trade, the use of unskilled workers by diffuse resource exploration, and the emergence of national low-end technological industrial sectors paying less for skilled labor than more advanced and predominant foreign-led industrial sectors.
J31|Voluntary work and labour income|The paper studies the effect of voluntary work on labour income for Italian employees. The Heckman and Instrumental Variables methods are used in order to control for self-selection bias of participation in labour market and endogeneity of volunteering. The results show that a wage premium of 3 - 4 percent of annual income emerges, when selection and endogeneity problems are taken into account
J31|Is the Use of Autocovariances in Level the Best in Estimating the Income Processes? A Simulation Study|In this simulation study, I compare the efficiency and finite sample bias of parameter estimators for popular income dynamic models using various forms of autocovariances. The dynamic models have a random walk or a heterogeneous growth permanent component, a persistent autoregressive component and a white noise transitory component. I compare the estimators using autocovariances in level, first differences (FD), and autocovariances between level and future first differences (LD), where the last one is new in the literature of income dynamics. To maintain the same information used as in using level covariances, I also augment the FD and LD covariances with level variances in the estimation. The results show that using level covariances can give rise to larger finite sample biases and larger standard errors than using covariances in FD and LD augmented by level variance. Without augmenting the level variances, LD provides more efficient estimators than FD in estimating the non-permanent components. I also show that LD provides a convenient test between random walk and heterogeneous growth models with good power.
J31|Market‐Based Incentives| In this article, we study market‐induced, external incentives similar to career concerns jointly with standard, contractual incentives linking compensation to performance. We consider a dynamic principal–agent problem in which the agent's outside option is determined endogenously in a competitive labor market. In equilibrium, strong performance increases the agent's market value. When this value becomes sufficiently high, the threat of the agent quitting forces the principal to increase the agent's compensation. The prospect of obtaining this raise gives the agent an incentive to exert effort, which reduces the need for standard incentives. In fact, whenever the agent's option to quit is sufficiently close to being “in the money,” the market‐induced incentive eliminates the need for standard incentives altogether: Compensation becomes completely insensitive to current performance.
J31|Do children spend too much time in schools? Evidence from a longer school year in Indonesia|I examine the effects of a longer school year in Indonesia on grade repetition, educational attainment, employability, and earnings. I exploit an arbitrary rule that assigned students to a longer school year in Indonesia in 1978–1979, which fits a fuzzy regression discontinuity design. I find the longer school year decreases the probability of grade repetition and increases educational attainment; it also increases the probability of working in formal sectors and wages later in life. These results suggest the length of school years in Indonesia is not too long.
J31|Heritability of Lifetime Income|Using 15 years of data on Finnish twins, we find that 24% (54%) of the variance of women’s (men’s) lifetime income is due to genetic factors and that the contribution of the shared environment is negligible. We link these figures to policy by showing that controlling for education reduces the variance share of genetics by 5-8 percentage points; by demonstrating that income uncertainty has a genetic component half the size of its variance share in lifetime income; and by exploring how the genetic heritability of lifetime income is related to the macroeconomic environment, as measured by GDP growth and the Gini-coefficient of income inequality.
J31|Employer’s moral hazard and wage rigidity|The standard explanation of wage rigidity in principal agent and in efficiency wage models is related to worker risk-aversion. However, these explanations do not consider at least two important classes of empirical evidence: (1) In worker cooperatives workers appear to behave in a less risk averse way than in for profit firms and to accept fluctuating wages; (2) The emerging experimental evidence on the employment contract shows that most workers prefer higher but more uncertain wages to lower fixed wages. Workers do not appear to express a preference for fixed wages in all situations and different ownership forms, in our case worker cooperatives and for-profit firms, behave in different ways when dealing with the trade-off between wage rigidity and employment fluctuations. More specifically, worker cooperatives are characterized, in relative terms, by fixed employment levels and fluctuating wages, while for-profit firms are characterized by fixed wages and fluctuating employment. Our paper reinterprets these stylized facts by focusing on the relationship between wage rigidity and worker risk aversion in light of the presence of employer post contractual opportunism. Contractual incompleteness and private information on the side of the employer can compound in favouring the pursuit of the employer’s objectives, when they diverge from the employee’s ones. The idea of employer moral hazard is able to disentangle the observed behavioural differences in different ownership forms. By resorting to the standard efficiency wage framework, we show that, in the presence of employer moral hazard, employees in capitalistic firms generally prefer fixed wage, accepting this way a positive risk of lay-off. On the contrary, one of the main functions of fluctuating wages in worker cooperatives is to minimize the risk of lay-off.
J31|Wage flexibility in the Chinese labour market, 1989–2009| Wage flexibility in the Chinese labour market, 1989–2009. Regional Studies. China’s bureaucratic wage determination system is gradually being replaced by a market-based system, leading to a novel version of a dual labour market. This paper studies wage flexibility in this dual market. Its principal findings are as follows: wages in both sectors have become less responsive to changes in official registered unemployment, with an alternative market-based measure of unemployment becoming more relevant; there is evidence of convergence of flexibility between the two sectors; the wages of women exhibit greater flexibility than those of men; and there is evidence of differences in wage flexibility between workers who have urban residential rights and rural migrants.
J31|The Great Recession and the Public-Private Wage Gap: Distributional Decomposition Evidence from Croatia 2008-2011|We study the pay gap between the public and the private sectors in Croatia just before and in the wake of the recent Great Recession. Using the Labor Force Survey data, we decompose the real hourly wage gap of full-time workers in 2008 and 2011 into the contributions of differences in workers’ characteristics and differences in marginal returns to these characteristics. Besides decomposing the gaps in the two years, we analyze the main drivers of changes in the 2008-2011 period. The decompositions are performed at the mean, as well as at a number of quantiles along the distribution. In addition to quantifying the aggregate effects of characteristics and their marginal returns, we further decompose each of the two effects into the contributions of specific characteristics or groups of them. For the decomposition of the mean gap, the standard Oaxaca-Blinder framework is used, while in the case of quantile decompositions, this framework is combined with the recently developed unconditional quantile regressions. The results show that in both 2008 and 2011 there was a notable wage premium in favor of the public sector workers along the entire distribution, with both the differences in characteristics and marginal returns playing a role. The premium in favor of the public sector increased in the period considered, driven almost exclusively by changes in marginal returns.
J31|The Impact of the 2008 Crisis on Top Labor Incomes in Turkey: A Nonparametric Analysis|This paper presents a nonparametric analysis of the impact of the 2008 crisis on earnings distribution in Turkey. Using micro-level data from the Household Labor Force Survey (2004-2011), I show that the crisis has operated most visibly above the upper quartile of the earnings distribution. I present three main findings: (1) the share of the top decile -- especially the top percentile -- has increased significantly right after the crisis, (2) the top quartile (i.e., the right tail) of labor incomes in Turkey resembles, on average, a Pareto distribution with a corresponding Gini coefficient of around 0.23, and (3) following the crisis, the earnings differentials have widened above the top quartile and wildly deviated from the Pareto form. I document that the changes observed right after the crisis have mostly been temporary; that is, a normalization process has operated in the aftermath of the crisis. I argue that the health of the domestic banking system might be an important determinant of the effect of large scale financial crises on top labor incomes. A sound banking system can generate income polarization in a country, when global crises lead to asymmetric income reallocations across sectors.
J31|Non-farm wages and poverty alleviation in developing countries|Abstract This paper is about rural non-farm income and poverty alleviation in sub-Saharan Africa and the determinants of differentials access to rural non-farm incomes, with an overview of trends in the magnitude, and location of rural poverty. It also offers evidence that advances our understanding of rural poverty, by presenting quantitative analysis of the determinants of rural income from farm and non-farm sources, drawing on data from Rural Income Generating Activities data base of 15 countries, complemented by demographic, health, production and income data from other sources. In order to reduce rural poverty, policies should concentrate both on improving household activities already available, most prominently farming and on expanding the range of potential activities of family members. The lessons from experience and much of the rural development literature is that the income generating potential, the ability to access and take advantage of activities, depending on access to fixed assets.
J31|Cyclical changes in the wage structure of the United Kingdom: a historical review of the GHS 1972-2002|This paper aims to investigate the cyclical changes in the wage structure of the United Kingdom over the period 1972-2002 using the General Household Survey (GHS). Wage structure of the UK shows a cyclical pattern, which may be from the different wage cyclicality of the top, middle and bottom percentile groups. Higher educated male workers have experienced a faster growth of the education premiums so that the wages of males have become more dispersed after the 1970s. However, female workers with only primary education have faster wage growth than higher educated ones. Moreover, the experience premiums of females have grown faster than males and become similar to males in recent years. Changes in the skill endowments and market valuation can account for the cyclical changes in female earnings structure over the entire period. The residual earnings inequality accounts for more than half changes in overall earnings inequality of males, which cannot be explained by changes in skill endowments and market returns. The evolution of the wage structure, including changes in gender gap, overall wage inequality, skill premiums as well as residual wage inequality are affected by business cycle.
J31|Good Firms, Worker Flows and Productivity|I present direct evidence on the role of firm-to-firm labor mobility in enhancing the productivity of firms located near highly productive firms. Using matched employer-employee and balance sheet data for the Veneto region of Italy, I identify a set of high-wage firms (HWF) and show they are more productive than other firms. I then show that hiring a worker with HWF experience increases the productivity of other (non-HWF) firms. A simulation indicates that worker flows explain 10-15 percent of the productivity gains experienced by other firms when HWFs in the same industry are added to a local labor market.

J31|Public-private sector wage differentials in Spain. An updated picture in the midst of the Great Recession|Using the recent Wage Structure Survey 2010, this article examines the public-private sector wage gaps in Spain across the whole earnings distribution and the incidence of the gender gap in both sectors of the economy. Firstly, we find that that there is positive wage premium to public sector employment which is not fully explained by employees’ observable characteristics. Furthermore, this premium concentrates on low-skilled workers, while high-skilled individuals in the public sector suffer a pay penalty. Secondly, the gender gap is substantially larger in the private sector. Lastly, we analyse what happens in some specific activities, Education and Human health and social work, where both public and private sector coexist to a large extent. We discuss several explanations for these findings, coherent with international evidence, and the possible implications of the current process of downsizing of public sector employment associated to austerity measures.

J31|Declining Labour Use in Agriculture : A Case of Rice Cultivation in Andhra Pradesh|The present paper examines the changing nature of labour use in rice cultivation in Andhra Pradesh. The study observed that there is a fast decline in labour use in respect of rice cultivation in Andhra Pradesh. All three forms of labour (family, casual and attached) have followed the same trend. But the share of casual labour in the total labour used in rice cultivation is increasing with a corresponding decline in the share of family labour. By gender, although both male and female labour use in rice cultivation has been declining, it is faster for female labour. Also, a noticeable decline in the share of harvesting and threshing/winnowing which are increasingly mechanized, in total labour used per hectare of rice cultivation. Between wage rate and labour inputs, it is observed that there are relatively higher female labour inputs per hectare in areas (Zones) where male wages are lower and vice versa.
J31|Employment in Poland 2011. Poverty and Jobs|It is with great pleasure that we present the seventh edition of ‘Employment in Poland’. This edition is devoted to the issue of poverty. Growth of prosperity is not distributed evenly among the Polish citizens, and some of them still cannot satisfy even basic needs. The improvement of an overall economic situation reduces risk of poverty in general. However, in case the risk occurs, efficient and effective support measures should be provided. First part of the report defines poverty, and explains the extent of the connection with such phenomena as economic deprivation or social exclusion. It is vital, as the exact criterion of poverty is ambiguous. Having discussed these issues, we elaborate on the characteristics of poverty in Poland as compared to those observed in other Member States of the European Union, as well as their regional and local dimensions. The key element of this part is to determine the causes of poverty, i.e. to what extent poverty results from the features of national and regional economy, and to what extent from individual characteristics of people. The topics introduced in this part form background for subsequent parts of the report. The second part is devoted to the poverty of certain social groups such as elderly, children, unemployed and rural. Conducted analyses allow to dispel some of the myths in this matter, as well as to bring out the characteristics that are particularly important from the perspective of creating the support instruments for groups that are at risk of poverty. The issue of poverty among children is scrutinised from the intergenerational perspective, and its determinants and possible measures of preventing the phenomenon are discussed. The third part focuses on relations between income inequalities and situation on the labour market. In this part changes in distribution of wages in Poland are confronted with the poverty dynamics. They are supplemented with a reflection on the impact on poverty exerted by changes in the Polish society, including (but not limited to) those concerning household structure or economic activity of women. The phenomenon of so called working poor is also scrutinised here. We determine, inter alia, whether the characteristics of household or of work performed are more important causes of in-work poverty. We also elaborate on the question if situation of poor households is persistent or low-paid employment enables them to get out of poverty. The fourth part discusses available tools and instruments to fight the poverty. The state of affairs described in first three parts allows to take a closer look on efficiency and effectiveness of social policy measures applied in Poland, both tax and benefit based. Special attention is drawn to the issue of financial support of families with children as an element of social and demographic policy. The key features of this part are simulations of the impact of hypothetical changes in currently functioning system on rate of poverty in Poland. The recommendations for public policy constitute the summary of the report.
J31|Market Mechanism and Skill Premiums in the UK 1972-2002|This paper examines the effect of shifts in the relative supply and demand of skills on the skill premiums and wage inequality in the British labour market 1972-2002. We test the Katz and Murphy (1992) hypothesis that the changes of skill premiums can be explained by their relative supply shifts, given stable or steadily growing relative demand. Alternatively, Machin (2001) hypothesis holds if the changes of skill premiums can be explained by relative demand shifts, given stable or steadily growing relative supply. From co-variation of relative skill wages and relative labour supplies of skills, we reject the hypothesis that the relative labour demand for skill is stable over time for either males or females. By using detrended relative skill wages and supplies, we infer that the acceleration of relative demand for skills caused a positive association between relative skill wages and labour supplies for males in the 1980s and the 2000s, and for females after the 1970s. Hence, the steadily growing relative demand in Katz and Murphy (1992) can only broadly fit with the cyclical co-variation of skill premiums and supply for males, but not for the long term increasing trend of skill premiums and supply of females. We find the acceleration of relative demand for skilled workers after the 1970s as suggested in Machin (2001) hypothesis.
J31|The immigrant-native pay gap in Germany|This note analyzes income differences between foreigners and natives in Germany. Using social survey data (ALLBUS) for 2012, I use Mincer style quantile regressions and Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions to estimate the size of the income differential. People not born in Germany, have an income lose for about 6,5 to 10 per cent. People with a foreign citizenship have even higher income losses. They face penalties between 8 to 14 percent. Decomposition shows a 9,2 percent difference for immigrants, while most of the gap is unexplained. Individuals without German citizenship have a 15,8 percent difference. Here more of the half remain unexplained.
J31|Informal versus formal search: Which yields better pay?|Estimates on the effect of job contact method -- i.e., informal versus formal search -- on wage offers vary considerably across studies, with some of them finding a positive correlation between getting help from informal connections and obtaining high-paying jobs, while others finding a negative one. In this paper, I investigate the sources of discrepancies in these empirical results. Using a formal job search framework, I derive an equilibrium wage distribution which reveals that the informal search yields for some groups higher and for some others lower wages than formal search. The key result is the existence of nonmonotonicities in wage offers. Two potential sources of these nonmonotonicities exist: (i) peer effects and (ii) unobserved worker heterogeneity in terms of the inherent cost of maintaining connections within a productive informal network. The model predicts that a greater degree of unobserved heterogeneity tilts the estimates toward producing a positive correlation between informal search and higher wages, whereas stronger peer influences tend to yield a negative correlation. This conclusion informs the empirical research in the sense that identification of the true correlation between job contact methods and wage offers requires a careful assessment of the unobserved heterogeneity and peer influences in the relevant sample.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J31|State-Dependence and Stepping-Stone Effects of Low-Pay Employment in Australia| Using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, this study shows that low-pay employment not only exhibits state-dependence, but it also has a stepping-stone effect towards higher pay, after observed and unobserved individual heterogeneity is accounted for. The results also show that, other things being equal, people who are on low pay are more likely to be in employment in the future than those who are either unemployed or not in the labour force. However, people on low pay do not appear to be more likely to become jobless in the future than those on higher pay.
J31|The Chilean Labor Market: Job Creation, Quality, Inclusiveness, and Future Challenges|This paper analyzes recent labor market developments in the Chilean economy. The evidence shows a booming labor market with strong job creation since 2010. Most of the jobs created during the past three years are quality jobs—that is, jobs with a written contract and whose employers have made the corresponding payments toward pensions, healthcare, and unemployment insurance. We show that a combination of economic growth and specific policies seems to be the driving force behind the strong creation of quality jobs. Additionally, we show that the rapid job creation has been inclusive and constitutes one of the potential explanations for the fall in income inequality observed during the past three years. However, a further reduction in income inequality remains an important challenge for the future. Greater access to a quality education for vulnerable groups is the key to achieving that goal.
J31|Is There Job Polarization at the Firm Level?|We perform decompositions and regression analyses that test for the routinization hypothesis and job polarization at the firm level, instead of the aggregate or industry level as in previous studies. Furthermore, we examine the technology-based explanations for routinization and job polarization at the firm level using firm-level R&D as an explanatory variable in the regressions. Our results for the intermediate education group and the routine occupation group are consistent with polarization at the firm level, i.e. disappearing middle due to technological change. These results are robust for accounting for dynamic selection effects.
J31|Comment on ‘‘Unemployment Compensation and Wages: Evidence from the German Hartz Reforms’’ by Stefan Arent and Wolfgang Nagl|Arent and Nagl (2013) use the BA Employment panel 1998-2007 to identify effects of the German Hartz reform and find that it caused a considerable reduction of wages. Our replication study suggests that their clear and strong conclusions are based on implausible assumptions regarding the error structure of their regression models and on a too coarse modelling of the time effects. They become blurred and weak once better estimates of the standard errors are obtained and the development of wages is investigated at a finer time grid. Furthermore, Arent and Nagl’s reform effects shrink considerably when a more appropriate price index is used to deflate the wages and when the censoring of wages is treated correctly. Methodological considerations suggest that their conclusions depend on several further daring and untested assumptions.
J31|A Persistente Desigualdade nas Grandes Cidades Brasileiras: o Caso de Brasília<BR>[The Persistent Inequality in the Great Brazilian Cities: The case of Brasília]|Using the censuses of 2000 and 2010, we have noticed that the inequality of the household per capita income in the biggest Brazilian cities did not show a trend of reduction, differently from the whole country. Also, the inequality in those cities is substantially higher than the Brazilian. We investigate the determinants of this high and persistent inequality for Brasília (Federal District). We use the static decomposition of the generalized entropy indexes and the decomposition by regression with the method of Fields and the Shapley value. We verified that the public sector was the main factor to explain why the inequality was kept high in the capital of Brazil. All the methods reached the same conclusion. While the shrinking differences on the education attainment of the population had an effect of reducing the inequality, the policy of paying better salaries to the public servants had the opposite effect, which preserved the high inequality. This policy induces the migration to Brasília and it has a long run impact on the retirements and pensions benefits, which perpetuates the disparities.

J31|Returns to Foreign Language Skills in a Developing Country: The Case of Turkey| This paper analyses the economic value of foreign languages in Turkey using data on some 6000 adult male wage-earners in 2007. We find positive earnings returns to proficiency in English and Russian, which increase with the level of competence. French and German skills are also positively rewarded, although their return seems mostly linked to the likelihood to hold specific occupations. In contrast, knowing Arabic does not generate an earnings premium. Focusing on English, we check for heterogeneous returns along the conditional earnings distribution. The results are qualitatively invariant when we account for misclassification errors in self-reported English skills.
J31|Job Promotion in Mid-Career: Gender, Recession and ‘Crowding’|Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 indicate that between 1996 and 2010 females on average lost some of the promotion momentum they had achieved at the beginning of mid-career, although they outperformed males in this regard. For both genders economic downturn has contributed to reduced promotion probabilities. In the case of women, however, cohort effects rather than the cycle seem to explain the promotion experience during the Great Recession. Promotions translate into higher real wage increases, and typically more so where job responsibilities increase. Crowding effects, if not necessarily a thing of the past, are no longer manifested in reduced female promotion rates or earnings.
J31|Creative accounting in the British Industrial Revolution: Cotton manufacturers and the ‘Ten Hours’ Movement|The paper examines an early case of creative accounting, and how, during British industrialization, accounting was enlisted by the manufacturers’ interest to resist demands, led by the ‘Ten hours’ movement, for limiting the working day. In contrast to much of the prior literature, which argues that entrepreneurs made poor use of accounting techniques in the British industrial revolution, the paper shows that there was considerable sophistication in their application to specific purposes, including political lobbying and accounting for the accumulation of capital. To illustrate lobbying behaviour, the paper examines entrepreneurs’ use of accounting to resist the threat of regulation of working time in textile mills. It explains why accounting information became so important in the debate over factory legislation. In doing so, it shows that a significant element was the accounting evidence of one manufacturer in particular, Robert Hyde Greg, which had a strong impact on the outcome of the parliamentary process. The paper uses archival evidence to illustrate how accounting was used in Greg’s enterprise and the reality of its economic performance. The archival evidence of actual performance is then contrasted with the figures presented by Greg to the Factories Inquiry Commission, convened by the House of Commons in 1833-1834 to hear witnesses from the manufacturing interest. These sets of figures are compared and contrasted and discrepancies noted. Conclusions show that the discrepancies were substantial, motivated by Greg’s incentives to present a particular view of low profits, high fixed costs, and the threat of cheaper overseas competition. The figures appeared to lend some credibility to the apparent plight of manufacturers and to Nassau Senior’s flawed argument about all profit being earned in the ‘last hour’ of the working day. The consequence was a setback for the Ten Hours movement, leading to a further intensification of political struggles over working conditions in the 1840s.
J31|Male-Female Labor Market Participation and the Extent of Gender-Based Wage Discrimination in Turkey|A gender differential in wages is considered to be discriminatory if the differential cannot be explained by gender differences in productivity. Numerous studies have been performed to measure the extent of gender wage discrimination in countries across the world, and most report a substantial amount of wage differential after adjusting for productivity differences. This differential has been attributed to labor market discrimination against women. Using data from 2003 and 2010 Household Budget Surveys conducted by Turkish Statistical Institute, this study examines the male-female earnings differentials and measures the extent of pay discrimination in Turkey. To analyze the components of the earnings gap, two methodologies are employed: The standard Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition method and the Juhn–Murphy–Pierce decomposition method. The results of the study indicate that in both years, a significant portion of the observed wage differential is attributable to wage discrimination which records a rise over the period.
J31|Wages and Labour Productivity: the role of performance-related pay in Italian firms|This paper analyses the role of Performance Related Pay (PRP) agreements on labour productivity and wages. Its main contribution is thus to investigate the effects of PRP on both dimensions, i.e. productivity and distribution, whereas most of the studies of related literature are restricted to one of those aspects. All estimates are performed for a large sample of manufacturing and service Italian firms with more than five employees and a restricted sample including only unionised firms. It allows us to focus on a relevant feature of industrial relations represented by worker representation and its role in local wage setting in the Italian economy. The expected positive link between PRP and firm performance has been confirmed in all estimates, also controlling for a rich set of covariates. Furthermore, the comparison of productivity estimates with those for wages allows us to ascertain that payments by results might be not only rent-sharing devices, but schemes that substantially lead to efficiency enhancements. These findings have been validated by a number of robustness checks, also taking into account endogen eity by using instrumental variables and the treatments of 3SLS. The paper argues that well designed policies, that circumvent the limited implementation of PRP practices, would guarantee productivity improvement. The real effectiveness of these measures would not be weakened under union governance.
J31|Whither Income Inequalities?|Some major trends in world income inequalities and relevant economic trends are reviewed here. In recent decades, there have been indications of a reversal of the growing income divergence between North and South after over half a millennium, especially in the last two centuries. Meanwhile, income inequalities within most countries have been growing again, increasing social tensions, which may jeopardize growth in some countries and reshape global economic competition. In the 1960s, when the profit rate and capital’s share of national income in Western countries were highest, income inequality within countries was at a historical low. Since the 1980s, the increasing share of profits in national income and rising inequality within countries have gone hand in hand.
J31|The impact of immigration on the labour market: Evidence from 20 years of cross-border migration to Argentina|This paper studies the effects of immigration on the wages of Argentinean native workers over the period 1993-2012. I use a novel micro-dataset which combines household surveys from Argentina and six other Latin American countries. Immigration from these six countries accounts for 95% of the total immigration from Latin American countries. The empirical strategy identifies the effects of the labour supply variation using the “national approach” from Borjas (2003) and a reduced form equation obtained within a CES framework. In order to account for demand/pull shocks, I propose a set of instruments based on labour market conditions in immigrants’ home countries. An alternative specification also explores the hypothesis of heterogeneous impact by country of origin. Overall, findings show a significant negative impact of immigration on wages. IV estimates suggest that OLS results are a lower bound for the (partial) causal effect. Thus, if confounding demand factors exist, they bias the results toward zero.
J31|Farm profitability and Labour Use Efficiency|Appropriate choice of cropping systems to local agro-ecology increases profitability and employment. The increased labour shortage and reduced profitability are growing concerns to the farmers. Keeping this, the paper written with the following objectives: i) To assess the profitability among different cropping systems in the semi-arid tropics; ii) To assess the labour use pattern among different cropping systems and farm size; iii) To determine the resource use efficiency of the different cropping systems in the SAT India; and finally iv) To assess the influence of regional/local factors on incomes of farmers in the SAT India. The study used plot wise data collected from 16 villages from India for the crop year 2010. And it also estimated the resource use efficiency especially labour across different farm size groups in the SAT India and finally to assess the influence of regional/local factors on profitability of farmers. The study shows that input intensive cropping systems like cotton, paddy, wheat, fruits and vegetables based cropping systems are more profitable across many of the SAT villages compared to coarse cereals, pulses and oilseeds based cropping systems. Most of the villages are experiencing the shortage of labour as indicated by higher marginal productivity of labour and increasing trend of mechanisation. Farm size is having positive association with the hired labour use and farm mechanisation, but having negative association with family labour. Female employment has inverted “U” shape relation with farm size. This indicates that the farms with more than five hectares of land are detrimental to women employment as farm mechanization in large farms replaces women labour.
J31|When Are Appearances Deceiving? The Nature of the Beauty Premium|We design a laboratory experiment to illuminate the channels through which relatively more attractive individuals receive higher wages. Specifically, we are able to distinguish taste-based discrimination from rational statistical discrimination and biased beliefs. Using three realistic worker tasks to increase the external validity of our results, we find that the “beauty premium” is highly task-specific: while relatively more attractive workers receive higher wage bids in a bargaining task, there is no such premium in either an analytical task or a data entry task. The premium in the bargaining task is driven by biased beliefs about worker performance. We find that there is substantial learning after worker- specific performance information is revealed, highlighting the importance of accounting for longer-run interactions in studies of discrimination.
J31|Ücret Yapışkanlığı Hipotezi'nin Test Edilmesi: Türkiye'de Asgari Ücret ve Büyüme Üzerine Zaman Serileri Analizi (2005-2012)<BR>[Testing Wage Rigidity Stickiness Hypothesis: Time Series Analysis on the Minimum Wage and Growth in Turkey (2005-2012)]|Classical economics envisaged to reach the subsistence level of wages in the long term. Keynes, however, argued that it would be sticky downward wages with trade union activities. Since the 1930s, governments have begun to phase out the laws of the minimum wage to support employees' income levels. Thus, the minimum wage has emerged as a wage stickiness. Although wages are rising long-term interest rates are still low production continue to receive. Economistic analysis suggests that the wages due to the excessive rise in inflation would lead to a wage-price hollyzone. Therefore, the pressure being created unemployment, is under pressure and wage on different grounds. In this study, Turkey's economy by applying the method of time series with quarterly data for the period 2005:01-2012:03, the minimum wage, wage stickiness analyzes the impact. At the beginning of the conclusions reached, the minimum wage, high shear between the poverty line, the food poverty line is that it exceeded; an interaction increases in inflation and GDP are not sufficiently supported by the results obtained. In addition, due to high unemployment, low minimum wage, the markets pulled down to the level of the current wage and the minimum wage increasing employment obtained.
J31|The Bargaining Power of Health Care Unions: Union Wage Premiums for Registered Nurses in Hospitals|For the first time in its history, the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses in 2008 includes a question involving union status. This study utilizes the data from this sample to estimate the union/non-union wage premium for registered nurses and among some of the occupational, workplace, and individual characteristics. The study finds that standard union wage premium estimates for registered nurses are relatively larger than what were revealed in other recent studies. Upon inspection of various characteristics of registered nurses, the study finds a positive wage gap for union nurses only as experience increases; and with respect to characteristics of the workplace, there is no statistical evidence in the sample that suggests a wage gap for registered nurses in the public or private sector. Finally, a positive wage gap is found for union nurses working in hospitals. The lattermost finding is particularly interesting given the recent change in labor law that may have influenced the bargaining power of health care unions.
J31|A quarter of a century: mobility and stagnation in India’s rural labour market|Transformation of the countryside from agrarian subsistence economy to non-farm monetised economy is propagated as a precursor of growth and development and involves shifting of labour from farming to off-farm activities. India has started its journey in this path but has a long way to go. Researchers also question whether the changing pattern of rural labour is a positive phenomenon or a distress one. This paper attempts to examine the complexity of changes in rural labour market in India over a quarter of a century to untangle the dynamics. It is observed that the changes taking place are not always conducive to progress as a large part of it is distress driven. While some social groups are going up the ladder, a large mass of the others are stagnating in same or similar occupations. It appears that agriculture still holds the key to rural development. A three pronged strategy of agricultural progress, human capital formation, and rural industrialisation is necessary for breaking the shackles of continuity and usher in changes that are real rather than apparent.
J31|The Impact of Working while Enrolled in College on Wages|Those students who work while enrolled in college are investing in their human capital, and therefore, corporations looking to employ new workers entering the labor market may favor these types of students, and create incentives for non-working students to seek employment. Using NLSY97 data, this paper finds that working while enrolled in college decreases the wages one receives. Therefore, students who are not working while enrolled in school may have higher grades and graduate more frequently on time, causing firms to hire the non-working students more favorably.
J31|Ecarts de salaire entre hommes et femmes au Cameroun : Discrimination ou Capital humain ? Une approche par sous groupes<BR>[Gender wage gap : Discrimination or Human Capital? A subgroup approach]|The working population is becoming more and more feminized from 2000 to 2008 in Cameroon. Women receive on average a salary lower than that of the men and the sex remains a significant determiner of the professional position in Cameroon. From Oaxaca-Blinder(1973)decomposition, this work suggests studying gender wage gap composition in private and para public sectors by using subgroup approach. Results show that wage gap is estimated to 8.8% in favor of men. This gap is higher for employees aged more than 70 years. Women of this class are more discriminated. Unexplained part is 70%.On the other hand,gap and unexplained part is more and more high for highest wages.
J31|Poverty : A Corporate Creation and Ratio Controls for Eradication|Poverty is an inability to buy the basic needs (Food, Shelter and Clothing) by a household, within their earnings. This is not the fault of the house holds. But it is a creation of the Corporate sectors producing/distributing the basic need items. They inflate the prices of these commodities on a continuous basis to absorb their cost of mismanagement and luxury needs of their management and employees. This could be controlled and poverty can be eradicated, if these corporate sectors perform within an Operating Ratio (Cost+Expense/Net revenue) of 75%. This is proved with facts and figures from Developing and Developed nations. This provides a leverage for profits without any price increase. Also, the supply quantum of the basic needs over years, should be in the same proportion of the Population increase OR Population should be controlled within the possible quantum increase of the basic needs.
J31|The Impact of Minimum Wages on Employment, Wages and Welfare: The Case of Vietnam|The paper investigates the impact of recent minimum wage changes on wages, employment and household welfare in Vietnam. It finds that minimum wage changes reduce the total number of wage workers (especially in domestic firms) and increases the incidence of self-employment. The number of wage workers declines because many wage workers with informal contracts lose their jobs, but only a fraction of the job loss is absorbed by the creation of self-employment or formal jobs. In addition, minimum wages help raise the average wages of workers who keep their jobs. In terms of welfare, an increase in minimum wage reduces poverty and raises household income and consumption expenditure, most importantly in education-related expenditures.
J31|Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Sex Discrimination|Earlier literature on the gender pay gap has taught us that occupations matter and so do firms. However, the role of the firm has received little scrutiny; occupations have most often been coded in a rather aggregate way, lumping together different jobs; and the use of samples of workers prevents any reliable determination of either the extent of segregation or the relative importance of access to firms versus occupations. Our contribution is twofold. We provide a clear measure of the impact of the allocation of workers to firms and to job titles shaping the gender pay gap. We also provide a methodological contribution that combines the estimation of sets of high-dimensional fixed effects and Gelbach's (2009) unambiguous decomposition of the conditional gap. We find that one fifth of the gender pay gap results from segregation of workers across firms and one fifth from job segregation. We also show that the widely documented glass ceiling effect operates mainly through worker allocation to firms rather than occupations.
J31|Mind the gap! The relative wages of immigrants in the Portuguese labour market|Using matched employer-employee data, we examine the wage gaps between immigrant and native workers in the Portuguese labour market in the 2002-2008 period. We use the relation between the Gelbach’s and Oaxaca-Blinder’s decompositions to split the unconditional average wage gap as the sum of a composition effect and a wage structure effect. Most of the wage gap is not due to worst endowments of the immigrants but to differences in the returns to those characteristics and to the immigrant status effect. In particular, education and foreign experience of the average immigrants are significantly less valued in the Portuguese labour market. Overall, the wages of immigrants do not fully converge to those of comparable natives as experience in the Portuguese labour market increases. The assimilation rates tend to be stronger in the first years after migration and for immigrants with higher levels of pre-immigration experience. Total immigrants are a heterogeneous group of different nationalities, with immigrants from the EU15 and China starring as the two extreme cases.
J31|Survey evidence on price and wage rigidities in Portugal|This paper exploits the information collected from a survey conducted on a sample of Portuguese firms to study the patterns of firms’ price and wage adjustments and the extent of nominal price and wage rigidities. The evidence shows that the frequency of price changes varies substantially across sectors and depends on a number of factors such as the intensity of competition, the share of labour costs and firms’ price reviewing behaviour. The results also show that wages are more flexible in those firms where the fraction of permanent and high-skilled workers is lower and where the share of flexible pay components is higher.
J31|The Effect of Educational Mismatch on Wages Using European Panel Data| This paper analyzes the effect of educational mismatch on wages, using a rich panel dataset of workers in the major euro area countries from 2006 to 2009, drawn from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (Eurostat). We use a consistent estimator to address the two econometric problems faced by the empirical literature: the omitted variable bias and measurement error. In principle, our fixed effect estimates confirm that overeducated workers suffer a wage penalty of similar magnitude to the return on each year of schooling attained. Interestingly, when we split the sample by age, we find that the wages of people aged under 35 basically depend on the level of education attained, while those of workers aged over 35 depend on job educational requirements. These results are interpreted taking into account the impact of the depreciation of skills on human capital. The main policy implication of the paper is that overeducation constitutes a waste of resources. Therefore public authorities should seek to reduce the negative impact of overeducation on the labor market.

J31|The role of non-cognitive and cognitive skills, behavioural and educational outcomes in accounting for the intergenerational transmission of worklessness|Previous work has shown that there is a significant intergenerational correlation of worklessness for the UK which varies across local labour markets (Macmillan, 2011). Using a decomposition from the intergenerational mobility literature (Blanden et. al, 2007), this research is the first to consider the drivers of this transmission. I consider the role of four sets of characteristics of the son in childhood; his non-cognitive skills, cognition, behavioural outcomes and educational attainment, to assess which characteristics are important predictors of later workless spells and whether those characteristics are associated with growing up with a workless father. The wide range of characteristics can only account for 12% of the intergenerational transmission, with the vast majority remaining unaccounted for. While cognition and education dominate the intergenerational transmission of incomes, non-cognitive skills and behavioural outcomes play a more important role in the intergenerational transmission of worklessness. Many of the characteristics considered become increasingly important predictors of future worklessness as the unemployment rate in the local labour market increases. This descriptive analysis suggests that there are benefits to improving the soft skills of the most disadvantaged children, alongside their attainment, to ensure a successful connection with the labour market in adulthood.
J31|Understanding income mobility: the role of education for intergenerational income persistence in the US, UK and Sweden|A growing number of studies in several countries over the past twenty years have documented the persistence in incomes across generations, and much of the current literature is seeking to understand the processes driving intergenerational mobility and how these differ across time periods and across countries. Education is commonly seen, just as in sociological studies of social mobility or status attainment, as the key driving force of intergenerational associations. In this paper we study the role of education for intergenerational income associations in three countries over time, and across the life-span of sons. We pay particular attention to issues of life-cycle bias and measurement error in modelling income mobility in a comparative setting. To explore the role of education, we utilise a three-stage framework that decomposes the intergenerational elasticity into three parts: the relationship between income and education, the returns to education, and the direct relationship between parental income and their childâ€™s income in the next generation after controlling for education. We find that the US and the UK have high levels of income persistence (low mobility) across generations while Sweden is more moderate. Levels of educational inequality are surprisingly similar in all three countries with the majority of the difference between the US/UK and Sweden working through unequal returns to education and, more strikingly, inequality of opportunities for people with similar educational qualifications.

J31|The Food Crisis. Implications for Labor|Food prices have gone up to prohibitive levels for many of the world’s poor. The vast majority of those who are hungry in the world today are working in agriculture, either as small landholders or as waged agricultural workers. The majority of the food producers have not benefited from rising prices. Apparently, the bargaining power of many producers, just as that of the end consumers, has been weakened vis-à-vis the buyers and retailers of agricultural produce. This powerlessness is also in the face of governments that fail to provide an appropriate infrastructure for smallholders and social protection. The first part of the book provides an introduction to the immediate and structural causes of the food crisis. The second part contains contributions that not only highlight the plight of rural labour but also develop tools for measuring the decent work deficit. The last part emphasizes income security as a major precondition for food security. It looks at the experiences of Brazil and India with the extension of social protection for the poor.
J31|Frictional wage dispersion with Bertrand competition: an assessment|I examine whether a version of the Cahuc et al. (2006) model can match the magnitude of wage dispersion, as measured by the ratio of the average and the lowest wage - the so-called mean-min ratio of Hornstein et al. (2011). I find that the workers' bargaining power is a crucial parameter: the mean-min ratio strictly decreases in the bargaining power up to a point near 1/2 and is essentially flat thereafter, generating the same amount of wage dispersion as the canonical wage ladder model, which is a special case of the CPVR model. Consequently, this model can yield large wage dispersion only for low bargaining power on the workers' side. I show that the share of job-to-job transitions with wage drops is decreasing in the bargaining power, calibrate the latter to the former, and demonstrate that the CPVR model generates an empirically plausible amount of wage dispersion. I also show that negative wages arise when workers have no bargaining power, and discuss the implications for the empirical findings of Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002b). (Copyright: Elsevier)
J31|Dynamic Effects of Labor Supply: a mechanism explaining cross-sectional differences in hours|This paper first establishes the empirical fact that over the last quarter of the 20th century, the average weekly hours worked increased for workers in the highest wage quintile while it decreased for the ones at the lowest. In 1976, a worker in the lowest quintile worked 2.8 hours more per week than a high wage worker (worker in the highest quintile), but by 2006, the low wage worker worked 1 hour less. During this period, there was also a wide increase in wage inequality. The typical mechanism in which hours are only determined by contemporaneous wages cannot simultaneously explain the pattern found in both variables for every quintile. This paper attempts to reconcile these cross-sectional trends in both hours and wages for the U.S. during this time period. As a first step, we show that compositional changes (in education, occupation and age) within quintiles can only explain a fraction of the observed pattern. Next, we propose a mechanism in which individuals' current decisions of how much to work take into account two components: the contemporaneous benefit of the wage received, and also how current hours worked affects the probability of moving across the wage distribution in later periods. The latter dynamic component is estimated from our dataset. We find that changes over time in how hours affect these probabilities provided incentives that differ across the quintiles, and are consistent with the labor supply decisions observed in the data. We incorporate these two components into an equilibrium model of heterogeneous agents with uninsurable income risk. We are able to replicate the decline in hours for the bottom of the distribution as well as the increase at the top. The ratio of hours worked between the two groups delivered by the model also fits the trend found in the data. (Copyright: Elsevier)
J31|Is Technological Change Biased Towards the Unskilled in Services? An Empirical Investigation|I fit a two-sector general equilibrium model to U.S. data in 1963-2005 in order to infer technological processes that affect the college premium. In skill intensive services factor augmenting technological change is slower for college graduates relative to less skilled workers. I find the opposite in the rest of the economy. This indicates that technological change is more complex than what we observe at the aggregate level. The results are consistent with changes in occupational mixes: low-skill workers in services reallocate into computer complementary occupations to a greater extent than college graduates in that sector. Occupational mixes in the rest of the private sector shift in the opposite direction. Thus, theoretical treatments of the underlying mechanisms of skill biased technological change may be improved by taking into account occupational mixes within broad education-sector groups.

J31|On the Persistence of Income Shocks over the Life Cycle: Evidence, Theory, and Implications|How does the persistence of earnings change over the life cycle? Do workers at different ages face the same variance of idiosyncratic earnings shocks? This paper proposes a novel specification for residual earnings that allows for an age profile in the persistence and variance of labor income shocks. We show that the statistical model is identified, and we estimate it using Panel Study of Income Dynamics data. We find that shocks to earnings are only moderately persistent (around 0.75) for young workers. Persistence rises with age, up to unity, until midway through life. The variance of persistent shocks exhibits a U-shaped profile over the life cycle (with a minimum of 0.01 and a maximum of 0.05). These results suggest that the standard specification in the literature (with age-invariant persistence and variance) cannot capture the earnings dynamics of young workers. We also argue that a calibrated job turnover model can account for these nonflat profiles. The key idea is that workers sort into better jobs and settle down as they age; in turn, magnitudes of wage growth rates decline, thereby decreasing the variance of shocks. Furthermore, the decline in job mobility results in higher persistence. Finally, we investigate the implications of age profiles for consumptionâ€“savings behavior. The welfare cost of idiosyncratic risk implied by the age-dependent income process is up to 1.6 percent of lifetime consumption lower compared with its age-invariant counterpart. This difference is mostly due to a higher degree of consumption insurance for young workers, for whom persistence is moderate. These results suggest that age profiles of persistence and variances should be taken into account when calibrating life-cycle models. (Copyright: Elsevier)
J31|Math Matters: Student Ability, College Majors, and Wage Inequality|This paper assess increasing wage inequality by showing that the top deciles of college earners are enjoying significant relative wage growth, which is underpinned by the link between ex ante math ability, math-heavy college majors and highly quantitative occupations. This mechanism is further strengthened by the strong and accelerating shift away from math-heavy college majors and occupations. We develop a general equilibrium model with multiple education choices whose outcomes depends on ex ante abilities, coupled with preferences, that lead to occupational opportunities that mimic the facts presented. This research shows that a large portion of wage inequality is determined by initial math/quantitative abilities. Furthermore, these results imply that policy measures aimed at increasing college enrollment to decrease wage inequality do not address the underlying process and, in some cases, may exacerbate wage inequality.
J31|Stochastic Search Equilibrium| We study equilibrium wage and employment dynamics in a class of popular search models with wage posting, in the presence of aggregate productivity shocks. Firms offer and commit to (Markov) contracts, which specify a wage contingent on all payoff-relevant states, but must pay equally all of their workers, who have limited commitment and are free to quit at any time. We find sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a stochastic search equilibrium in such contracts, which is Rank Preserving [RP]: larger and more productive firms offer more generous contracts to their workers in all states of the world. On the RP equilibrium path, turnover is always efficient as workers always move from less to more productive firms. The resulting stochastic dynamics of firm size provide an intuitive explanation for the empirical finding that large employers have more cyclical job creation ( Moscarini and Postel-Vinay, 2012 ). Finally, computation of RP equilibrium contracts is tractable. Copyright 2013, Oxford University Press.
J31|Better Workers Move to Better Firms: A Simple Test to Identify Sorting|We propose a test that uses information on workers’ mobility, wages and firms’ profits to identify the sign and strength of assortative matching. The basic intuition underlying our empirical strategy is that, in the presence of positive (negative) assortative matching, good workers are more (less) likely to move to better firms than bad workers. Assuming that agents’ payoffs are increasing in their own types allows us to use within-firm variation on wages to rank workers by their types and firm profits to rank firms. We exploit a panel data set that combines Social Security earnings records for workers in the Veneto region of Italy with detailed balance-sheet information for employers. We find robust evidence that positive assortative matching is a pervasive phenomenon in the labor market. This result is in contrast with what we find from correlating the worker and firm fixed effects in standard Mincerian wage equations.
J31|Post schooling human capital investments and the life cycle variance of earnings|We propose an original model of human capital investments after leaving school in which individuals differ in their initial human capital obtained at school, their rate of return, their costs of human capital investments and their terminal values of human capital at a fixed date in the future. We derive a tractable reduced form Mincerian model of log earnings profiles along the life cycle which is written as a linear factor model in which levels, growth and curvature of earnings profiles are individual-specific. Using panel data from a single cohort of French male wage earners observed over a long span of 30 years, a random effect model is estimated first by pseudo maximum likelihood methods. This step is followed by a simple second step fixed effect method by which individual-specific structural parameters are estimated. This allows us to test restrictions, compute counterfactual profiles and evaluate how earnings inequality over the life-cycle is affected by changes in structural parameters. Under some conditions, even small changes in life expectancy seem to imply large changes in earnings inequality.
J31|Sorting by skill over the course of job search|We use novel high-frequency panel data on individuals' job applications from an online job posting engine to study (1) whether at the beginning of search job seekers with different levels of education (skill) apply to different jobs, and (2) how search behavior changes as search continues. First, we find that there is sorting by skill at the beginning of search. Second, as search continues, job seekers apply to different types of jobs than at the beginning of search. In particular, assuming that sorting at the beginning of search is positive, as search continues there is less sorting by education and job seekers, on average, apply to lower quality jobs.
J31|Comparative Advantage and Risk Premia in Labor Markets|Using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) we estimate quarterly labor earnings risk across 21 industries of the US economy. We document a significant and positive association between earnings risk (both permanent and transitory) and average log-earnings across industries. The Finance sector is 50% riskier than Government which implies a mean earnings premium of 20%. We develop an equilibrium framework to analyze the interplay between volatility in labor earnings and comparative advantage in determining the level of earnings across industries. We use the model to decompose how much of the empirical correlation represents compensation for risk and how much represents selection. The positive association between permanent risk and earnings is compensation for risk, but selection is responsible for the observed relationship between temporary risk and mean earnings.
J31|Bidding for teams|We develop a simple competing job auction model to study wages and employment within teams. If synergies favor larger teams, the basic competing job auction model predicts that workers are generally paid a wage less than their marginal product of labor and that there is too much entry of firms. We then extend the model to allow for workplace competition. In this case, the firms can also compete by a commitment to job amenities and a minimum scale of operation. We then find that wages are always equal to the marginal product of labor and entry of firms is efficient.
J31|Career progression, economic downturns, and skills|This paper analyses the career progression of skilled and unskilled workers with a focus on how careers are affected by economic downturns and whether formal skills, acquired early on, can shield workers from the effect of recessions. Using detailed administrative data for Germany for numerous birth cohorts across different regions, we follow workers from labour market entry onwards and estimate a dynamic life-cycle model of vocational training choice, labour supply, and wage progression. Most particularly, our model allows for labour market frictions that vary by skill group and over the business cycle. We find that sources of wage growth differ: learning-by-doing is an important component for unskilled workers early on in their careers, while job mobility is important for workers who acquire skills in an apprenticeship scheme before labour market entry. Likewise, economic downturns affect skill groups through very different channels: unskilled workers lose out from a decline in productivity and human capital, whereas skilled individuals suffer mainly from lack of mobility.
J31|Non-Formal Education, Overeducation And Wages|Why do overeducated workers participate in non-formal education activities? Do they not suffer from an excess of education? Using microdata from the Spanish sample of the 2007 Adult Education Survey, we have found that overeducated workers participate more than the rest in nonformal education and that they earn higher wages than overeducated workers who did not participate. This result can be interpreted as evidence that non-formal education allows overeducated workers to acquire new abilities that improve their competence at the job they perform. Our results support the European Commission’s view on the need to reinforce lifelong learning among the adult population.
J31|Young Workers, Marital Status And Wage Gap|This paper analyses whether marital status has a significant effect on wages and whether it is a determinant of the gender gap. We use the stochastic frontier approach to explain the differences between the potential and the observed wage that an individual could obtain, given his or her human capital endowment. We construct a balanced panel of wage earners from the European Community Household Panel Survey (ECHP), from 1995 to 2001. The sample is of young workers that remain seven consecutive years in the labour market. Our results show that a significant part of the gender wage gap (distance to the frontier) suffered by married women in Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom is not attributable to differences in human capital endowment or personal and job-related characteristics.
J31|Discriminación Salarial De Género Y Pobreza En Cataluña|Este trabajo analiza los beneficios de la eliminación de la discriminación salarial de género en la erradicación de la pobreza en Cataluña. A partir de los datos de la Encuesta de Condiciones de Vida (ECV) para el periodo entre 2005 y 2009, calculamos una distribución contrafactual de los ingresos de los hogares en la que las mujeres son remuneradas por sus características igual que los hombres. Los resultados nos permiten predecir una reducción del riesgo de pobreza para el conjunto de la población catalana de entre un 1,5 y un 2%, siendo los niños (y especialmente los adolescentes) algunos de los colectivos más beneficiados. A la luz de los resultados, argumentamos que las medidas que intentan igualar la posición de las mujeres y los hombres en el mercado de trabajo, deberían contemplarse como una política más de lucha contra la pobreza.
J31|The Nature of the Finnish Competitiveness Problem|Abstract We assess Finland’s competitiveness in the light of various, mainly short-term indicators. It turns out that the weak export market performance over the last few years is linked to the deterioration of profitability of production in Finland. A better export and employment performance requires a decline of relative unit labour costs and an improvement of business profitability. Wage moderation is necessary for this to happen. On the other hand, the determinants of Finland’s long-term competitiveness are quite good and maintaining and developing them should remain a key element of economic policy also in the future.
J31|Rent Seeking at Plant Level: An Application of the Card-de la Rica Tenure Model to Workers in German Works Councils|Low-skilled workers enjoy a large wage advantage in German works council establishments. Since job tenure is also longer for these workers, one explanation might be rent-seeking. If the premium is a compensating wage differential (or a return to unmeasured ability), it should not lead to higher tenure; whereas if it is (partly) rent, lower quits should lead to longer tenure at plants with works councils. Our analysis uses the Card and de la Rica (2006) tenure model, and although the association between skill level and the works council tenure gap is positive it fails to achieve statistical significance in a single equation framework. However, running the tenure equation for separate skill quintiles, we find that those with the highest wage premium have the greatest tenure. As a result, although we cannot be certain that the works council wage mark-up of low-skilled workers is necessarily a non-competitive rent, the observed pattern of job tenure across different skill subsamples is not after all inconsistent with rent-seeking behavior.
J31|Technological Change, Skill Demand, and Wage Inequality in Indonesia|This paper examines the empirical implications of technological changes for skill demand and wage inequality in Indonesia. According to the National Labor Force Survey of Indonesia, the share of educated workers and wage skill premium increased significantly over 2003–2009 for overall industry and across the region. An analysis based on demand–supply framework suggests that demand shifts favoring skilled workers during the period. The decomposition of labor demand shifts shows that they were driven not only by reallocation of labor forces between industries but also by change within industries, particularly among formal workers, suggesting evidence of skill-biased technological changes. The empirical evidence from the data of manufacturing firms suggest that diffusion of new technologies through imported materials and foreign direct investment caused greater demand for skilled labor and higher wage inequality in the manufacturing sector.
J31|Intrinsic Motivation in the Labor Market: Not Too Much, Thank You|We study the screening problem of a firm that needs to hire a worker to produce output and that observes neither the productive ability nor the intrinsic motivation of the worker applying for the job. We completely characterize the set of optimal contracts and we show that it is always in the firm’s interest to hire all types of worker, even the worst ones, and to offer different contracts to different types of employees. Interestingly, the highest social welfare attains when motivation is high but not so much as to become more significant than productive ability. Moreover, when motivation is very high, incentives force the firm to offer a strictly positive wage to workers who derive a positive utility from effort exertion and who become paid volunteers. These results prove that very high motivation is not a desirable workers’ characteristic.
J31|Gender Wage-Productivity Differentials and Global Integration in China|In the absence of discrimination, there should be no wage-productivity differentials as relative wages should be equal to the relative marginal productivity levels of workers. This paper investigates the role of globalization on the structure and evolution of gender differentials in China by simultaneously estimating demand-side wage and productivity outcomes using nonlinear least squares. The analyses are based on a comprehensive population-wide panel survey of manufacturing firms between the years of 2004 and 2007, covering 94 percent of total industry output and providing an accurate representation of labor demand. The results suggest that more exposure to globalization through increased exports is associated with lower gender wage-productivity differentials, and more exposure through increased foreign investment leads to differentials in favor of female workers. On the other hand, gender discrimination is found to be prevalent among domestically owned and non-exporting firms.
J31|Privatization In China: Technology And Gender In The Manufacturing Sector|" type=""main"" xml:id=""coep12071-abs-0001""> This paper examines the impact of privatization on gender discrimination in China across firms with different technology intensities. Using a comprehensive firm-level survey, the paper identifies gender wage-productivity differentials by directly estimating the relative productivity levels of workers from the production function of firms. The panel structure of the survey is taken advantage of by following firms that were fully state-owned in the initial year, and distinguishing them from firms that were later privatized. The main results show that privatization was associated with an increase in relative productivity of female workers in high technology industries, and a reduction in relative productivity of female workers in low technology industries. Time varying coefficient results suggest that the improvements in gender outcomes in high technology industries may not be maintained in the long run as the relative wage and productivity ratios tend to deteriorate, potentially due to low supply of highly educated female workers. At the same time, outcomes in privatized low technology industries increase over time, lowering the wage and productivity gaps between male and female workers. (JEL J16, J31, P20)"
J31|The distributional impacts of an energy boom in Western Canada|In the energy-rich provinces of Western Canada, inequality rose over the past two decades while poverty declined, raising the question of whether the recent energy boom was a contributing factor. This study uses local labour market variation in energy extraction intensity to identify these distributional impacts. The growth in local outcomes attributable to the boom is found to be U-shaped and significant across all distributional segments, leading to somewhat increased local inequality aggregates and reduced local poverty. This pattern is preserved but varies across sectors, driving a large local inequality increase in energy extraction, with smaller rises and reductions in other industries.
J31|Econometric analysis of the effect of marital status change on wages in Russia|What effect does change of the marital status of the individual to his wages in Russia? We used matching estimators (simple matching estimator and propensity score matching) on RLMS data for 2000–2009. On the basis of estimates we analyzed different transitions of changing marital status («not married — registered marriage », «registered marriage — divorced», «divorced — civil marriage», «divorced — registered marriage», «registered marriage — widow (widower)», «registered marriage — civil marriage») and their effect on wages separately for men and women. It was found that women are more influenced by cast of change in private life on the behavior on the labor market. For women, most of the transitions lead to some costs in wages, except a «divorced — registered marriage». For men it was significantly affect wages only transition «registered marriage — divorce».
J31|Marital wage gap|In the paper relationship of men’s income and their marital status is tested empirically. The Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey of HSE (RLMS HSE) data (1994–2011) confirm that men who are officially or civil married and were married before earn more in average than men who are not and were not married. This is explained by hypotheses of selection and treatment. The hypotheses are tested by the Mincerian type equations estimates. The using data do not reject the hypotheses.
J31|The impact of informality on earnings inequality: Unconditional quantile regressions|In this paper, we investigate the impact of informality on earnings inequality in Russia using the RLMS–HSE data for 2000–2010. We apply decompositions based on the recentered influence functions of unconditional quantiles. Our results confirm that informality increases the earnings polarization widening both tails of the distribution. This effect, albeit small, is statistically significant. Changes in structure and wage effects of informality did not have significant contribution to the decline in overall earnings inequality in 2000–2010, except for a group of workers without permanent job.
J31|The Impact of the Minimum Wage on Wage Distribution: The Evidence from Turkey|In this paper, we investigate the effect of the minimum wage on the entire system of wage distribution. More specifically, we address the issue of wage inequality by taking into account the potential distributional outcomes of minimum-wage legislation. We decompose the wage differences and the variations in the wage inequality before and after the sizable minimum-wage boost in 2004, following the methodology introduced by DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996). We use a non-parametric reweighting approach to decompose the effects of the minimum-wage hike as well as other factors that may have affected the wage distribution. Our main findings confirm that the minimum wage played a pivotal role in reducing wage inequality for both Turkish male and female wage earners between the years 2003 and 2005.
J31|Wage Inequality in Turkey: 2002-2010|This paper studies the evolution of wage inequality over the last decade in Turkey using household labor force survey between 2002 and 2010. During the period between 2002 and 2004, the relative supply of more educated workers to less educated workers stayed almost constant while their relative wages have decreased in the benefit of less educated workers. However, in the second period between 2004 and 2010 the relative supply of more educated workers to less educated workers had risen while their relative wages remained constant or kept increasing in the benefit of more educated workers. Both of these developments calls for factors other than those implied by a simple supply-demand model such as skill-biased technical change or minimum wage changes. The decomposition of wage inequality reveals that price(wage) e ect is dominant over the composition particularly in the period between 2002 and 2004. Our results show that the real minimum wage hike in 2004 corresponds to a major institutional change which proves to be welfare increasing in terms of wage inequality. The upper-tail (90/50) wage inequality decreased between 2002 and 2004 and stayed constant thereafter. The lower-tail (50/10) wage inequality decreased smoothly between 2002 and 2010. Our findings provide another evidence to the institutional view.
J31|Education in Romania - How much is it Worth?|This paper aims at estimating the impact of education on individual earnings through the econometric modeling of secondary data, for the year 2009 in Romania. The national representative sample used includes 16,570 statistical observations. Surprisingly, the largest impact on Romania’s income is determined by gender. Male income (log) is 26.58% higher than that of females, although data shows, that, on average, women in the sample have more years of education than men. This shows a highly discriminatory phenomenon, which can be solved probably by educational and awareness raising programs, aimed at combating gender-based (wage) discrimination. As regards to the importance of education as a determinant of earnings, we conclude that it is a key determinant of individual income. If in 1995 the coefficient of the variable “years of education” was -0.0019 and in 2000 0.0061, in 2009 it was, according to this study, 0.081652. It shows that in Romania the importance of education has increased, and consequently, the importance of people's knowledge and skills in their wage level, has soared too, which, in turn, may be an indicator of the transformation of Romania into a knowledge based society.
J31|The high wage economy and the industrial revolution: a restatement|" type=""main""> This article responds to Humphries's critique of Allen's assessment of the high wage economy of eighteenth-century Britain and its importance for explaining the industrial revolution. New evidence is presented to show that women and children participated in the high wage economy. It is also shown that the high wage economy provides a good explanation of why the industrial revolution happened in the eighteenth century by showing that increases of women's wages around 1700 greatly increased the profitability of using spinning machinery. The relationship between the high wage economy of the eighteenth century and the inequality and poverty in Britain in the nineteenth century is explored."
J31|Tax Reforms and Intertemporal Shifting of Wage Income: Evidence from Danish Monthly Payroll Records|This paper uses monthly payroll records for all Danish employees to identify widespread intertemporal shifting of labor income in response to a tax reform that significantly reduced the marginal tax rates for one-fourth of all employees. When ignoring shifting, the estimate of the overall elasticity of taxable income equals 0.1, and the elasticity is increasing with earnings. When removing the shifting component, the elasticity is close to zero at all earnings levels. The evidence also indicates that tax salience, liquidity constraints and firm willingness to cooperate in shifting are important factors in explaining shifting behavior.
J31|Studiu De Impact Privind Reformele Legislatiei Muncii În România|Romanian labour and industrial relations law has undergone wide-ranging changes in recent years. The Social Dialogue Law No. 62/2011 repealed and replaced several laws regulating industrial relations, while the Romanian Labour Code was extensively modified through the Law No. 40/2011. This legislation followed the Romanian government’s passing of a broad package of economic and labour reforms comprising wide-ranging cuts in entitlements and tax rises. These reforms were aimed at achieving macroeconomic stability and reducing government budget deficits, thus satisfying conditions in agreements Romania had signed with various international financial institutions. The authors themselves point out in the study that the time lapsed from the date of these legislative changes is rather short. However, the official statistics show that in 2008 the employees’ wages accounted for 42% of the gross domestic product, and the gross operating surplus for 47.2% of the GDP. In 2011, the share of the employees’ wages dropped to 40.6%, and the surplus rose to 50.8%. In other words, the crisis took its toll mostly on the workers and their earnings. According to the study, the reforms have had detrimental social impacts and have not delivered the economic benefits promised. Workers and their representatives have lost a wide array of entitlements, leaving them in a very precarious working situation. There has been a decline in both the quantity and the quality of work and employment. There has also been a decline in the number of employed people and in the average number of hours worked per week. The reforms have also caused collective bargaining in Romania to stagnate. At all levels, there is a noticeable drop in the extent of collective bargaining and the number of agreements. Even those agreements which have been signed cover less workers and their provisions offer inferior protection to employees compared to previous agreements in similar contexts. This poses longer term concerns for regulation, working conditions and social stability. The English version of the study was published on Labordoc database (http://labordoc.ilo.org/record/457525).
J31|Contradictions: Finance, Greed, And Labor Unequally Paid|This volume analyzes two decisive factors that have become embedded in the world spread of capitalism, a shift toward dominance of the financial sector, now entailing massive greed and calling into question whether the ‘rules’ of capitalism have been broken, and of global wage differentials so deep that recognition of a labor aristocracy cannot be avoided. These chapters are supplemented by two additional showing that gold still regulates the dollar’s value, and that unpaid reproductive labor of women adversely affects labor productivity. (New paragraph) Analysis of finance engenders discussion of its place in value theory, posed around the rate of profit, and is more complex than often presented. Furthermore, the varying rates of profit at the firm level, not just for financials, are distributed in a manner exhibiting more frequent extreme cases than a Bell-curve would suggest. Implications for incorporation of randomization into political economy are drawn. The final chapters provide evidence that Marx was more correct than Kalecki and Minsky when arguing the lead of profits for investment, and that product innovations can mitigate problems of over-production resulting from process innovations.
J31|Relative Prices, Trade, Technology and Wage Inequality: Evidence from India|This article examines the link between relative export, import and domestic goodsâ€™ prices and relative wages over the years by empirically testing the Stolperâ€“Samuelson theorem for India. It also examines the role of other factors such as manufacturing trade, liberalization phase, inflation, foreign and domestic technology, etc. on rising wage inequality in the manufacturing sector in India.â€ƒThe results seem to prove the validity of Stolperâ€“Samuelson theorem. The results also throw some light on Rybczynski theorem, which shows the relationship between output and endowment and factor price insensitivity elasticity, and the link between factor endowments and factor prices. The empirical testing is done using estimates of the translog production function and translog cost function along with the share equations. The elasticity of substitution between factors of production has been worked out using Allenâ€™s and Morishimaâ€™s formulae, which in turn use estimates of the translog cost function.
J31|Union Density and Varieties of Coverage: The Anatomy of Union Wage Effects in Germany|Collective bargaining in Germany takes place at either industry or firm level, and bargaining coverage is much higher than union density. The share of a firm's employees covered can vary between 0% and 100%, suggesting that researchers should distinguish union density, coverage at the firm level, and coverage at the individual level. Using linked employer-employee data, the authors estimate OLS and quantile regressions of wages on these dimensions of union influence. They find that a higher share of employees in a firm covered by industrywide or firm-specific contracts is associated with higher wages but find no clear-cut effect on wage dispersion. Yet, holding coverage at the firm level constant, individual coverage is associated with lower wages and less wage dispersion. Higher union density reinforces the effects of coverage. But for employees in firms without coverage, density's effect is negative and thus compresses the wage distribution in firms without coverage.
J31|Competition, Takeovers, and Gender Discrimination|Theories of taste-based discrimination predict that competitive pressures will drive discriminatory behavior out of the market. The authors analyze how firm takeovers and product market competition affect firms' gender composition and gender wage gap using detailed matched employer-employee data. Taking into account several endogeneity concerns while using a difference- in- difference framework, they find that the share of female employees increases as a result of an ownership change when product market competition is weak. Furthermore, a takeover reduces the gender wage gap. Although the estimated effects are small, the results support the main theoretical predictions.
J31|Monopsony Power, Pay Structure, and Training|Although interest in monopsonistic influences on labor market outcomes has revived in recent years, only a few empirical studies provide direct evidence on this topic. In this article, the authors analyze the effect of monopsony power on pay structure, using a direct measure of labor market thinness. The authors find evidence of monopsony power, as firms facing fewer local competitors offer lower wages to skilled labor and trainees, but not to unskilled labor. The findings have important implications for the economic theory of training, as most recent models assume monopsonistic pay-setting for skilled labor, but not for trainees.
J31|Industrial Composition, Methods of Compensation and Real Earnings in the Great Depression|A major objective of the government during the Great Recession has been severely to restrict public sector real wage growth. One potential advantage of performance-related pay schemes is that they naturally offer greater wage responsiveness to fluctuations in the business cycle. Based on evidence from engineering and allied industries during the Great Depression we show that piecework wages exhibited more flexibility than their timework equivalents. We compare and contrast southern/midland engineering districts of Britain with northern districts. The former region was dominated by piece-rated workers and by modern sections of the industry, such as vehicle and aircraft manufacture. Time-rated work predominated in northern districts where older sections â€“ for example, marine and textile engineering â€“ were clusteredâ€¥
J31|Policies to End the Gender Wage Gap in the United States|Women continue to earn less than men in the United States. This article surveys the debate about why this occurs and synthesizes the policy remedies. Unionizing women, comparable worth, pay secrecy legislation, affirmative action, stronger non-discrimination legislation, and family-friendly policies can improve the gender wage gap. But doing so means that instead of attempting to pass federal legislation, advocates should target states to pass legislation and undertake pro-active remedies that can improve womenâ€™s pay.JEL Classification: J7, J31, J38
J31|"The Market for ""Rough Diamonds"": Information, Finance and Wage Inequality"|During the past four decades both between and within group wage inequality increased significantly in the US. I provide a microfounded justification for this pattern, by introducing private employer learning in a model of signaling with credit constraints. In particular, I show that when financial constraints relax, talented individuals can acquire education and leave the uneducated pool, this decreases unskilled-inexperienced wages and boosts wage inequality. This explanation is consistent with US data from 1970 to 1997, indicating that the rise of the skill and the experience premium coincides with a fall in unskilled-inexperienced wages, while at the same time skilled or experienced wages do not change much. The model accounts for: (i) the increase in the skill premium despite the growing supply of skills; (ii) the understudied aspect of rising inequality related to the increase in the experience premium; (iii) the sharp growth of the skill premium for inexperienced workers and its moderate expansion for the experienced ones; (iv) the puzzling coexistence of increasing experience premium within the group of unskilled workers and its stable pattern among the skilled ones. The results hold under various robustness checks and provide some interesting policy implications about the potential conflict between inequality of opportunity and substantial economic inequality, as well as the role of minimum wage policy in determining the equilibrium wage inequality.

J31|Age and productivity. Human Capital Accumulation and Depreciation|This NEUJOBS research report focuses on links between age, productivity and lifelong learning. Various data sources (EU-SILC, LFS, Structure of Earnings Survey, SHARE, ELSA, SHARELIFE) and methodological approaches were used in this report. Our analysis identifies clusters of countries with common characteristics of age-earnings profiles (for certain groups of employees) and allows for an explanation of those differences. Some differences can be attributed to the share of sectors, education types, and occupations in country-specific employment. Others are due to labour market institutions and the (dis)incentives to work at older ages provided by social security systems. Additionally, the dynamics of earnings after age 50 differ less between educational and occupational groups than at earlier ages. We show that the dynamics of average wages are strongly influenced by the timing of entering and leaving labour market. An estimation of the impact of LLL on productivity (measured by earnings) at older ages shows that for employees aged 50+, participation in training increases wages in the short-term.
J31|The Impact of Institutional and Socio-Ecological Drivers on Activity at Older Ages|We present an insight of the socio-economic drivers of economic and noneconomic activity of persons 50+ as well their ability to adopt to SET. Not only the labour market participation, but also social engagement, beliefs, education, religious activities and housework are studied. With the use of European Social Survey data we investigate the general level of the activity among people aged 50+ in Europe as well as the relation between various aspects of activity and general labour market performance. We obtain mixed results on the concomitance of non-market and labour-market activities. We also check the role of personal traits as well as pull and push factors on prematurely leaving labour market in European countries. The differences among countries in terms of the results are confronted with the institutional characteristics of the countries. Finally, selected case studies of successful activation policies are presented.
J31|Adolescent Depression and Adult Labor Market Outcomes|This article uses recently released data from a national longitudinal sample to present new evidence of the longer term effects of adolescent depression on labor market outcomes. Results suggest reductions in labor force attachment of approximately 5% and earnings reductions of approximately 15% for individuals with depressive symptoms as an adolescent. These effects are only partially reduced when controlling for channels operating through educational attainment, adult depressive symptoms, or co-occurring illnesses. Further, the unique structure of the data allows for high-school fixed effects as well as suggestive evidence using sibling comparisons, which allows controls for potentially important unobserved heterogeneity. Overall, the results suggest that the links between adolescent depression and labor market outcomes are quite robust and important in magnitude, suggesting the need for further investments in treatment options and opportunities during adolescence, which will likely result in long term returns.
J31|The Effect of Immigration on Unskilled Native Workers: Evidence from a Natural Experiment|This study exploits the natural experiment, provided by the start of the second intifada, to measure the effect of immigration on the wage and employment of unskilled native workers. It finds that immigration has no effect on the wage or employment of unskilled Jewish workers. The wage and employment of the least-skilled Israeli Arab workers (with zero to five years of schooling) are adversely affected by immigration. The slightly more skilled Arab workers (with six to 11 years of schooling), in contrast, are positively affected by immigration, suggesting a complementarity effect with this group. Different explanations are proposed.
J31|The Value of a Statistical Injury: New Evidence from the Swiss Labor Market|We study the monetary compensation for non-fatal accident risk in Switzerland using the number of accidents within cells defined over industry x skill-level of the job and capitalizing on the partial panel structure of our data. Our results show that using accident risk at a lower level of aggregation, using narrower samples of workers, and using the wage component that is specific to the firm all yield higher (i.e. more positive) estimates of risk compensation. However, we only find a statistically significant positive compensation for non-fatal accident risk for workers in jobs with the lowest skill-level. Our preferred estimate for this group of workers yields an estimate of about 35,000 Swiss francs per prevented injury per year.
J31|Minimum wage in a deflationary economy: The Japanese experience, 1994–2003|The statutory minimum wage in Japan has increased continuously for a few decades until the early 2000s even during a period of deflation. This paper examines the impact of the minimum wage on wage and employment outcomes under this unusual circumstance. We find that the minimum-wage increase resulted in the compression of the lower tail of the wage distribution among women and that the wage compression is only partially attributable to the loss of employment. The continuous increase in the minimum wage accounts for one half of the reduction in lower-tail inequality that occurred among women during the period between 1994 and 2003.
J31|The Heterogeneous Effects of Workforce Diversity on Productivity, Wages, and Profits|" type=""main"" xml:id=""irel12064-abs-0001""> We estimate the impact of workforce diversity on productivity, wages, and productivity–wage gaps (i.e., profits) using detailed Belgian linked employer–employee panel data. Findings show that educational (age) diversity is beneficial (harmful) for firm productivity and wages. While gender diversity is found to generate significant gains in high-tech/knowledge-intensive sectors, the opposite result is obtained in more traditional industries. Estimates neither vary substantially with firm size nor point to sizeable productivity–wage gaps except for age diversity."
J31|Sharp Teeth or Empty Mouths? Revisiting the Minimum Wage Bite with Sectoral Data|The paper explores the link between different institutional features of minimum wage systems and the minimum wage bite. We notably address the striking absence of studies on sectoral-level minima and exploit unique data covering 17 European countries and information from more than 1100 collective bargaining agreements. Results provide evidence for a neglected trade- off: systems with bargained sectoral-level minima are associated with higher Kaitz indices than systems with statutory floors, but also with more individuals actually paid below prevailing minima. Higher collective bargaining coverage can to some extent reduce this trade-off between sharp teeth (high wage floors) and empty mouths (noncompliance/noncoverage).
J31|Minimum Wage Systems and Earnings Inequalities:Does Institutional Diversity Matter?|This paper explores how the diversity of minimum wage systems affects earnings inequalities within European countries. It relies on the combination of (a) harmonized micro-data from household surveys, (b) data on national statutory minimum wages and coverage rates, and (c) hand-collected information on minimum rates from more than 1,100 sectoral-level agreements across Europe. The analysis covers 18 countries over the period 2007-2009. Empirical results confirm the intuition of many practitioners that the combination of sectoral minimum rates and high coverage of collective bargaining can, at least for earnings inequalities, be regarded as a functional equivalent to a binding statutory minimum wage at the national level. Regression results suggest indeed that both a national statutory minimum wage and, in countries with sectoral-level minima, a higher collective bargaining coverage are significantly associated with lower levels of (overall and inter-industry) wage inequalities and a smaller fraction of workers paid below prevailing minima. Several robustness checks confirm these findings.
J31|Part-time Work, Wages and Productivity:Evidence from Belgian Matched Panel Data|The authors use matched employer-employee panel data on Belgian private-sector firms to estimate the relationship between wage/productivity differentials and the firm’s labor composition in terms of part-time and sex. Findings suggest that the groups of women and part-timers generate employer rents, but also that the origin of these rents differs (relatively lower wages for women, relatively higher productivity for part-timers). Interactions between gender and part-time suggest that the positive productivity effect is driven by male part-timers working more than 25 hours, whereas the share of female part-timers is associated with wage penalties. The authors conclude that men and women differ with respect to motives for reducing working hours and the types of part-time jobs available to them: women often have to accommodate domestic constraints by downgrading to more flexible jobs, whereas male part-time work is frequently related to training and collectively negotiated hours reductions that do not affect hourly pay.
J31|Workers' Responses to Incentives: The Case of Pending MLB Free Agents|This study examines ways in which workers respond to implicit incentives. Specifically, we examine the extent to which workers shift their effort to activities that are measured and which have been previously rewarded in the labor market. To examine this question, we examine the changes in the performance measures of professional baseball players in the season prior to the opportunity to freely negotiate their contract (free agency). We will examine different eras in baseball to examine if we can identify changes in behavior in this pivotal year based on changes to the current premium outputs for each time period.
J31|Career Progression, Economic Downturns, and Skills|This paper analyzes the career progression of skilled and unskilled workers, with a focus on how careers are aected by economic downturns and whether formal skills, acquired early on, can shield workers from the eect of recessions. Using detailed administrative data for Germany for numerous birth cohorts across different regions, we follow workers from labor market entry onwards and estimate a dynamic life-cycle model of vocational training choice, labor supply, and wage progression. Most particularly, our model allows for labor market frictions that vary by skill group and over the business cycle. We find that sources of wage growth differ: learning-by-doing is an important component for unskilled workers early on in their careers, while job mobility is important for workers who acquire skills in an apprenticeship scheme before labor market entry. Likewise, economic downturns affect skill groups through very different channels: unskilled workers lose out from a decline in productivity and human capital, whereas skilled individuals suffer mainly from a lack of mobility.
J31|Human capital and wages: a comparison of Albanian and Italian immigrants|This paper identifies the factors influencing earnings gaps between migrants belonging to old immigrant groups (defined as those with long established migration linkages with the receiving country) and those belonging to new immigrant groups. Earnings are conceptualized as a function of human capital, decomposed into the portion acquired in the home country and the portion acquired in the receiving country. It is hypothesized that poor transferability of human capital acquired at home dampens wages more for new than for old immigrant groups. Further, it is hypothesized that upon arrival in the destination, new immigrant groups accumulate human capital faster than old immigrant groups. The empirical analysis focuses on Albanians in the United States as a representative of a new immigrant group and Italians as a representative of an old immigrant group. The analysis is based on pooled data from the 2000 US Census 5 % sample, and the 2001–2007 American Community Survey (ACS) 3 % sample. Findings suggest that (1) Albanian immigrants earn substantially less than Italian immigrants; (2) human capital acquired at home has a positive impact on wages, but the level of human capital transferability is low for Albanians; (3) upon arrival, both Italian and Albanian immigrants accumulate human capital, but the speed of human capital accumulation is faster for Albanians than for Italians.

J31|A parametric control function approach to estimating the returns to schooling in the absence of exclusion restrictions: an application to the NLSY|An innovation which bypasses the need for instruments when estimating endogenous treatment effects is identification via conditional second moments. The most general of these approaches is Klein and Vella (J Econom 154:154–164, 2010), which models the conditional variances semiparametrically. While this is attractive, as identification is not reliant on parametric assumptions for variances, the nonparametric aspect of the estimation may discourage practitioners from its use. This paper outlines how the estimator can be implemented parametrically. The use of parametric assumptions is accompanied by a large reduction in computational and programming demands. We illustrate the approach by estimating the return to education using a sample drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. Accounting for endogeneity increases the estimate of the return to education from 6.8 to 11.2%. Copyright Springer-Verlag 2013
J31|College education and wages in the U.K.: estimating conditional average structural functions in nonadditive models with binary endogenous variables|Recent studies debate how the unobserved dependence between the monetary return to college education and selection into college can be characterised. This paper examines this question using British data. We develop a semiparametric local instrumental variables estimator for identified features of a flexible correlated random coefficient model. These identified features are directly related to the marginal and average treatment effect in policy evaluation. Our results indicate that returns to college systematically differ between actual college graduates and actual college non-graduates. They are on average higher for college graduates and positively related to selection into college for 96% of the individuals. The dependence between selection into college and returns to college education is strongest for individuals with low math test scores at the age of 7, individuals with less educated mothers, and for working-class individuals.

J31|An analysis of the impact of the self-sufficiency project on wages|We measure the impact of the Self-Sufficiency Project (a randomized welfare-to-work experiment in Canada; henceforth, SSP) on relative wage progression. SSP provided a generous 3-year earnings supplement to treatment group members who found a full-time job within a year of the start of the experiment (take-up group). We estimate the treatment on the treated for two sub-groups of the take-up group: the incentivized and non-incentivized groups. Using an econometric model of wage determination, we find evidence of large and significant relative wage progression of approximately 9 percentage points during the 3-year supplement period for the incentivized group. The impact for the non-incentivized group is much smaller (at most 3 percentage points). There is also some limited information that the non-incentivized group in New Brunswick and the incentivized groups in both New Brunswick and British Columbia continued to work more after the 3-year supplement period ended.

J31|Understanding wage determination in a multi-level bargaining system: a panel data analysis|This article presents an estimation of the elasticity of actual wages to industry-level collective bargaining thereby quantifying empirically the role of industry-level bargaining on wage determination. For this purpose, we use a unique employer–employee panel dataset covering the entire Belgian employment population over 9 years (1998–2006). Like several other European countries, e.g. Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands, Belgium has a relatively centralised wage bargaining system, with the industry level playing the most important role. Regression results confirm that wage increases collectively decided at the industry level are, on average, fully passed on to individual wages. In addition to industry-level bargaining, we are interested in the supplementary wage increases granted at the firm level, referred to as wage drift or wage cushion in the literature. Our estimates show that wage drift is affected by company size, by the economic performance of the industry and to a much lesser extent by labour market tensions as measured by the local unemployment rate. Interestingly, our results show that industry-level bargaining also takes most of these features into account. Copyright Springer-Verlag 2013
J31|How well does a dynamic Mincer equation fit NLSY data? Evidence based on a simple wage-bargaining model|This article argues that a dynamic Mincer equation can be seen as the solution of a simple wage-bargaining model between a worker and an employer where the unemployment-benefit level, affecting the outside option of the worker, depends on past wages. Further, it shows that this model provides a good fit of the US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data. The evidence is robust to a number of sensitivity checks. Copyright Springer-Verlag 2013
J31|The importance of worker, firm and match effects in the formation of wages|This paper estimates a Mincerian wage equation with worker, firm, and match specific effects and thereby complements the growing empirical literature started by the seminal paper of Abowd (Econometrica 67:251–333, 1999b ). The analysis takes advantage of the extensive Danish IDA data which provides wage information on the entire working population in a 27-year period. We find that the major part of wage dispersion in the Danish labor market can be explained by differences in worker characteristics. However, the relative contributions of the three components vary across subgroups of workers. The match effect constitutes a non-negligible part of the overall wage dispersion. An analysis of inter-industry wage differentials shows that firm characteristics are more important at the industry level than at the worker level. Similarly, we find evidence that high-wage workers tend to sort into high-wage industries to a larger extent than they sort into high-wage firms within industries. The mobility pattern of workers is related to the quality of the firm and the match. Finally, we find that firms’ wage policies differ across subgroups. Copyright Springer-Verlag 2013
J31|Generalized measures of wage differentials|This paper considers measures of wage differentials not solely determined by mean comparisons but summarizing differences across complete wage distributions. The approach builds on considerations of risk or inequality aversion and on standard expected utility concepts. In an application to the gender pay gap in Luxembourg the disadvantage of women persists according to the proposed measures: lower mean wages for women are not compensated by differences in higher moments of wage distributions (e.g., by less dispersion) at least for realistic assumptions about women preferences toward risk and inequality. The paper also illustrates an original empirical model for wage distributions in the presence of covariates and under endogenous labour market participation. Copyright Springer-Verlag 2013
J31|Key issues in the design of pay for performance programs|Pay for performance (P4P) is increasingly being used to stimulate healthcare providers to improve their performance. However, evidence on P4P effectiveness remains inconclusive. Flaws in program design may have contributed to this limited success. Based on a synthesis of relevant theoretical and empirical literature, this paper discusses key issues in P4P-program design. The analysis reveals that designing a fair and effective program is a complex undertaking. The following tentative conclusions are made: (1) performance is ideally defined broadly, provided that the set of measures remains comprehensible, (2) concerns that P4P encourages “selection” and “teaching to the test” should not be dismissed, (3) sophisticated risk adjustment is important, especially in outcome and resource use measures, (4) involving providers in program design is vital, (5) on balance, group incentives are preferred over individual incentives, (6) whether to use rewards or penalties is context-dependent, (7) payouts should be frequent and low-powered, (8) absolute targets are generally preferred over relative targets, (9) multiple targets are preferred over single targets, and (10) P4P should be a permanent component of provider compensation and is ideally “decoupled” form base payments. However, the design of P4P programs should be tailored to the specific setting of implementation, and empirical research is needed to confirm the conclusions. Copyright The Author(s) 2013
J31|Measuring Aggregate Agricultural Labor Effort in Dual Economies|Wide differences in labor productivity are observed between agriculture and industry in most developing countries. Research suggests that these differences - often denoted a “dual economy” effect — can explain a significant portion of low output per capita levels in these countries. A central input to the labor productivity calculation is the aggregate labor effort in the agricultural sector. Using findings from the Rural Income Generating Activity (RIGA) database, I reconsider the measure of labor productivity in agriculture and industry. I use several methods to extract information on labor effort and human capital from the household data in RIGA, and this is used to estimate the aggregate labor effort in the agricultural sector. With these new estimates, dual economy effects are found to be less severe for most of the RIGA countries. Using these estimates to adjust a wider sample of country-level data shows that the share of variation in output per capita explained by dual economy effects is around half of previous estimates.

J31|Labor Market Penalties for Mothers in Italy|We use a large Italian employer-employee matched dataset to study how motherhood affects women’s working career in terms of labor force participation and wages. We confirm that the probability of exiting employment significantly increases for mothers of pre-school children; however, this is mitigated by higher job quality, human capital endowment and childcare accessibility. Most importantly, the availability of part-time jobs reduces their probability of moving out of the labor force. Women not leaving employment after becoming mothers experience lower wages than women with no pre-school child, and there are no signs of this gap closing 5 years after childbirth. Contrary to previous literature, the wage gap penalty emerges only among women working full-time, thanks to the high protection accorded to part-time jobs in Italy.

J31|Offshoring and the skill structure of labour demand|In this paper we examine the link between international outsourcing—or offshoring—and the skill structure of labour demand for a sample of 40 countries over the period 1995–2009. The paper uses data from the recently compiled World Input–Output Database to estimate a system of variable factor demand equations. These data allow us to exploit both a cross-country and cross-industry dimension and split employment into three skill categories. Our results indicate that while offshoring has impacted negatively upon all skill levels within industries, the largest impacts have been observed for medium-skilled workers. Such results are consistent with recent evidence indicating that medium-skilled workers have suffered to a greater extent than other skill types in recent years. Copyright Kiel Institute 2013
J31|Gesetzliche Mindestlöhne: mit der Einführung kommen die Tücken der Umsetzung|Looking around the world, one realizes that national minimum wages are not uncommon. Yet it is still very difficult to estimate what effects a minimum wage might have in Germany. This is not just a question of how high the minimum wage should be — its impacts would also depend on many details of practical implementation. The present article addresses these issues.

J31|Vor der Bundestagswahl: Argumente für Mindestlöhne überzeugen nicht|For the first time ever, all political parties represented in the German Bundestag are proposing some form of minimum wage regulation in their federal campaigns. After sketching an overview of the vast empirical literature on the employment effects of minimum wages, which has yet to come to a consensus, the paper concentrates on the most common theoretical arguments for the view that minimum wages need not reduce the employment levels of affected workers. The authors find that those arguments are either conceptually inconsistent or assume market characteristics that can hardly describe the reality of low-wage labour markets. In the end, minimum wages are a blunt instrument to reduce poverty among workers — its primary objective — because it benefits many that are not poor and does not address the most important determinant of poverty in Germany, namely unemployment.

J31|Dynamics Of Productivity And Cost Of Labour In Italian Manufacturing Firms|" type=""main""> This paper studies the impact of size on labour cost and productivity for Italian manufacturing firms. The distributions of both labour cost and productivity display a wide support, even when disaggregated by sector of industrial activity. Further, both labour cost and productivity, when considered alone, are growing with the size of the firm. We investigate this relationship on a new set of data and we are able to show that once productivity differences among firms have been accounted for, size still retains a positive effect on cost of labour in most of the sectors considered."
J31|The Ins and Outs of Top Income Mobility|This paper is concerned with the question of whether top income earners are permanently there or only temporarily receive the highest incomes. How much mobility is there at the top of the income distribution, and how has mobility changed over time? The paper makes both a methodological and an empirical contribution to answering these questions. The first part of the paper introduces a family of top income mobility measures based on differences in average annual incomes of top income earners in short-term and long-term distributions of income. Norwegian income tax records are then employed to study top income mobility in Norway since 1967. The results reveal low levels of top income mobility, but a relatively large increase in mobility starting at the same time as the income shares of the top income receivers started to increase around 1990.
J31|Job Spells, Employer Spells, and Wage Returns to Tenure|We show that the distinction between job spells and employer spells matters for returns to tenure. Employer spells encompass between-job wage movements linked to promotions or demotions while job spells don't. Using a 1% sample of the British workforce over the period 1975-2010, we find that a significant proportion of the return to employer tenure arises due to job changes within employer spells. Conditional on tenure with employer, the return to job tenure is negative. This suggests that any positive effects of job-specific human capital on wage growth within jobs are outweighed by the effects of job changes within firms.
J31|Wage Growth and Human Capital in the UK Finance Sector|Despite the recent financial crisis the UK financial pay premium has continued to rise. To some extent this is a consequence of increased skill intensity in the finance sector, but this paper shows that finance workers have higher cognitive skills, on average, and this partly explains their higher wages. These are significant across all post-secondary education groups and not just those at the top. However, after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity we still find unexplainable rents to finance sector workers which are largely a consequence of bonuses. Though we also show that finance workers are more likely to be insecure about their job especially those that receive higher bonuses. In keeping with the existing literature on inequality we estimate demand and supply models to explain increasing inequality between finance workers vis-à-vis other workers. We find that finance workers are not perfect substitutes for non-finance workers in production, which is consistent with them having higher cognitive skills. Finally, we find relative demand shifts in favour of finance sector workers which are partially correlated with increased financial innovation and technical change, but most importantly we find that these demand shifts are slowing down.
J31|Trabajo por cuenta propia y monotributo en Uruguay|The incorporation of self employed workers into social protection systems constitutes a relevant challenge for Uruguay, as well as for other countries in the region. Among the strategies to this end, some countries have designed specific systems for this group of workers. In that context, Uruguay has recently made a relevant regulatory change, with the flexibilization of the rules of monotax. A relevant part of self employed workers can now incorporate to this regime, and so the study of their labor situation and changes since this regulatory modification are useful for policy design. This document presents a detailed analysis of the characteristics and labor conditions of self employed workers in Uruguay in 2000-2010, and explores changes in social security contributions associated with changes in the regime.
J31|The Distribution of Income in Central America|We document changes in income and earnings inequality in the five Central American countries from the early 1990s to 2009. In the 1990s Costa Rica had the most equal distribution of income in Central America, and one of the most equal distributions of income in Latin America. At the other extreme, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua were among the most unequal countries in Latin America. Inequality in El Salvador was between these extremes. Then, in the first decade of the 21st century inequality in El Salvador and Nicaragua decreased while inequality in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras increased. By 2009 levels of inequality in El Salvador and Nicaragua were similar to those in Costa Rica. In this paper, we examine why income and earning inequality differs between the five Central American countries, and why inequality decreased in El Salvador and Nicaragua but increased in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras.
J31|Does the Minimum Wage Bite into Fast-Food Prices?|Abstract We study the effect of increases in effective minimum wages on the prices of several fast-food items using quarterly city-level data from 1993–2014, a period during much of which the federal minimum wage declined in real value while state-level legislation flourished. For one product, a burger, we find a robust price elasticity of 9 % with respect to the minimum wage. This estimate indicates substantial cost pass-through when contextualized by the effect of minimum-wage increases on restaurant wage bills. Our estimate for pizza is suggestive of a similarly large pass-through rate but is less precisely estimated, and our estimate for fried chicken is near zero, but estimated even less precisely. Taken as a whole, our estimates point toward sizable cost pass-through of minimum wage increases to consumer prices. These results contribute to a mixed literature on the consumer burden of minimum wage increases.
J31|Power, Luck and Ideology in a Model of Executive Pay|The microprocessor and related technologies have transformed corporate and industry structure; applied in a neo?liberal environment, the technologies have had profound effects on the relative power of different groups. Skott and Guy (2007) and Guy and Skott (2008) formalized one aspect of this process of power?biased technical change: firms' increased ability to monitor low?paid employees and the resulting changes in inequality and employment at the low end of the income distribution. This paper addresses power biases and income inequality at the high end. Increasing firm?level financial volatility has intensified the agency problem and increased the power of corporate executives. These effects, which have been compounded by changes in ideology and pay norms, yielded an explosion in executive pay. JEL Categories: J31, O33
J31|Technology, power and the political economy of inequality|Technology can affect the distribution of income directly via its influence on both the bargaining power of different parties and the marginal product of different factors of production. This paper focuses mainly on the first route. The role of power is transparent in the case of medieval choke points but modern network technologies have similar features. There is also substantial evidence -- from truckers and retail clerks to CEOs -- that power affects the determination of wages. But power relations inevitably have institutional dimensions; regulatory frameworks influence industry structures and the market power of large companies as well as the parameters that determine the earnings of different groups of workers. The institutional framework is arrived at through complex social and political processes; technology, however, may exert some influence on the course of those processes.
J31|Default options and training participation|This article analyzes whether defaults affect the choice for courses followed at work. In addition, we analyze whether the size of the default effect varies with employees’ personality and skill-deficiencies. We perform an experiment in which workers are hypothetically offered three courses which they can accept or exchange for other courses. Randomizing the default package of courses, we identify the default effect. Default courses are chosen approximately three times more often than other courses. They are chosen more often if people have skill-deficiencies in these courses, suggesting that people consider the default to be an advice. Women choose default courses more often than men. Women with less self-confidence and men with lower cognitive skills choose the default courses more often. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014
J31|Wage effects of job-worker mismatches: Heterogeneous skills or institutional effects?|The strong wage effects related to mismatches between a workers education and that required in the job are usually attributed to assignment theory. This theory asserts that productivity and wages depend on the education-job match, which determines the utilization of skills. However, recent research shows that educational mismatches are only weakly related to skill utilization, which in any case fails to account for the bulk of the wage effects. Two alternative theories have been put forward to explain the observed wage effects. One points to wage setting institutions that cause wages to be based on job characteristics regardless of individual performance, the other to the heterogeneity of skills within a given educational level. Both theories explain existing results, but have never been tested directly. In this paper we show that the former theory explains observed wage effects in the public sector, and the latter theory those in the private sector.

They relate the development of turnover and wages for various employment categories to alternative models of wage and employment determination. The authors argue that the firm's behavior is consistent with the predictions of efficiency wage models of the shirking and turnover type.

J31|A cross-country analysis of the relationship between income inequality and social capital|This study investigated whether earnings inequality is associated with social capital as measured by active membership in organizations and interpersonal trust. Pearson product-moment correlation analysis showed that greater earnings inequality was associated with lower values on both measures of social capital in 14 European countries. While causality in either direction cannot be inferred from this result, it does suggest the possibility that earnings inequality negatively affects social capital. To test this idea further, we also tentatively examined whether other societal indicators related to earnings inequality are associated with social capital. These alternative indicatorsthe countrys percentage of urban residents, percentage of residents with tertiary education, and government spending as a percentage of GDPdid not show stronger relationships with social capital than did earnings inequality. Further analysis of the data by excluding specific groups of countries indicated little association between earnings inequality and measures of social capital. These results suggested that country-specific economic or cultural values play a large role in how earnings inequality and social capital are related.
J31|The Premium for Part-Time Work in Australia|Booth and Wood (2008), using longitudinal data from 2001 through 2004, found a large part-time wage premium for both men and women in Australia. Longitudinal studies of the full-time/part-time wage differential in other countries find small penalties or premiums, or no significant wage differentials. The objective of this paper is to explain the nature of the premium in Australia. We find the premium is pervasive across age groups, occupations and industries. It is not explained by the way part-time work is defined, or by the pay loading received in Australia by employees on casual contracts. We find substantial hourly wage increases accompany a move into part-time employment and similarly large hourly wage decreases occur when moving into full-time employment. The magnitude of these wage changes is smaller when the change from full-time to part-time employment (or vice versa) occurs with a change of employer. For women, we found evidence that the contemporaneous effect on the wage of moving into, or out of, part-time employment is not sustained beyond one, or at most two, years.
J31|Worker Signals among New College Graduates: The Role of Selectivity and GPA|Recent studies have found a large earnings premium to attending a more selective college, but the mechanisms underlying this premium have received little attention and remain unclear. In order to shed light on this question, I develop a multidimensional signaling model relying on college grades and selectivity that rationalizes students’ choices of effort and firms’ wage-setting behavior. The model is then used to produce predictions of how the interaction of the signals should be related to wages, namely that the return on college GPA should fall the more selective the institution attended. Using five data sets that span the early 1960s through the late 2000s, I show that the data support the predictions of the signaling model, with support growing stronger over time as college sorting by ability has increased. The findings imply that return to college selectivity depends on GPA, something previously not recognized in the literature, and they can rationalize why employers learn more quickly about college graduates’ productivity than less educated workers’.
J31|Employment Relations and Wages: What Can We Learn from Subjective Assessments?|This paper studies the link between hourly wages and workers’ subjective assessments of how easy it would be to find another job as good as the present one, and how easy it would be for an employer to replace an employee. First, using high-quality data, I study the correlates of these two assessments. Second, I study whether respondents who report better outside opportunities and respondents who think they are difficult to replace receive higher wages. The results appear to be consistent with predictions of at least three theoretical frameworks: human capital theory, search theory, and a “locus of control” model.
J31|Is there a Double-Negative Effect? Gender and Ethnic Wage Differentials|This paper investigates the gender and ethnic wage differentials for female immigrants, applying the Oaxaca decomposition to estimate the level of discrimination. The gender pay gap is quite small (7.42%), but it's not explained by observable differences, whilst the ethnic wage gap is larger (27.11%), but the explained components account for about 30%. Ultimately, we will evaluate how the multiple levels of discrimination (due to being a woman and a foreigner at the same time) intersect, following the decomposition suggested by Shamsuddin (1998). The double-negative effect is estimated to be 56-62%.
J31|Immigrant job search assimilation in Canada|Immigrant assimilation is a major issue in many countries. While most of the literature studies assimilation through a human capital framework, we examine the role of job search assimilation. To do so, we estimate an equilibrium search model of immigrants operating in the same labour market as natives, where newly arrived immigrants have lower job offer arrival rates than natives but can acquire the same arrival rates according to a stochastic process. Using Canadian panel data, we find substantial differences in job offer arrival and destruction rates between natives and immigrants that are able to account for three quarters of the observed earnings gap. The estimates imply that immigrants take on average 13 years to acquire the native search parameters. Due to immigrants facing much lower on-the-job offer arrival rates than natives, the model predicts that earnings growth through job search is minimal for immigrants prior to their job search assimilation.
J31|Popularity|What makes you popular at school? What are the labor market returns to popularity? We investigate these questions using an objective measure of popularity derived from sociometric theory: the number of friendship nominations received from schoolmates, interpreted as a measure of early accumulation of personal social capital. Our econometric model of friendship formation and labor market outcomes allows for partial observation of networks, and provides new evidence on the impact of early family environment on popularity. We estimate that moving from the 20th to 80th percentile of the high school popularity distribution yields a 10 percent wage premium 40 years later.
J31|The Goodwill Effect? Female Access to the Labor Market Over Transition: A Multicountry Analysis|This study evaluates quantitatively the context of gender discrimination in transition countries in terms of access to the labor market. Over economic transition female labor market participation has generally weakened. Notwithstanding, transition countries differ in institutional design, structural labor supply patterns, labor demand characteristics and the speed of transition processes. We propose to evaluate the contribution of these effects to the observed extent of gender discrimination. Using estimators of gender discrimination obtained from a panel of micro-datasets covering a possibly large set of transition countries, we seek determinants cross-country variation in gender discrimination in the labor market. Empirical evidence suggest that while countries with generally higher female labor force participation are characterized by less discrimination, ceteris paribus, this pattern does not hold for the transition countries.
J31|Age-productivity patterns in talent occupations for men and women: a decomposition| One could expect that in the so-called talent occupations, while access to these professions may differ between men and women, the gender wage gap should actually be smaller owing to the high relevance of human capital quality. Wage regressions typically suggest an inverted U-shaped age-productivity pattern. However, such analyses confuse age, cohort and year effects. Deaton decomposition allows us to disentangle these effects. We apply this method to investigate the age-productivity pattern for the so-called 'talent' occupations. Using data from a transition economy (Poland) we find that talent occupations indeed have a steeper age-productivity pattern. However, gender differences are larger for talent occupations than for general occupations.
J31|What is the true gender wage gap? A comparative analysis using data from Poland|Given the proliferation of methods to estimate gender wage gap, practical issues arise. The aim of this paper is to compare estimates of the adjusted wage gap from different methods and sets of conditioning variables. We apply available parametric and non-parametric methods to LFS data from Poland for 2012. While the raw gap amounts to nearly 10% of the female wage, after the correction for the endowments, the adjusted wage gap estimates range between 15% and as much as 25% depending on the method and the choice of conditional variables. The differences across methods and conditioning variables do not exceed 3pp. The largest differences emerged between methods estimating gap at the mean and those operating at quantiles. Within the same moment, methods which account for selection into employment yielded higher estimates of the adjusted wage gap. When expanding the conditioning set, to account for possible sorting of women into lower paid jobs, estimates of gap increase. While the actual point estimators of adjusted wage gap are slightly different, all of them are roughly twice as high as the raw gap, which corroborates the policy relevance of this methodological study.
J31|Diasporas and Outsourcing: Evidence from oDesk and India|We examine the role of the Indian diaspora in the outsourcing of work to India. Our data are taken from oDesk, the world's largest online platform for outsourced contracts. Despite oDesk minimizing many of the frictions that diaspora connections have traditionally overcome, diaspora connections still matter on oDesk, with ethnic Indians substantially more likely to choose a worker in India. This higher placement is the result of a greater likelihood of choosing India for the initial contract and substantial path dependence in location choices. We further examine wage and performance outcomes of outsourcing as a function of ethnic connections. Our examination of potential rationales for the greater ethnic-based placement of contracts assesses taste-based preferences and information differences. This paper was accepted by Lee Fleming, entrepreneurship and innovation.
J31|Revisiting the determinants of informal sector in Burkina Faso|The main objective of this paper is to highlight the determinants of informal sector activity with a special focus on informal self-employment opposed to informal wage employment. For this purpose we build a theoretical framework to show the important role of education in occupational choice. To empirically test our hypothesis, we estimate a two-stage degenerated nested Logit model after rejecting the independence of irrelevant alternatives hypothesis. Our results show that the probability of formal sector employment increases with the level of education. In the informal sector education attainment tends to reduce the probability of self-employment as opposed to wage employment. Other relevant determinants are related to gender, age and place of residence.
