H10|Ser ou não ser: Reflexões sobre a crise e o futuro da União Europeia|Neste artigo discutimos a crise e o futuro da União Europeia (UE). O método consiste num diagnóstico e análise críticos daquilo que tem sido a crise europeia e na subsequente discussão de duas propostas para o futuro, com vista a recuperar uma Europa com um rosto humano. Os resultados mostram que a visão económica que transparece da atuação das Instituições Europeias (IE) padece de fortes limitações. Ao fim de uma década, a UE ainda não conseguiu ultrapassar os problemas levantados pela crise financeira de 2008. A crise europeia é mais profunda e tem as suas origens na globalização financeira dos anos 1970’s, na unificação da Alemanha e no fim da guerra fria, em 1989 e 1991, no tratado de Maastricht e no aparecimento do Euro (no âmbito da União Económica e Monetária) nos anos 1990’s. A Área do Euro (AE) não é uma zona monetária ótima e completa. A crise financeira de 2008 atingiu fortemente a banca do centro e norte da Europa, sendo que as IE converteram o problema numa crise das dívidas soberanas e moral dos Estados Membros (EM) da coesão e da Itália (PIIGS/GIPSI) e do orçamento da UE. Entrando em linha de conta com as transferências por via do mercado único, a posição líquida que países como a Alemanha e Portugal têm, no que refere ao orçamento europeu, inverte-se, sendo a Alemanha beneficiária líquido da UE e Portugal um contribuinte líquido. Duas alterações ajudariam a UE a refundar-se com um rosto humano e a parar a afirmação dos nacionalismos populistas e xenófobos no continente: o orçamento da UE passar a ser pago exclusivamente com recursos próprios (impostos europeus); a UE adotar aproximações territoriais (“place-based”) em todas as suas políticas.
H10|Collective Emotions and Protest Vote|We leverage on important findings in social psychology to build a behavioral theory of protest vote. An individual develops a feeling of resentment if she loses income over time while richer people do not, or if she does not gain as others do, i.e. when her relative deprivation increases. In line with the Intergroup Emotions Theory, this feeling is amplified if the individual identifies with a community experiencing the same feeling. Such a negative collective emotion, which we define as aggrievement, fuels the desire to take revenge against traditional parties and the richer elite, a common trait of populist rhetoric. The theory predicts higher support for the protest party when individuals identify more strongly with their local community and when a higher share of community members are aggrieved. We test this theory using longitudinal data on British households and exploiting the emergence of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) in Great Britain in the 2010 and 2015 national elections. Empirical findings robustly support theoretical predictions. The psychological mechanism postulated by our theory survives the controls for alternative non-behavioral mechanisms (e.g. information sharing or political activism in local communities).
H10|Voting Up? The Effects of Democracy and Franchise Extension on Human Stature|We study the health effects of the spread of democratic institutions and the extension of voting rights in 15 European countries since the middle of the nineteenth century. We employ both cross country and cohort variation in heights and employ a new instrument for democracy and the extension of the franchise, the effect of decolonisation on democracy in the colonising country's democratisation to identify the causal effect of democracy on heights. We find robust evidence of a link between democratic quality and human stature. The results indicate that the transition to democracy increased average male heights by 0.7 to 1 cm, equivalent to a one-decade average increase in stature across cohorts. Including the extension of the franchise to women increases the effect on average stature to about 1.7cm. The effect is driven by both political participation and contestation in reducing inequality and expanding health insurance coverage.
H10|Samuelson Meets Federalism: Local Production of a National Public Good|This paper studies an overlooked phenomenon in the provision of public goods: local produc-tion of a national public good, such as the manufacture of fighter planes (which contribute to national defense) in many different jurisdictions across the country. Because local production of the national good raises local incomes, each jurisdiction seeks to raise its share of the good’s production. A subset of jurisdictions then forms a minimum winning coalition, which offers equal production shares to its members and smaller (possibly zero shares) to non-members, while choosing the provision level of the national good. The outcome is inefficient, with produc-tion inefficiently concentrated and the public good also overprovided (because income benefits reducing the good’s perceived marginal cost). Empirical results confirm the prediction that the location of production is important in determining Congressional support for federal program spending.
H10|On the Relationship between Trade Openness and Government Size|Does trade openness systematically imply bigger governments, as proposed by Rodrik (1998)? This paper presents a novel and more refined explanation for when and why international trade may enlarge the public sector. We propose that trade openness is associated with bigger governments if (i) the price volatility of a country’s export basket is substantial and (ii) the country is democratic. The first condition satisfies the prior that open trade barriers indeed introduce uncertainty and external risk – something that is not necessarily the case for all trade. The second condition ensures that the people’s desire for greater economic security can be realized through government spending. Empirical evidence for 143 countries (accounting for approximately 96 percent of world population) from 2000-2016 is consistent with this hypothesis. Exploring areas of public spending, we find intuitive patterns: Consistent with the compensation hypothesis, government spending on economic affairs and housing increases significantly with trade openness, whereas public spending on education, health care, and the military are not immediately concerned. As with our general result, this is only the case in democracies that are subject to high price volatility on the global market.
H10|Impulse Purchases, Gun Ownership and Homicides: Evidence from a Firearm Demand Shock|Do firearm purchase delay laws reduce aggregate homicide levels? Using quasi-experimental evidence from a 6-month countrywide gun demand shock starting in late 2012, we show that U.S. states with legislation preventing immediate handgun purchases experienced smaller increases in handgun sales. Our findings are hard to reconcile with entirely rational consumers, but suggest that gun buyers behave time-inconsistently. In a second step, we demonstrate that states with purchase delays also witnessed 2% lower homicide rates during the same period compared to states allowing instant handgun access. We report suggestive evidence that lower handgun sales primarily reduced impulsive assaults and domestic violence.
H10|The Distributional Consequences of Rent Seeking|Rent seeking leads to a misallocation of resources that worsens economic outcomes and reduces aggregate welfare. We conduct a quantitative examination of the distributional effects of rent extraction via the financial sector. Rent seeking introduces a possibility for insurance against idiosyncratic earnings risk that is more valuable for poorer households that are lacking in means of self insurance. However, it also creates a wedge that discourages savings, thus reducing self insurance via asset accumulation. When the model is calibrated to US data, the distorting effects dominate, implying welfare losses for all households, and an increase in wealth inequality. Nevertheless, welfare losses are bigger for households with higher initial wealth. Therefore, a policy reform to reduce rent seeking via the financial sector, despite being Pareto improving, will benefit predominantly wealthier households.
H10|Tying the Politicians’ Hands: The Optimal Limits to Representative Democracy|The citizen-candidate models of democracy assume that politicians have their own preferences that are not fully revealed at the time of elections. We study the optimal delegation problem which arises between the median voter (the writer of the constitution) and the (future) incumbent politician under the assumption that not only the state of the world and but also the politician's type (preferred policy) are the policy-maker's private information. We show that it is optimal to tie the hands of the politician by imposing both a policy floor and a policy cap and delegating him/her the policy choice only in between the cap and the floor. We establish two uncertainty principles: (a) the state-uncertainty principle, which states that the greater is the uncertainty about the state of the world, the wider is the delegation interval, and (b) the bias-uncertainty principle, which states that the greater is the uncertainty about political bias, the smaller is the delegation interval. Les récents modèles de la démocratie supposent que les hommes politiques ont leurs propres préférences qui ne sont pas pleinement révélées au moment des élections. Nous étudions le problème de délégation optimale qui se pose entre le votant médian (l'auteur de la constitution) et le (futur) politicien sous l’hypothèse que non seulement l'état du monde mais aussi le type de politicien sont des informations privées. Nous montrons qu'il est optimal de lier les mains du politicien en lui imposant à la fois un plancher et un plafond, et en lui déléguant le choix politique seulement entre le plafond et le plancher. Nous établissons deux principes d’incertitude : (a) le principe d’incertitude des états, selon lequel plus l’incertitude sur l’état du monde est grande, plus l’intervalle de délégation est large, et (b) le principe d’incertitude sur les biais, qui exige que l'intervalle de délégation soit une fonction décroissante de l’incertitude sur le type du politicien.
H10|Reconsidering the Role of Farmer Politics in Swedish Democratization|In discussions of Scandinavian democratization, it is commonplace to argue that long-standing farmer representation in parliament and a lack of feudalism encouraged a democratic-participatory civic culture within the peasant farmer class – or perhaps in the population as a whole. The present essay questions this interpretation in the Swedish case. It centers on a re-interpretation of farmer politics at the national level from a two-chamber system of representation after the 1866-67 reform to the alliance between the farmers’ party and Social Democracy in 1933 and offers a new analytical account of the way that one class’s attitude to democratic inclusion can change over time, owing to changed political and economic relationships to other classes. I show that Swedish farmers did not organize themselves independently of nobles and land-owners until the 1920s, and that they did not play the role of an independent pro-democratic force. On the contrary, the broad-based organizations of farmers in the 1920s and 1930s, with their democratic, participatory culture, appear to have been heavily influenced by the political culture of liberals and the labor movement, which in democratic society opened the door to a re-shaping of Swedish farmer politics that abandoned the old (subservient) alliance with estate owners. It was not democratic farmers who gave rise to Social Democracy – rather, it was Social Democracy that caused farmers to become democratic. Understanding farmer politics correctly also opens up a new understanding of the determinants of Swedish democratization.
H10|Tax system reform and the merits of the 1970 scheme|The present form of levy, as regards direct taxation, is quite imperfect. In fact. direct taxation is on distributed personal incomes; its personality implies defining a place of residence for the perceiver; residents of a country are hit on their worldwide basis. These are the general principles. The revenue of a nation is the sum of internal revenue (from the national basis) and of external revenue (from the foreign basis). Progressivity leads to their being strictly linked. Of course this is the rule for every nation. Since assessment can be conducted only internally, this leads to a general disorder, which compels nations to integrate their fiscal systems. This constriction soon leads to a single destination of revenue within an integrated administration. The functions of expenditure nevertheless are mainly national. This compels huge transfers from the point of collection of revenue, to single nations. The structure so depicted is in part avoided in Europe, because there are exceptions to the principles. Some of these exceptions are: incorporated firms pay not on the basis of distributed incomes, but on produced incomes (profits), at a proportional rate; many less developed countries apply the principle of produced incomes and proportionality also to other incomes beyond profits; taxation on distributed profits and on capital gains is decreasing as a rate (the one on capital gains is hardly effective); financial capital is subtracted in many countries to progressivity. This, if we add the circumstance that every nation normally subjects all internal incomes to withdrawal, and that international treaties pose remedies to such a situation which are necessarily partial, gives some idea of the total confusion with which direct taxation is now confronted. Such confusion is partially extended to indirect taxation, dominated by a tax, VAT, in which the imposable base is not directly revealed. The previous fiscal system, based as regards direct taxation on produced incomes (and therefore at proportional levy), and as regards indirect taxation on all produced goods and not only on consumption, was much more appropriate. The problem is how to try to take the best advantage of past experiences, by adding progressivity, the only “result” of recent times. It is shown that this is possible, taking advantage of the new economy: progressivity can operate within social contributions, which are national; national incomes may be effected by different rates; especially high rates may hit capital gains and the interest rate, on the side of production; a small rate may regard B to B transactions. A synthesis can then be achieved.
H10|Stalin and the origins of mistrust|We show that current differences in trust levels within former Soviet Union countries can be traced back to the system of forced prison labor during Stalin's rule, which was marked by high incarceration rates, repression, and harsh punishments. We argue that those exposed to forced labor camps (gulags) became less trusting and transferred this social norm to their descendants. Combining contemporary individual-level survey data with historical information on the location of forced labor camps, we find that individuals who live near former gulags have low levels of social and institutional trust. Our results are robust to a battery of sensitivity checks, which suggests that the relationship we document is causal. We outline several causal mechanisms and test whether the social norm of mistrust near gulags developed because of political repression or due to fear that inmates bring criminality. As such, we provide novel evidence on the channels through which history matters for current socio-economic outcomes today.
H10|Repeated shocks and preferences for redistribution| A society that believes wealth to be determined by random “luck” rather than by merit, demands more redistribution. The theoretical literature shows that any increase in the volatility of income caused by unpredictable adverse shocks implies a higher support for redistribution. We present evidence of this behavior by exploiting a natural experiment provided by the L’Aquila earthquake in 2009, which hit a large area of Central Italy through a series of destructive shakes over eight days. Matching detailed information on the ground acceleration registered during each shock with survey data about individual opinions on redistribution we show that the average intensity of the shakes is associated with subsequent stronger beliefs that, for a society to be fair, income inequalities should be levelled by redistribution. The shocks, however, are not all alike. We find that only the last three shakes - occurred on the fourth and the eighth day of the earthquake - have a statistically significant impact. Overall, we find that the timing and repetition of the shock play a role in shaping redistributive preferences. Revision posted January 24, 2019. A previous version of this paper circulated under the title “Natural disasters and demand for redistribution: lessons from an earthquake”.
H10|An Inquiry of Indonesia Central and Sub-national Government Cooperation on National Expenditure Program|Indonesia decentralization policy is an expenditure type of decentralization. It has evolved from setting functional assignments to coordination of expenditure programs across level of governments. This study will compare type of cooperation that has taken place in three sectors of expenditure programs: (1) environmental - carbon emission mitigation programs, (2) infrastructure programs, and (3) social assistance program. We investigate challenges and opportunities of central government support that can still be salience for the sub-national and local governments involvement on those expenditure programs.
H10|Mission-oriented Public Organizations for Knowledge Creation|The purpose of this paper is to investigate and discuss the role played by the state in enhancing technological progress, creating knowledge and fostering radical innovation. This catalyst function may take place in different ways. Specifically, we focus on three channels: (a) R&D of traditional state-owned or state-invested enterprises; (b) funding of organizations such as public agencies, research universities and large research infrastructures (e.g. CERN, NASA, etc.); (c) indirect intervention through public procurement for innovation. We critically review existing contributions, summarize their main findings and discuss the benefits and costs entailed by these policies. We claim that research, development, and innovation should be supported by governments not simply to pursue generic growth objectives but also to meet societal challenges like energy transition, sustainable mobility, the digital society, the demographic transition and climate change. Mission-oriented organizations can be powerful tools for achieving the technological breakthroughs needed to tackle these challenges.
H10|Counting Defiers|The LATE monotonicity assumption of Imbens and Angrist (1994) precludes “defiers,” individuals whose treatment always runs counter to the instrument, in the terminology of Balke and Pearl (1993) and Angrist et al. (1996). I allow for defiers in a model with a binary instrument and a binary treatment. The model is explicit about the randomization process that gives rise to the instrument. I use the model to develop estimators of the counts of defiers, always takers, compliers, and never takers. I propose separate versions of the estimators for contexts in which the parameter of the randomization process is unspecified, which I intend for use with natural experiments with virtual random assignment. I present an empirical application that revisits Angrist and Evans (1998), which examines the impact of virtual random assignment of the sex of the first two children on subsequent fertility. I find that subsequent fertility is much more responsive to the sex mix of the first two children when defiers are allowed.
H10|The Political Economy Consequences of China's Export Slowdown|We study how adverse economic shocks influence political outcomes in authoritarian regimes in strong states, by examining the 2013-2015 export slowdown in China. We exploit detailed customs data and the variation they reveal about Chinese prefectures’ underlying exposure to the global trade slowdown, in order to implement a shift-share instrumental variables strategy. Prefectures that experienced a more severe export slowdown witnessed a significant increase in incidents of labor strikes. This was accompanied by a heightened emphasis in such prefectures on upholding domestic stability, as evidenced from: (i) textual analysis measures we constructed from official annual work reports using machine-learning algorithms; and (ii) data we gathered on local fiscal expenditures channelled towards public security uses and social spending. The central government was subsequently more likely to replace the party secretary in prefectures that saw a high level of “excess strikes”, above what could be predicted from the observed export slowdown, suggesting that local leaders were held to account on yardsticks related to political stability.
H10|Who Becomes a Member of Congress? Evidence From De-Anonymized Census Data|We link future members of Congress to the de-anonymized 1940 census to offer a uniquely detailed analysis of how economically unrepresentative American politicians were in the 20th century, and why. Future members under the age of 18 in 1940 grew up in households with parents who earned more than twice as much as the population average and who were more than 6 times as likely as the general population to hold college degrees. However, compared to siblings who did not become politicians, future members of Congress between the ages of 18 and 40 in 1940 were higher-earners and more educated, indicating that socioeconomic background alone does not explain the differences between politicians and non-politicians. Examining a smaller sample of candidates that includes non-winners, we find that the candidate pool is much higher-earning and more educated than the general population. At the same time, among the candidate pool, elections advantage candidates with higher earnings ability and education. We conclude that barriers to entry likely deter a more economically representative candidate pool, but that electoral advantages for more-educated individuals with more private-sector success also play an important role.
H10|School spending and extension of the youth voting franchise: Evidence from an experiment in Norway|Changes in population age composition is challenging in modern welfare states. Intergenerational conflicts may have important consequences for provision of services directed towards specific age groups as schooling and care for elderly. A relevant question is to what extent the supply side responds to changes in the age composition of the electorate in terms of actual spending policies. This paper exploits a novel experiment that took place in Norway in the 2011 local elections to estimate the causal relationship between local government school spending and the age composition of the electorate. We exploit that the voting age was reduced from 18 to 16 years in local elections in selected local governments (experimental governments), while voting age was kept at 18 in the rest (control governments). Using a difference in differences strategy, we find that compulsory school spending decreased by approximately 2% in the experimental governments. The results are robust across a number of econometric specifications and robustness checks. Since all the newly enfranchised voters had just finished compulsory school and receive no direct benefits from local government school spending, the result is consistent with selfish voter behavior.
H10|Modern Democracy-Welfare State and Public Goods. A current consequence for Greece|People expect the state to create jobs and provide them with a social security net. Whatever its defects, whatever the virtues of the private sector, no structure other than the state can today provide citizens with the basic public goods. Under the present right-wing government of Nea Dimokratia in Greece, which is not particularly at odds with neoliberalism, a very active role of the state is not expected. Also is nor expected the introduction of a serious program of public investment and demand boosting to stimulate the national economy and enter into a virtuous circle of recovery. Greece, which has undergone the economic crisis with drastic cuts in its traditionally deficient social state, has to respond directly to the marked underinvestment in public goods (in key areas such as education, health, natural disasters, dealing with decent living conditions).The most important tool for inputting resources is the tax system.
H10|“To destroy the settlement of estate”? the Glorious Revolution and estate acts of parliament, 1660–1702|This article sheds light on the way the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England affected property rights to land. From 1660 to 1702, the bulk of parliament’s legislative work was on estate acts that reorganized families’ rights to land use. Using a random sample of 65 estate acts, the article finds that the Revolution broadened political access to parliament. I show acts were primarily for members of parliament and their families, but new acts after 1688 had secondary connections to MPs as trustees. It also finds that the composition of the acts changed after the Revolution because landholders sought to break strict settlements, a new form of property conveyance. The findings establish the place of estate acts in the broad narrative of the Glorious Revolution and help to explain the development of capitalism in England.
H10|Stalin and the Origins of Mistrust|We show that current differences in trust levels within former Soviet Union countries can be traced back to the system of forced prison labor during Stalin's rule, which was marked by high incarceration rates, repression, and harsh punishments. We argue that those exposed to forced labor camps (gulags) became less trusting and transferred this social norm to their descendants. Combining contemporary individual-level survey data with historical information on the location of forced labor camps, we find that individuals who live near former gulags have low levels of social and institutional trust. Our results are robust to a battery of sensitivity checks, which suggests that the relationship we document is causal. We outline several causal mechanisms and test whether the social norm of mistrust near gulags developed because of political repression or due to fear that inmates bring criminality. As such, we provide novel evidence on the channels through which history matters for current socio-economic outcomes today.
H10|Re-theorizing the welfare state and the political economy of neoliberalism's war against it|This paper argues neoliberalism is engaged in a war against the welfare state. At issue are competing views regarding the size of the welfare state and how it should be organized. In waging this war, neoliberalism seeks to politically discredit the traditional welfare state and change the economic structure so that the latter becomes unviable. The paper presents a new theoretical framework that distinguishes between modes of production and financing of the welfare estate. Neoliberalism's war rests on ideologically grounded criticisms drawn from mainstream economics; implementation of policies that undermine social solidarity toward the welfare state; exploiting pressures fostered by neoliberal globalization; and misrepresentations about affordability. The welfare state was critical in saving capitalism from itself after World War II. It is a way of embedding the market system so as to produce socially acceptable outcomes that are politically stable. Neoliberalism's war promises a body blow against shared prosperity. More ominously, it may so dis-embed the market system as to recreate conditions Polyani (1944) blamed for the rise of fascism in the 1930s.
H10|Come rifare Maastricht. L’Europa e la stampa|This work is fully integrated and unitary. It starts by analyzing the 2019 Stability Law and its financial accounts, which are illustrated, discussed and shared. How to reform the Maastricht parameters is then examined in some depth. One of its major conclusions is that the fiscal system should be reoriented toward a national model, similar to the one in vigour in Italy until the 1970s. Most of the work is concerned with this discussion, conducted by reporting all the articles, published and unpublished, sent to ItaliaOggi during this and the previous Legislature (2014-2018). Two papers follow, illustrating what the Bank of Italy should but cannot do, being “entangled” by BCE policy. The papers had in fact been sent to important seminars held in the Bank of Italy (2017 and 2018), but they were both rejected. Then other papers, published in Mondoperaio, Nuovi Lavori, and various newspapers, essentially delve deeper into the macroeconomic question. Here, following Keynes, it is shown that investment and amortisation are now more or less equal in the major European nations, so that net saving equates with the sum of trade surpluses and/or public deficits. This is a fundamental question, since trade surpluses are unsustainable, so public deficits become necessary and the rate of interest is compelled to zero, both in the public and the private system. A period of serious reforms is advocated, following what was thought and taught during most of the past century by the Italian School of public finance. This is illustrated by discussing my comments in a book edited by GORINI, LONGOBARDI, VITALETTI, entitled “Economia, Politica, Cultura nell’Italia del XX Secolo. Il pensiero critico di Sergio Steve”, FrancoAngeli, 2018.
H10|Government Size, Unemployment, and Inflation Nexus in Eight Large Emerging Market Economies|Using a panel of eight large emerging market economies from 1980 to 2015, this paper seeks to assess the causal linkages between government size, unemployment, and inflation. Overall, our results suggest that the government size is positively associated with both unemployment and inflation. The Granger causality runs from the government size to unemployment and to inflation. From our analysis, two aspects stand out. First, the effects of government size on unemployment and inflation depend essentially on how the government size is measured. As long as government consumption spending is considered as the proxy measure of the government size, the government size is significantly and positively correlated with unemployment, and with inflation. Second, indirect taxes, like government consumption spending, have a positive as well as statistically significant association with unemployment. However, the direct taxes solely exert a strong effect on inflation in the countries considered.
H10|The Right Type of Legislator: A Theory of Taxation and Representation|Theories of taxation conclude that legislators' ability to target redistribution to their districts’ results in higher government spending and taxation. Yet, despite the fact that securing “pork” is an important part of a legislator's job in the U.S., but not in European countries, the U.S. has lower taxes. Our analysis adds a simple assumption to standard models to reconcile them with this fact. Our assumption - that those who are successful in the private sector will also tend to be successful in negotiating transfers for their district - allows our theory to match stylized facts about class representation in legislatures. The model can then be used to examine policies aimed at increasing descriptive representation in legislatures. We find that many of these policies have no, or negative, effects on descriptive representation, including: increasing the number of representatives, allowing parties to choose candidates, or giving parties some ability to discipline legislator's votes and screen candidates. On the other hand, two policies are found to be particularly effective for increasing descriptive representation: proportional representation and limiting competition between legislators.
H10|Costa Rica: Restoring fiscal sustainability and setting the basis for a more growth-friendly and inclusive fiscal policy|Consecutive years of primary deficits have led to mounting public debt of almost 50% of GDP, one of the fastest increases in Latin America over the last decade. Government attempts to restore fiscal health have been undermined by a gridlocked Congress. While only minor reforms have been enacted to contain spending, efforts to curb tax evasion and increase the efficiency of the tax administration are commendable. However, increases in tax revenue have been unable to match mandated increases in spending. As a consequence, sovereign debt ratings have declined to below investment level, and the negative outlook on Costa Rica’s debt signals increasing financing costs. Against this backdrop, the risk of a fiscal crisis is increasing, particularly as global financial conditions become less favourable and debt structure has shifted towards increased reliance on floating rates and dollar-denominated bonds. Enacting a three year fiscal consolidation programme of one percentage point of GDP each year, will enable debt to stabilise at current levels by 2032. The current draft bill to strengthen public finances – Ley de Fortalecimiento de las Finanzas Públicas – proposes a comprehensive fiscal reform package, with measures on both the revenue and the spending side, as well as a fiscal rule. It needs to be complemented with additional measures to contain revenue earmarking. In addition, reducing excessive fragmentation of the public sector would allow the Ministry of Finance to regain control of the budget. There is also room to reduce expenditure on remuneration of public sector workers, one of the fastest growing expenditure items and a source of income inequality. The proposed fiscal rule should be strengthened, including introducing a multi-year expenditure framework and a fiscal council. Debt management should be modernised by stepping up communication with markets and reducing the number of benchmark securities. Over time, improving social spending efficiency and quality as well as modifying the tax structure away from social security contributions and enlarging the tax base would allow for a much stronger contribution of fiscal policy to growth and equity.
H10|Quel est le régime démocratique optimal en Afrique ?<BR>[What is the optimal democratic system ?]|Referring to several rebellions in Africa, referring to troubles after each election in Africa, the purpose of that paper is to analyze the strengths and the weaknesses of each democratic regime in Africa. Indeed, according to customary past of Africa, according to the drifts of the presidentialism, from our analyses, it rises that the best democratic regime in Africa are those which do not facilitate the emergence of a strong man to the summit of the state (parliamentary system, constitutional monarchy, hybrid republican system). From the econometric analyses, we deduce that the practice of the democracy in the economies of the second group attracts more investments and improves the investment climate.
H10|Natural disasters and demand for redistribution: lessons from an earthquake|Abstract The literature shows that when a society believes that wealth is determined by random “luck” rather than by merit, it demands more redistribution. Adverse shocks, like earthquakes, strengthen the belief that random “bad luck” can frustrate the outcomes achieved with merit. We theoretically illustrate that individuals react to such shocks by raising support for redistribution. We then present evidence of this behavior by exploiting a natural experiment provided by one of the strongest seismic events that occurred in Italy in the last three decades, the L’Aquila earthquake in 2009. We assemble a novel dataset by matching information on the ground acceleration registered throughout the National Strong Motion Network during the earthquake with survey data about individual opinions on redistribution collected a few months later. The empirical analysis illustrates that the intensity of the shakes is associated with subsequent stronger beliefs that, for a society to be fair, income inequalities should be levelled by redistribution.
H10|The Changing Structure of Government Spending|We document that advanced economies experience a secular increase in the share of purchases from the private sector in total government spending, implying that over time governments purchase relatively more private-sector goods, and rely less on own production of value added. We build a calibrated general equilibrium model to show that this secular process can be accounted for by investment-specific technological change. We then use the model to measure the effect of this secular process on the transmission of fiscal policy, and find that (i) it shifts the stimulative effects of government spending towards private economic activity and (ii) it dampens the response of hours - but not of output - to fiscal shocks.
H10|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.
H10|Was Higher Education a Major Channel through which the United States Became an Economic Superpower in the 20th Century?|We offer a thesis for why the United States (US) overtook the United Kingdom (UK) and other European countries in the 20th century in both aggregate and per capita GDP as a case study of recent models of endogenous growth, where “human capital” is the engine of growth. By human capital we mean an intangible asset, best thought of as a stock of embodied and disembodied knowledge comprising education, information, entrepreneurship, and productive and innovative skills, which is formed through investments in schooling, job training, and health as well as through research and development projects and informal knowledge transfers (cf. Ehrlich and Murphy 2007). The conjecture is that the ascendancy of the US as an economic superpower in the 20th century owes considerably to its faster human capital formation relative to that of the UK and “old Europe.” We assess whether the thesis has legs to stand on through both stylized facts and a supplementary quasi-experimental empirical analysis. The stylized facts indicate that the US led other major developed countries in schooling attainments per adult population member, beginning in the latter part of the 19th century and lasting throughout the 20th century, especially at the secondary and tertiary levels. The quasi-experimental analysis constitutes the first attempt to test the hypothesis that the US’s ascendancy to a major economic power stems largely from the impact of the first Morrill Act of 1862, which launched the public higher education movement in the US through the establishment of land grant colleges and universities across the nation during the latter part of the 19th century.
H10|Economic Freedom in Albania|"At early stages of transition, markets are in their first steps and sometimes do not exist in the literal sense of the word. Even after many years of development, the markets in transitional economies may be imperfect as well as incomplete. In these circumstances we cannot pretend the market system itself will determine prices and reallocate resources to more productive sectors.Also, being for many decades isolated from the outside world and external development, the economy and enterprises themselves are in great need of new and advanced technology. Obviously, there is need of economic sustainability and the social environment for the establishment and development of private sector.In these circumstances, obviously there is need for some restrictions and obligations. These are necessary for the very existence of a country, but when these limits exceed the target then the problem arises. Economic freedom, inter alia, will be defined as ""the lack of pressure or governmental constraints on the production, distribution or consumption of utility goods beyond what is needed for citizens to protect and preserve their freedom to work, produce, consume and invested so that they feel they are productive ""(Angjeli, A; 2007: 70).Over two?thirds of studies on economic freedom, found it to correspond to a ?good? outcome such as faster growth, better living standards, more happiness, etc. ( Hall, C. J; Lawson, A. R; 2013) For these reasons, we are having a look on economic freedom to see how this indicator has affected the Albanian economy and whether its values are comparable to those of the countries we aspire to."
H10|Impulse Purchases, Gun Ownership and Homicides : Evidence from a Firearm Demand Shock|Do firearm purchase delay laws reduce aggregate homicide levels? Using quasi-experimental evidence from a 6-month countrywide gun demand shock starting in late 2012, we show that U.S. states with legislation preventing immediate handgun purchases experienced smaller increases in handgun sales. Our findings are hard to reconcile with entirely rational consumers, but suggest that gun buyers behave time-inconsistently. In a second step, we demonstrate that states with purchase delays also witnessed 3% lower homicide rates during the same period compared to states allowing instant handgun access. We report suggestive evidence that lower handgun sales primarily reduced impulsive assaults and domestic violence.
H10|Regional Risk Sharing and Redistribution - The Role of Fiscal Mechanisms in Switzerland|This paper analyses the importance of fiscal mechanisms for regional risk sharing and redistribution in Switzerland. Switzerland is a particularly interesting setting in this context because it features both a high level of fiscal autonomy for Swiss cantons and explicit fiscal transfers between the federal government and the cantons. Based on panel-data analysis we study the redistributive and stabilizing properties of fiscal equalization transfers, federal government transfers in general, direct federal taxation, the unemployment insurance scheme and the first pillar pension scheme. We find a combined redistributive effect of these mechanisms of about 20%. This means that long-run income differentials of 1 Swiss Franc between cantons translate into differences of long-run disposable income after taxes and transfers of about 80 cents. The combined contemporary stabilization effect with respect to short-term income fluctuations amounts to less than 10%, which is a small effect compared to previous findings for other countries.
H10|Fertility and population policy|There have been significant changes in both the fertility rates and fertility perception since 1970s. In this paper, we examine the relationship between government policies towards fertility and the fertility trends. Total fertility rate, defined as the number of children per woman, is used as the main fertility trend variable. We use panel data from the United Nations World Population Policies database, and the World Bank World Development Indicators for the period 1976 through 2013. We find a significant negative association between a countryâ€™s fertility rate and its anti-fertility policy. On the other hand, there is no significant and robust relationship between the fertility rate and a countryâ€™s pro-fertility or family-planning policies. In addition we find evidence of spatial autocorrelation in the total fertility rate, and spatial spillovers from a governmentâ€™s policy on fertility.
H10|Could/should Jubilee debt cancellations be reintroduced today?|In this paper the authors recall the history of Jubilee debt cancellations, emphasizing what their social purpose was at that time. They note that it would not be possible to copy that procedure exactly nowadays, primarily because most debt/credit relationships are intermediated via financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies, etc., rather than by governments or wealthy families directly. But the authors argue that the underlying social purpose of such Jubilees - to keep debt within the reasonable ability to be paid without social and economic polarisation - could be recreated via alternative mechanisms, and they discuss the politico-economic arguments for, and against, doing so.
H10|Are managerial capitalism and crony capitalism incompatible? The adaptation of the Spanish corporate elite to the capitalist system in the last century|"In the last century, Spanish economic and society have experienced remarkable transformations, as the consolidation of a democratic State of law, and the access to the reduced club of developed countries. Such transformations have also reached the corporate elite. Nevertheless, has the professionalization of the managers of large companies represented a break with the old practices of crony capitalism? To answer this question, the paper analyzes the profiles of the presidents and CEO of the largest Spanish corporations, between 1917 and today. The application of prosopographic method to different aspects of the social capital of managers, on nine selected dates, will allow to understand better the evolution process of the Spanish corporate elite. This process includes an increase in managerial capabilities, due to the formation and cosmopolitan capital; but despite the advance of managerial capitalism, this has not meant the end of the so-called crony capitalism, —characteristic of both the Restoration and the Franco dictatorship—, and in the last decades it seems that there is again an ""entrenchment"" movement by the new business elite to defend their own interest to the detriment of those of the country."
H10|Tying the Politicians' Hands: The Optimal Limits to Representative Democracy|We study the optimal delegation problem which arises between the median voter (writer of the constitution) and the (future) incumbent politician when not only the state of the world and but also the politician's type (preferred policy) are the policy-maker's private information. We show that it is optimal to tie the hands of the politician by imposing him/her both a policy floor and a policy cap and delegating him/her the policy choice only in between. The delegation interval is shown to be the smaller the greater is the uncertainty about the politician's type. These results apply outside the specific problem to which our model is applied here.
H10|The changing structure of goverment consumption spending|We document a secular increase in the share of purchases from the private sector in government consumption spending: over time the government purchases relatively more private-sector goods, and relies less on its own production of value added. We build a general equilibrium model in which investment-specifi c technological change accounts for the changing structure of government spending. The model predicts that this secular process alters the transmission of government spending shocks by raising the response of private value added, while dampening the response of hours. We validate these results with novel empirical evidence on the effects of government spending across countries.
H10|Dynamics in Gun Ownership and Crime - Evidence from the Aftermath of Sandy Hook|Gun rights activists in the United States frequently argue that the right to bear arms, as guaranteed by the Second Amendment, can help deter crime. Advocates of gun control usually respond that firearm prevalence contributes positively to violent crime rates. In this paper, we provide quasi-experimental evidence that a positive and unexpected gun demand shock led to an increase in murder rates after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and the resulting gun control debate in December 2012. In states where purchases were delayed due to mandatory waiting periods and bureaucratic hurdles in issuing a gun permit, firearm sales exhibited weaker increases than in states without any such delays. We show that this finding is hard to reconcile with standard economic theory, but is in line with findings from behavioral economics. States that saw more gun sales then experienced significantly higher murder rates in the months following the demand shock, as murders increased by 6-15% over the course of a year.

H10|Future European Alliance - Europe as a Flexible Democracy|A reasonable future for Europe can only be achieved if two essential elements are fulfilled: Firstly, newly established institutions must be democratic and have strong support from citizens rather than from national governments. Secondly, the large number of different ethnic, cultural, religious, and regional units existing on the European continent must be able to maintain their identity. This diversity must be institutionally supported rather than be undermined by standardization and centralization. We suggest political institutions, which are formed to meet these goals, following the example of Functional, Overlapping, Competing Jurisdictions (FOCJ). If these two goals are adequately reached, a future alliance raises the identification with the European project, and induces citizens to exhibit civic virtue in strengthening these goals.
H10|New Output Gap Estimates for Assessing Fiscal Policy with Lessons for Euro Area Reform|Output gaps (OG) identify economic cycles and the cyclical and structural components in government budget balances. A new simple method for estimating OGs is presented here. The new results are more transparent than those published by the leading economic policy institutions. - The retroactive changes to the OGs as such do not indicate that they would have been incorrect. Instead, they naturally depend on what will happen afterwards, including changes in the fiscal and other policies conducted. - Fiscal policy in the euro area was tight in 2012-13, contributing to an unexpected fall in the GDP. Fiscal policy has generally amplified cycles in the euro area, except in 2009. - Procyclicality is caused by short-sighted fiscal discipline stemming from the mistrust among the member states. Policy reforms should focus on long-term sustainability and diminishing conflicts and mistrust. The numerous reform proposals should be assessed under two key criteria: (1) reducing mistrust across the members and (2) implementation without changes to the EU Treaty. Focussing on long-term sustainability meets them both.
H10|Digital Governance in Developing Countries: Beneficiary Experience and Perceptions of System Reform in Rajasthan, India|India is at the forefront of the use of digital technology to transform the way in which citizens interact with states. This paper provides a picture of the perceived impact of digitization reforms in Rajasthan, based on a survey of beneficiaries of several benefit programs. We find that, on balance, the reforms appear to have improved perceptions of service delivery despite some difficulties during the digitization process and the possibility—which we cannot fully assess with our data—that there could have been some degree of exclusion. The proportion of people preferring the new systems, at 40–60 percent, far exceeded the proportion who expressed a preference for the old system (5–12 percent). In the case of food and cooking gas subsidy reforms, the reason for the preference is relatively clear—they considered that the new systems gave them greater control over their entitlements and reduced the ability of others to claim their benefits or divert them. The main problems arise from biometric authentication. Shifting pensions from postal delivery to bank deposits is overwhelmingly supported, partly because of better regularity. Reforms in Rajasthan also had two cross-cutting goals: financial inclusion and women’s empowerment. Our survey confirms that virtually all respondents have bank accounts, often two or more per family, as do all heads of household who are officially mandated to be women. Two thirds of these women had not owned bank accounts before the reforms. Mobiles emerge, however, as a male preserve. This suggests a further frontier for policies and programs to shift India towards a digital society—ensuring that all people have the capacity to access and to use digital technology.
H10|Racionalidad representacional de la política de competitividad de la ciudad de Medellín|No abstract is available for this item.
H10|Fiscal Rules and Discretion in a World Economy|Governments are present-biased toward spending. Fiscal rules are deficit limits that trade off commitment to not overspend and flexibility to react to shocks. We compare coordinated rules, chosen jointly by a group of countries, to uncoordinated rules. If governments' present bias is small, coordinated rules are tighter than uncoordinated rules: individual countries do not internalize the redistributive effect of interest rates. However, if the bias is large, coordinated rules are slacker: countries do not internalize the disciplining effect of interest rates. Surplus limits enhance welfare, and increased savings by some countries or outside economies can hurt the rest.
H10|Could/Should Jubilee Debt Cancellations be Reintroduced Today?|In this paper we recall the history of Jubilee debt cancellations, emphasizing what their social purpose was at that time.

H10|Public Assets: What's at Stake? An Analysis of Public Assets and their Management in the European Union|Based on a study conducted by a private consultant, this paper sheds light on a large selection of public assets across the EU and compares their management practices. The paper shows that these assets amount to around €16.5 trillion in 2015, of which 60% are non-financial assets while the rest consists of financial assets in the form of public stakes. A large number of these stakes are in fully public, domestic and unlisted firms and consist of public services and utility providers. As regards non-financial assets, after acknowledging important data gaps, the paper provides evidence on selected fixed assets and natural resources. A review of managerial practices reveals that central governments tend to maintain control of strategic decisions for most assets - although ownership can be shared with private investors and/or local governments - and that operational decisions may be taken by local governments or public companies. Regarding investment strategies, while financial asset portfolios are being reduced, the paper indicates that public investments in some strategic non-financial assets continue. As policy implications the paper underlines the need to improve data availability as well as enhance transparency in the management of these assets.
H10|Repeated Shocks and Preferences for Redistribution|A society that believes wealth to be determined by random “luck” rather than by merit, demands more redistribution. The theoretical literature shows that any increase in the volatility of income caused by unpredictable adverse shocks implies a higher support for redistribution. We present evidence of this behavior by exploiting a natural experiment provided by the L’Aquila earthquake in 2009, which hit a large area of Central Italy through a series of destructive shakes over eight days. Matching detailed information on the ground acceleration registered during each shock with survey data about individual opinions on redistribution we show that the average intensity of the shakes is associated with subsequent stronger beliefs that, for a society to be fair, income inequalities should be levelled by redistribution. The shocks, however, are not all alike. We find that only the last three shakes - occurred on the fourth and the eighth day of the earthquake - have a statistically significant impact. Overall, we find that the timing and repetition of the shock play a role in shaping redistributive preferences.
H10|Planning paper 116 - Les charges administratives en Belgique pour lâ€™annÃ©e 2016<BR>[Planning paper 116 - De administratieve lasten in BelgiÃ« voor het jaar 2016]|At the request of the Ministerial Council and in collaboration with the Agency for Administrative Simplification (AAS), the Federal Planning Bureau carries out an estimate every two years of the administrative burdens for firms and self-employed in Belgium. This estimate is based on a survey of a representative sample of firms and self-employed. In addition to the quantitative part, the survey also includes an important qualitative part that shows how firms and self-employed view the problem of administrative burdens. This Planning Paper shows the results regarding the administrative burdens for 2016.
H10|From Financial to Managerial Capitalism. The slow adaptation of Spanish corporate elite|In the last century, Spanish society and economy have endured considerable social and economic transformations which have also affected the corporate elite. Has the professionalization of managers of large companies broke away from old practices of crony capitalism? We have analysed the profiles of managers and executives of the biggest limited liability companies in Spain from 1917 to present day in order to answer this question. Prosoprographic method applied to different social capital fields of managers allows for a better understanding of how the Spanish corporate elite evolved. The latter entails an increase of managerial skills, through training and cosmopolitan capital; nonetheless, progress in managerial capitalism has not put an end to typical aspects of crony capitalism, which was attributed to most of the twentieth century and the new business elite has uplifted a new “entrenchment” in the last decades to put their interests before those of the country as a whole.
H10|Tying the Politicians’ Hands: The Optimal Limits to Representative Democracy|We study the optimal delegation problem which arises between the median voter (writer of the constitution) and the (future) incumbent politician when not only the state of the world and but also the politician’s type (preferred policy) are the policy-maker’s private information. We show that it is optimal to tie the hands of the politician by imposing him/her both a policy floor and a policy cap and delegating him/her the policy choice only in between. The delegation interval is shown to be the smaller the greater is the uncertainty about the politician’s type. These results apply outside the specific problem to which our model is applied here.
H10|Delegation of Regulation|We develop a model to discuss a government’s incentives to delegate to bureaucrats the regulation of an industry. The industry consists of a polluting firm with private information about its production technology. Implementing a transfer-based regulation policy requires the government to make use of a bureaucracy; this has a bureaucratic cost, as the bureaucracy diverts a fraction of the transfer. The government faces a trade-off in its delegation decision: bureaucrats have knowledge of the firms in the industry that the government does not have, but at the same time, they have other preferences than the government, so-called bureaucratic drift. We study how the bureaucratic drift and the bureaucratic cost interact to affect the incentives to delegate. Furthermore, we discuss how partial delegation, i.e., delegation followed by laws and regulations that restrict bureaucratic discretion, increases the scope of delegation. We characterize the optimal delegation rule and show that, in equilibrium, three different regimes can arise that differ in the extent of bureaucratic discretion. Our analysis has implications for when and how a government should delegate its regulation of industry. We find that bureaucratic discretion reduces with bureaucratic drift but that, because of the nature of the regulation problem, the effect of increased uncertainty about the firm’s technology on the bureaucratic discretion depends on how that uncertainty is reduced.
H10|Red tape asset pricing|The equity premium–risk-free rate puzzle in standard consumption-based asset pricing models disappears once we remove the government-imposed component from the consumption expenditure series. I calibrate this component based on the growth rates of two proxies for government intervention, which I also show to forecast the short- and long-term equity premiums between 1974 (or 1981) and 2017. In summary, investors require large premiums to hold stocks because stocks give poor returns when government intervention increases, thereby systematically reducing individuals’ utility levels.
H10|Establishing A New State under Human Resource Constraint: The Experience of the German Reunification|The human resources of East Germany were short in the terms of political integrity and professional qualification to establish the new public institutions modeled to those of West Germany. Dispatching West-German personnel, extensive re-training, and creation of informal personal network were the solution to compensate the shortage and to transfer knowledge and know-hows to East Germany. Reunified Germany established the new public institutions quickly, although the sudden change might discourage East-German personnel’s self-efforts to improve their capacities. The German experience suggests that it is difficult for the other ex-socialist countries those cannot expect quick transfer of knowledge and know-hows from the democratic market countries to establish their new public institutions quickly. It would take a long time of a generation and more for those countries to complete the systemic transformations, because the accumulation of the human capital needs the long period., Highlights: ・Human capital for operating state institutions is short in systemic transformation. ・Transfer of knowledge and know-hows is needed to solve the problem. ・Dispatching West-German personnel, re-training, and informal network solved it. ・Applying the German solution to the other ex-socialist countries are difficult. ・A generation or more are needed to complete the systemic transformation.
H10|Guaranteed Employment and Universal Child Care For a New Social Contract|The United States is falling behind many other rich nations on a broad spectrum of measures of the quality of life. These include social mobility, inequality, education, crime, health and longevity. Polls suggest that many Americans have not only lost their optimism concerning the future, but have become angry as well. This article sets forth the elements of a new social contract, one that would deliver substantial results almost overnight and which conforms to the traditional American values of the importance of work, that everyone should have a fair opportunity for upwards mobility, and the central importance of the family. This proposal is composed of two parts: The first is guaranteed employment, and where necessary, the retraining required to enable workers to successfully enter the regular workforce. The second is universal child care to give all parents the possibility of participating in the labor force. The article discusses in depth how these measures would reverse the relative decline in quality of life in America. It also reveals how, although these measure would be costly, their payoff for the economy would far offset the costs.
H10|Why Has Labor Not Demanded Guaranteed Employment?| Unemployment has almost always been traumatic for its victims. In earlier times, it threatened extreme privation, if not starvation. Still today, it dramatically decreases its victims' standard of living, human capital, social standing, and self-respect. It is associated with poorer health, suicide, and family dissolution. Unemployment also entails considerable costs to society such as lost output, increased crime, decayed neighborhoods, and when extreme, political unrest. Why, then, is it tolerated? Why, especially, have workers and their advocates not demanded that employment be guaranteed to all? This article explores why what has always been foremost to workers' interests -- security of employment -- has not remained one of labor's foremost demands. It finds that the reasons have been complex and varied over time, including degrading work houses, workers' focus on alternatives to capitalism, the fact that unemployment typically is suffered by a small portion of the workforce, the local character of most worker demands, the eventual provision of safety nets, and most importantly, the dominance of ideology that blames workers for their unemployment or holds that full employment is impossible to attain.
H10|Legal conflicts of interest of the revolving door|This paper analyzes the conflicts of interest arising from the “revolving door”. The revolving door is a common phenomenon, and it is unlikely that most of it can be explained by ‘regulatory capture’, a practice that is unlawful. Therefore, there is a need for a new framework.
H10|The Financial-Economic Aspect of the Media and the Public Service in the Globalization Era (Budget and Ownership Framework)|This study deals with influence of globalization on the economic aspect of the media. Financing the media and the issue of ownership over them represents the fundamental framework on which basis the media work and direct their editorial policy. Principle position implies that owners of the media use power of media to promote their economic, political, cultural and other stances. A particular issue, especially in European countries in transition, represents the financing of public service, as a socially beneficial good. Many commercial media, on the basis of their financial and political power, are trying to diminish or discredit the power and role of the public service. Former socialist countries, now countries in transition, seek from their national budgets to maintain this kind of informing, that is, the public interest, education and promoting cultural values. The era of globalization brought, as one of its negative traits, the domination of profit over culture, education, and even over the right to have quality informing. So the mass media have become a sort of hostage of confrontation of different political and economic interests, which reflects on the quality of media content that strive towards sensationalism, advertocracy, tabloidization. Based on the case study of Montenegro, as a country in transition, the development of mass media is shown, including their financing, ownership structure, and profit.
H10|Commodity taxation and regulatory competition|Abstract The purpose of this paper is twofold. We first investigate whether product market regulations affect commodity taxation in open-to-trade economies, and second, we study the strategic interaction in regulatory measures between trading partner countries. We present a two-country general equilibrium model in which destination-based commodity taxes finance public goods, and product market regulation affects both the number of firms in the market and product diversity. Based on data for 21 OECD countries over the 1990–2008 period, we provide empirical evidence suggesting that product market regulations are strategic complement policies and that domestic regulations have a negative impact on domestic commodity taxation.
H10|Israel's High Fertility Rate and Anemic Skill Acquisition|The exceptionally high fertility among ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Arab minority, increasing portions of the population, is the main reason for Israel’s flagging labor-force participation. In addition, high fertility diminishes Israel’s skill attainment of the labor force. A rise in income inequality in all advanced economies, which in the last two decades has taken a sharp upward turn in Israel, has a potential for setting off social- divide and political polarization.
H10|Studies on Issues in Political Economy since the Global Financial Crisis|Die Dissertation behandelt in vier Kapiteln Themen zu den Ursprüngen und Auswirkungen der globalen Finanzkrise 2007-8. Nach der Einleitung untersucht Kapitel 2, warum autoritäre Regime im Vergleich zu Demokratien vor und nach der Finanzkrise eher in der Lage waren, größere Bestände an Währungsreserven anzuhäufen. Die empirische Analyse zeigt, daß Wahlzyklen ausschließich in Demokratien zu einer signifikanten Reduzierung von Währungsreserven führten. Kapitel 3 zeigt, daß die Deregulierung der Banken-Mindestreserve einen negativen Einfluß auf die Volatilität der M2-Geldmenge und der Inflationsrate hat. Dies könnte eine weitreichende Bedeutung haben, da die Mindestreserve in Form von Liquiditätsanforderungen ein Hauptbestandteil der Basel III Regulierung ist, die bis 2019 in Kraft treten soll. In Kapitel 4 gehe ich der Frage nach, ob die Regierungsideologie in Zeiten von Globalisierung und Austeritätsprogrammen noch eine Rolle in der Wirtschaftspolitik spielt. Basierend auf einen Index, der die wirtschaftliche Freiheit für diverse Politikfelder mißt, zeigt das Kapitel, daß rechte bzw. klassisch liberale Regierungen dazu tendieren, die wirtschaftliche Freiheit signifikant zu erhöhen, während sie unter linken bzw. sozialdemokratischen Regierungen stagniert. Das fünfte Kapitel untersucht, warum deutsche und französische Top-Manager - auf dem Höhepunkt der Eurokrise - den Euro öffentlich in einer Anzeigenkampagne unterstützten. Während die Firmeninteressen anscheinend keinen direkten Einfluß haben, verfügten die Unterstützer der Euro-Kampagne über mehr Netzwerkkontakte zu Wirtschaftsverbänden und Politik. Dieses Ergebnis suggeriert, daß führende Manager den Euro öffentlich unterstützten, um ihr politisches Kapital zu EU- und nationalen Entscheidungsträgern zu wahren oder zu verbessern.
H10|Engagement der deutschen Wirtschaft in afrikanischen Staaten|Afrika ist ein Kontinent mit immensen Zukunftschancen, steht aber großen Herausforderungen gegenüber. Das Wirtschaftswachstum der vergangenen Jahre war vielerorts hoch, die Bevölkerung wird sich bis 2050 verdoppeln, aber die Pro-Kopf-Einkommen sind immer noch sehr niedrig. Das wirtschaftliche Engagement der deutschen Wirtschaft in Afrika ist, abgesehen von Südafrika, gering. Zwar ist Deutschland der fünftwichtigste Lieferant für Afrika, doch der deutsche Marktanteil ist von 14% im Jahre 1992 auf 5% im Jahr 2013 gesunken. Deutschland exportiert vor allem Industrieprodukte; Agrarprodukte spielen eine sehr untergeordnete Rolle. Für Afrika ist Deutschland der achtwichtigste Absatzmarkt; aber auch hier blieb das Wachstum hinter jenem anderer Länder deutlich zurück. Interessanterweise dominieren Energie- und Bergbauprodukte die deutschen Importe weniger, als das in anderen Ländern der Fall ist. Dies liegt auch daran, dass es fast keine deutschen Auslandsdirektinvestitionen (ADI) im extraktiven Ressourcenbereich in Afrika gibt. Die deutschen ADI konzentrieren sich im Know-how-intensiven Kfz-Bereich. Insgesamt beträgt der Anteil Afrikas am Bestand der deutschen ADI weniger als 1% und entwickelt sich nur langsam. Die deutsche Wirtschaft könnte durch ein stärkeres Engagement in Afrika Wachstumschancen wahrnehmen und gleichzeitig die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung fördern. Dazu bedarf es geeigneter institutioneller Rahmenbedingungen und politischer Hilfestellungen. Zum Beispiel zeigt sich, dass der Abschluss von Freihandelsabkommen vor allem afrikanische Exporte fördert und Investitionsschutzverträge wesentliche Voraussetzung für deutsche ADI in Afrika sind.
H10|Global Skill-Based Immigration Policies and Israel's Brain Drain|US attracts more high skill immigrants than Europe. One key factors is US research centers. US universities and research centers, funded directly and indirectly by the US federal and state governments, attract talented researchers from all over the world. Many of them remained in the US after completing their original term of education, training or research. Many became citizens. In the confines of the generous welfare state, low skill immigrants impose fiscal burden on the native born. In contrast, high-skill immigrants help in relieving the burden. This is the economic rationale behind skill-based immigration policies. The other side of the skill bias in immigration policy is that the international migration of skilled workers (the so-called brain drain) deprives the origin country from its scarce resource - human capital. Israel supply of high skill workers is unique. Today, Israel ranks third in the world in the number of university graduates per capita, after the United States and the Netherlands. It possesses the highest per capita number of scientists in the world, The paper links Israel's brain drain to skill-based immigration policies, prevailing in the advanced economies.

H10|Populism and Central Bank Independence|"The consensus that surrounded the granting of central bank independence in the pursuit of a price stability oriented monetary policy has been challenged in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, in the light of the rise of populism on the one hand and the expanded mandates of central banks on the other hand. After considering the economic case for independence and the three Ds (distributional, directional and duration effects), the paper examines three different dimensions in the debate of how the rise in populism - or simply general discontent with the status quo - affects central bank independence. Finally, the paper examines how to interpret the legality of central bank mandates, and whether or not central banks have exceeded their powers. This analysis leads us in turn to consider accountability and, in particular, the judicial review of central bank actions and decisions. It is important to have in place adequate mechanisms to ""guard the guardians"" of monetary and financial stability."
H10|Tax Revenues, Development, and the Fiscal Cost of Trade Liberalization, 1792-2006|This paper puts the recent evolution of tax revenues in developing countries in historical perspective. Using a novel dataset on total and trade tax revenues we compare the fiscal cost of trade liberalization in developing countries and in today's rich countries at earlier stages of development. We find that trade liberalization episodes led to larger and longer- lived decreases in total tax revenues in developing countries since the 1970s than in rich countries in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The fall in total tax revenues lasts more than ten years in half the developing countries in our sample.
H10|Carga y estructura tributaria en Chile: comparación con países OCDE|Uno de los argumentos utilizados para justificar la reforma tributaria de 2014, que se espera recaude 3 puntos porcentuales del PIB, fue que Chile tenía una carga tributaria inferior a la de la gran mayoría de los países de la OCDE (Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económico), por lo que era razonable aumentarla, más aún en vista de que se requería recursos para financiar programas sociales adicionales. En este trabajo se compara la carga tributaria y la estructura de dicha carga en Chile y en el resto de los países de la OCDE. La comparación se hace para cuando las naciones tenían un ingreso per cápita similar al chileno actual. La conclusión básica es que la carga tributaria en Chile post reforma tributaria será similar (un punto del PIB menor) a la de la mediana de esos países cuando tenían un nivel de desarrollo similar al chileno. También se analiza la estructura de la carga tributaria. Se concluye que la recaudación por impuesto a las utilidades de las empresas en Chile es elevada en relación al resto de los países de la OCDE, que la recaudación por el impuesto al ingreso de las personas es baja y que en términos de impuesto a los bienes y servicios la recaudación es similar. Se discuten algunas hipótesis sobre la razón por la cual la recaudación del impuesto al ingreso personal es tan baja en nuestro país (la menor entre los 35 naciones). Se concluye que la principal razón es que el mínimo exento en Chile es relativamente alto. En efecto, mientras en la mediana de los países de la OCDE los individuos comienzan a pagar impuestos cuando su ingreso es alrededor de un 30% del ingreso mediano de su respectivo país, en Chile lo hacen cuando su ingreso llega a 180% de dicho ingreso mediano. Finalmente, se debe destacar que una discusión sobre el nivel y la estructura óptima de la carga tributaria excede el propósito de esta nota. Lo aquí planteado sólo pretende ser una comparación de niveles y estructuras bajo condiciones similares de desarrollo, junto con una explicación del porqué algunas diferencias en las estructuras tributarias de Chile y el resto de los países de la OCDE.
H10|Tax Mechanisms of Economic Development and the Improvement of Migration Situation in the Russian Arctic|The paper deals with the economic and demographic development of the Arctic regions of Russia. It shows the features of demographic dynamics consisting in a sharp reduction of the population, a significant contribution that migration plays in the formation of the population. Based on the analysis of two population surveys of the Arctic regions of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) the paper presents the views of residents about their everyday problems that the people are mostly concerned about, the causes of migration, the expectations of changes in migration plans of their children. A conclusion is made about the necessity of state support of the Arctic regions, solving social and economic problems of life in the Arctic, and, above all, the preservation of the population, improving the conditions and quality of life, supporting traditional economies and way of life of the Arctic’s indigenous peoples. In order to create favorable tax conditions in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation, the authors propose to create an enabling system of taxation and customs regulations with the aim of stimulating investment, entrepreneurship activities and enhancing the effectiveness of the implementation of projects aimed at socio-economic development of the Russian Arctic
H10|Oil Rent and Financial Environment: A Cross-country Examination|This study provides an empirical investigation to test one of the transmission channels of resource curse, i.e. financial environment. Our panel data analysis of 70 countries from 2006 to 2014 shows a negative and statistically significant association between oil rent and the quality of financial environment in developing countries, but a positive relationship in developed countries. These findings are robust when we control for other major drivers of financial environment quality, unobservable country- and time-fixed effects. In addition, our main results show that institutional quality, among other independent variables, has a major statistically significant effect on financial environment.
H10|Compulsory voting, turnout, and government spending: Evidence from Austria|We study a unique quasi-experiment in Austria, where compulsory voting laws are changed across Austria's nine states at different times. Analyzing state and national elections from 1949 to 2010, we show that compulsory voting laws with weakly enforced fines increase turnout by roughly 10 percentage points. However, we find no evidence that this change in turnout affected government spending patterns (in levels or composition) or electoral outcomes. Individual-level data on turnout and political preferences suggest that these results occur because the impacts of compulsory voting on turnout are larger among those who are non-partisan, who have low interest in politics, and who are uninformed.
H10|Civic capital and support for the welfare state|Abstract We model how the interplay between tax surveillance institutions and civic capital shapes taxpayers’ support for the welfare state. We show that, when tax surveillance is tight, rational civic-minded individuals express greater support for welfare spending than uncivic ones. We provide empirical evidence of these preferences using data from Italy, a country that has long posed a puzzle for public economists for its limited civic capital and large welfare state.
H10|Fairness and the unselfish demand for redistribution by taxpayers and welfare recipients|We illustrate how the desire to live in a fair society that rewards individual effort and hard work triggers an unselfish though rational demand for redistribution. This leads the well off to prefer higher taxes and the poor to reject extreme progressivity. We then provide evidence of these behaviors using a nationally representative survey from Italy. Our empirical analysis confirms that a stronger aversion to unfair distributive outcomes is associated with a higher support for redistribution by individuals with high income and to a lower demand for redistribution by those with low income.
H10|Public sector productivity: measurement challenges, performance information and prospects for improvement|Improving productivity at the organisational level offers the greatest immediate dividends and could successfully cover the largest departments and agencies at the central or national level. For many decades the measurement of government outputs in national statistics and economic accounts used inputs, which assumes that government productivity neither grows nor falls. Modern solutions exist however, that can generate empirically useful metrics of total outputs from which stakeholders could learn key lessons about the productivity of their agencies over time. This article outlines the tools needed to apply these modern solutions and offers recommendations for improving cross-national productivity data for government

H10|Updates to the Sampling of Wealthy Families in the Survey of Consumer Finances|Participation in household surveys has fallen over time, making it harder to produce a household survey-like the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)-in a timely manner. To address these challenges, the reference year of the sampling frame data for the 2016 SCF wealthy oversample was shifted back one year, allowing the oversample to be selected earlier than the past. In implementing this change, though, we risk identifying an outdated set of families and introducing variability in the sampling process. However, we show that the set of families selected in the new frame are observationally equivalent to those that would have been selected from a past frame, and that the increased variability of wealth estimates is compensated-for with the use of more comprehensive data than in the past. Other aspects of the SCF sampling process are revisited, too. We continue to find support for using permanent income in the sampling process, rather than annual income. We also estimate the geographic distribution of wealthy families and show that the current distribution is similar to the past. We propose adding one geographic area to the oversample, though, and supplementing by 100 the set of sampled families.
H10|Political Communication Factors Affecting University Students’ Political Participation|"""Objective – The purposes of this research were to examine and study political communication factors affecting university students’ political participation. Methodology/Technique – The population was 2,613 university students from all over Thailand. Quantitative methodology was applied to survey students’ opinions. The research instrument was a questionnaire. The statistics used for data analysis were percentage, mean, standard deviation and factor analysis. The factors affecting political participation were analyzed and used to find an effective strategy to promote political participation. Findings – The research results showed that the factors affecting knowledge building in politics were family, university and classmates. Students’ political decision making was based on their role models, e.g. idols, actors and musicians. The students did not agree with vote buying; however, they could not stop family or community leaders from doing it because of the seniority-based culture. Novelty – The results provide suggested guidelines for developing students’ political participation."""
H10|Who benefits from free health insurance: evidence from Mexico| We present the first comprehensive evidence on the health impacts of the introduction and expansion of a large non-contributory health insurance program in Mexico, the Seguro Popular (SP). SP provided access to health services without co-pays to individuals with no Social Security protection. To identify the impacts of the program we use its staggered rollout across municipalities between 2002 and 2010. Our intent-to-treat estimates show that SP reduced infant mortality by 10% in poor municipalities. We are unable to detect program impacts on mortality for children ages 1-4, adults or elderly. The decline in infant mortality is driven by reductions in deaths due to perinatal conditions, congenital malformations, diarrhea and respiratory infections. Also in poor municipalities, the introduction of SP is associated with an immediate 7% increase in obstetric-related hospital admissions and with a 6% increase in hospital admissions due to diarrhea and respiratory infections among infants. The decline in infant mortality attributed to SP closes 84% of the gap in infant mortality rates between poor and rich Mexican municipalities.
H10|Making Direct Democracy Work. An economic perspective on the graphe paranomon in ancient Athens|The specific way the Athenians set up their democracy presents both theoretical and empirical challenges. Decisions were taken by majority vote in the Assembly. To keep politicians in line, the Athenians first used ostracism, which however was replaced by the graphe paranomon around 415 BCE. The latter provided that anybody who had made a proposal in the Assembly could be accused of having made an unconstitu¬tional suggestion, bringing a severe penalty if found guilty. We know of 35 such cases between 403 and 322. During the fourth century the notion of illegality was extended to a mere question of undesirability. Henceforth any decision by the Assembly could be overturned by the courts, but if the accuser failed to get at least 20% of the jury votes, he was punished instead. While these rules can be seen as a safeguard against bad decisions, they also provided the Athenian politicians with important information about the relative strength of their political support. This effect has not been analysed before, and it may help explain the relative stability of political life in classical Athens. Furthermore this analysis also contributes to our understanding of a curious but often overlooked fact, namely that the decrees of the Athenian Assembly to a great extent concerned honorary rewards, and the use of the graphe paranomon in turn was largely focussed on the honorary decrees.
H10|The Firm and the self-enforcing dynamics of crime and protection|We model the symbiotic relationship between criminals and a partnership of protection providers - the Firm. In the absence of state authority, insecurity and crime generate a demand for protection. When the protection providers themselves are recruited among criminals, the prospect of graduating to the Firm magnifies the incentive for violent crime. More violence in turn increases the income of the protection providers. The result is a violence multiplier. Combining elements from tournament and rent-seeking theory, we derive results that contrast with standard results from the rent-seeking literature. For example, a decrease in the cost of violence increases violence more than pari passu and increases the value of being a criminal. The violence multiplier also generates an incentive for the protection providers to welcome new partners into the Firm. This is a crucial premise in explaining the viability of many violent structures. We confirm empirical relevance of key elements of our framework by exploring unique data on incarcerated youth in South Africa.
H10|Capital Taxation in a Fiscal Union – Implications of Simultaneous Horizontal and Decentralized Leadership|This article concerns capital taxation and public good provision in a two-layer fiscal union where the federal government uses lump-sum transfers to redistribute resources between two local jurisdictions, and where each local government uses a capital tax and a lump-sum tax to finance the provision of a local public good. The novelty is to allow for simultaneous horizontal and decentralized leadership (double leadership) which means that one of the local governments is able to exercise Stackelberg leadership both vis-a-vis the other local government and vis-a-vis the federal government. Among the results it is shown that the capital tax becomes redundant as a policy instrument for the double leader if the other state government acts as a decentralized leader vis-a-vis the federal government. If, instead, the other state government does not exercise leadership vis-a-vis the federal government then the double leader will implement a capital tax which is allocatively efficient from the perspective of the fiscal union as a whole. It is also shown that double leadership exacerbates the under-taxation inefficiency that earlier research has shown exists in a fiscal union with decentralized leadership.

H10|Building a Scientific Narrative Towards a More Resilient EU Society. Part 1: a Conceptual Framework|This report explains the main elements of a conceptual framework for resilience. The framework was developed in consultation with several Directorate Generals of the European Commission, participating in the Research Network on the Measurement of Resilience, which was jointly established by JRC and EPSC in 2016. The conceptual framework was designed to serve the policy DGs in their policy-making activities by creating a common understanding of the concept and paving the way towards a measurement and monitoring facility.
H10|Europa tra Stati Uniti e Confederazione. Occorre scegliere la Confederazione|Europe is attempting to concentrate in Brussels the actual fiscal revenue, claiming also a European Minister of Economics. If it succeeds, the risk is a negative outcome. In fact Italy, and other European countries as well, would not give up their nationality, in order to become a province of Europe. Nevertheless it is shown that the cause of the problems is the actual fiscal system, of anglo-saxon origin, which it is then necessary to substitute. It is possible to take deep insights from the fiscal system ruling in Italy up to the seventies of the last century, based on a real rather than a personal taxation. In this case it is not necessary a European Minister of Economics. It is sufficient a coordination in some rates of taxation among European countries. It is shown that this is not the only reason to substitute the actual fiscal system. T here are other reasons also, which reveal the actual knots of the ruling personal system.
H10|Norms and monetary fines as deterrents, and distributive effects|Abstract Both social norms and monetary fines can deter acts that are privately beneficial but socially undesirable. The number and the identities of those who commit the acts differ between with norms and with fines. Fines are more likely to make higher-income individuals better off than norms. As a society becomes more affluent, fines are more likely to increase the number of those who commit than norms, and norms become the better system of deterring socially undesirable acts.
H10|When Officials Dont Know What They Dont Know: Dunning-Kruger Effect in the Case of Green Budgeting for Local Government|This paper extends the key findings of Kruger & Dunning (1999), which shows that people who are unskilled in a given domain tend to be unaware of their lack of skills, to government circle that is supposed to be filled by professionals. This paper compared individual government officialsâ€™ self-assessment of their officesâ€™ ability to perform certain tasks related to green budgeting with their responses to questions that implicitly assess their actual ability to perform such tasks. Consistent with Kruger & Dunning (1999), individuals who have sufficient knowledge and expertise in a given domain tend to have more accurate self-assessment when asked to rate their own expertise, and vice versa. This paper also discusses the theoretical underpinning of how compensation structure is related with Dunning-Kruger effect on policy design and how tying the outcome with compensation can promote learning and better metacognitive abilities, even for less knowledgeable individuals
H10|(Re)creating Boundary Lines: Assessing Toronto's Ward Boundary Review Process|When Toronto's Ward Boundary Review (WBR) began in 2013, the city's 44 wards varied widely in size, ranging from 45,000 to 90,000 residents. The WBRâ€™s multi-year process was designed by staff and led by consultants, with ample opportunity for involvement by councillors. The final ward boundaries were approved in November 2016 without significant deviation from those recommended in the consultantsâ€™ report. The result was the addition of three new wards. Assuming there are no successful appeals of the decision, the new ward boundaries will be in place for the 2018 election. The ward boundary review raised significant questions about the regularity by which such reviews should be held, the role of city councillors as participants and decision-makers in the process, and the relationship between the WBR and a future governance review. This paper sets out the contested legal terrain within which the City of Torontoâ€™s WBR took place and assesses possible next steps, including the grounds for a possible Ontario Municipal Board appeal. Ultimately, the paper concludes that wards are but one important component of municipal representation and governance.
H10|One in a Million: Field Experiments on Perceived Closeness of the Election and Voter Turnout|A common feature of many models of voter turnout is that increasing the perceived closeness of the election should increase voter turnout. However, cleanly testing this prediction is difficult and little is known about voter beliefs regarding the closeness of a given race. We conduct a field experiment during the 2010 US gubernatorial elections where we elicit voter beliefs about the closeness of the election before and after showing different polls, which, depending on treatment, indicate a close race or a not close race. We find that subjects update their beliefs in response to new information, but systematically overestimate the probability of a very close election. However, the decision to vote is unaffected by beliefs about the closeness of the election. A follow-up field experiment, conducted during the 2014 gubernatorial elections but at much larger scale, also points to little relationship between poll information about closeness and voter turnout.
H10|Who Becomes A Politician?|Can a democracy attract competent leaders, while attaining broad representation? Economic models suggest that free-riding incentives and lower opportunity costs give the less competent a comparative advantage at entering political life. Moreover, if elites have more human capital, selecting on competence may lead to uneven representation. This article examines patterns of political selection among the universe of municipal politicians and national legislators in Sweden, using extraordinarily rich data on competence traits and social background for the entire population. We document four new facts that together characterize an “inclusive meritocracy.” First, politicians are on average significantly smarter and better leaders than the population they represent. Second, this positive selection is present even when conditioning on family (and hence social) background, suggesting that individual competence is key for selection. Third, the representation of social background, whether measured by parental earnings or occupational social class, is remarkably even. Fourth, there is at best a weak trade-off in selection between competence and social representation, mainly due to strong positive selection of politicians of low (parental) socioeconomic status. A broad implication of these facts is that it is possible for democracy to generate competent and socially representative leadership.
H10|Delegation of Regulation|We develop a model to discuss a government’s incentives to delegate to bureaucrats the regulation of an industry. The industry consists of a polluting firm with private information about its production technology. Implementing a transfer-based regulation policy requires the government to make use of a bureaucracy; this has a bureaucratic cost, as the bureaucracy diverts a fraction of the transfer. The government faces a trade-off in its delegation decision: bureaucrats have knowledge of the firms in the industry that the government does not have, but at the same time, they have other preferences than the government, so-called bureaucratic drift. We study how the bureaucratic drift and the bureaucratic cost interact to affect the incentives to delegate. Furthermore, we discuss how partial delegation, i.e., delegation followed by laws and regulations that restrict bureaucratic discretion, increases the scope of delegation. We characterize the optimal delegation rule and show that, in equilibrium, three different regimes can arise that differ in the extent of bureaucratic discretion. Our analysis has implications for when and how a government should delegate its regulation of industry. We find that bureaucratic discretion reduces with bureaucratic drift but that, because of the nature of the regulation problem, the effect of increased uncertainty about the firm’s technology on the bureaucratic discretion depends on how that uncertainty is reduced.
H10|Public Policy Against Political Frictions|Recent research has demonstrated that political distortions can increase macroeconomic volatility. The aim of this paper is to analyze a fiscal policy institution capable of reducing the influence of such distortions on politically-driven fluctuations. We introduce the distinction between mandatory and discretionary public spending in the political model of optimal fiscal policy. We show that the different legislative nature of these components of government spending leads to a divergent impact of mandatory and discretionary spending on macroeconomic volatility. Increasing the fraction of mandatory spending in total government spending reduces the politically-driven volatility of income taxes, total government spending, consumption, labor, and output. Increasing the fraction of discretionary spending has the opposite effect. Our findings are supported by empirical evidence.
H10|Trade Openness and Political Distortions|In this paper we explore the relationship between international trade openness and two major political distortions, political polarization and political instability. We consider the extensive and intensive margins of trade as measured by the number of trade partners and trade volume, respectively. As political distortions and trade characteristics of the country are endogenously related, we instrument political instability by the age difference between the youngest and the oldest effective political leaders of a country and the average neighbors' neighbors political instability. We find that political instability reduces trade openness at the extensive and intensive margin while political polarization negatively affects the extensive margin of trade. We propose a simple model that provides intuition on our findings.
H10|Confucianism and the Legalism: A Model of the National Strategy of Governance in Ancient China|The Confucian school emphasizes family value, moral persuasions, and personal relations. Under Confucianism, there is a free-rider issue in the provision of efforts. Since national officials are chosen through personal relations, they may not be the most capable. The Legalist school emphasizes the usage of incentives and formal institutions. Under the Legalism, the ruler provides strong incentives to local officials which may lead to side effects because some activities are noncontractible. The cold-blood image of the Legalism may alien citizens. By exploiting the paternalistic relationship between the ruler and the ruled under Confucianism and the strength of institution-building under the Legalism, the ruler may benefit from a combination of Confucianism approach and the Legalism approach as the national strategy of governance. As each strategy has its pros and cons, which strategy of is optimal depends on factors such as the minimum enforceable level of public service and the level of institution building costs.

This leads the well off to prefer higher taxes and the poor to reject extreme progressivity. We then provide evidence of these behaviors using a nationally representative survey from Italy. Our empirical analysis confirms that a stronger aversion to unfair distributive outcomes is associated with a higher support for redistribution by individuals with high income and to a lower demand for redistribution by those with low income.
H10|Trends and Features of Research on Foreign Aid: A Literature Review|This paper reviews the economics literature on foreign aid. Aid supporters tend to emphasize results, while its detractors tend to highlight the incentives it provides (although they may still acknowledge some of aid’s positive results, particularly on public health). Like the modes to deliver it, research on foreign aid has evolved over the years. From the traditional aid-growth regressions research has refocused towards micro issues, including institutional inefficiencies or sector-specific bottlenecks. This tendency is positive, in so far as it can lead to useful policy advice that improves the way aid is given. Great gaps in knowledge remain, though. Notably, the aid market is poorly understood in aspects such as donors’ interaction with the recipient government or donors’ coordination. In terms of political economy, recipient countries’ decision making with regards to aid fungibility or the incentives provided by new types of aid (notably China’s) have been largely unexplored. Moreover, the types of public goods that improve households’ living standards are little understood. The scarcity of research on these questions is greatly due to lack of data – or even data opacity; if aid is to be better understood and improved, far greater efforts must be made in terms of collecting and sharing data.
H10|The Government Expenditure Structure and Economic growth|This article examines the effect of the government expenditure structure on the economic growth. The objective is to determine which components of public expenditures are growth enhancing and which growth retarding. The theoretical model is set into the endogenous growth framework and describes the growth mechanism of productive and unproductive government expenditures. The growth impact of public spending composition is analysed for 18 European countries from 1996 to 2012. The empirical part is based on the panel data analysis. The empirical findings suggest that reallocating public resources towards education and health can promote growth. On the contrary higher expenditures on social spending and defence are likely to be growth-retarding.
H10|Consumption Smoothing and Debtor Protections|Protections for debtors are a significant source of consumption insurance. This paper evaluates the insurance created by laws that protect defaulting debtors’ assets. First, I show that households are not fully insured; consumption declines by 3-5% upon default. Second, I estimate the effect of changes in asset protection on the default rate, repayment in default, and interest rates. While additional protection does smooth consumption, the default distortion generates a substantial interest rate cost. Within a sufficient statistics formula, the estimates imply that less asset protection would significantly increase welfare.
H10|Measuring the Strength of the Theories of Government Size|Existing theoretical and empirical evidence on the determinants of government expenditure is inconclusive. We posit that the main cause of this problem is theory uncertainty, which arises due to the fact that the different theories imply different mutually compatible and interrelated mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel model averaging method to perform model averaging in linear regression systems that allows for endogeneity. Using data for more than 90 countries we assess the evidentiary support for nine different theories. Our results suggest that the government size and its components are explained by multiple mechanisms that work simultaneously but differ in their impact and importance. In particular, for general government total expenditure we find decisive evidence for the demography theory and a strong evidence for the globalization and political institution theory. In the case of central government total expenditure, we find that income inequality and macroeconomic policy play a decisive role in addition to demography.
H10|Do authoritarian regimes receive more Chinese development finance than democratic ones? Empirical evidence for Africa|This study is part of an emerging literature that aims to shed light on China's development finance activities in Africa using quantitative estimation techniques. This paper empirically investigates whether African authoritarian regimes receive more Chinese development assistance than democratic ones, both in absolute and relative terms. I use three different measures of democracy/autocracy which allows me to check whether my results depend on the specific indicator chosen. The OLS results suggest that Chinese development finance does not systematically flow to more authoritarian countries, controlling for strategic, economic, political, institutional and geographic confounding factors. The results are not driven by the specific democracy indicator used in the analysis. The findings remain virtually unchanged if I reduce the sample to Sub-Saharan Africa only. Furthermore, the results stand up to several robustness checks, including FE, RE and instrumental variable estimation.
H10|Inequality and the Size of Government|The median voter theory of government size predicts that greater inequality leads to greater demand for redistribution and larger government (Meltzer and Richard, 1981). However, this prediction is often rejected empirically. This paper distinguishes between income inequality induced by differences in labor productivity and income inequality induced by differences in capital income. Whilst the standard argument applies to productivity-induced income inequality, greater capital income inequality leads to smaller government if, as often observed, capital income is difficult to tax. Using OECD data, government size and capital income inequality (proxied by the top 1% income share) are found to be negatively related in both fixed effects and instrumental variable regressions. Moreover, controlling for capital income inequality yields a positive and significant relationship between government size and labor income inequality, as originally conjectured.
H10|Local secessions, homophily, and growth. A model with some evidence from the regions of Abruzzo and Molise (Italy, 1963)|This paper analyses the case of a local secession, i.e. the birth of a new local jurisdiction by separation from an existing one. We present a stylized model in which society is composed of heterogeneous groups and individuals have an homophily bias. The model predicts that: (i) separations, such as the split of a territory into distinct administrative units, occur when the costs of mixed communities are sufficiently large; (ii) the smaller community drives the decision to secede; (iii) welfare gains from the split are associated with positive population growth; (iv) higher payoffs under separations, however, might be related to taste for sameness only, with no (or even negative) effect on economic growth. Empirically, we exploit the secession of the Italian region of Molise from Abruzzo in 1963, a unique event in Italian history. Historical records document that the split was the result of pressures from Molise, the smaller community. Our evidence suggests that the split was associated with population inflows in both areas. Finally, by using a synthetic control approach, we show that the split caused significant benefits to per-capita GDP growth, in both regions.
H10|Economic systems in developing countries: A macro cluster approach|The literature on economic systems and corresponding empirical studies have largely focused on a classification for developed countries, while other world regions have only partly been included and/or not compared to established OECD prototypes on an income-adjusted basis. In our macro clustering approaches, correct for the income bias in clustering variables. We are therefore able to include a worldwide sample of 115 developed and developing countries, the latter including transition countries. The major result from using income adjusted variables is that developing countries join the liberal OECD prototype economies in the world of inequality. On the other hand, a large part of Asian developing countries as well all transition countries join the coordinated and liberal European market economies in the world of equality. As a robust result, European Nordic and transition countries form a cluster combining high levels of innovation and equality of income differences are phased out. At the same time, as argued by La Porta et al. (2008) and Lange et al. (2006), the distribution of non-transition developing countries between and within these worlds of equality and inequality reveals a clear distinction between British vs. other colonial heritages as one driver of economic systems today.

H10|The impact of oil rents on military spending: Does corruption matter?|This study shows that the level of corruption matters in how oil rents affect the military spending within countries. Using panel data covering the 1984–2014 period for the Middle East and North Africa countries, we find that the effect of oil rents on military budget depends on the extent of political corruption. Oil wealth boosts military spending when corruption (measured by the re-scaled ICRG index) exceeds a critical score of 5 (out of 6) in the MENA region.
H10|Criteria of Economic and Social Efficiency of Public Administration in Romania|"The present paper represents an synthesis of the research study entitled Criteria Of Economic And Social Efficiency Of Public Administration In Romania, developed within 'Economic and social criteria of regionalization and local development in Romania' Priority Programme of National Institute of Economic Research ""Costin C. Kiritescu"" (2016). The objectives of the research paper are in agreement with current national strategic priorities, regarding to modernization and efficiency of public administration in Romania. The paper aims to present, from a theoretical and practical perspective, the importance which public administration has within economic systems which are continuously under the influence of political, local or central factors, which decide from a period to another, the proportion of resources allocation needed to achieve various objectives of social or economic nature.

H10|Health Insurance and Child Health: Evidence from Mexico|We present evidence on the health impacts and mechanisms of a large expansion in non-contributory health insurance in Mexico. The Seguro Popular (SP) was rolled out in 2002-2010 across municipalities, providing exogenous variation in access to health services without co-pays. Our intent-to-treat estimates show that SP reduced child mortality by 7% in poor municipalities, saving 861 children/year. The decline is driven mainly by deaths due to preventable causes, such as diarrhea and respiratory infections. We also document an increase in hospital care for children with the same conditions. Our findings have important implications for the ongoing health insurance expansions.
H10|Bringing War Home: Violent Crime, Police Killings and the Overmilitarization of the US Police|The withdrawal from the Afghan and Iraqi wars has led to the arrival of vast quantities of military equipment to the US. Much of this equipment, now unused by the military, has been redistributed to police departments via a program called 1033. In this paper, I study the causal effect on criminal activity and police behavior of the militarization of the police through this program. I do so by taking into account that military equipment is stored in various disposition centers. Police departments do not pay for the cost of these items but must cover all transportation costs. I then use the distance to a disposition center and the timing of the US withdrawal from the wars in an instrumental variable setting. Estimates show that military equipment reduces violent crime and is responsible for 60% of the rapid drop observed since 2007. More than one third of this effect is caused by the displacement of violent crime to neighboring areas. Because police departments do not consider this externality when making militarization decisions, they overmilitarize. Finally, I show that police militarization increases the number of people killed by the police. Estimates imply that all the recent increases in police killings are due to police militarization.
H10|Native American reservation constitutions|Abstract The Cherokees wrote a constitution in 1827; in contrast, the Yokuts tribe on the Santa Rosa Rancheria Reservation adopted theirs in 2014. As Native American tribal constitutions are common, I examine determinants of establishing these written constitutions. During their formation, some reservations had bands of the same tribe forced onto the same land. These reservations of forced coexistence wrote constitutions at an earlier date. More homogeneous, centralized tribes tended to adopt their constitutions at a later date, although this finding is less robust. The implication is that coordination costs were less than the benefits from constraining a potential rival band, and that social norms of centralization made having a written constitution less necessary. Additionally, a positive correlation is found between having a written constitution and economic output, similar to other studies.
H10|Government activity and economic growth – one size fits All?|Abstract This study investigates the role of government activity in economic growth, arguing that economic systems are important and that, therefore, one size of government does not fit all countries. Taking a panel of 111 countries over the years from 1971 to 2010, we consider clusters of economic systems as predicted by an extended Varieties of Capitalism (VoC) approach. The empirical growth impact of government activity is positive but u-shaped and depends on both the quality of institutions and the institutional setting. For the polar cases of liberal economies and Scandinavian coordinated market economies, the potential growth impact is quite similar and superior to other clusters of countries. However, the maximum growth effect is realized for above-average levels of government activity in the Scandinavian countries, while this would be detrimental to growth in liberal countries. Hence, high levels of government activity are consistent with growth but only in economic systems consistently rooted in a high level of government activity.
H10|De jure determinants of new firm formation: how the pillars of constitutions influence entrepreneurship|Abstract This paper provides empirical evidence supporting the view that constitutions are the primary and fundamental institutional determinant of entrepreneurship. It shows that some of the provisions contained in national constitutions are positively and significantly associated with a standard measure of entrepreneurial dynamics, namely the rate of new business density. Using for 115 countries a novel dataset containing the characteristics of the constitutions enacted in the world, applying an IV-GMM treatment to deal with the endogeneity of constitutional rules, and controlling for de facto variables, the paper finds that provisions about the right to conduct/establish a business, the right to strike, consumer protection, anti-corruption, and compulsory education promote higher rates of new firm formation. Contrasting results are instead obtained for provisions concerning protection of intellectual property rights.
H10|Complex Factors Behind Misguided Policies in Socioeconomics: From Mass Migration and Persistent Alienation to Rampant Crime and Economic Malaise|In a complex and chaotic world, people often gloss over the facts and jump to conclusions. Unfortunately, the hasty approach usually yields deficient and even harmful results. The domains affected range from migration and poverty to alienation and crime. According to the Myth of Boon, for instance, immigrants always benefit the host society. In this light, many people envisage the great migrations of the 19th century from Europe to America. However, the United States at that stage was itself a developing country; moreover the Civil War showed that clashing cultures cannot co-exist. Meanwhile the Myth of Multiculturalism asserts that a mashup of mores is always desirable; but the reality is otherwise. When immigrants in their millions pour into sparsely populated districts, they end up replicating the cultures that caused them to flee their homelands in the first place. The upshot is disruptive and distressing for all parties be they newcomers or incumbents. In addition, the Myth of Virtue declares that migrants of all backgrounds are equally upright. Yet comprehensive studies in Sweden have shown that violent crimes can be traced to immigrants at rates which are at least four times those for natives. From another angle, a drove of migrants is a godsend for criminals. For instance, a terrorist ring struck in France in 2015 and again in Belgium the following year. The perpetrators – who grew up in Belgium, France and Sweden – displayed immigrant backgrounds and included part of the cohort that traveled to the Mideast to receive training from militants then returned to Europe by posing as refugees. Since socioeconomic problems are intertwined rather than independent, a piecemeal approach will not fill the bill. Instead, a coherent grasp of the issues and their tie-ups is a prerequisite for devising a wholesome solution.
H10|It Is Not Armed Robbery When Government Takes People's Stuff, It Is Civil Asset Forfeiture|Civil asset forfeiture allows the police to profit from crime instead of the criminal by seizing a person’s belongings that were used in illegal activity. The police profit from crime by keeping a percentage of the proceeds they seize. This ends up creating some perverse incentives, such as having more police resources go to seize people’s assets instead of fighting crime. Shifting police efforts away from combating hard crime into fighting so-called “victimless crimes” causes an increase in hard crimes as criminals substitute from soft crimes, such as selling drugs, into hard crimes where the chances of being caught are now lower.
H10|Are Constitutional States Able to Drive the Global Technological Change?|The present paper aims at assessing the possible efficiency of the principle of national contributions, assumed in the 2015 Paris Framework Convention on Climate Change. Strong historical evidence indicates that any significant development of constitutional states used to take place, in the past, on the rising tide of demographic growth. Presently, we are facing global demographic slowdown, and contesters argue that constitutional states are not the right address to write to if we want breakthrough technological change. This paper assumes that the capacity of constitutional states to carry out the obligations declared in the Framework Convention, i.e. to carry out deep technological changes in the global economy, depends on their economic power, which can be estimated as their capacity to appropriate capital. Empirical data, examined in this article, indicates that since the 1980s, constitutional states have been losing their economic power, and that the overall technological progress is more and more disconnected from that economic power of governments. Moreover, constitutional states seem to be losing their capacity to experiment with their own institutions.
H10|Leadership: A Case Study on the Importance of Ethics and Trust|This research is important because it empirically tests why ethical behavior by business and government leaders is essential for good management—which is to earn trust from customers and constituents—thus ensuring organizations are successful, for the greater good, over the long term, especially in the global marketplace. Law and morality are two standards by which business and government leaders are judged, but these norms fail whenever laws are not enforced and morality is disregarded. Five research questions on leadership are statistically tested, using a Likert-scale response measure questionnaire—based on “perceptions of societal corruption” and “trust levels,” using Bandura’s “aggressive behavior modification theory,” as the model for analysis. Nigeria is selected as the location of this case study on leadership ethics and trust, because Nigerian government officials have a long history of unethical and corrupt behavior. Descriptive statistics, along with chi-square quantitative research methods reveals “perceptions of societal corruption” in Nigeria are high and “trust levels” for government leaders are very low. Leaders in Nigeria are only as ethical as the code-of-conduct prevalent in their country—where cultural, economic and legal factors contribute to the nation’s corrupt society—which may cause Nigeria to become a failed state. To change the Nigerian culture of societal corruption—education is necessary—to instruct elected officials, civil servants, business leaders and Nigerian society, at large, on the importance of ethics and trust. Nigerian government and business leaders should institute an ethics policy—and implement five suggested reforms presented in this paper—which will help establish government leader’s ethical integrity and improve citizens’ trust and confidence in their government. Recommendations for future research on government and business leadership ethics and trust are offered.
H10|Government Consumption Volatility and the Size of Nations|This paper analyzes the relation between government consumption volatility and country size. Using an unbalanced sample of 160 countries from 1960 to 2010, it finds that smaller countries have more volatile government consumption. Moreover, while this relation is more negative for more volatile economies, there is also evidence that smaller countries have more volatile government consumption even controlling for the level of volatility in the economy.
H10|Social and economic development of Russia: Finding new dynamics|The paper deals with Russian economic development and economic policy in 2015—2016. The analysis is focused on external and domestic challenges as well as on anti-crisis policy of the Russian government. Special attention is paid to key elements of a new model of economic growth in Russia. The paper discusses priorities of economic policy of sustainable growth including: budget efficiency, structural reforms and import substitution, stimulation of entrepreneurship, efficiency of public administration, modernization of welfare state.
H10|Towards a privacy framework for India in the age of the internet|Over the last decade, there have been vast improvements in surveillance technology and the availability, storage, and mining of personal information online, supported by developments in big data analytics. This has created a public policy conundrum over balancing the benefits of big data with the threat to the right to privacy. In an environment of pervasive surveillance and intrusive technology, there is a need for improved protection of privacy rights through a mixture of legislation and regulation, and building public awareness and demand for safeguards. This paper makes a case for the need for privacy from both the State and the private sector; examines the jurisprudential development of the right to privacy in India, and lays down privacy principles, that will underlie any proposed privacy law. It then evaluates the Indian IT Act, and the recently legislated Aadhaar Act, against the proposed privacy principles.
H10|Endogenous Leadership in a Federal Transfer Game|The paper explores the issue of leadership in central transfer within a federation. In a federal country, provinces, in anticipation of the ultimate federal bailout, may spend more than what is optimal. Such behaviour creates negative fiscal externalities and harms the central government. To counter such tendencies, it is suggested by policymakers that central authority should always be a first mover in the transfer game: once the grant (presumably formulaic) is dispensed, it should refrain from any ex post transfer. In spite of such recommendations, central governments, in almost all countries, chooses to be the second mover from time to time. We explore the conditions, other than the familiar political economy arguments, under which the central government optimally chooses to be the second mover. The key determinants of the first or second mover advantages in such situations is the nature of spillover effects of public goods between the two tiers of government
H10|Costa Rica: Boosting productivity to sustain income convergence|In the latest 30 years, Costa Rica's real GDP per capita has more than doubled, driven by increasing labour utilisation. Labour productivity has instead stagnated at around 30% of the more advanced OECD countries. Productivity growth has been lacklustre despite the opening up of markets to international competition and large FDI inflows. Several obstacles continue to hamper the development of domestic firms and markets. They have fostered a dual speed economy characterised, on the one hand, by an innovative, productive and export oriented FDI sector – increasingly focussing on high value added sectors – and, on the other hand, a domestic sector – dominated by small firms and focused on traditional industries – that is neither innovative nor very productive. Boosting national productivity to sustain the convergence process towards OECD countries living standards will hinge on creating the right conditions for domestic firms to thrive and become more innovative and productive, while maintaining the long-standing commitment to open international markets and investment. To make this happens the government should: 1) encourage innovation and improving links between domestic and foreign firms by better enforcing and implementing intellectual property rights, shifting public R&D spending towards tertiary education institutions, and improving the coordination of public programmes promoting innovation of local firms and linkages with foreign affiliates; 2) strengthen competition in product markets and ease access to finance for SMEs by eliminating anti-trust exemptions, empowering the competition commission and giving it more independence, reducing barriers to entrepreneurship, ameliorating the corporate governance of state-owned enterprises and creating a level-playing fields between state-owned and private banks; 3) enhance the institutional and legal framework of the transport and other infrastructure sectors by reducing the number of agencies involved in policy development and project executions, and establishing an institutional framework to reduce policy uncertainty and attract more private investment. This Working Paper relates to the 2016 OECD Economic Assessment of Costa Rica (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-costa-rica.htm). Costa Rica: Stimuler la productivité pour soutenir la convergence des revenus Dans les dernières 30 années, le PIB réel par habitant du Costa Rica a plus que doublé, grâce à une utilisation croissante du travail. La productivité du travail a stagné autour de 30% des pays les plus avancés de l'OCDE. La croissance de la productivité a été terne, malgré l'ouverture des marchés à la concurrence internationale et de grandes entrées d'IDE. Plusieurs obstacles continuent d'entraver le développement des entreprises et des marchés intérieurs. Ils ont favorisé une économie à deux vitesses caractérisée, d'une part, par un secteur de l'IDE innovateur, productif et orienté vers l'exportation - se concentrant de plus en plus sur les secteurs à forte valeur ajoutée - et, d'autre part, un secteur domestique - dominé par les petites entreprises et concentré sur les industries traditionnelles - qui ne sont ni innovantes, ni très productives. Stimuler la productivité nationale pour soutenir le processus de convergence vers des pays de l'OCDE le niveau de vie dépendra de la création des conditions pour les entreprises nationales de se développer et de devenir plus innovantes et productives, tout en maintenant l'engagement de longue date pour ouvrir les marchés et les investissements internationaux. Pour que cela arrive, le gouvernement devrait: 1) encourager l'innovation et l'amélioration des liens entre les entreprises nationales et étrangères par une meilleure application et par la mise en oeuvre des droits de propriété intellectuelle, en déplaçant les dépenses de R&D vers les établissements d'enseignement supérieur, et par l'amélioration de la coordination des programmes publics de promotion de l'innovation des entreprises locales et des liens avec des sociétés étrangères affiliées; 2) renforcer la concurrence sur les marchés de produits et de faciliter l'accès au financement pour les PME en éliminant les exemptions anti-trust, habilitant la commission de la concurrence et en lui donnant plus d'indépendance, de réduire les obstacles à l'entrepreneuriat, améliorer la gouvernance des entreprises publiques et la création d'une concurrence equitable entre les banques publiques et privées; 3) renforcer le cadre institutionnel et juridique du transport et d'autres secteurs de l'infrastructure, en réduisant le nombre d'organismes impliqués dans les exécutions de développement des politiques et des projets, et l'établissement d'un cadre institutionnel pour réduire l'incertitude politique et d'attirer davantage d'investissements privés. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE de la Costa Rica 2016 (www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-economique-costa-rica.htm).
H10|Fiscal Decentralisation and Income Inequality: Empirical Evidence from OECD Countries|Fiscal decentralisation might be partially responsible for rising income inequality by exacerbating competition between sub-national governments and compromising national government’s ability to redistribute. This paper investigates the relationship between fiscal decentralisation and economy-wide disposable income inequality. Drawing on a dataset of up to 20 OECD countries and covering the period 1996 to 2011, the analysis links a set of income inequality indicators and a wide array of fiscal decentralisation indicators. Results indicate that decentralisation might actually reduce income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, but the effect is rather small and unstable across specifications. Fine-graining the analysis by using income percentile ratios, in turn, produces more significant and stable results. As such, the effects of fiscal decentralisation are not the same along the income distribution. While decentralisation tends to be associated with a reduction in income inequality between high incomes and the median, it is linked to a divergence of low income groups from the median, notably via sub-central tax autonomy. Transfers between levels of government also tend to be associated with an increase in the gap between lower and middle incomes. Interpreting these effects jointly, it seems that mainly middle income earners benefit from fiscal decentralisation.
H10|Does Fiscal Decentralisation Foster Regional Convergence?|Across the OECD, GDP per capita is converging. In contrast, regional disparities – or differences in GDP per capita across jurisdictions – are rising, mainly as a result of widening productivity differences. Fiscal decentralisation could help reduce them again. According to new OECD research, assigning more ownsource revenue to sub-national governments dampens regional GDP disparities and underpins regional convergence. In more decentralised settings, catching-up regions appear to adopt policy innovations more rapidly and their policy innovations have a stronger impact. Conversely, intergovernmental grants tend to fuel disparities, probably because they discourage lagging regions to develop their economic and fiscal base. However, when replacing intergovernmental transfers by own-source revenue, lower disparities in regional output may come at the cost of larger disparities in regional income and more unequal public service standards. Reforms to intergovernmental fiscal frameworks should therefore be two-pronged: a rise in sub-national own-source revenue should be paired with a re-design of intergovernmental transfers and fiscal equalisation, in order to make all jurisdictions enjoy the benefits of more sub-central fiscal power. La décentralisation budgétaire encourage-t-elle la convergence régionale du PIB ? Si l’on observe une convergence des PIB par habitant au sein de la zone OCDE, en revanche, les disparités régionales, c’est-à-dire, les écarts de PIB par habitant entre régions d’un même pays, se creusent, essentiellement du fait de l’augmentation des écarts de productivité. La décentralisation budgétaire pourrait contribuer à ce que ces disparités se réduisent de nouveau. Une nouvelle étude de l’OCDE montre que les disparités régionales de PIB sont atténuées et la convergence entre les régions stimulée lorsque les administrations infranationales disposent de recettes propres plus importantes. Il semble que, dans un environnement plus décentralisé, les régions en phase de rattrapage adoptent plus rapidement les innovations de politique publique et que celles-ci aient un impact plus fort. À l’inverse, les transferts interadministrations tendent à alimenter les disparités, probablement parce qu’ils n’incitent pas les régions en retard à élargir leur assise économique et budgétaire. Toutefois, en remplaçant les transferts interadministrations par des recettes propres, on risque de voir la réduction des différences régionales au niveau de la production s’opérer au prix d’un creusement des disparités au niveau des revenus et d’un accroissement des inégalités en matière de normes de service public. Les réformes des cadres budgétaires interadministrations devraient donc être déployées en deux volets : l’augmentation des recettes infranationales propres devrait être couplée à une redéfinition des transferts interadministrations et de la péréquation budgétaire, de façon que toutes les juridictions profitent des avantages du renforcement du pouvoir budgétaire des administrations infranationales.
H10|Large-Scale Transition of Economic Systems – Do CEECs Converge Toward Western Prototypes?|Abstract We analyze potential convergence of Central and Eastern European Countries’ (CEECs) economic systems toward western prototypes. The corresponding comparative capitalism literature identified four prototype economic systems among (traditional) OECD countries: Liberal, Continental, Nordic, and Mediterranean. Based on a comprehensive macroeconomic cluster approach, we are able to confirm these prototype country clusters. At the same time, our results indicate that the economic systems of CEECs have still not completely converged toward these prototypes, but complement them by independent Liberal (CEEC LME) and Continental/Nordic (CEEC CME) varieties, showing no signs of convergence toward the inconsistent and underperforming economic system of Mediterranean countries.
H10|Alexis Tsipras und der rhetorische Diskurs als Politik<BR>[Alexis Tsipras and the rhetorical discourse as Policy]|"Es existiert wohl keinerlei «Präzedenzfall», der in irgendeiner Weise vergleichbar wäre mit der vollkommenen Verwandlung des derzeitigen griechischen Ministerpräsidenten Alexis Tsipras und dessen Anpassung an die Anforderungen der griechischen Realität. Wahrhaft, all zu rasch übersetzte sich sein radikaler, unkonventioneller und extremer Diskurs gegen die in Griechenland seit 2010 implementierte harte Sparpolitik, in einen taktischen Rückzug. Die SYRIZA Partei, eine heterogene Mischung linker Strömungen, nutzte den Unmut der Bevölkerung gegenüber den schmerzhaft anmutenden Sparmaβnahmen des sogenannten griechischen Memorandums, um den eigenen machtpolitischen Senkrechtsstart voranzutreiben und sich ziemlich rasch von einer kleinen Protestpartei zu einer Machtpartei zu verwandeln. Dementsprechend transferierte diese Partei, ohne die geringste moralische Umschweife, die Verzweiflung der Bürger in einen extremen rhetorischen Diskurs der scheinbaren „Verteidigung sozialer Rechte“ hinein, jedoch mit dem Ziel des eigenen Wahlsieges und anschließend die Übernahme der Macht. Abstract English There is probably no ""precedent"", which would be comparable in any way with the perfect transformation of the current Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras and its adaptation to the requirements of the Greek reality. Truly, all too quickly his radical, unconventional and extreme discourse against the implemented in Greece since 2010 tough austerity policy, is transformed into a tactical retreat.. The SYRIZA party, a heterogeneous mixture of left Groups , used the displeasure of the population to the painful-looking Austerity measures of the so-called Greek memorandum to advance their own political take off to power and rather rapidly to transform from a small protest party to a ruling party. Accordingly, this party transferred, without the slightest moral ado, the despair of the citizens in an extreme rhetorical discourse of apparent ""defense of social rights"" into it, however, with the aim of the own electoral victory and then the acquisition of power."
H10|Экономическая Точка Бифуркации Для Украинского Олигархического Государства В Контексте Модели Стационарного Бандита<BR>[Economic Point Of Bifurcation For Ukrainian Oligarchic State In The Stationary Bandit Model]|The article is devoted to a retrospective analysis of transitional model of Ukrainian state’s economic behavior in the context of public goods’ distribution based on the Lala-Mint classification. The characteristics and nature of the rent of fractional oligarchic state as a stationary bandit in Ukraine are defined on the basis of the McGuire-Olson model. Using basic mathematical and graphical tools and also the results of built multiple regression models the potential effects of reducing or maintaining economic rent of the stationary bandit in Ukraine are reflected. The problem of economic bifurcation point was outlined for Ukrainian oligarchic state.
H10|Tsipras and the rhetorical speech as policy|It is the first time after the restoration of democracy in Greece that such a U-turn has been conducted. The radical, unconventional and extreme rhetoric against harsh austeritywas sharply transformed into a tactical retreat in order to supposedly support more effectively the public interest. SYRIZA, a heterogeneous alloy of leftist tendencies, treated the popular anger and resentment towards harsher austerity measures in order to achieve electoral rise. Consequently, it was rapidly transformed from a small – protest – party into a power party. In this instance, it transformed, without moral curb, citizens’ despair into an extreme rhetoric which defended their “rights” in order to rise to power. Namely, SYRIZA treated instrumentally the expectations of the desperate as a means to rise to power in order to benefit the party but not for the whole society.
H10|متطلبات إرساء حكومة إلكترونية ناجحة: نماذج وتجارب عالمية وعربية<BR>[Requirements of Developing a Successful E-Government: international and Arab experiences]|Recently, information technology has a tremendous influence on how Governments operate, and many governments have started to make moves toward e-Government that enable them to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector, as well as delivering quality public services in alignment with the goals and aspirations of communities. In this paper, we present the case of Korea as the e-government leader with the highest scores in ‘E-government Development Index’ according to the latest edition of the United Nations E-Government Survey, followed by the e-government of El Bahrain that took serious action to improve e-government, and as a result, the only Arab country to be classified among the very high-performing countries within the EGDI, and to bring out the reasons behind their success. Finally, we review Algeria e-government project, Some critical factors that affect its implementation.
H10|The consolidated group definition of public sector in the Czech republic and Slovakia|The article deals with the definition of a consolidated group in the Czech Republic and Slovakia public sector. On 30 January 2015 The International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board published new standard IPSAS 35 - Consolidated Financial Statements. This standard represents a very sophisticated construction accounting axioms based on the approximation of the public sector to the private sector in the accounting consolidation field. The aim of this article is an identification and subsequent comparison of methodological elements in the consolidated group definition of public sector in the Czech and Slovak national legislative amendments in the context of IPSAS 35.
H10|A needs theory of governance|New-institutional economics hypothesizes imperfect rationality, self-seeking preferences, monetary-related needs, and opportunism as fundamental features of human behavior. Consistently, new-institutionalist models of governance highlight the efficiency and transaction costs minimizing features of control rights and governance. Differently, needs theory of governance, as here presented, hypothesizes imperfect rationality, multiple needs, and reciprocity, in which case opportunism is reduced to an exception to individual behavior. Consistently, it presents a theory that links production governance with the wellbeing of those partaking in production. Building on Maslowâ€™s human psychology, the governance model suggested in this paper is aimed at evidencing the self-actualization potential of control rights, organizational structures and practices. The application of Maslowâ€™s theory to the institutional structure of organizations suggests that the deepest organizational layers (control rights and governance) broadly correspond to the most basic needs in Maslowâ€™s theory (survival, security and belonging), while the outer layers (managerial models and employment relations) correspond to the fulfillment of the highest needs (self-esteem and self-actualization). Cooperative firms are used as an illustration of governance solutions consistent with needs theory in human psychology
H10|State bloc versus individual delegate voting at the constitutional convention: Did it make a difference?|Voting at the 1787 Constitutional Convention followed the procedure of requiring state votes to be determined by the majority vote of each state's present delegates, and the outcome of the vote to be decided by majority vote of the states. In establishing the new legislature, the adopted Constitution set rules such that a simple majority of all present representatives would determine the outcome of each legislative vote. We investigate how Convention vote outcomes might have changed if this voting rule was in place for the Convention. Using spatial models on 398 separate roll calls, we identify which vote outcomes would have differed under individual delegate voting. Analysis suggests only 16 of the vote outcomes would have changed but those that were predicted to change included considering unequal representation in the Senate (i.e., similar to representation in the House) and requiring two-thirds (rather than three-fourths) of states to ratify constitutional amendments.
H10|The impact of government size and composition on growth in EU15 countries|The goal of this paper is to investigate the long-run effect of government size and composition on growth. Unlike previous studies, this paper employs an improved dataset and a more adequate econometric technique. Using pooled mean group (PMG) estimation approach, which is particularly suitable because it allows short-term adjustments and convergence speeds to vary across countries while imposing cross-country homogeneity restrictions on the long-run coefficients, we empirically test the relationship between growth and government size and its composition in developed European economies, over the period 1970 to 2014. The obtained results indicate that high aggregate spending levels are an impediment for growth in developed economies, while the single most important government expenditure item is - Education.
H10|Editor’S Introduction To: A Symposium On Second And Third Best Theory: Criticisms And Applications|This paper presents the editor’s introduction and the table of contents for a symposium on Second and Third Best Theory forthcoming in The Pacific Economic Review, 22:2, May 2017. Unusual in such cases, the two editors are the major protagonists in this debate. In the symposium Ng maintains that second-best theory appears to preclude giving theory-based policy advice because full second-best optima cannot be determined in any practical case. Lipsey disagrees and discusses the development of context-specific policies not based on the theory of the optimal allocation of resources. To allow for theory-based policy, Ng offers his theory of third best. The major disagreement over this theory concerns its proposition: first-best rules for third-best worlds under Informational Poverty (not enough is known to determine the desirable direction of change of some the policy variable). Lipsey argues that, if correct, this rule would upset the main result of second-best theory that the sign of the change in the objective function may be either positive or negative when first-best rules are fulfilled piecemeal in second-best worlds. Wo supports Ng’s third best theory and derives additional rules, while Boadway surveys the application of second best theory in several cases from the literature of public economics.
H10|The Social Effects of Ethnic Diversity at the Local Level: A Natural Experiment with Exogenous Residential Allocation|Relying on diversity measures computed at the apartment block level under conditions of exogenous allocation of public housing in France, this paper identifies the effects of ethnic diversity on social relationships and housing quality. Housing Survey data reveal that diversity induces social anomie. Through the channel of anomie, diversity accounts for the inability of residents to sanction others for vandalism and to act collectively to demand proper building maintenance. However, anomie also lowers opportunities for violent confrontations, which are not related to diversity.
H10|Government size, country size, openness and economic growth in selected MENA countries|Purpose – The purpose of this article is to examine the interconnected relationships between government size, country size, openness and economic growth. In fact, more trade openness increases government size, which lays stabilizer role against external shocks and GDP volatility. More country size leads to lower government share to GDP from one side and less openness from other side, where as per capita expenditure on public goods is lower, and large markets enjoy more productivity and less incentives for large market to increase openness than the small markets. Finally, economic growth and government have a negative relationship if government size exceeds the optimal size. Design/methodology/approach - We employ three models, which two of them are using 2SLS technique and the third model is using GMM system analysis to examine these relationships in eight selected MENA countries. Our panel data is for the period from 1977-2013 sourced from the World Development Indicators of the World Bank. Findings - Results prove literature proposed hypotheses for the selected region and period, and show that government share to GDP exceeds the optimal size. Moreover, more growth can be realized through more integration in the world economy. Research limitations/implications – Data limitation led to the inclusion of only eight countries of MENA region. We recommend to convert government expenditure to investment and infrastructure instead of social transfer and current expenditure. Furthermore, more studies could be done about the government expenditure structure. In addition, we recommend to minimize government intervention to the market. Finally, growth of government does not improve investment environment or reduce transactions costs, and it crowds out private sector. Originality/value – This is the first work in MENA region, and using recent econometric techniques in subject according to our knowledge.
H10|Corruption in Russia|We analyze the determinants of corruption in Russia using law enforcement data on corruption incidents for a panel of 79 Russian regions for the period 2004-13. We find that the relative salaries of bureaucrats determine corruption levels: corruption declines as relative salaries rise, yet at strongly diminishing rates. Furthermore, we show that even very limited media freedom helps to curtail corruption. Other important determinants are the strength of law enforcement, education levels, and unemployment rates.
H10|Historical Polities Data|For a systematic analysis of the relationship between state and religion over time, a new dataset has been developed, called “Historical Polities Data.” It includes annual information on the territories occupied by today’s nation states since the year 1000. This brief essay describes the history of the project, its contents and sources, and plans for future work. The objectives are to provide background information for research using the data, acknowledge the contributions of numerous students who assisted in its construction, share insights with other investigators engaged in similar data construction projects, and identify the limitations of the data and areas that need further development.
H10|Geography, Transparency, and Institutions|We propose a theory by which geographic attributes explain cross-regional institutional differences in : (1) the scale of the state, (2) the distribution of power within state hierarchy, and (3) property rights over land. The mechanism that underlies our theory concerns the state's extractive capacity. In particular, we argue that the ability to appropriate revenue from the farming sector is affected by the transparency of farming which, in turn, is affected by geography and technology. We apply the theory to explain the differences between the institutions of Ancient Egypt, Southern Mesopotamia and Northern Mesopotamia<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H10|Cereals Appropriability and Hierarchy|We propose that the development of social hierarchy following the Neolithic Revolution was an outcome of the ability of the emergent elite to appropriate cereal crops from farmers and not a result of land productivity, as argued by conventional theory. We argue that cereals are easier to appropriate than roots and tubers, and that regional differences in the suitability of land for different crops explain therefore differences in the formation of hierarchy and states. A simple model illustrates our main theoretical argument. Our empirical investigation shows that land suitability for cereals relative to suitability for tubers explains the formation of hierarchical institutions and states, whereas land productivity does not.
H10|Public debt and economic growth – economic systems matter|Abstract Most studies on the relationship between public debt and economic growth implicitly assume homogeneous debt effects across their samples. We –in accordance with recent literature– challenge this view and state that there likely is a great deal of cross-country heterogeneity in that relationship. However, other than scholars assuming that all countries are different, we expect that clusters of countries differ. We identify three country clusters with distinct economic systems: Liberal (Anglo Saxon), Continental (Core EU members) and Nordic (Scandinavian). We argue that different degrees of fiscal uncertainty at comparable levels of public debt between those economic systems constitute a major source of heterogeneity in the debt-growth relationship. Our empirical evidence supports this assumption. Continental countries face more growth reducing public debt effects than especially Liberal countries. There, public debt apparently exerts neutral or even positive growth effects, while for Nordic countries a non-linear relationship is discovered, with negative debt effects kicking in at public debt values of around 60% of GDP.
H10|Social nudging with condorcet juries and its strategic implications for a paternalistic implementation of LED bulbs|"In the light of irrational behaviour and decision biases leading people to commit systematic blunders, Thaler and Sunstein (2003) presented in their approach of libertarian paternalism the concept of choice architecture, to face the problem of wrong decisionmaking and resulting welfare losses by ""Nudging"" irrational agents. The debate about this approach focuses on its compatibility with libertarian principles, on its welfare-enhancing character and on the knowledge problem about peoples' true preferences. The goal of this paper is to show in part I that with recourse to contract theory, applied constitutional economics provides a justification of both the libertarian character and the profitability of libertarian paternalism. The use of libertarian paternalistic policies for environmental in particular to promote the acceptance and purchase of climate-friendly and sustainable LED bulbs can be justified as a selfbinding commitment induced by hierarchical preferences for sustainability. Referring to the Condorcet Jury Theorem, stating that 1) an expert jury is always more competent than a single expert and that 2) for large juries, group competence tends to infallibility with an increase in group size, libertarian paternalism for ecological goals can be defended against the knowledge problem. In part II an extension of the Condorcet Jury Theorem relaxing its restrictive assumptions of binary choice, homogeneous and independent voters, investigates its applicability and reliability for paternalistic interventions and allows a new perspective in the debate of choice framing paternalism, namely the concept of ""social nudging"" to promote social long-term goals. This paper provides an approach of effective choice framing by applying the CJT and implementing expert juries with the subsidiary principle.

H10|Coming home without supplies: Impact of household needs on bribe involvement and gender gaps| Using a unique data on sub-Saharan Africa, we show that even though in absolute terms men pay more bribes, in relative terms, women are more likely to be involved in bribery or do favors that benefit the household. Additionally, running country specific regressions shows that for 65% of the countries gender differences when household needs are at stake disappear. These results underscore the importance of household needs to the woman, and that the effect of gender on corruption may well be context specific.
H10|Smoothing Asymmetric Shocks vs. Redistribution in the Euro Area: A Simple Proposal for Dealing with Mistrust in the Euro Area|The euro area will not have a centralised budget and smoothing of country-specific asymmetric shocks via private financial markets will develop only slowly. Mistrust among the governments has caused rigid, even pro-cyclical fiscal policies. Smoothing mechanisms are absent due to the fear that the transfers would develop into permanent redistribution. For removing these deficiencies we propose a transfer mechanism to be managed in periods of seven years so that the cumulative balance of each country is cleared in equal instalments during the subsequent 7-year period. The transfers would smoothen asymmetric shocks and alleviate the rigidity of the fiscal rules.
H10|Absorbing Shocks: National Rainy-Day Funds and Cross-Country Transfers in a Fiscal Union|In this paper we investigate the interplay between national rainy-day funds and supra-national transfers in a fiscal union. We find that moral hazard leads to lower contributions to a rainy day fund with a fiscal union present, and further that the higher the fiscal transfer, the lower will be the contributions to the rainy-day fund. The optimal size of the fiscal union trades-off the ex-post insurance provided by the union and the moral hazard which reduces national ex-ante preparation for stabilization policies. Optimally, the insurance provided by the fiscal union should be lower (1) the more effective is own-fiscal policy; (2) the more the presence of the fiscal union reduces rainy-day fund savings; (3) the lower is the relative probability of recession; and (4) the lower is the utility gain of redistribution in the union. We also find that commitment to a transfer policy is essential. A fiscal union that is prone to break the rules on transfers negatively impacts the ex-ante contributions to individual members' rainy day funds.
H10|Aleatoric Democracy|Democracy usually is identified by the right to vote. However, in recent times voting procedures have been criticized, as they seemingly do not guarantee that all parts of the population have an adequate voice in the established political process. We suggest invigorating an old but nearly forgotten procedure to overcome this deficit: Aleatoric Democracy based on a combination of voting and random decisions. By using random mechanisms the interests of the whole population are considered. Persons and ideas, being so far disregarded, are taken into account. Democracy becomes vivid and creative, and does not run the danger of being entrenched.
H10|Taxation Influence On Economic Stability In Romania And European Union|The aim of the paper is the taxation system in Romania and European Union. The first part is concentrated on the theoretical and general aspects regarding the European fiscal policies with a focus on the conditions that member states should respect. Our research continues with the comparison between the share of indirect taxes and direct taxes at the EU level. We discovered that there are some fiscal connections between countries with similar economies. At the end, we emphasized the conclusions obtained with our article.
H10|Evaluating Transformation Process In Central Asian Turkic Republics In Terms Of Privatization And Economic Freedom On 25th Anniversary Of The Transition|“Transition economies” phrase , covering various countries as well as Caucasus and Central Asian Turkic Republics, was found its place in the literature by the 1980’s and this transformation process from the centrally planned economy to market economy was analyzed with economic and fiscal dimensions. Without any doubt, the transition process of these countries wouldn’t be easy and exhibits differences, especially for the Central Asian Turkic Republics, as they were governed under the command economy over many years. Related studies is put forward the increasing importance and future predictions within this scope. Two of the most economical and fiscal prosperity indicators of the transition economies are reconstruction of government and privatization implementations. In this context, after literature review analyzing the privatization implementations and the level of economic freedom indexes related to reconstruction of government by many dimensions under seminal international databases are crucial for that countries. With this study, after literature review , on the 25th year of the transition of Caucasus and Central Asian Turkic Republics, in 2016, reconstruction of government and privatization implementations are examined both in fiscal and economically and will be analyzed by many dimensions under seminal international databases . Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan are not only the prosperous countries in this respect but also have outstanding mining and underground resources. We also reach that the reform process of transition and the prosperity of economic indicators have not been strongly correlated.
H10|The Impact of Motivation Enhancing Practices and Mediating Role of Talent Engagement on Turnover Intentions: Evidence from Malaysia|Employees are the backbone of any organization. Engaged and motivated employees enable the organization to gain the competitive advantage. Retention of employees is the main concern of organization now a days. The purpose of this study was to examine the direct relationship of motivation enhancing practices on turnover intentions and through talent engagement (job engagement and organization engagement) among the managers in hotel industry in Kuala Lumpur. This study investigated engagement in two dimensions. A total of 560 questionnaires were distributed to managers, who were working in three star, four star and five star hotels located in Kuala Lumpur. Structural equation modeling was applied to test the hypotheses. The study found that motivation enhancing practices (employee recognition, salary and perks, performance feedback, opportunities for advancement and development job security and workload) have significant negative relationship with employees’ turnover intentions. The interesting finding is that job engagement does not mediate between the motivation enhancing and turnover intentions while organization engagement statistically significant mediates the relationship. The findings of this study is important for hotels management to implement these motivation enhancing practices. Management of hotels should pay more attention to these motivation enhancing practices in order to retain the potential managers
H10|Perspectives On Marketing And Organizational Advertising|"The main objective of this paper is to show several perspectives on marketing and organizational advertising, as fields of research, training and practice. We also aim to highlight the relationship between the two concepts: ""marketing"" and ""advertising of organizations""."
H10|Perspectives And Modalities In Order To Develop The Didactic Staff's Intercultural Competences|The purpose of the study is to analyse the impact of some perspectives, strategies, and programs, in order to develop the intercultural dimension of the professional competence profile, regarding the teaching career. The investigation tools are represented by the questionnaire and the focus group, applied to a sample of 110 subjects. The results of the research emphasize: a) the social and educational necessity in order to train the didactic staff's intercultural competence; b) the subjects 'options for programs of intercultural psychology, intercultural communication, the didactic methodology of the intercultural education; c) the subjects' adhesion to creating a European curricular framework, in order to acclimatize the teachers to an intercultural environment. The results achieved emphasize the idea of adopting the transformational curricular model as part of the intercultural curricula, in order to train the teachers and to synchronize specific strategies as part of European countries.
H10|Globalisation, Tradition And Cultural Identity In Spanish Football: Reflections And Observations|This article offers some reflections and observations on the complex relationship between the forces of Globalisation and Spanish football, posing the key question as to whether the impact of Globalisation has been a quintessentially corrosive dynamic, eroding the quasi - sacrosanct traditions of the Spanish game to fashion a distinctive post- modern pastiche of elitism and inequality based on an orgy of consumption and commodity.
H10|Overcoming The Children's Mourning State Through Psychological Intervention|Death and mourning that follows it are experiences that occurs in everyone`s life at one time. There are unavoidable, painful, sad experiences even for adults who are able to manage their own emotions, and evenmore for children who, at least in early childhood and elementary school aren't able to understand on their own what it's happening in that moment, and how to manage their sadness and live the mourning period properly. Due to the fact that children are not yet fully developed cognitively, cannot understand on their own the concept of death. At that age, death seems for them not to be permanent. Children believe that death is a reversible process that the person in their family is temporarily left and they will return at any moment, and they will wait and ask for that moment long after the actual death, if lacked of any other information. Moreover, children think that death is avoidable, since - at that age, self-centeredness is somehow a characteristic of their personality and death hasn't affected their own person; therefore, when death occurs in their family, their reality will be brutally shaken and they will be very disoriented. Also, in early childhood, kids have a symbolic, magical perspective about death; they imagine it as a devil, a monster or a black lady with a scythe and many other images, far from a realistic perspective. Considering this aspects, it is very important that a realistic, honest, adapted to their age perspective of death when it affects their family. Unfortunately, in many cultures, death is still a taboo. It still exists the belief of overprotecting children from suffering by hiding the death of a close family member, lying them and taking them far away so that they cannot see the dead person. But actually, by practicing this, parents, teachers and persons around the children only make him be more disoriented and suffer more by not knowing what happened with the person they love. As a parent or teacher, it is very important to understand that staying beside the children and sustaining him emotionally, without hiding him any aspect about death of the loved one has a crucial importance for their future development; otherwise, it is probable that they will develop symptoms of chronic depression, and as adults, problems of attachment and extreme fear of death. Proper education for population regarding this delicate subject is a sign of a developed society. In the light of this perspectives, specialists and psychotherapists should be prepared to offer advice and support in any moment so that parents will be learn how to stand by their children in the hard and long process of managing their negative emotions, living their mourning together.
H10|The Dimension Of The Socio-Cultural Brand Of Coca-Cola|Today, advertising is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating social phenomena, a fundamental factor influencing individuals, attitudes or lifestyles. It is an important element of contemporary culture, deeply anchored in our cultural heritage. In this framework encompasses our article, aiming to demonstrate influential aspects of the Coca-Cola advertising slogan as an instrument of culture and ideology, in a few words, a merciless mirror of our society.
H10|A Possible Barrier In Extending The Process Of Lifelong Learning (Lll)|The process of accumulating cognitive and socio-emotional proficiencies is accomplished mainly during the first period of a person's life. These proficiencies assure a basis for the ulterior accumulation of specific skills through vocational and technical education, superior education and lifelong learning. Employees have limited access to information about their training opportunities, and employers do not benefit of stimuli so that they might offer a professional formation. A comparative approach regarding necessary skills categories on labor market may be very useful from the education and formation point of view.
H10|Diminished-dimensional political economy|Economists base policy advice on models of responses by a variety of economic entities to policy adoptions. There is compelling evidence that these entities do not optimize as mainstream economics assumes. Rather, they limit decision-making to solving problems of much smaller dimensionality. We consider how political economy goes awry when ignoring diminished dimensionality, and some research avenues opened up by this realization.
H10|Religious heterogeneity and fiscal policy: Evidence from German reunification|Theoretical work based on social identity theory predicts that population diversity undermines redistributive public policies. This article tests this proposition exploiting an exogenous shock in diversity due to Germany’s reunification. In contrast to previous work on ethno-linguistic or racial heterogeneity, we specifically analyze religious diversity, which is an increasingly relevant social cleavage in many countries. Our main results corroborate that increasing religious diversity leads to a change in fiscal policies in Bavarian municipalities over the 1983–2005 period. Moreover, we find some evidence of declining individual-level local identification over the post-reunification period, which suggests that the observed fiscal effects are indeed linked to the theoretical mechanism of individuals’ social identification. Finally, we highlight an important mediating role for the democratic process, since the observed fiscal effects strengthen considerably following Bavarian municipalities’ first local elections after the reunification migration wave (March 1996) and a legal change allowing local referenda on public policies (October 1995).
H10|Voter turnout and the size of government|This paper uses Swedish and Finnish municipal data to investigate the effect of changes in voter turnout on the tax rate, public spending and vote-shares. A reform in Sweden in 1970, which overall lowered the cost of voting, is applied as an instrument for voter turnout in local elections. The reform increased voter turnout in Sweden. The higher voter turnout resulted in higher municipal taxes and greater per capita local public spending. There are also indications that higher turnout decreased the vote share for right-wing parties. I use an individual survey data set to conclude that it was in particular low income earners that began to vote to a greater extent after the reform.
H10|The welfare state and migration: A dynamic analysis of political coalitions|We develop a dynamic political–economic theory of welfare state and immigration policies, featuring three distinct voting groups: skilled workers, unskilled workers, and old retirees. The essence of inter- and intra-generational redistribution of a typical welfare system is captured with a proportional tax on labor income to finance a transfer in a balanced-budget manner. We provide an analytical characterization of political–economic equilibrium policy rules consisting of the tax rate, the skill composition of migrants, and the total number of migrants. When none of these groups enjoy a majority (50 percent of the voters or more), political coalitions will form. With overlapping generations and policy-determined influx of immigrants, the formation of the political coalitions changes over time. These future changes are taken into account when policies are shaped.
H10|A needs theory of governance|New-institutional economics hypothesizes imperfect rationality, self-seeking preferences, monetary-related needs, and opportunism as fundamental features of human behavior. Consistently, new-institutionalist models of governance highlight the efficiency and transaction costs minimizing features of control rights and governance. Differently, needs theory of governance, as here presented, hypothesizes imperfect rationality, multiple needs, and reciprocity, in which case opportunism is reduced to an exception to individual behavior. Consistently, it presents a theory that links production governance with the wellbeing of those partaking in production. Building on Maslow’s human psychology, the governance model suggested in this paper is aimed at evidencing the self-actualization potential of control rights, organizational structures and practices. The application of Maslow’s theory to the institutional structure of organizations suggests that the deepest organizational layers (control rights and governance) broadly correspond to the most basic needs in Maslow’s theory (survival, security and belonging), while the outer layers (managerial models and employment relations) correspond to the fulfillment of the highest needs (self-esteem and self-actualization). Cooperative firms are used as an illustration of governance solutions consistent with needs theory in human psychology.
H10|Outsourcing vs decentralisation: A comparative analysis in Central and Eastern Europe|Outsourcing and decentralisation are two of the major practices associated with New Public Management. While applied differently, similar objectives are pursued in both cases, including reducing the size of the public sector in order to generate public savings, creating a competitive behaviour at the local level with a customer orientation approach, increasing the efficiency of the public sector or reducing red tape. On top of all, both practices imply that a one-size does not fit all. There are continuous debates in some parts of Central and Eastern Europe on whether outsourcing and/or decentralisation could be considered viable solutions for ensuring a smooth transfer of responsibility for delivering certain public services, from the central level of administration to sub-national institutions or non-governmental entities without, however, challenging the ultimate authority of the central government. These discussions are particularly sensitive in those unitary states that are facing strong demands from the sub-national level for more devolved power, authority or responsibilities. Scholars have frequently analysed outsourcing and decentralisation either separately or together with other practices associated with New Public Management. Consequently, there is a limited amount of comparative research in relation with the two. The research focus in this paper is twofold. In the first part of the research we thoroughly analyse the concepts of outsourcing and decentralisation. Building on this, in the second part of the paper we compare the two practices against each other focusing on their economic and financial impact, their qualitative impact and their political impact. The research aims to complement previous studies which have assessed these two practices either individually or against different criteria. After an in-depth assessment of both practices, we propose to answer three questions related to the possible effects of outsourcing and decentralisation on the public budget, on the quality of the public service and on the political dimension. The results of the research suggest that outsourcing can generate a reduction of public spending and a quality increase in the public sector only when the state follows transparent and competitive public procurement procedures. Decentralisation on the other hand can generate public savings in the long term without, however, guaranteeing an increase of quality in the public sector delivery. Finally, results suggest that especially in the unitary states neither decentralisation nor outsourcing can significantly lower the demands for more autonomy transferred from the central level. Consequently, if planned thoroughly and implemented transparently, both processes could be viable solutions in Central and Eastern Europe.
H10|La governance multilivello delle strategie macro-regionali dell’ue: note critiche|In relazione agli obiettivi di Europe 2020, l’Unione Europea ha deciso di innovare il proprio approccio alla governance multilivello della European territorial co-operation. A questo proposito nel 2009 è nata la EU Strategy for Baltic Sea Region (Eusbsr) e nel 2011 la EU Strategy for Danube Region (Eusdr); recentemente il Consiglio Europeo ha deliberato la creazione di due ulteriori strategie macro-regionali (l’Adriatico-Ionica e l’Alpina) che interessano alcune delle regioni italiane. Si tratta di un approccio interessante e innovativo, che tuttavia conferma empiricamente i limiti della governance multilivello europea, in merito alla prevalenza delle dinamiche top-down su quelle bottom-up.
H10|The visible hand: the role of government in China’s long-awaited industrial revolution| China is undergoing its long-awaited industrial revolution. There is no shortage of commentary and opinion on this dramatic period, but few have attempted to provide a coherent, in-depth, political-economic framework that explains the fundamental mechanisms behind China’s rapid industrialization. This article reviews the Embryonic Economic Development theory put forth by Wen (2016a). This article reviews the Embryonic Economic Development theory put forth by Wen . It illuminates the critical sequence of developmental stages since the reforms enacted by Deng Xiaoping in 1978: namely, small-scale commercialized agricultural production, proto-industrialization in the countryside, a formal industrial revolution based on mass production of labor-intensive light consumer goods, a sustainable ‘industrial trinity’ boom in energy/motive power/infrastructure, and a second industrial revolution involving the mass production of heavy industrial goods. This developmental sequence follows essentially the same pattern as Great Britain’s Industrial Revolution, despite sharp differences in political and institutional conditions. One of the key conclusions exemplified by China’s economic rise is that the extent of industrialization is limited by the extent of the market. One of the key strategies behind the creation and nurturing of a continually growing market in China is based on this premise: The free market is a public good that is very costly for nations to create and support. Market creation requires a powerful ‘mercantilist’ state and the correct sequence of developmental stages; China has been successfully accomplishing its industrialization through these stages, backed by measured, targeted reforms and direct participation from its central and local governments.

H10|Dal controllo ex ante al controllo ex post: la rivoluzione della modernizzazione degli aiuti di Stato|Shifting control from ex ante to ex post: the revolution of state aid modernization. In 2012 European Commission started a comprehensive reform of state aid control. The core of the reform is Regulation n. 651/2014, which extends the exemption from notification obligation to a wide number of aid measures. This is not only a quantitative change but a qualitative one as well. Member states are called to verify the respect of the conditions for the exemption should comply with information obligations and in some cases must evaluate the effect of the aid measures adopted. This substantial shift from the traditional ex ante to ex post control should render easier for Member States to grant aids, which are assumed compatible with the internal market. Nevertheless, some fear the danger that an effective control will be weakened.
H10|Challenges to the Development of an Islamic Economic System|The disappointment with the failure of the capitalist and socialist economic systems in solving the development problems of many countries has led several scholars to inves-tigate the Islamic Economic System (IES) as an alternative. Nienhaus (2010) describes the IES as a system that has the potential to capture the dynamism of capitalism and the equality of socialism. This paper contributes to the literature by identifying the pillars of an IES in conformity with the basic features that identify other economic systems. The paper aims at emphasizing the challenges that may arise in association with every pillar of this system to propel an Islamic economy forward in the modern world. The paper explores the challenges associated with ownership, economic decision making, incentives, and the role of the government in an Islamic framework. Accordingly, this study highlights that attaining a balanced demeanor, continuous assessment and inno-vation of financial instruments, employing spiritual incentives, institutional reform, and fighting Islamophobia are key challenges to the implementation of an IES.
H10|Burying the Bumblebee Once and for All:|High levels of social trust has been linked to both public sector size and long term economic growth, thereby helping to explain how some countries are able to combine high taxes and relatively high levels of economic growth. This paper examines if social trust as a background factor also insulates countries against negative effects of public sector size on growth, as government size and growth are found to be negatively associated in several recent studies. We note that the effect is theoretically ambiguous. In panel data from 66 countries across 40 years, we find little robust evidence of insulating effects. Instead we find robust evidence that high trust aggravates the crowding out effects of public sector size on private investments.
H10|Real and Imagined Threats to the Welfare State|"The traditionally, and wrongly, imagined vulnerabilities of the welfare state are economic. The true threats are demographic and political. The most frequently imagined threat is that the welfare state package reduces the level and growth of GDP. It does not, according to broad historical patterns and non-experimental panel econometrics. Large-budget welfare states achieve a host of social improvements without any clear loss of GDP. The paper elaborates on how this ""free lunch"" is gained in practice. Other threats to the welfare state are more real, however. Two demographic-political clouds loom on the horizon in the twenty-first century, though neither cloud reveals an economic flaw specific to the welfare state. One cloud is the rise of anti-immigrant backlash. If combined with heavy refugee inflows, this could destroy future public support for universalist welfare state programs, even though they seem to remain economically sound. The other, and more certainly rain-bearing, cloud is that population aging poses a serious problem for financing old age, either publicly or privately. Pension deficits threatens to crowd out more productive social spending. Only a few countries have faced this issue very well."
H10|Bridging or Bonding? Preferences for Redistribution and Social Capital in Russia|Does bridging or bonding social capital matter for redistribution preferences? Existing literature demonstrates causal link between measures of social capital and such preferences but does it mostly for developed countries with good enforcement of formal rules and without a distinction between two completely different types of social capital. We argue that welfare state relies on contributions from an immense number of anonymous citizens, thus attitudes towards strangers, i.e. generalized trust and solidarity should be salient. Using two surveys of about 34,000 and 37,000 Russians we prove this proposition showing the importance of the bridging type but not the bonding one. Instrumenting social capital with education, climate and distance from Moscow we deal with endogeneity concerns. Additionally we claim that connection between social capital and redistribution preferences for less developed countries such as Russia could be similar to developed countries

H10|Estimación de la intensidad de la competencia entre centros educativos en la Comunidad de Madrid y de sus efectos sobre el rendimiento escolar|La literatura acerca de la eficiencia del sistema educativo generalmente trata de identificar las variables que explican los resultados de los alumnos en las diferentes pruebas. Un factor asociado a la libertad de elección de los padres, y que no suele ser considerado a la hora de medir la citada eficiencia, es el de la competencia entre centros educativos, variable ésta vinculada a la ubicación del centro y que dependerá de la variedad de competidores y de la concentración del mercado. A su vez, los estudios que la han incluido suelen considerar un único mercado de la educación, sin dividir el mismo en base a la titularidad de los centros. La presente comunicación muestra una revisión de la literatura sobre las distintas técnicas empleadas, así como una caracterización del fenómeno de la competencia entre centros educativos que imparten educación secundaria en la Comunidad de Madrid, empleando para ello los datos de las pruebas de Conocimientos y Destrezas Indispensables (CDI) de 2011. Se ha calculado un Índice de Herfindahl para cada municipio de la Comunidad de Madrid, así como para cada distrito y sus aledaños, de la Ciudad de Madrid, considerando tres tipos de mercados: el de centros públicos-concertados, el de centros concertados-privados y el de los concertados-públicos-privados. Tras esta caracterización se ha calculado la función de producción de la educación considerando otros factores que inciden en el rendimiento académico del alumno (socioeconómicos, del centro, efecto compañero). Esta primera aproximación muestra como en los distintos tipos de mercados una mayor concentración de centros contribuye a una mejora en los resultados obtenidos en las pruebas.
H10|Growth and Institutions in African Development by Augustin K. Fosu|Augustin K. Fosu, a leading and respected expert in the field of African development has edited an interesting bulk of studies in a book entitled: Growth and Institutions in African Development. The book is a timely contribution to knowledge that offers very interesting insights into views and agenda within rigorous theoretical and empirical frameworks on policy issues surrounding the relevance of growth and institutions in African development. The book’s coverage comprises of 15 chapters presented into two main subject areas, namely: growth and institutions. Each of the two subjects is further divided into two parts. On the one hand, the growth area covers: (i) growth determinants (industrial embeddedness, innovation, exchange-rate regimes and environmental quality); and (ii) sectors, dynamics and distribution of growth. On the other hand, the institutions area entails: (i) institutional development; and (ii) institutions and development outcomes. An interesting common denominator among authors of various chapters in the two subject areas is that the empirical results are succinctly summarised to enhance accessibility and readability by interested readers who might have required technical reading skills to understand the rigorous empirical analyses and resulting policy insights. Hence, it is an easy-to-read and richly policy-relevant book for both specialists and non-specialists. Moreover, the underlying ease of readership is facilitated with an introductory chapter by Augustin K. Fosu which lays out the general framework with hard but interesting stylized facts, before summarising the key motivations and contributions of various chapters with very accessible and non-technical language. This is a critical review of the book.
H10|The Need For Evolving Practice Of Governance In Public Enterprises|The globalization of markets, technological change and deregulation of monopolies generated the need for readjustment and restructuring of the state sector and to develop efficient governance in public enterprises. The efficiency of an economic system depends, first of all of good management, and proper implementation for good functioning of society’s governing mechanics.
H10|Finding your right (or left) partner to merge|We study political determinants of municipality amalgamations during a boundary reform in the German state of Brandenburg, which reduced the number of municipalities from 1,489 to 421. The analysis is conducted using data on the political decision makers as well as fiscal and socio-economic variables for the municipalities. We ask whether party representation in the town council influences the merger decision. To identify the effect, we follow a dual approach and make use of different stages in the reform process. First, municipalities were initially free to choose partners. In a later phase of the reform the state legislature forced municipalities to amalgamate. We can, thus, compare voluntary to forced units. Second, we simulate potential mergers from the map of municipalities and compare voluntary mergers to those simulated units. Both approaches show that political representation matters significantly during the voluntary stage of the merger reform.
H10|Intrinsic Motivations of Public Sector Employees: Evidence for Germany|" type=""main"" xml:id=""geer12056-abs-0001""> We examine differences in altruism and laziness between public sector employees and private sector employees. Our theoretical model predicts that the likelihood of public sector employment increases with a worker's altruism, and increases or decreases with a worker's laziness depending on his altruism. Using questionnaire data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, we find that public sector employees are significantly more altruistic and lazy than observationally equivalent private sector employees. A series of robustness checks show that these patterns are stronger among higher educated workers; that the sorting of altruistic people to the public sector takes place only within the caring industries; and that the difference in altruism is already present at the start of people's career, while the difference in laziness is only present for employees with sufficiently long work experience."
H10|Social Identity And Redistributive Preferences: A Survey| Social identity has become accepted as a key concept underpinning the endogeneity of economic behaviour and preferences. It is important in explaining attitudes towards redistribution and pro-social behaviour. We examine how economic theory measures social identity and its effects on preferences towards redistribution, social solidarity and redistributive institutions. Empirical evidence indicates that social identity carries weight in explaining the presence of social preferences and attitudes towards redistributive institutions.
H10|Welfare Magnet Hypothesis, Fiscal Burden, and Immigration Skill Selectivity| In this paper, we investigate the effect of welfare state generosity on the difference between skilled and unskilled migration rates, and the role of mobility restriction in shaping this effect. We utilize the free labor movement within the European Union plus Norway and Switzerland (EUR) and the restricted movement from outside the EUR in order to compare the free-migration regime to the restricted-migration regime. We find strong support for the magnet hypothesis under the free-migration regime, and the fiscal burden hypothesis under the restricted-migration regime, even after controlling for differences in educational quality and returns to skills in source and host countries.
H10|Social Expenditures at Sub-National Level: An Experience from Indian state of Odisha|The composition and trends of social expenditures at sub-national level in India has been examined using the secondary data from 1987-88 to 2013-14 of the state of Odisha. The composition shows (1) the insignificant share of productive social expenditures, (2) significant share of education relegating the role of health care and (3) higher priority of transfer payments relative to the level of employment and health. The comparative analysis of the composition between pre and post-restructuring period indicates the shifting of priority from education and health towards transfer payments in the later than the former period. The level of social expenditures has been declined over the time period leading to excessive contraction of educational expenditures. The decline in the level of social expenditures is attributed to the use of implicit loopholes of the efficiency criteria used for the devolution of federal transfers. For the economic development of the state increased level of social expenditures, higher priority of education and health and reform in the efficiency criteria used for the devolution of transfers are of crucial need of the hour.
H10|"When does inter-jurisdictional competition engender a ""race to the bottom""?: a meta-regression analysis"|A growing literature documents the existence of strategic political reactions to public expenditure in one jurisdiction on either neighboring or reference jurisdictions. The latter might give raise to downward expenditure spiral, or “race to the bottom”. However, in ascertaining the empirical triggers of such a process evidence is suggestive of markedly heterogeneous findings. Most of such heterogeneity can be traced back to study design and institutional differences. This paper contributes to the literature by applying meta-regression analysis to quantify the size and the direction of strategic inter-jurisdictional expenditure interactions controlling for study and institutional characteristics. We find several robust results beyond confirming that jurisdictions do engage in strategic expenditure interactions; namely that (i) interactions are weakening over time; (ii) strategic interactions are stronger among municipalities than among intermediate levels of government; and (iii) strategic interactions appear to emerge from tax competition rather than yardstick competition, with capital controls and fiscal decentralization shaping the magnitude of fiscal interactions. Hence, we conclude political decentralization structures that draw upon the political agency (yardstick competition) are not necessarily engendering a ‘race to the bottom’.
H10|Government Size, Trade Openness, and Output Volatility: A Case of fully Integrated Economies|Abstract Government is often considered the safe sector of an open economy that provides households with insurance against external risk exposure. Among highly integrated economies, however, households should be able to exploit common financial markets to insure themselves. In this paper we examine the relationship between government size, trade openness, and output volatility across fully integrated economies using Japan’s regional income accounting and public finance data. The contributions of the government- and market-based insurances to inter-regional risk sharing are also estimated. The empirical results reveal some unique aspects of the state-market interactions under full economic integration with vertical fiscal imbalance.
H10|Regulation in Swiss Cantons: Data for one Century|We present and illustrate novel data on more than a century of regulation in Switzerland. We provide quantitative measures for Swiss cantons on the annual stock of legally binding rules from 2006-2013 and on regulatory activity as reflected in the annual changes to such regulation from 1908-2013. We measure the stock of regulation by the number of enactments and characters, and the regulatory activity by the number of changed enactments and pages. We break down the measures by the level in the hierarchy of legal norms and by the issuing authority. The data reveal substantial cantonal heterogeneity in the stock of regulation and the extent and development of regulatory activity. Regulatory activity generally increased over the century, though in a non-monotonic and volatile manner. Quantitatively, regulation at the level of decrees and regulation by the executive dominate. We also construct our measures for the federal level from 2006-2013 (stock) and 1848-2013 (activity).
H10|Cereals, Appropriability and Hierarchy|We propose that the development of social hierarchy following the Neolithic Revolution was an outcome of the ability of the emergent elite to appropriate cereal crops from farmers and not a result of land productivity, as argued by conventional theory. We argue that cereals are easier to appropriate than roots and tubers, and that regional differences in the suitability of land for different crops explain therefore differences in the formation of hierarchy and states. A simple model illustrates our main theoretical argument. Our empirical investigation shows that land suitability for cereals relative to suitability for tubers explains the formation of hierarchical institutions and states, whereas land productivity does not.
H10|Income Inequality In Macedonia: Mechanisms And Solutions|The rising income inequalities are one of the most important structural reasons of the global economic crisis. We focus on the income inequality in the country with highest Gini coefficient in Europe â€“ Republic of Macedonia. We argue that there are two main drivers of income inequality in the country: installed neo-liberalism and political patronage system. Neo-liberalism is used as a tool to remove the legislative protection of the workers, to maintain the wages on the miserable low level and to block the redistribution of income from the elites towards the others in the society. The completely opposite system of political patronage and populism is used as a tool of governance. It is based on state related benefits targeted to different groups of citizens and designed to be distributed in small portions and in turns in order to gradually increase the serfdom of the majority of the population from the elites. As a result, the country currently has the highest income inequality in Europe, accompanied by increase of poverty. The article concludes with suggestion of five directions for policy reforms.
H10|Eficiencia de las Finanzas Públicas de los Estados Costeros del Pacífico Mexicano|La administración pública configura el presupuesto del Estado, y sus componentes principales que son el gasto público y los impuestos, permiten asegurar y mantener la estabilidad económica, amortiguando las oscilaciones de los ciclos económicos y contribuyendo a mantener una economía creciente. El objetivo de la presente investigación es determinar el grado de eficiencia financiera de la administración pública de las entidades federativas que conforman la región occidente de México. Entre los principales resultados se observan que las entidades federativas analizadas continúan manteniendo una gran dependencia de los recursos federales, siendo los estados más eficientes: Baja California Sur, Colima y Baja California. ****** Public administration sets the State’s budget, and its main components such as public spending and taxes, which help ensure and maintain financial stability while softening the variations of economic cycles and helping maintain a growing economy (Samuelson, 1984). The purpose of this research is to determine the degree of financial efficiency in the public administration of the federal states in the West Region of Mexico. The results indicate that the analyzed federal states continue to maintain a high dependence on federal resources, showing as the most efficient the states of Baja California Sur, Colima and Baja California
H10|Theocracy and resilience against economic sanctions|This paper provides a simply theory to explain the impact of sanctions on a regime's policies and behavior. Sanctions are generally put to strip the target country from its available rents and weaken the government's stance against growing discontent in the population. We show however that sanctions may give legitimacy to an incumbent government by influencing the optimal level of religious ideology provided by the state and further stabilizing its grip to power and rents. While in a good state of nature sanctions build resilience as long as religious ideology among the population is strong, at bad times they compel the target country to move towards ideological moderation. In a world of asymmetric information, the target country always finds it optimal to send a signal that truly represents the prevailing state of nature in order to induce learning and reach a win–win outcome.
H10|Large and Lasting Regional Disparities in Municipal Investments|The regional dispersion of local public investment in Germany is very uneven. Even a comparison between the states shows considerable differences in gross investment. Municipalities in Bavaria currently invest more than three times as much per capita as those in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. There are even greater differences between districts and independent cities, both nationwide and within the federal states. In 2013, the district of Munich invested 724 euros per inhabitant, in other words, almost 700 euros more than the independent city of Wilhelmshaven in Lower Saxony (35 euros per inhabitant). There are disparities within Bavaria, too, with the independent city of Weiden spending 560 euros less (160 euros per inhabitant) than the district of Munich. Our analysis demonstrates that there have been virtually no changes in the regional dispersion of investment spending over time. Around 83 percent of the weakest quartile of all municipalities in 2000 were still in the lower half of the distribution 14 years later. Overall, investment in economically strong municipalities is considerably higher than in the structurally weak regions. The level of investment has a positive correlation with high tax revenues and a negative one with high social security spending, a negative fiscal balance, and high levels of debt. Municipalities that are less competitive today will continue to struggle in the long term due to a lack of investment. This compounds differences in infrastructure and quality of location which are important general conditions for future economic performance.

Die kommunalen Investitionen sind in Deutschland regional sehr ungleich verteilt. Schon der Vergleich zwischen den Flächenländern zeigt deutliche Unterschiede bei den Bruttoinvestitionen. So gaben die Kommunen Bayerns im Jahr 2013 mehr als drei Mal so viel pro Einwohner für Investitionen aus als beispielsweise die Kommunen in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Ein Blick auf die Kreise und kreisfreien Städte zeigt noch deutlich größere Unterschiede, sowohl bundesweit als auch innerhalb der Bundesländer. 2013 gab der Landkreis München mit 724 Euro pro Einwohner fast 700 Euro mehr aus als die kreisfreie Stadt Wilhelmshaven in Niedersachsen (35 Euro pro Einwohner). Innerhalb Bayerns lag der Unterschied noch bei 560 Euro zwischen der kreisfreien Stadt Weiden in der Oberpfalz (160 Euro pro Einwohner) und dem Landkreis München. Unsere Analyse weist nach, dass sich diese regionalen Unterschiede bei den Investitionsausgaben über die Zeit kaum verändern. Von den Kommunen, die schon im Jahr 2000 zum schwächsten Viertel aller Kommunen gehört haben, finden sich 83 Prozent auch 14 Jahre später in der unteren Hälfte der Verteilung wieder. Insgesamt sind die Investitionen in den wirtschaftlich starken Kommunen deutlich höher als in strukturschwachen Regionen. Die Höhe der Investitionen korreliert positiv mit hohen Steuereinnahmen und negativ mit hohen Sozialausgaben, negativem Finanzierungssaldo und hoher Verschuldung. Kommunen, die schon heute weniger wettbewerbsfähig sind, werden durch fehlende Investitionen langfristig weiter abgehängt. Damit werden Unterschiede in der Infrastruktur und der Standortqualität zementiert, die wichtige Voraussetzungen für zukünftige Wirtschaftsleistungen darstellen.
H10|Finding Your Right (or Left) Partner to Merge|We study political determinants of municipality amalgamations during a boundary reform in the German state of Brandenburg, which reduced the number of municipalities from 1,489 to 421. The analysis is conducted using data on the political decision makers as well as fiscal and socio-economic variables for the municipalities. We ask whether party representation in the town council influences the merger decision. To identify the effect, we follow a dual approach and make use of different stages in the reform process. First, municipalities were initially free to choose partners. In a later phase of the reform the state legislature forced municipalities to amalgamate. We can, thus, compare voluntary to forced units. Second, we simulate potential mergers from the map of municipalities and compare voluntary mergers to those simulated units. Both approaches show that political representation matters significantly during the voluntary stage of the merger reform.
H10|Regression Discontinuity Designs Based on Population Thresholds: Pitfalls and Solutions|In many countries, important features of municipal government (such as the electoral system, mayors' salaries, and the number of councillors) depend on whether the municipality is above or below arbitrary population thresholds. Several papers have used a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to measure the effects of these threshold‐based policies on political and economic outcomes. Using evidence from France, Germany, and Italy, we highlight two common pitfalls that arise in exploiting population‐based policies (compound treatment and sorting), and we provide guidance for detecting and addressing these pitfalls. Even when these problems are present, population‐threshold RDD may be the best available research design for studying the effects of certain policies and political institutions.
H10|El empleo público en América Latina. Evidencia de las encuestas de hogares|This paper provides evidence about the public employment in Latin America during the period 1992-2012, exploiting a standardized database of household surveys from all the countries of the region. These surveys constitute a useful tool because of their national representativeness, their frequency, and their wide coverage about employment and wage issues, both in the public sector as in the private, formal and informal. The article documents and analyzes the changes in the employment and wage levels of Latin-American public employees vis-à-vis the rest of workers.// Este artículo aporta evidencia sobre el empleo público en América Latina durante el periodo 1992-2012, explotando una base de datos estandarizados de las encuestas de hogares de todos los países de la región.

El trabajo documenta y analiza los cambios en los niveles de empleo y salarios de los empleados públicos latinoamericanos vis-à-vis el resto de los trabajadores
H10|The journalists' obligation of protecting the victims of sexual assault|The most debated media story of 2015 in Romania was related to a case of sexual assualt. On the 19th of July 2015 seven teenagers were released from house arrest in the case where they were accused of collectively raping an 18-year-old high school student. The Romania media landscape was quickly overtaken by this story: we had in depth media reports about the alleged assailaints and their home town, scandal regarding a facebook group created by a parent of one of the former mentioned and even a TV appearance from the victim and her mother on live television. The present article will attempt an analysis of the responsabilities that journalists have in protecting victims of sexual assault, according to the European law, Romanian legislation and in the media code of ethics. The questions we are starting from are these: were the Romanian journalists really disgusted by the actions of the seven or was it just a race for larger readership and viewership? What did the journalists do wrong when reporting n this story? What could they and should they have done more in order to protect a victim of sexual assault? And why was this case so widely reported while other cases of rape are constantly ignored by the Romanian media and society?
H10|The Role of University in Seniors' Education: A Romanian Perspective|The continuous education of university professors gets new valences and supplementary elements of quality and innovation, if it is studied from the perspective of the university mission to initiate, organize, and launch seniors' education projects. In this study, using the method of comprehensive interviews, we analyzed the state of the art of the cooperation between universities and seniors education providers in Romania with the aim of identifying the best practices and suggesting new ways of approaching this field, unjustly ignored in education sciences literature. The conclusions highlight the fact that, although the educational infrastrucure may be available to seniors, consistent efforts must be done in the direction of stregthening the cooperation between seniors' education stakeholders, at both European and Romanian level.
H10|Football, Identity and Mass Populism in Spanish Society|The study is divided into two parts: PART A examines the relationship between Football and Mass Populism in Spain and considers the first Case Study, the national teamâ€™s victory over England in the Brazil World Cup, 1950 and it is forthcoming in the Proceedings of the Conference Creativity, Imaginary, Language held at the University of Craiova, Romania in May 2015. PART B examines the implications of Case Studies 2 and 3, Spainâ€™s victories in the European Nations Cup of 1964 and the World Cup of 2010.
H10|Conjugal violence|"Scientific knowledge of different aspects related to conjugal violence is highly important for people directly involved, such as researchers, practitioners and the entire society. In this respect, globally, specialised studies continue to advance, offer correct definitions, clear descriptions, convincing assessments to certain issues, encouraging thus long-term research, since some specialists have managed to overcome restrictive or ideological methods and explanations. Moreover, in practice, debates reach almost all social, political and legal dimensions regarding appropriate and efficient forms of preventing conjugal violence. Unfortunately, in Romania there are fewer research and prevention approaches of this social problem. In general, attention is directed to domestic violence and conjugal violence is dealt with only implicitly. Considering the given context, the aim of the paper is to outline, by analysing specialised literature, a new research direction and implicitly, social intervention. I specify that this article represents a stage in the ongoing postdoctoral research project, entitled ""Conjugal homicide. Aggressors and victims""."
H10|"Psychological effects and epistemological education through mathematics ""abstraction"" and ""construction"""|"This study is part of a broader research which will be found in future work, Psychology and epistemology of mathematical creation, complementary work of experimental research psychology mathematics, whose investigative approach, promoting the combination type cross section paradigms and quantitative methods and qualitative and comparative method and the analytic-synthetic, based on the following idea: to make learning as efficient, contents and methods must be appropriate to the individual particularities of the pupils, a measure of the balance between converging and diverging dosing tasks as a promising opening to the transition from education proficiency in math performance. At this juncture, mathematical existence as ontological approach against the background of a history of ""abstraction"" mathematical and theoretical observations on the abstraction, realization and other mathematical thought processes, explanatory approach fulfills the context in which s mathematics constituted an important factor in psychological and methodological perspective, in a context of maximizing the educational effectiveness that depends on the quality of the methods used in teaching, focused on knowledge of the general principles of psycho-didactics not only mathematical and mental organization individual student or knowledge of the factors that make possible psycho-educational learning process."
H10|Three Metaphors for Liminality of the Political Party Concept|The given study is circumscribed by anthropology and communication and its purpose is to research the perception and the social-anthropological concept of a political party. If we analyze the meta-analytical method and quality method, we will achieve three modes of reporting to the thought of what a political party means. The article is organized in three primary sections: the political party as a scene, the political party as a dispossession of a person, and the political party as a metamorphosis of freedom. This blend of transformation contains a multistructure in which anthropological reasoning guarantees the best possible measurements of liminality. The political party represents a social irradiation through the idea of liminality.
H10|Breaking News and News Alert, between Information and Spectacle for Rating|We live in a digital era, a period when information travels with fulminant speed and goes from one side of the world to the other in only a few minutes. The general interest information has a strong impact on the mankind and is transmitted rapidly especially through the internet and through news televisions, which take over the information directly from the area where the event occurs or by the intermediary of other media channels, such as news agencies or other TV stations. Therefore, it is extremely important for the journalists to grant a particular importance to the research of a piece of news before broadcasting it as news alert or breaking news and to analyze the impact that the information has on the audience. This because, at present, we reached the situation of creating 10-12 breaking news per day, fact that leads to a decline in journalistsâ€™ credibility and it can cast ridicule on the journalist concepts of breaking news or news alert.
H10|The relationship between national culture and organizational culture|The definition of organizational culture must start from humans, from their historical existence, the psychology of the people they belong to, because, as everybody knows, organizational culture is an integral part of national culture. The values, symbols, histories of a nation become starting points in shaping the cultures of organizations operating in that geographic area.
H10|Governmental decentralization and corruption revisited: Accounting for potential endogeneity|The causal effect of governmental decentralization on firm-level corruption is inconclusive due to the difficulty in obtaining a traditional instrumental variable. Circumventing the issue by using the Lewbel (2012) identification strategy, we find mild evidence of political decentralization being endogenous but no support for fiscal decentralization being endogenous.
