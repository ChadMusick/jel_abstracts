J11|Implications of Increasing College Attainment for Aging in General Equilibrium|We develop and calibrate an overlapping generations general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy with heterogeneous consumers who face idiosyncratic earnings and health risk to study the implications of exogenous trends in increasing college attainment, decreasing fertility, and increasing longevity between 2005 and 2100. While all three trends contribute to a higher old age dependency ratio, increasing college attainment has different macroeconomic implications because it increases labor productivity. Decreasing fertility and increasing longevity require the government to increase the average labor tax rate from 32.0 to 44.4 percent. Increasing college attainment lowers the required tax increase by 10.1 percentage points. The required tax increase is higher under general equilibrium than in a small open economy with a constant interest rate because the reduction in the interest rate lowers capital income tax revenues.
J11|Firm and Worker Dynamics in an Aging Labor Market|I develop an idea flows theory of firm and worker dynamics in order to assess the consequences of population aging. Older people are less likely to attempt entrepreneurship and switch employers because they have found better jobs. Consequently, aging reduces entry and worker mobility through a composition effect. In equilibrium, the lower entry rate implies fewer new, better job opportunities for workers, while the better matched labor market dissuades job creation and entry. Aging accounts for a large share of substantial declines in firm and worker dynamics since the 1980s, primarily due to equilibrium forces. Cross-state evidence supports these predictions.
J11|Demographic Origins of the Startup Deficit|We propose a simple explanation for the long-run decline in the startup rate. It was caused by a slowdown in labor supply growth since the late 1970s, largely pre-determined by demographics. This channel explains roughly two-thirds of the decline and why incumbent firm survival and average growth over the lifecycle have been little changed. We show these results in a standard model of firm dynamics and test the mechanism using shocks to labor supply growth across states. Finally, we show that a longer startup rate series imputed using historical establishment tabulations rises over the 1960-70s period of accelerating labor force growth.
J11|A Unified Approach to Measuring u|This paper bridges the gap between two popular approaches to estimating the natural rate of unemployment, u*. The first approach uses detailed labor market indicators such as labor market flows, cross-sectional data on unemployment and vacancies, or various measures of demographic changes. The second approach which comprises reduced form models and DSGE models relies on aggregate price and wage Phillips curve relationships. We combine the key features of these two approaches to estimate the natural rate of unemployment in the United States using both data on labor market flows and a forward-looking Phillips curve linking inflation to current and expected deviations of unemployment from its unobserved natural rate. We estimate that the natural rate of unemployment is around 4.0% toward the end of 2018 and that the unemployment gap is roughly closed. Identification of a secular downward trend in the unemployment rate, driven solely by the inflow rate, facilitates the estimation of u*. We identify the increase in labor force attachment of women, decline in job destruction and reallocation intensity, and dual aging of workers and firms as the main drivers of the secular downward trend in the inflow rate.
J11|Beautiful city: Leisure amenities and urban growth|Modern urban economic theory and policymakers are coming to see the provision of consumer‐leisure amenities as a way to attract population, especially the highly skilled and their employers. However, past studies have arguably only provided indirect evidence of the importance of leisure amenities for urban development. In this paper, we propose and validate the number of tourist trips and the number of crowdsourced picturesque locations as measures of consumer revealed preferences for local lifestyle amenities. Urban population growth in the 1990–2010 period was about 10% points (about one standard deviation) higher in a metro area that was perceived as twice more picturesque. This measure ties with low taxes as the most important predictor of urban population growth. “Beautiful cities” disproportionally attracted highly educated individuals and experienced faster housing price appreciation, especially in supply‐inelastic markets. In contrast to the generally declining trend of the American central city, neighborhoods that were close to central recreational districts have experienced economic growth, although at the cost of minority displacement.
J11|Demographic Aging, Industrial Policy, and Chinese Economic Growth|We examine the role of demographics and changing industrial policies in accounting for the rapid rise in household savings and in per capita output growth in China since the mid-1970s. The demographic changes come from reductions in the fertility rate and increases in life expectancy, while the industrial policies take many forms. These policies cause important structural changes; first benefiting private labor-intensive firms by incentivizing them to increase their share of employment, and later on benefiting capital-intensive firms resulting in an increasing share of capital devoted to heavy industries. We conduct our analysis in a general equilibrium economy that also features endogenous human capital investment. We calibrate the model to match key economic variables of the Chinese economy and show that demographic changes and industrial policies both contributed to increases in savings and output growth but with differing intensities and at different horizons. We further demonstrate the importance of endogenous human capital investment in accounting for the economic growth in China.
J11|Catching up! The sexual opinions and behaviour of Italian students (2000-2017)|Over the past decades and particularly recently, sexual attitudes and behaviour have been exposed to tremendous changes across developed societies. Only partial or outdated studies are available for Italy. This paper aims to provide fresh insights into the sexual and emotional behaviour and attitudes of young Italians. Our analysis compares the results of two nationally representative surveys of Italian university students conducted in 2000 (n = 4,998) and 2017 (n = 8,094). The results highlight a clear pattern of anticipation of the sexual debut. In addition, the sexual behaviour and attitudes of boys and girls seem to be converging in several respects (contraception, casual sex, betrayal), even if some differences between men and women remain large, especially on double standards. Convergence is mainly driven by a â€˜feminisationâ€™ of male sexual life within the couple and a â€˜masculinisationâ€™ of female sexual life outside the couple. Finally, acceptance of homosexual experiences is rising substantially.
J11|Medical and nursery care with endogenous health and longevity|For the population over 65, nursery care expenditures constitute on average the largest share in total health expenditures. In this paper, we distinguish between medical care, intended to improve one›s state of health, and personal care required for daily routine. Personal care can be either carried out autonomously or by a third party. In the course of aging, autonomous personal care is eventually substituted by nursery care. We set up a life-cycle model in which individuals are subject to physiological aging, calibrate it with data from gerontology, and analyze the interplay between medical and nursery care. We replicate health behavior and life expectancy of individuals and in particular the empirically observed patterns of medical and nursery care expenditure. We then analyze the impact of better health and rising life expectancy, triggered by rising income and medical progress, on the expected cost of nursery care in the future. We predict an elasticity of nursery care expenditure with respect to life expectancy of 1/3. In terms of present value at age 20, life-time nursery care expenditure is predicted to decline with rising life expectancy.
J11|When I was your age...Population Dynamics and Household Energy Consumption|Generational values inspire behaviour in numerous areas such as politics, labour markets, social cohesion, consumption and energy use. Stephenson et al. (2015) highlight the role of so-called energy culture in shaping the behaviour of different population cohorts regarding energy consumption and environmental protection, and empirical studies have confirmed the relevance of cohort effects in residential and transport-related energy use (Bardazzi and Pazienza, 2017; Chancel, 2014). This paper aims to assess how ageing and evolving generational energy cultures in Italy affect the future path of energy consumption, considering the expected changes in the Italian population size, composition and location. We use a pseudo-panel of Italian households to estimate cohort and age effects by macro-area and then we combine these effects with official demographic projections to forecast the potential consequences for energy consumption up to 2050. Our findings show that age and generation are key determinants of household behaviour regarding residential energy consumption and these effects interplay with future population dynamics, which are also area-specific due to internal migration.
J11|The households’ income, poverty and income inequality in Russia in 2018|In 2018 real accrued wages and salaries of corporate employees increased in Q1 by 10.2%, by 7.6% in Q2, by 6.3 in Q3 and by 4.1% in Q4 against the same period of the previous year (Fig. 1). At the same time, real disposable cash incomes of households grew in Q1 and Q2, 2018, by 2.3 è 1.3% respectively against the same period of 2017 while in Q3 and Q4 they decreased by 1.6 and 1.1% against the same period of 20172. Real allotted pensions increased in Q1-2, 2018, by 2.3–0.4% against the same period of 2017 and decreased by 0.5% in Q4.
J11|Cities of Workers, Children or Seniors? Age Structure and Economic Growth in a Global Cross-Section of Cities|A large literature documents the positive influence of a cityâ€™s skill structure on its rate of economic growth. By contrast, the effect of a cityâ€™s age structure on its economic growth has been a hitherto largely neglected area of research. We hypothesize that cities with more working-age adults are likely to grow faster than cities with more children or seniors and set-out the potential channels through which such differential growth may occur. Using data from a variety of historical and contemporary sources, we show that there exists marked variation in the age structure of the worldâ€™s largest cities, both across cities and over time. We then study how age structure affects economic growth for a global cross-section of mega-cities. Using various identification strategies, we find that mega-cities with higher dependency ratios - i.e. with more children and/or seniors per working-age adult - grow significantly slower. Such effects are particularly pronounced for cities with high shares of children. This result appears to be mainly driven by the direct negative effects of a higher dependency ratio on the size of the working-age population and the indirect effects on work hours and productivity for working age adults within a city.
J11|Unemployment fluctuations over the life cycle|In this paper, we show that (i) the volatility of worker flows increases with age in US CPS data, and (ii)a search and matching model with life-cycle features, endogenous separation and search effort, is well suited to explain this fact. With a shorter horizon on the labor market, older workers’ outside options become less responsive to new employment opportunities, thereby making their wages less sensitive to the business cycle. Their job finding and separation rates are then more volatile along the business cycle. The horizon effect cannot explain the significant differences between prime-age and young workers as both age groups are far away from retirement. A lower bargaining power on the youth labor market brings the model closer to the data.
J11|Estimating the transition time from school to university using a stochastic mortality model|The sufficient provision of university places is of high sociopolitical importance as it facilitates the participation in higher education as well as the accumulation of human capital both being important factors for wealth and economic growth. The aim of this paper is to use the concept of mortality rates for forecasting the transition from school graduates into university in order to enrich and enhance the planning of the needed university places for first-year students. The transition rates differentiated in 16 Federal States and two types of university entrance qualifications were interpreted as mortality rates, fitted with the classical Lee-Carter approach and forecasted with automatically selected ARIMA processes. The results suggest that the constancy assumption used for the original planning provides indeed the best approach for many Federal States. Nevertheless, the application of the well-established Lee-Carter mortality model offers the opportunity to estimate an alternative number of first-year students and to open up a range of possible solutions.
J11|Reconstruction of regional and national population using intermittent census-type data: the case of Portugal, 1527-1864|We offer a new methodology for the construction of annual population stocks over the very long run. Our method does not require the assumption of a closed economy, and can be used in situations in which local annual gross flows are obtainable. Combining gross flows with intermittent census-type data, it is possible to arrive at local, regional and national population stock estimates at annual frequencies. We provide an application to early modern and nineteenth century Portugal, using a large sample of parish-level statistics up to the first modern census of 1864. All six major regions of the country are considered. ghlight the effect of the second nature geography changes as well as protectionism on well-being. We use a novel database of Danish and Swedish real wages to investigate the impact of these changes on Scanian living standards by employing a difference in difference approach to show that wages fell more in Scania than those in surrounding regions in relation to the border change and associated protectionism.
J11|The Great Divergence in South Africa: Population and Wealth Dynamics Over Two Centuries|Does wealth persist over time, despite the disruptions of historical shocks like colonisation? This paper shows that South Africa experienced a reversal of fortunes after the arrival of European settlers in the eastern half of the country. Yet this was not, as some have argued was the case elsewhere in colonial Africa, because of an institutional reversal. We argue, instead, that black South Africans found themselves at the mercy of two extractive regimes: those in `white South Africa and those in the `homelands. The political and economic institutions of each of those regimes favoured a small elite: in white South Africa, whites, and in the homelands, the black chiefs and headmen. Democracy brought inclusive institutions for black residents in white South Africa but not for those in the former home- lands. This is why we see mass migration to the urban areas of South Africa today, and why addressing the institutional weaknesses of the former homelands is key to alleviating the poverty in these regions where a third of South Africans still reside.
J11|Parental job loss and child human capital in the short and long run|We study the effects of parental job loss on children’s health, educational achievement and labor market success as young adults. Past evidence shows mixed results which could be due to small sample sizes and that workers who suffer job loss are a selected group. Using Swedish register data, including more than 140,000 children whose parents were displaced due to workplace closures, and conditioning on a wide set of pretreatment outcomes of both parents and children, we find no effects of parental job loss on childhood health, school performance or outcomes as young adults although parents are negatively affected.
J11|「人口減少局面における経済的な安心・安全の確保」について|我が国経済では、人手不足が顕著になっており、法人の休廃業・解散も増加している。その背景には人口高齢化と人口減少が存在する。低い出生率を踏まえると、この傾向は続く。今後は、東京でも生産年齢人口が減少に転じ、一気に高齢化が進むことになる。人口高齢化や人口減少は経済を悪くするという見方もあるが、人口高齢化そのものが悪影響を及ぼすのか、それとも、年齢に依存する社会的な制度や慣行が悪影響を及ぼすのかの識別は難しい。また、人口高齢化や人口減少に伴い、イノベーションの加速や実装（ロボット化等）が促されているという指摘もある。何れにしても、人口変動は、年齢構成に依存した仕組み（年金、医療、介護などの社会保険）を通じて経済活動に影響する。高齢化という年齢構成の変化の場合、給付と負担のバランスが崩れ、若年層の負担率が上昇する。また、人口減少や人口密度の低下は、規模の経済性の喪失要因となり、公共サービス等の一人当たり費用が高まる。こうした動きに対し、地域（自治体）レベルにおいては、１）保有資産の稼働率を高めるように削減、集約化・複合化を急ぐ、２）コストを抑える方法でサービスを提供する（民間施設利用、ネット利用促進・標準化・紙の廃止等々）、といったことが課題となる。また、住民レベルでも、３）集住・生活サービス拠点の集約を通じて暮らしの質を維持しつつ、生活費用の上昇を抑えることが肝要となる。一国レベルでは、４）社会的なコンセンサスである高齢者の定義は実態に合わせて見直し、年齢中立的な仕組に変えていくことや、５）イノベーションの社会実装を促進するように、規制や制度を見直していく、ことが重要となっている。
J11|Nonlinear Effects of Population Aging on Economic Growth?|Using panel data for 142 countries for the period from 1960 to 2014, we assess the effects of population aging on economic growth. We find that population aging proxied by old-age population share (or old-age dependency ratio) negatively affects economic growth only when it reaches a certain high level and its negative effects grow stronger as population aging deepens. We also find that population aging has hampered economic growth during more recent years, especially in more aged countries which are mostly developed countries. This nonlinear effect of aging is mainly driven by the fact that we use old-age population share as a proxy for aging. If we use lower working-age population share as a proxy for aging, the nonlinear relationship disappears: working-age population share is positively related to economic growth in a linear way.
J11|Determinants of Regional Fertility in Russia : A Dynamic Panel Data Analysis|The aim of this paper is to empirically examine the regional determinants of fertility rate in Russia using panel data for the period of 2005–2015. The estimation results of a system GMM dynamic model revealed that economic growth, employment opportunity, favorable local business conditions, educational opportunity, quality of social infrastructure, and housing supply serve to increase the fertility rate in Russian regions, while the presence of a Slavic population, migration inflow, poverty and ecological risks tend to suppress it. Furthermore, we found that combinations of factors that strongly affect the reproductive behavior of Russian women vary greatly among age groups and regions. To mitigate the declining trend of fertility in Russia, it is necessary to implement policies that take generational differences and regional heterogeneity into serious consideration.
J11|Changing Business Cycles: The Role of Women's Employment|This paper studies the impact of changing trends in female labor supply on productivity,TFP growth and aggregate business cycles. We find that the growth in womenâ€™s labor supplyand relative productivity added substantially to TFP growth from the early 1980s, even if itdepressed average labor productivity growth, contributing to the 1970s productivity slowdown.We also show that the lower cyclicality of female hours and their growing share can account fora large fraction of the reduced cyclicality of aggregate hours during the great moderation, as wellas the decline in the correlation between average labor productivity and hours. Finally, we showthat the discontinued growth in female labor supply starting in the 1990s played a substantialrole in the jobless recoveries following the 1990-1991, 2001 and 2007-2009 recessions. Moreover,it depressed aggregate hours, output growth and male wages during the late 1990s and mid2000s expansions. These results suggest that continued growth in female employment since theearly 1990s would have significantly improved economic performance in the United States.
J11|Demographic Aging, Industrial Policy, and Chinese Economic Growth|We examine the role of demographics and changing industrial policies in ac- counting for the rapid rise in household savings and in per capita output growth in China since the mid-1970s. The demographic changes come from reductions in the fertility rate and increases in the life expectancy, while the industrial policies take many forms. These policies cause important structural changes; first benefiting private labor-intensive firms by incentivizing them to increase their share of employment, and later on benefiting capital-intensive firms resulting in an increasing share of capital devoted to heavy industries. We conduct our analysis in a general equilibrium economy that also features endogenous human capital investment. We calibrate the model to match key economic variables of the Chinese economy and show that demographic changes and industrial policies both contributed to in- creases in savings and output growth but with differing intensities and at different horizons. We further demonstrate the importance of endogenous human capital investment in accounting for the economic growth in China.
J11|The rural exodus and the rise of Europe|To assess the importance of the rural exodus in fostering the transition from stagnation to growth, we propose a unified model of growth and internal migrations. Using an original set of Swedish data, we identify the deep parameters of our model. We show that internal migration conditions had to be favorable enough to authorize an exodus out of the countryside in order to fuel the industrial development of cities and the demographic transition of the country. We then compare the respective contribution of shocks on internal migration costs, infant mortality and inequalities in agricultural productivity to the economic take-off and the demographic transition that occurred in Sweden. Negative shocks on labor mobility generate larger delays in the take-off to growth compared to mortality shocks equivalent to the Black Death. Deepening inequalities of productivity in the agricultural sector, like it has been done by enclosure movements, contributes to accelerate urbanization at the cost of depressed economic growth.
J11|Childlessness and Economic Development: A Survey|This paper provides an introduction to the analysis of childlessness, first by describing the stylized facts and the relevant literature, and then by proposing a theoretical framework. We show that both poverty-driven childlessness and opportunity-driven childlessness matter and are essential to a thorough understanding of childlessness as a socioeconomic phenomenon.
J11|Education and Childlessness in India|In a developing setting like India, women have started their long way to emancipation both at the family and societal levels. In this context, we study what may be perceived as a key sign of emancipation regarding marriage and motherhood: childlessness. Using micro-level regressions, we show that the probability of a woman ending her reproductive life without children exhibits a U-shaped relationship with her educational attainment. This is indicative of the fact that poverty and sterility are not the sole determinants of childlessness, but that better economic opportunities and empowerment within couples also matter. This result is robust to the introduction of important control variables such as the development level of the state where women live, the husband’s education, age at marriage, religion, and caste. India seems to be joining a list of countries where adjustments to childlessness are much more than simple responses to boom-andbust poverty.
J11|The Economic Benefits of Latino Immigration: How the Migrant Hispanic Population’s Demographic Characteristics Contribute to US Growth|The Hispanic community in the United States has contributed significantly to US economic growth in recent decades and will continue to do so over the next 10 to 20 years, adding more to US growth than some past immigrant communities at similar stages of integration and time following their arrival on American shores. This contribution derives partially from demographic vitality: the fact that Hispanics are the youngest and largest minority group in America and are on a path toward becoming an increasingly large share of the US labor force. Higher fertility rates, net immigration, and growing labor force participation rates will reinforce this trend. This paper presents evidence showing that Hispanic educational attainments are now rapidly converging to the US average. The Hispanic community now exhibits significantly higher levels of opportunity-driven entrepreneurship than does the rest of the US population. These factors position the Hispanic community to increase its contribution to the US economy in coming decades, with significant positive effects on the overall economic growth rate. The data underlying this analysis are available at https://piie.com/system/files/documents/wp19-3.zip.
J11|Demographic Changes in a Small Open Economy with Endogenous Time Allocation and Age-Dependent Mortality|We calibrate an endogenous overlapping generations model of a small open economy to study the effects of population aging and population decline. In an invariant scenario public and foreign debt explode and GDP growth decreases markedly. Among the tested policies to control public nances, the best for the individuals is an increase in the retirement age, which needs to increase 6 years, a similar magnitude as the increase in life expectancy at birth. However, this increase has to happen before the increase in life expectancy materi- alizes itself. Aging has a stronger negative impact on public debt than population decline. We find a positive, but quantitatively modest, behavioral effect in reaction to a higher life expectancy with an impact on the GDP growth rate of only 2 basis points.
J11|Mortality in Midlife for Subgroups in Germany|Case and Deaton (2015) document that, since 1998, midlife mortality rates are increasing for white non-Hispanics in the US. This trend is driven by deaths from drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related diseases, termed as deaths of despair, and by the subgroup of low-educated individuals. In contrast, average mortality for middle-aged men and women continued to decrease in several other high-income countries including Germany. However, average mortality rates can disguise important differences between subgroups and the phenomenon of increasing mortality rates might also be present for subpopulations in these countries. Hence, we analyze how mortality in midlife is changing for several important demographic subgroups in Germany over the 1990 to 2015 period with a focus on deaths of despair. Our results show a very clear pattern: We find that mortality rates declined between 1990 and 2015, with no increases in deaths of despair for any of the subgroups. Thus, our findings starkly contrast with those for the US
J11|Make Yourselves Scarce: The Effect of Demographic Change on the Relative Wages and Employment Rates of Experienced Workers|We argue that rising supply of experience not only reduces experienced workers' relative wages but also their relative labor market participation. From a theoretical model we derive predictions which we quasi-experimentally investigate, using variation across U.S. local labor markets (LLMs) over the last decades and instrumenting experience supply by the LLMs' age structures a decade earlier. We find that aging substantially reduces experienced workers' relative wages and employment rates, and also their labor market participation rates. Our results imply thatthe effect of demographic change on labor markets might be more severe than previously recognized, as it reaches beyond wages.
J11|Who is in favor of immigration|Population ageing affects most countries, especially developed ones. The elderly have increased in number as a result of increased longevity and a parallel decline in fertility. This phenomenon is placing an increasing burden on the young to finance intergenerational transfers to the old, which is creating a threat to the stability of the pension system and the long-run viability of society as a whole. One possible solution is to permit more immigration, which will both increase the labor force and broaden the tax base. Increasing immigration has a variety of effects on the local population, which vary according to age and wealth. One of these is the threat to local social norms and culture since immigrants tend to maintain the culture of their country of origin. This effect increases with the number of immigrants and reduces the attractiveness of immigration as a solution to population ageing. This paper examines immigration as a solution to the problem of ageing population, while considering the implication of immigration on social norms.
J11|Samuelson's Contributions to Population Theory and Overlapping Generations in Economics|Paul Samuelson made a series of important contributions to population theory for humans and other species, evolutionary theory, and the theory of age structured life cycles in economic equilibrium and growth. The work is highly abstract but much of it was intended to illuminate issues of compelling policy importance, such as declining fertility and population aging. While his work in population economics has been very influential, his work in population and evolution appears to have been largely overlooked, perhaps because he seldom published in demographic journals or went to population meetings. Here I discuss his many contributions in all these areas, but give particular attention to demographic aspects of his famous work on overlapping generation models, social security systems, and population growth.
J11|Institutional Responses to Aging Populations and Economic Growth: A Panel Data Approach|Will an aging population lower economic growth? Economists are generally concerned that the increase in life expectancy could lower economic growth, however, theory does not make a prediction. As life expectancy increases, so should household savings, which results in more physical capital per worker. This will stimulate economic growth. However, as the retired population share increases, this may reduce spending on children as more resources are transferred to the elderly. This will likely reduce human capital accumulation and lower growth. The net effect of these competing influences is an empirical question. This paper constructs a stylized endogenous growth model that includes both human capital and government transfers to the elderly. The model is mapped into a linear statistical framework that allows us to estimate each of these potential responses using panel data for a set of OECD countries during the period 1975-2014. We find evidence that households do in fact increase savings in response to a longer retirement period and this effect is associated with a higher realized rate of growth per worker. However, we also find evidence that an aging population reduces spending on children (or other productive investments) placing a drag on growth. These results suggest it is the institutional response to population aging that will determine whether or not an aging population will place a drag on future growth, not population aging itself.
J11|Fertility, Inequality and Income Growth|This paper sets an endogenous fertility model with a two-sector model: one for the final goods sector and the other for child care service sector. Results of theoretical analysis indicate that the subsidy for children raises the labor share of the child care service sector and that it can increase fertility. An aging population reduces fertility and the labor share of the child care service sector. In addition to these results, we consider monetary policy effects on fertility. Results show that monetary policy can raise fertility and the labor share of the child care service sector by virtue of an increase in the pension benefit if a pay-as-you-go pension exists.
J11|Pandemics, places, and populations: evidence from the Black Death|The Black Death killed 40% of Europe’s population between 1347-1352, making it one of the largest shocks in the history of mankind. Despite its historical importance, little is known about its spatial effects and the effects of pandemics more generally. Using a novel dataset that provides information on spatial variation in Plague mortality at the city level, as well as various identification strategies, we explore the short-run and long-run impacts of the Black Death on city growth. On average, cities recovered their pre-Plague populations within two centuries. In addition, aggregate convergence masked heterogeneity in urban recovery. We show that both of these facts are consistent with a Malthusian model in which population returns to high-mortality locations endowed with more rural and urban fixed factors of production. Land suitability and natural and historical trade networks played a vital role in urban recovery. Our study highlights the role played by pandemics in determining both the sizes and placements of populations.
J11|Changing Business Cycles: The Role of Women's Employment|This paper studies the impact of changing trends in female labor supply on productivity, TFP growth and aggregate business cycles. We find that the growth in women’s labor supply and relative productivity added substantially to TFP growth from the early 1980s, even if it depressed average labor productivity growth, contributing to the 1970s productivity slowdown. We also show that the lower cyclicality of female hours and their growing share can account for a large fraction of the reduced cyclicality of aggregate hours during the great moderation, as well as the decline in the correlation between average labor productivity and hours. Finally, we show that the discontinued growth in female labor supply starting in the 1990s played a substantial role in the jobless recoveries following the 1990-1991, 2001 and 2007-2009 recessions. Moreover, it depressed aggregate hours, output growth and male wages during the late 1990s and mid 2000s expansions. These results suggest that continued growth in female employment since the early 1990s would have significantly improved economic performance in the United States.
J11|From Immigrants to Americans: Race and Assimilation during the Great Migration|How does the appearance of a new out-group affect the economic, social and cultural integration of previous outsiders? We study this question in the context of the first Great Migration (1915-1930), when 1.5 million African Americans moved from the US South to urban centers in the North, where 30 million Europeans had arrived since 1850. We test the hypothesis that black inflows led to the establishment of a binary black-white racial classification, and facilitated the incorporation of - previously racially ambiguous - European immigrants into the white majority. We exploit variation induced by the interaction between 1900 settlements of southern-born blacks in northern cities and state-level outmigration from the US South after 1910. Black arrivals increased both the effort exerted by immigrants to assimilate and their eventual Americanization. These average effects mask substantial heterogeneity: while initially less integrated groups (i.e. Southern and Eastern Europeans) exerted more assimilation effort, assimilation success was larger for those that were culturally closer to native whites (i.e. Western and Northern Europeans). These patterns are consistent with a framework in which changing perceptions of out-group distance among native whites lower the barriers to the assimilation of white immigrants.
J11|Childlessness and Economic Development: a Survey|This paper provides an introduction to the analysis of childlessness, first by describing the stylized facts and the relevant literature, and then by proposing a theoretical framework. We show that both poverty-driven childlessness and opportunity-driven childlessness matter and are essential to a thorough understanding of childlessness as a socioeconomic phenomenon.
J11|Population and the environment: the role of fertility, education and life expectancy|This paper explores the interplay between population and environmental quality. After reviewing the existing literature, we set up a theoretical framework suitable to analyze two major endogenous forces of demographic change - fertility and life expectancy - and their dynamic interaction with human capital and environmental conditions. We thus revisit and encompass in a unified model some key results of the literature, and gain new insight on the consequences of policy intervention on environmental dynamics and economic development. In particular, we highlight (i) the possible perverse effects of pollution control, (ii) a demographic explanation of the environmental Kuznets curve, (iii) the opportunity of relying on educational subsidies to alleviate the pressure on natural resources, and (iv) the existence of poverty traps related to human capital and environmental quality.
J11|Mortality in Midlife for Subgroups in Germany|Case and Deaton (2015) document that, since 1998, midlife mortality rates are increasing for white non-Hispanics in the US. This trend is driven by deaths from drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related diseases, termed as deaths of despair, and by the subgroup of low-educated individuals. In contrast, average mortality for middle-aged men and women continued to decrease in several other high-income countries including Germany. However, average mortality rates can disguise important differences between subgroups and the phenomenon of increasing mortality rates might also be present for subpopulations in these countries. Hence, we analyze how mortality in midlife is changing for several important demographic subgroups in Germany over the 1990 to 2015 period with a focus on deaths of despair. Our results show a very clear pattern: We find that mortality rates declined between 1990 and 2015, with no increases in deaths of despair for any of the subgroups. Thus, our findings starkly contrast with those for the US.
J11|Economic structures 20 years into the euro|Well-functioning economic structures are key for resilient and prospering euro area economies. The global financial and sovereign debt crises exposed the limited resilience of the euro area’s economic structures. Economic growth was masking underlying weaknesses in several euro area countries. With the inception of the crises, significant efforts have been undertaken by Member States individually and collectively to strengthen resilience of economic structures and the smooth functioning of the euro area. National fiscal policies were consolidated to keep the increase in government debt contained and structural reform momentum increased notably in the second decade, particularly in those countries most hit by the crisis. The strengthened national economic structures were supported by a reformed EU crisis and economic governance framework. However, overall economic structures in euro area countries are still not fully commensurate with the requirements of a monetary union. Moreover, remaining challenges, such as population ageing, low productivity and the implications of digitalisation, will need to be addressed to increase economic resilience and long-term growth.

J11|Demographics and the natural real interest rate: historical and projected paths for the euro area|This paper employs an aggregate representation of an overlapping generation (OLG) model quantifying a decrease of the natural real interest rate in the range of -1.7 and -0.4 percentage points in the euro area between 1990 and 2030 due to demographics alone. Two channels contribute to this downward impact: the increasing scarcity of effective labor input and the increasing willingness to save by individuals due to longer life expectancy. The decrease of the aggregate saving rate as individuals retire has an upward impact which is never strong enough. Mitigating factors are: higher substitutability between labor and capital, higher intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption, reforms aiming at increasing the relative productivity of older cohorts, the participation rate and the retirement age. The simulated path of the natural real interest rate is consistent with recent econometric estimates: an upward trend in the 70s and 80s and a prolonged decline afterward.

J11|Females, the Elderly, and Also Males: Demographic Aging and Macroeconomy in Japan|The speed and magnitude of the ongoing demographic aging in Japan are unprecedented. A rapid decline in the labor force and a rising fiscal burden to finance social security expenditures could hamper growth over a prolonged period. We build a dynamic general equilibrium model populated by overlapping generations of males and females who differ in employment type and labor productivity in addition to life expectancy. We study how changes in the labor market over the coming decades will affect the transition path of the economy and fiscal situation of Japan. We find that a rise in the labor supply of females and the elderly of both genders in extensive margin and in productivity can significantly mitigate the effects of demographic aging on the macroeconomy and reduce fiscal pressures, despite a decline in wages during the transition. We also quantify effects of alternative demographic scenarios and fiscal policies. The study suggests that a combination of policies that remove obstacles hindering the labor supply and that create a more efficient allocation of male and female workers of all age groups will be critical to keeping government deficits under control and raising incomes across the nation.
J11|Retirement Plan Wealth Inequality: Measurement and Trends| Using Health and Retirement Study data linked to summary plan descriptions and W-2s, this study reports trends in retirement wealth inequality of older employees 1992-2010. The study identifies and corrects methodological flaws in past research. Retirement wealth is highly unequally distributed; the top lifetime earnings quintile holds half of all retirement wealth, the bottom quintile, only 1 percent. The top earnings quintile fared better in 2010 than in 1992, whereas bottom-quintile earners fared worse. But retirement wealth inequality mainly reflects inequality within earnings quintiles, resulting from inadequate savings, not outsize accumulations. Systemic flaws reduce median retirement wealth by 84 percent.

J11|Pension Reforms and Adverse Demographics: Options for the Czech Republic|This paper estimates changes in pensions and long-term financial sustainability of the Czech pension system in the light of population ageing, market imperfections or a potential economic downturn, and assesses feasibility of various parametric and structural reforms. To do so, it develops a bespoke OLG model with heterogeneous agents, bequests, productivity shocks, market imperfections, and realistic representation of three distinct types of pension systems calibrated using real-world data. Numerical results are obtained through computer simulations. The estimates show that a well-designed multi-pillar pension scheme provides good results in a number of performance indicators without leading to excessive costs of transition, whereas maintaining the current PAY-GO scheme would lead to a gradual decrease in real pensions, lower pension-to-wage ratios, higher budget deficits, or any combination thereof, unless the statutory retirement age increases beyond 67 years by 2050.
J11|Improving the Accuracy of Economic Measurement with Multiple Data Sources: The Case of Payroll Employment Data|"This paper combines information from two sources of U.S. private payroll employment to increase the accuracy of real-time measurement of the labor market. The sources are the Current Employment Statistics (CES) from BLS and microdata from the payroll processing firm ADP. We briefly describe the ADP-derived data series, compare it to the BLS data, and describe an exercise that benchmarks the data series to an employment census. The CES and the ADP employment data are each derived from roughly equal-sized samples. We argue that combining CES and ADP data series reduces the measurement error inherent in both data sources. In particular, we infer ""true"" unobserved payroll employment growth using a state-space model and find that the optimal predictor of the unobserved state puts approximately equal weight on the CES and ADP-derived series. Moreover, the estimated state contains information about future readings of payroll employment."
J11|More Gray, More Volatile? Aging and (Optimal) Monetary Policy|The empirical and theoretical evidence on the inflation impact of population aging is mixed, and there is no evidence regarding the volatility of inflation. Based on advanced economies’ data and a DSGE-OLG model - a multi-period general equilibrium framework with overlapping generations, - we find that aging leads to downward pressure on inflation and higher inflation volatility. Our paper is also the first to discuss, using this framework, how aging affects the short-term cyclical behavior of the economy and the transmission channels of monetary policy. Further, we are also the first to examine the interplay between aging and optimal central bank policies. As aging redistributes wealth among generations, generations behave differently, and the labor force becomes more scarce with aging, our model suggests that aging makes monetary policy less effective, and aggregate demand less elastic to changes in the interest rate. Moreover, in more gray societies central banks should react more strongly to nominal variables, and in a very old society the nominal GDP targeting rule might become the most effective monetary policy rule to compensate for higher inflation volatility.
J11|Body Mass Index and Social Interactions from Adolescence to Adulthood|We apply a dynamic linear-in-means model to analyze the importance of social ties for the body-weight-related behavior of US youth. Our methodology shows how to estimate peer effects free of the “reflection problem” in a dynamic context where individual- and group-specific unobservable effects are controlled for. Our results show that the main drivers for the body-weight-related behavior are past and peer effects. For individuals who were normal-weight or obese during adolescence, past and peer effects are shown to be both relevant. Peer effects, instead, explain more the variation in the BMI for individuals who were over-weight during adolescence, showing in this way the importance of social interactions for body-weight-related behavior.
J11|L’apologo dei due cinema Mercato del lavoro e migrazioni|L’apologo del Cinema Italia (che raccontai per la prima volta circa 35 anni or sono e ho poi regolarmente utilizzato per spiegare ai miei studenti le dinamiche del mercato del lavoro) viene qui rivisitato per spiegare le cause dei flussi migratori internazionali, mostrare che il fenomeno è ineludibile, capire perché i flussi stiano progressivamente aumentando e continueranno a farlo nel corso del secolo. Dopo averci fatto capire che i flussi migratori sono spiegati dalla carenza strutturale di offerta di lavoro che caratterizza i paesi ricchi, in presenza di una offerta illimitata nei paesi più poveri, l’apologo mostra qual è l’unica soluzione soluzione razionale che contribuisce a risolvere gli opposti, ma ugualmente gravi, problemi dei paesi ricchi e dei paesi poveri: flussi migratori commisurati al fabbisogno quantitativo e qualitativo dei paesi economicamente sviluppati, ma organizzati congiuntamente dai paesi di destinazione e di partenza, dopo aver fornito ai futuri migranti le competenze richieste dal mercato del lavoro di arrivo.
J11|How Many Life-Years Have New Drugs Saved? A 3-Way Fixed-Effects Analysis of 66 Diseases in 27 Countries, 2000-2013|We analyze the role that the launch of new drugs has played in reducing the number of years of life lost (YLL) before 3 different ages (85, 70, and 55) due to 66 diseases in 27 countries. We estimate 2-way fixed-effects models of the rate of decline of the disease- and country-specific age-standardized YLL rate. The models control for the average decline in the YLL rate in each country and from each disease. One additional drug launch 0-11 years before year t is estimated to have reduced the pre-age-85 YLL rate (YLL85) in year t by 3.0%, and one additional drug launch 12 or more years before year t is estimated to have reduced YLL85 by 5.5%. (A drug’s utilization peaks 8-10 years after it was launched.) Controlling for the number of drugs previously launched, YLL rates are unrelated to the number of drug classes previously launched. The estimates imply that, if no new drugs had been launched after 1981, YLL85 in 2013 would have been 2.16 times as high as it actually was. We estimate that pharmaceutical expenditure per life-year saved before age 85 in 2013 by post-1981 drugs was $2837. This amount is about 8% of per capita GDP, indicating that post-1981 drugs launched were very cost–effective, overall. But the fact that an intervention is cost-effective does not necessarily mean that it is “affordable.”
J11|Fertility Trends in the United States, 1980-2017: The Role of Unintended Births|After roughly 10 years of decline, the U.S. fertility rate reached a historic low in 2017. However, aggregate trends in fertility mask substantial heterogeneity across different demographic groups. Young women and unmarried women have seen the largest declines in fertility in recent years while women older than 30 and married women have actually experienced increases. In this paper, we explore the role of changes in unintended births in explaining fertility patterns in the U.S. from 1980 to 2017, with an emphasis on the fertility decline of the last decade. We begin by documenting heterogeneity in fertility trends across demographic groups, using data from the National Center for Health Statistics’ Natality Detail Files. We then use data from the National Survey of Family Growth to describe trends in unintended births and to estimate a model that will identify the maternal characteristics that most strongly predict them. Finally, we use this model to predict the proportion of births in the Natality Detail Files that are unintended. We find that 35% of the decline in fertility between 2007 and 2016 can be explained by declines in births that were likely unintended, and that this is driven by drops in births to young women.
J11|Demographic origins of the startup deficit|We propose a simple explanation for the long-run decline in the startup rate. It was caused by a slowdown in labor supply growth since the late 1970s, largely pre-determined by demographics. This channel explains roughly two-thirds of the decline and why incumbent firm survival and average growth over the lifecycle have been little changed. We show these results in a standard model of firm dynamics and test the mechanism using shocks to labor supply growth across states. Finally, we show a longer startup rate series, imputed using historical establishment tabulations, that rises over the 1960-70s period of accelerating labor force growth.
J11|A unified approach to measuring u|This paper bridges the gap between two popular approaches to estimating the natural rate of unemployment, u*. The first approach uses detailed labor market indicators, such as labor market flows, cross-sectional data on unemployment and vacancies, or various measures of demographic changes. The second approach, which employs reduced-form models and DSGE models, relies on aggregate price and wage Phillips curve relationships. We combine the key features of these two approaches to estimate the natural rate of unemployment in the United States using both data on labor market flows and a forward-looking Phillips curve that links inflation to current and expected deviations of unemployment from its unobserved natural rate. We estimate that the natural rate of unemployment was around 4.0 percent toward the end of 2018 and that the unemployment gap was roughly closed. Identification of a secular downward trend in the unemployment rate, driven solely by the inflow rate, facilitates the estimation of u*. We identify the increase in labor force attachment of women, decline in job destruction and reallocation intensity, and dual aging of workers and firms as the main drivers of the secular downward trend in the inflow rate.
J11|Redistributive Effects of Different Pension Systems When Longevity Varies by Socioeconomic Status|We propose a general analytical framework to model the redistributive features of alternative pension systems when individuals face ex ante differences in mortality. Differences in life expectancy between high and low socioeconomic groups are often large and have widened recently in many countries. Such longevity gaps affect the actuarial fairness and progressivity of public pension systems. However, behavioral responses to longevity and policy complicate analysis of possible reforms. Here we consider how various pension systems would perform in a general equilibrium OLG setting with heterogeneous longevity and ability. We evaluate redistributive effects of three Notional Defined Contribution plans and three Defined Benefit plans, calibrated on the US case. Compared to a benchmark non-redistributive plan that accounts for differences in mortality, US Social Security reduces regressivity from longevity differences, but would require group-specific life tables to achieve progressivity. Moreover, without separate life tables, despite apparent accounting gains, lower income groups would suffer welfare losses and higher income groups would enjoy welfare gains through indirect effects of pension systems on labor supply.
J11|Demographics and Monetary Policy Shocks|We study how consumption of households at different stages of the life cycle responds to monetary policy shocks. We find that older households have a higher consumption re- sponse than younger households. Amongst older households, the consumption response is also increasing in income. This, along with data on age-related net wealth, presents evidence for a wealth effect playing a role in driving the response patterns. This mecha- nism is studied further in a partial-equilibrium life-cycle model of consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions. The model qualitatively explains these empirical patterns. Understanding the heterogeneity in consumption responses across age groups is im- portant for understanding the transmission of monetary policy, especially as the U.S. population grows older.
J11|Implications of Increasing College Attainment for Aging in General Equilibrium|We develop and calibrate an overlapping generations general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy with heterogeneous consumers who face idiosyncratic earnings and health risk to study the implications of exogenous trends in increasing college attainment, decreasing fertility, and increasing longevity between 2005 and 2100. While all three trends contribute to a higher old age dependency ratio, increasing college attainment has different macroeconomic implications because it increases labor productivity. Decreasing fertility and increasing longevity require the government to increase the average labor tax rate from 32.0 to 44.4 percent. Increasing college attainment lowers the required tax increase by 10.1 percentage points. The required tax increase is higher under general equilibrium than in a small open economy with a constant interest rate because the reduction in the interest rate lowers capital income tax revenues.
J11|Health and Economic Growth: Reconciling the Micro and Macro Evidence|Micro-based and macro-based approaches have been used to assess the effects of health on economic growth. Micro-based approaches aggregate the return on individual health from Mincerian wage regressions to derive the macroeconomic effects of population health. Macro-based approaches estimate a generalized aggregate production function that decomposes output into its components. The microbased approach tends to find smaller effects than the macro-based approach, thus presenting a micromacro puzzle regarding the economic return on health. We reconcile these two strands of literature by showing that the point estimate of the macroeconomic effect of health is quantitatively close to that found by aggregating the microeconomic effects, controlling for potential spillovers of population health at the aggregate level. Our results justify using the micro-based approach to estimate the direct economic benefits of health interventions.

J11|Demographic Effects on the Impact of Monetary Policy|We study whether the effects of monetary policy are dependent on the demographic structure of the population. We exploit cross-sectional variation in the response of US states to an identified monetary policy shock. We find that there are three distinct age groups. In response to an increase in interest rates, the responses of private employment and personal income are weaker the greater the share of population under 35 years of age, are stronger the greater the share between 40 and 65 years of age, and are relatively unaffected by the share older than 65 years. We find that all age groups become more responsive to monetary policy shocks when the proportion of middle aged increases. We provide evidence consistent with middle aged entrepreneurs starting and expanding businesses in response to an expansionary monetary shock.
J11|Objectives and challenges in the implementation of a universal pension system in France|The mission of the French High Commission for Pension Reform is to prepare the reform introducing a universal pension points system in France. This paper explains why implementing a universal points system in France would increase transparency, reduce inequality and generate efficiency gains for the whole economy. It documents the experience of OECD countries which have opted for a points or a notional defined contribution (NDC) schemes, and provides a technical framework to compare defined benefit, points and NDC pension systems. The paper discusses some key issues related to the main parameters of the new system. While it can include a wide range of redistribution schemes depending on political choices, indexation rules should be designed in a way that maximises, as much as possible, the rates of return on pension contributions within a pay-as-you-go system while ensuring financial sustainability and accounting for changes in life expectancy. This implies that the value of the point would vary at the individual level depending on the cohort and the effective age of retirement based on actuarial principles. No country having a points system currently uses age-cohort point values, and France could be the first one to introduce such an innovation.This Working Paper relates to the 2019 OECD Economic Survey of France (http://www.oecd.org/economy/surveys/france-economic-snapshot/)
J11|Fiscal challenges and inclusive growth in ageing societies|This paper was prepared in support of Japan’s G20 Presidency. It takes stock of ongoing and projected population ageing across G20 economies and its far-reaching implications for economic growth, productivity, inequality within and between generations and the sustainability of public finances. Rising old-age dependency ratios will put the financing of adequate pensions, health and long-term care under high pressure. The paper provides recommendations on policy responses to address ageing-related challenges and highlights good practices. A comprehensive approach is needed, tailored to each country’s institutional and policy settings and social preferences, and may span many areas of public policy: improving the design of public pensions, incentivising private savings, enhancing the efficiency of health care provision, expanding the coverage of social security systems, promoting employability and skills of older workers, and striving for a better labour market inclusion of women, youth and migrants.
J11|Health Spending Projections to 2030: New results based on a revised OECD methodology|To gain a better understanding of the financial sustainability of health systems, the OECD has produced a new set of health spending projections up to 2030 for all its member countries. Estimates are produced across a range of policy situations. Policy situations analysed include a “base” scenario – estimates of health spending growth in the absence of major policy changes – and a number of alternative scenarios that model the effect on health spending of policies that increase productivity or contribute to better lifestyles; or conversely, ineffective policies that contribute to additional cost pressures on health systems.
J11|Ageing and productivity growth in OECD regions: Combatting the economic impact of ageing through productivity growth?|OECD countries and their regions are ageing fast. In principle, the negative impact of ageing on the growth rate of per capita gross domestic product could be offset by increases in productivity. However, for many regions, productivity growth required to maintain per capita GDP levels constant has been higher than the actual growth rates they recorded in the past years. One reason for this is that ageing also has a direct negative impact on productivity growth, with the effect being concentrated in urban areas. One possible explanation is that cities specialise in sectors, such as tradable services, where the content of tasks makes it difficult to automate stages of the production process and where business dynamism, negatively affected by demographic change, is a more solid driver of productivity growth. Finally, ageing seems to be associated with a redistribution of revenues away from workers and towards capital and firm owners.
J11|The price of demography|A few studies lately explored the relationship between changes in the demographic structure and inflation using mainly cross-country analyses. In this paper we investigate how the evolution in the age structure of the population affected price dynamics in Italy, using annual data for a panel of provinces in the period 1982-2016. The within-country approach allows us to wipe out the effects of supranational shocks, as well as to better take into account the effects of monetary policy, main common driver of price dynamics over the medium-term. We use a set of indicators, namely young age, old age and overall dependency ratios, and the share of working age population. Our results suggest that the ongoing ageing process likely contributed to dampening price dynamics.
J11|Do old and new labour market risks overlap? Automation, offshorability, and non-standard employment|This article analyses whether automation and offshorability risks overlap with non-standard employment. The research uses data from Spain, as this is a country with one of the highest temporary employment rates across the world since the 1990s. In general, the analysis shows that automation risks affect slightly more to those with non-standard work arrangements. However, higher educational level is crucial to be much less exposed to automation risks, irrespective of the type of contract or the working time. The offshorability risk also has a small overlap with non-standard employment, but has the opposite relationship with the educational level. The results suggest that specific training policies attending to those with lower educational levels in non-standard employment would be advisable to protect some workers against automation risks, but not against offshorability.
J11|Alternative Boomerang Kids, Intergenerational Co-residence, and Maternal Labor Supply|This study investigates the boomerang phenomenon among adult children in Thailand. We estimate the effect of having children on co-residence between parents and adult children using Socio-Economic Survey panel data. We find that adult children who have moved out tend to move back in with their parents after having children to save time and money on childcare. The presence of young children increases the likelihood of intergenerational co-residence by over 30%. This study is the first to provide empirical evidence of boomerang kids in an Asian context, which is distinctive compared with Western countries. The relationship between intergenerational co-residence and the maternal labor supply is also examined using the instrumental variable approach based on the cross-sectional Labor Force Survey, which has data covering over 30 years. Our results show that co-residence increases the female labor supply by 21% and also extends women's working hours by 10 hours.
J11|"""Gold Miss"" or ""Earthy Mom""? Evidence from Thailand"|"This paper investigates the impact of Thai women's education on their marriage behavior and fertility. It first uses the panel data set from the Socio-Economic Survey to estimate the effect of education on the marriage market. The result from applying the individual fixed effect estimation indicates that obtaining a university degree decreases the probability of women's marriage, emphasizing the rise of the ""Gold Miss"" phenomenon in Thailand. The cross-sectional data set from the Labor Force Survey examines the effect of education on fertility. By applying both the instrumental variable using the compulsory education reform as an instrument and pseudo-panel approaches to take into account the endogeneity of schooling, the result shows that education causally reduces fertility, which provides a convincing sequential explanation for the dramatic decline in fertility in Thailand."
J11|Demographics and the Evolution of Global Imbalances|The age distribution evolves asymmetrically across countries, influencing relative saving rates and labor supply. Emerging economies experienced faster increases in working age shares than advanced economies did. Using a dynamic, multicountry model I quantify the effect of demographic changes on trade imbalances across 28 countries since 1970. Counterfactually holding demographics constant reduces net exports in emerging economies and boosts them in advanced economies. On average, a one percentage point increase in a country’s working age share, relative to the world, increases its ratio of net exports to GDP by one-third of a percentage point. These findings alleviate the allocation puzzle.
J11|Demographics and Monetary Policy Shocks|We decompose the response of aggregate consumption to monetary policy shocks into contributions by households at different stages of the life cycle. This decomposition finds that older households have a higher consumption response than younger households. Amongst older households, the consumption response is also increasing in income. This, along with data on age-related net wealth, presents evidence for a wealth effect playing a role in driving the response patterns. This mechanism is studied further in a partial-equilibrium life-cycle model of consumption, saving, and labor-supply decisions. The model qualitatively explains the empirical patterns. Understanding the heterogeneity in consumption responses across age groups is important for understanding the transmission of monetary policy, especially as the U.S. population grows older.
J11|Top 3: Pension Systems in Denmark, Finland, and the Netherlands|Abstract According to the 2018 Mercer Global Pension index, the pension systems of Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands are the best three in the world. This paper seeks to identify the common elements of success of these three pension systems, including the institutional framework within which they operate. We emphasize the collective and compulsory nature of the earnings-related pension schemes and the important role for social partners in all three pension systems. We also discuss what we believe are the most important challenges these systems face.
J11|An Investment-and-Marriage Model with Differential Fecundity|I build an equilibrium investment-and-marriage model with differential fecundity to explain stylized facts about education, income, and marriage for Americans born in the twentieth century that had not been explained in a unified way. The most novel finding is an explanation for why women attend college at a higher rate and earn a lower average income than men. Differential fecundity and an equilibrium marriage market form the basis of my explanation. The model also accounts for gender-specific relationships between age at marriage and income, and the evolving relationship between age at marriage and spousal income for women. I provide evidence to support my theory and calibrate the model to conduct counterfactual analyses.
J11|Demography and Productivity in the Italian Manufacturing Industry: Yesterday and Today|Population ageing and lack of productivity growth characterize most western countries. We focus on Italy and investigate whether the availability of a young population represents a determinant of manufacturing productivity growth. We follow a historical comparative analysis and provide evidence of the strength of this relation in the past (1861-1911) and today (1961-2011). To account for the sizeable regional heterogeneity characterizing historically the country we use data disaggregated at the provincial level. Our analysis suggests that the availability of a young population represents indeed one of the determinant of manufacturing productivity growth. The strength of the relation was higher in the past than today, but ageing is still nevertheless a factor that cannot be neglected from a policy perspective.
J11|Household Incomes in Canada and the United States: Who is Better Off?|It is commonly noted that Americans are on average richer than Canadians. For example, in 2016, GDP per capita was US $47,294 in Canada (PPP-adjusted) compared to US $57,798 in the United States. However, this comparison of average incomes does not necessarily imply that all or even most Canadians are worse off than Americans. This report shows that Canadian households in the bottom 56 per cent of the income distribution are in fact better off than American households at the same point of the income distribution. This finding is driven by the lower income inequality in Canada, and illustrates how the usual comparison of incomes between Canada and the United States using GDP per capita or average household income hides a critical part of the story.
J11|Linking neighbors’ fertility. Third births in Norwegian neighborhoods|The aim of this paper is to gain more insight on the drivers behind geographical variations in family sizes by pointing out the role of neighborhoods and neighbors for two-child couples’ transitions to third births. Couples’ decisions about fertility behavior are influenced by their social context where immediate neighborhoods and neighbors may play a significant role. Furthermore, as neighborhoods are important contexts of childrearing, couples may sort geographically based on their fertility preferences. Using detailed geo-data from Norwegian administrative registers to locate couples in flexible ego-centered neighborhoods, this paper introduces a new dimension of spatial fertility variations. Results from regression models show that the family size of neighbors is positively related to each other. That is, the likelihood that two-child couples have a third child increases with the share of families with three or more children in the neighborhood. This relationship remains significant also after controlling for a range of couple characteristics, housing, neighboring women’s educational level and time-constant characteristics of neighborhoods. It is also consistent for various neighborhood definitions which in this study range from the 12 to the 500 nearest neighbors. However, the strength of the association between neighbors’ fertility increases with the number of neighbors, providing evidence that residential sorting is a dominant driver.
J11|A tale of two tracks| We provide a simple framework that helps explore the need for contingent (teaching) jobs in academia alongside the usual tenured-professorship positions. It also explains the coexistence of these two types of jobs in research universities as an equilibrium phenomenon. Imprecisions in the academic editorial process, combined with the increasing difficulty of producing academic research, is suggested as a possible explanation for the recent increasing trend in the share of non-tenure-track teaching jobs in academia as well as the widening wage gap between tenured-professors and teaching faculty. Alternative interpretations are explored.
J11|Determinants of the Rise in Female Labor Force Participation: Identifying Cohort Effects|Female labor force participation rate in Turkey is quite low but is rapidly increasing. This study analyzes the determinants of this rise. The study focuses on the birth cohort effects on female labor force participation. Cohort effects can be considered as a proxy for the effects of changes in societal values or institutional setting on female labor force participation. The study finds cohort effect as the main determinant of recent rise in female labor participation. Improvements in educational attainment and decline in fertility are other important factors. On the other hand, there is no decrease in the negative effect of having children on female labor force participation.
J11|Demographic Developments and Their Macroeconomic Impacts|This study firstly introduces demographic concepts and reveals the different dynamics displayed by emerging and advanced economies. Then, the links between demographic developments and economic activity are discussed. We aim to support our arguments with quantitative findings obtained through a New-Keynesian general equilibrium model. The general equilibrium model, which is calibrated for Turkey, is simulated for the period until 2050 in accordance with changes in demographic exogenous variables. Through this simulation, the path that main macroeconomic variables follow is analyzed. The simulation exercise, conducted through the model which is de-trended with the increases in productivity and population, reveals that, compared to the initial steady state, production factor prices significantly change; real interest rate declines and real wage increases.
J11|Time Variation in Lifecycle Consumption and Housing Wealth|We document systematic and significant time variation in the profiles of lifecycle consumption expenditures in the US. Lifecycle consumption profiles have consistently become flatter through time. Pooling data across different periods to identify consumption profiles masks relevant time variation and may artificially generate the well known hump-shaped consumption age profile. We also identify the effect of perceived housing wealth on lifecycle consumption profiles. Housing influenced lifecycle consumption particularly from 2006 onwards and for older households. We propose mechanisms that may account for the estimated results employing an overlapping generations model with perceived housing wealth and time varying borrowing constraints
J11|Interactions between Formal and Informal Labor Dynamics: Revealing Job Flows from Household Surveys|In its characterizations of job creation and job destruction rates, the literature on labor dynamics has largely ignored informal labor markets. The interrelationships between job creation and destruction among informal and formal labor markets are therefore still generally unknown, despite recent developments in the study of labor market dynamics. These interrelationships are important, however, because much of what researchers identify as formal job creation in developing countries involves substitution of informal jobs for formal ones. In this paper, we use an original methodology to derive hires as well as job creation, separation, and destruction flows from standard household surveys. The great advantage of this technique is that it allows measurements of these labor dynamic measures for the informal labor market. We find that informal labor markets are less fluid than formal ones, mainly because informal job-to-job transitions seem to have a low incidence. In addition, we characterize the relationship between informal job destruction and formal job creation. We find that almost 50% of job creation in the formal sector is caused by job destruction in the informal sector, and identify this formalization process as countercyclical. Our findings portray the informal labor market as an inferior segment; in good economic times, it loses importance as a source of formal jobs and as a recipient of jobs from the formal sector. **** RESUMEN: En los estudios sobre creación y destrucción de trabajo, la literatura sobre dinámica laboral ha ignorado al segmento informal del mercado. En general no se sabe mucho sobre la interdependencia de la creación y destrucción de trabajo entre estos segmentos. Las relaciones entre estas variables son importantes, ya que mucho de lo que a menudo se identifica como creación de trabajo formal, en realidad implica una sustitución de trabajos informales por formales. En este artículo, se utiliza una metodología original para derivar los flujos de contrataciones, separaciones, creación y destrucción de trabajo a partir de encuestas de hogares. La ventaja de la metodología es que también permite medir estos flujos para el segmento informal. Este estudio encuentra que el mercado laboral informal es menos fluido que el formal, principalmente porque las reasignaciones de trabajadores y la rotación laboral tienen baja incidencia en el segmento informal. Adicionalmente, en este artículo se caracteriza la relación entre la destrucción de trabajo informal y la creación de trabajo formal. Se halla que al menos el 50% de la creación de trabajo formal es causada por destrucción de trabajo informal; adicionalmente, este proceso de formalización resulta ser contra-cíclico. Nuestros resultados permiten inferir que el mercado laboral informal es un segmento inferior, ya que en los periodos de expansión económica pierde relevancia en dos sentidos: en primer lugar, como fuente para la creación de trabajos formales y, en segundo lugar, como receptor de trabajos desde el segmento formal.
J11|Employment of People Ages 55 to 79|In 1995, 33 percent of people ages 55 to 79 worked. By 2018, that share rose to 44 percent. That growth was the result of continued increases in employment for women and a reversal of previously declining employment for men. The changes in employment of people ages 55 to 79â€”the period during which many people stop workingâ€”were related to changes in their demographic characteristics and the jobs they held, as well as to changes in Social Security.
J11|The Demographic Transition in a Unified Growth Modelof the English Economy|A dynamic stochastic unified growth model is estimated from English economy data for almost a millennium. At the core of the (seven) overlapping generations, rational expectations structure is household choice about target number and quality of children. The trends of births, deaths, population and, the real wage, are closely matched by the estimated model. In the 19th century English fertility transition, the model shows how the generalized child price relative to the child quality price rose. The rising opportunity cost of education was as decisive for the transition as the parental shift to child quality.
J11|Pandemics, Places, and Populations: Evidence from the Black Death|The Black Death killed 40% of Europe's population between 1347-1352, making it one of the largest shocks in history. Despite its importance, little is known about its spatial effects and the effects of pandemics more generally. Using a novel dataset that provides information on spatial variation in Plague mortality at the city level, as well as various identification strategies, we explore the short-run and long-run impacts of the Black Death on city growth. On average, cities recovered their pre-Plague populations within two centuries. In addition, aggregate convergence masked heterogeneity in urban recovery. We show that both of these facts are consistent with a Malthusian model in which population returns to high-mortality locations endowed with more rural and urban fixed factors of production. Land suitability and natural and historical trade networks played a vital role in urban recovery. Our study highlights the role played by pandemics in determining both the sizes and placements of populations.
J11|Body weight and United States economic development, 1840-1940|When traditional measures for material and economic welfare are scarce or unreliable, height and the body mass index (BMI) are now widely accepted measures that represent cumulative and current net nutrition in development studies. However, as the ratio of weight to height, BMI does not fully isolate the effects of current net nutrition. After controlling for height as a measure for current net nutrition, this study uses the weight of a sample of international men in US prisons. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, individuals with darker complexions had greater weights than individuals with fairer complexions. Mexican and Asian populations in the US had lower weights and reached shorter statures. Black and white weights stagnated throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Agricultural workers’ had greater weights than workers in other occupations.
J11|Demographic change and climate change|The paper uses a continuous-time overlapping-generations model with endogenous growth and pollution accumulation over time to study the link between longevity and global warming. It is seen that increasing longevity accelerates climate change in a business-as-usual scenario without climate policy. If a binding emission target is set exogenously and implemented via a cap-and-trade system, the price of emission permits is increasing in longevity. Longevity has no effect on the optimal solution of the climate problem if perfect intergenerational transfers are feasible. If these transfers are absent, the impact of longevity is ambiguous.
J11|Birth Rates, Factor Shares, and Growth|Increases in capital shares affect the marginal productivity of capital, stimulating capital accumulation. Can a decrease in labor shares reduce the supply of labor? We explore this question using a model of fertility inspired by Caldwell (1982) and Boldrin and Jones (2002). Individuals may transfer wealth to the future in two ways: by saving and by having children. Raising children has a cost in terms of current consumption but generates future income through intergenerational transfers. In this setting, a redistribution of income from labor to capital affects the return of savings and children in opposite ways and generates incentives for more savings and fewer children. Two pieces of evidence motivate our model. First, recent historical evidence shows that the increases in capital shares that preceded the Industrial Revolution coincided with falling birth rates. Second, for current developed economies, changes in labor shares correlate positively with changes in fertility rates, and negatively with changes in saving rates.
J11|Fifty Years a-Growing: Economic History and Demography in the ESR|This paper surveys publications in the fields of economic history and demography in the ESR since 1969. Numbering sixty in all, they cover a broad chronological and thematic range. Some of these papers never attracted much notice, but stand as useful sources for future historians. A few have become classics.
J11|Make Yourselves Scarce: The Effect of Demographic Change on the Relative Wages and Employment Rates of Experienced Workers|We argue that rising supply of experience not only reduces experienced workers' relative wages but also their relative labor market participation. From a theoretical model we derive predictions which we quasi-experimentally investigate, using variation across U.S. local labor markets (LLMs) over the last decades and instrumenting experience supply by the LLMs' age structures a decade earlier. We find that aging substantially reduces experienced workers' relative wages and employment rates, and also their labor market participation rates. Our results imply that the effect of demographic change on labor markets might be more severe than previously recognized, as it reaches beyond wages.
J11|EU Faces a Tough Demographic Reckoning|By 2030, labour demand could be equal to labour supply in most of the EU, creating significant challenges for policy-makers and firms. The ‘tipping point’ at which labour demand will become equal to labour supply in the EU – that is, when labour will become a constraint on economic growth – is now imminent. If current trends continue, most EU countries will hit this ‘tipping point’ during the next decade, many by 2025. Vacancy rates and surveys of employers find that firms in some sectors are already facing severe labour constraints on production. Most of CEE will be hit first, not least because they are still losing so many workers to Western Europe. For Western Europe, however, the situation will also become difficult soon, especially for Germany. This is an enormous challenge for policy-makers, and will become even more so in the future. Policy options to counter demographic trends can be split into four main areas higher productivity, immigration, activity rates, or fertility. However, none is a silver bullet. Even if all of these policies are pursued successfully and in combination, they are unlikely to fundamentally alter the picture. The implications of this demographic decline do not have to be all negative. Combined with intelligent upgrading of infrastructure and investment in productivity-enhancing improvements in industry, there is no reason that these population trends cannot go hand-in-hand with increases in per capita GDP and living standards. Much can be learned from Japan in this regard. The politics of the future in the EU is likely to be defined by generational questions, and potentially inter-generational conflict. Policy discussions are likely to centre ever more on immigration, how to fund old-age and child care, how to extend working lives, automation, and the problematic issue of financial incentives to increase fertility rates.
J11|Labour Market Trends in Visegrád Countries: Implications for Austria|Economic developments in the four Visegrád countries – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – will be viewed against the background of secular trends of population ageing and, in some cases, outright population decline. Under plausible assumptions, these trends will persist over the next few decades, as low birth rates and rising mortality rates – reinforced by outward net migration in the case of Poland – will result in the working-age populations shrinking further. So far, the economic effects of the reduced labour supply in the Visegrád countries have been largely positive it has been a major factor behind the dramatic decline in unemployment over the past few years. However, growing labour shortages – unless offset by increased automation – might become a constraint on the economic growth of the Visegrád countries in the near future. It was only after a considerable time lag that the decline in labour supply started to translate into an improvement in the bargaining power of workers and a corresponding sustained real wage growth. Until about 2013, these were largely offset by institutional factors, namely labour market liberalisation and fiscal austerity measures implemented in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, resulting in the stagnation of real wages over a protracted period of time. It was not until 2013 that real wage growth in the Visegrád countries finally gained momentum, crucially helped by a profound turnaround in economic policies under the newly formed ‘populist’ governments which revoked some of the liberal economic reforms initiated by their predecessors (especially in Hungary and Poland). The marked growth in real wages observed over the past few years has hardly eroded the competitiveness of the Visegrád countries’ economies which all possess a strong export sector and continue recording solid trade surpluses. At the same time, it has been the main factor behind the growth of private consumption – and ultimately GDP growth. The implications of these developments for Austria are likely to be two-fold. On the one hand, the above-average economic growth in the Visegrád countries is welcome news for Austria as it will offer more trade and investment opportunities for Austrian companies. The track record of increased economic cooperation with these countries so far has been, by and large, positive for Austria. On the other hand, the shrinking working-age population in the Visegrád countries and their ongoing catching-up, inter alia in terms of wages and social benefits, imply that labour migration flows from these countries to Austria, which has been sizeable up to now, will likely subside, aggravating the problem of labour and skills shortages in Austria. Measures offsetting the rising labour and skill shortages in Austria could include, for instance, training programs and apprenticeships, supported by fiscal measures such as tax benefits and targeted subsidies. In the longer term, mitigating labour force shortages in Austria would require policies such as improving training in technical and craft occupations as well as subsidising investments in labour-saving technologies which could offset the effects of a shrinking working-age population on economic growth.
J11|Bevölkerungs- und Wirtschaftsentwicklung in den mittel- und osteuropäischen Ländern|This publication is available in German language only. For a brief English summary see further below. Der Zustrom aus den mittel- und osteuropäischen Ländern (MOEL) spielte eine wichtige Rolle bei der Bevölkerungsentwicklung in Österreich und Wien zwischen 2000 und 2016. Dies hat auch zu einer signifikanten Veränderung der Beschäftigungsstruktur in Wien geführt, die teilweise zu einer Verdrängung inländischer und anderer ausländischer Arbeitnehmer führte. Die Studie gibt eine Einschätzung des aktuellen und zukünftigen Migrationspotenzials nach Österreich und Wien aus den MOEL und zwei Westbalkanländern, Bosnien und Herzegowina und Serbien. Die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung in den MOEL ist seit einigen Jahren sehr positiv, und auch die Prognosen deuten auf ein stetiges Wirtschaftswachstum mit deutlich höheren Wachstumsraten als im EU-Durchschnitt hin. Damit einhergehend hat sich die Arbeitsmarktsituation in diesen Ländern insgesamt verbessert. Dies und die allgemeine demographische Entwicklung in der Region führen zu einer Verlangsamung der Mobilitätsströme aus den MOEL. Dennoch ist die demographische Entwicklung in der Region und auf dem Westbalkan nach wie vor besorgniserregend, da die Bevölkerung (insbesondere jene im erwerbsfähigen Alter) schrumpft. Demographische Langzeitszenarien gehen davon aus, dass die Bevölkerung in der Region in den kommenden Jahrzehnten weiter stark zurückgehen wird. Diese Entwicklungen deuten auf eine Abflachung der Trends hin, wenn nicht sogar auf eine mittelfristige Schwächung der bestehenden Mobilitätsströme nach Österreich und Wien. Es gibt auch keine Hinweise darauf, dass sich die regionale Struktur der Migrationsströme in Hinblick auf die österreichischen Bundesländer stark verschieben wird. English Summary Population trends and economic development in Central and East European countries The influx from Central and East European countries (CEECs) played an important role in population trends in Austria and Vienna between 2000 and 2016. This has also led to a significant change in the employment structure in Vienna, partly resulting in the displacement of both domestic and other foreign workers. The study assesses the current and future migration potential to Austria and Vienna from the CEECs and two Western Balkan countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. Economic developments in the CEECs have been very positive for some years already and forecasts also point to steady economic growth with significantly higher growth rates than the EU average. In line with this, the labour market situation in these countries has generally improved. This and the general demographic developments in the region lead to a slowdown in mobility flows from CEECs. Nonetheless, demographic developments in the region and the Western Balkans remain worrying as population is shrinking and the working-age population even more so. Demographic long-term scenarios suggest that the population in the region will continue to shrink sharply in the coming decades. These developments point towards a flattening of trends, if not a weakening of existing mobility flows to Austria and Vienna in the medium term. Finally, there are no indications that the patterns of mobility flows to Austrian regions (i.e. with respect to individual provinces) will shift significantly.
J11|Die Lohnentwicklung in den Westbalkanländern, Moldau und der Ukraine|This publication is available in German language only. For a brief English summary see further below. Erst in den letzten Jahren kam es im Zuge der allgemeinen Erholung der Wirtschaft zu einem deutlichen Anstieg der Reallöhne in den Westbalkanländern, Moldau und der Ukraine. Trotzdem sind die Lohnquoten kaum gestiegen bzw. zum Teil sogar leicht gesunken. Nur im Kosovo ist es zu einer deutlichen Annäherung an das österreichische Lohnniveau gekommen. Die Verbesserung der Arbeitsmarktbedingungen hatte einen nur mäßig positiven Effekt auf die Lohnentwicklung. Die Arbeitslosenquoten bleiben – trotz jüngster Rückgänge – oft im zweistelligen Bereich, so dass sich die Verhandlungsmacht der Arbeitnehmer nur geringfügig verbessert hat. Auch die schrittweise Dezentralisierung der Lohnsetzungsmechanismen hat das Lohnwachstum gebremst. Generell sind kollektivvertragliche Mechanismen in den Ländern der Region wesentlich schwächer entwickelt als etwa in Österreich. Deren Reichweite wird durch den geringen Anteil der unselbständig Beschäftigten an der (formellen) Gesamtbeschäftigung begrenzt. Hohe Arbeitslosigkeit und ein großes Lohngefälle, vor allem im Vergleich mit Westeuropa, hatten eine beträchtliche Abwanderung und einen Rückgang der Bevölkerung vieler dieser Länder zur Folge. Mit der Fortsetzung dieses Trends wird auch für die Zukunft gerechnet. Langfristig gesehen geht dadurch ein wichtiger Teil von Humankapital verloren, was die Aussichten auf eine Annäherung an das westeuropäische Niveau – unter anderem in puncto Löhne – beeinträchtigen dürfte. English Summary Wage developments in the West Balkans, Moldova and Ukraine In recent years, the general economic recovery has finally fed through to a significant increase in real wages in the Western Balkan countries, Moldova and Ukraine. Nevertheless, wage shares have barely picked up, and even declined slightly in several places. Significant convergence towards the Austrian wage level has only been registered in Kosovo. The improvement in labour market conditions in the countries covered has had only a moderately positive effect on wage developments. Despite recent declines, many countries continue to record double-digit unemployment rates, meaning that the bargaining power of employees has improved only slightly. The gradual decentralisation of wage-setting mechanisms has also slowed wage growth. In general, collective bargaining mechanisms are much less developed than, for example, in Austria. Their scope is limited by the low share of employees in total (formal) employment. High unemployment and large wage gaps, especially in comparison with Western Europe, have led to considerable outward migration and population decline in many of these countries. This trend is expected to continue in the future. In the long run, this will result in the loss of an important share of the human capital of these countries, which might affect their prospects for convergence towards Western European levels, including in wages.
J11|Demographic Challenges for Labour Supply and Growth|Many EU countries are currently undergoing major demographic changes, particularly in terms of shrinking total and working-age populations and population ageing. If this trend is to continue, the functioning of the labour market is at risk as labour shortages are increasingly more likely to emerge which will subsequently imperil further economic growth and catching-up across the EU. This report addresses the likely labour-market consequences of observable demographic trends in the EU. It applies a simple trend-based model which uses observable trends of the past 15 years of the working-age population and the activity rate – which together determine the evolution of the supply of labour – as well as of labour productivity and GDP growth – which together determine the evolution of the demand for labour – to simulate likely scenarios for the future development of labour supply and demand until 2050. Projected future trends in both labour supply and demand are then used to establish whether and – if so – in what year adverse past demographic developments are likely to kick in and begin jeopardising further growth. Different simulation exercises demonstrate that in some EU countries – particularly countries in Central and Eastern Europe – labour supply-side constraints would already materialise in the mid-2020s, which calls for quick policy action to address and ideally avert the imminent demographic collapse.
J11|The Belt and Road Initiative. Demographic trends, labour markets and welfare systems of member countries|A brief analysis of the different demographic tendencies that will affect the 65 countries of the Belt and Road Initiative allows to point out that they are largely spread along the path of the demographic transition so that in some working age population will dramatically decline, in others will dramatically increase. The implication is that the first group of countries (epitomized by China, Russia, Thailand, but also by Singapore) will be affected by a structural shortage of labour, the second (well represented by India, but also by Pakistan, Egypt and Philippines) by a structural excess of labour. Therefore, for the countries of the first group immigration will not be an option but a necessity, while for the countries of the second group emigration will not be an option but a necessity. The situation suggests that it would be in the interest of all BRI countries to design, develop and implement a policy framework that would allow them to jointly manage migration flows in the amount and with the educational stricture coherent with their needs. However, such a process is extremely difficult and complex and to succeed needs to be properly directed and orchestrated. The paper argues that given its size, the dimension of its need of foreign labour, and its role in the Belt and Road Initiative it is China that should take the lead of a rational approach that falls well inside the strategies of the Initiative.
J11|The World at the Crossroad. Demographic Polarization and Mass Migration. Global threat or global opportunity|The unstoppable progress of the demographic transition is determining a progressive decline of the rates of growth of the total population and working age population of the planet, two phenomena that could have a very positive global socioeconomic and environmental impact. Unfortunately, it is also determining a growing demographic polarization between an increasing number of countries, the most developed ones, where working age population will drop, and a decreasing number, the poorest ones, in which it will explode. The former will be affected by a dramatic structural shortage of labour that will make immigration unavoidable, the latter by a dramatic structural excess of labour that will make emigration necessary to avoid political and socioeconomic havoc. This phenomenon will have extremely disruptive effects not only at the country level but also at the planet level unless both groups of countries will understand that the disease provides its own medicine in the form of well planned and organized migration flows that, while responding to the quantitative and qualitative needs of potential arrival countries, will relieve the poorest countries from their structural excess of labour. Obviously there is a problem: this rational solution is in stark contrast with the myopic and xenophobic vision of an emerging political class that funds its success on the fear of immigrants and fuels xenophobic feelings talking advantage of ignorance and fake news. The incoming demographic polarization does also signal the passage from a situation in which labour markets were affected by economic cyclical disequilibrium to a situation in which they will be affected by a demo-economic structural disequilibrium. This new situation calls for an integrated demo-economic modeling and the use of coordinated sets of demographic and economic measures.
J11|Who Is in Favor of Immigration|Population ageing affects most countries, especially developed ones. The elderly have increased in number as a result of increased longevity and a parallel decline in fertility. This phenomenon is placing an increasing burden on the young to finance intergenerational transfers to the old, which is creating a threat to the stability of the pension system and the long-run viability of society as a whole. One possible solution is to permit more immigration, which will both increase the labor force and broaden the tax base. Increasing immigration has a variety of effects on the local population, which vary according to age and wealth. One of these is the threat to local social norms and culture since immigrants tend to maintain the culture of their country of origin. This effect increases with the number of immigrants and reduces the attractiveness of immigration as a solution to population ageing. This paper examines immigration as a solution to the problem of ageing population, while considering the implication of immigration on social norms.
J11|The effect of immigration on natives’ well-being in the European Union|Immigration is one of the most debated topics in Europe today, yet little is known about the overall effect of its multiple impacts. The analysis suggests natives need not worry. Increasing immigrant population shares have no statistically significant effects on natives’ well-being in 28 European Union countries over the years 1990- 2017 (EU12) and 2005-2017 (new member states) using macro data aggregated from Eurobarometer surveys. Immigration does not statistically affect natives’ well-being across all scenarios, such as: when observing the raw data or accounting for reverse causality and omitted variables using instrumental variable methods; accounting for whether or not immigrants are from the EU; and for population subgroups, notably the poorly educated and elderly. Refugees also do not statistically affect the well-being of natives. Any negative relations that are observed are not statistically significant and exhibit small magnitudes.
J11|Migration. Comparing political and cultural visions|Different interpretations of migration confront themselves in the political arena. Considering two factors, necessity and acceptability, the paper identifies four stereotyped visions: the society of the walls, the society of mercy, the society of ghettos, and the society of reason. The first three share the ideological assumption that migration flows are supply determined, that they are pushed by poverty, lack of jobs, and desperation due to the lack of perspectives of a better future. The fourth vision states, based on robust empirical evidence, that migrations are determined by the structural shortage of labour that characterizes an increasing number of Developed countries, in the presence of an unlimited supply of labour in the Least developed countries. The implication of this idea is that international migrations flows of increasing size are unavoidable and indispensable to both groups of countries that should reach a political agreement to jointly manage them with mutual advantage. An Annex -that summarize previous work of one of the author but is based on the last data and estimates released by UN DESA- provides a short, critical introduction to the concept of the demographic transition and present the statistical implications of its most relevant consequence: the demographic polarization of the plane.
J11|The interplay between trade unions and the social security system in an aging economy|This paper investigates how demographic change affects the financial sustainability of a defined benefit pay-as-you-go social security system in an environment with collective bargaining on the labor market. Temporary equilibrium analysis shows that the contribution rate decreases, if the old-age dependency ratio rises. The government balances the social security budget by aiming indirectly at a higher level of employment. In the intertemporal equilibrium the opposite applies. The government increases the contribution rate due to additional effects of demographic change on capital accumulation and labor demand. In contrast to a perfect labor market scenario, the imposed financing burden from an aging society is overcompensated by favorable labor market effects on the social security budget.
J11|The interplay between trade unions and the social security system in an aging economy|This paper investigates how demographic change affects the financial sustainability of a pay-as-you-go social security system in an environment with collective bargaining on the labor market. Partial equilibrium analysis shows that the contribution rate or the benefit level decreases, if the old-age dependency ratio rises. The government balances the social security budget by aiming indirectly at a higher level of employment. In general equilibrium the opposite applies. The government increases the contribution rate (defined benefit) or the benefit level (defined contribution) due to additional effects of demographic change on capital accumulation and labor demand. In contrast to a perfect labor market scenario, the imposed financing burden from an aging society is overcompensated by favorable labor market effects on the social security budget.
J11|Carbon footprint, demography, and employment status?|This paper investigates the interplay between aging of a society and its carbon dioxide emissions. The existing literature based on US data predicts lower overall emissions due to the lower emission intensity of consumption of a growing old-age share of the population. This conjecture is reexamined by a multivariate approach. The underlying hypothesis is that the individual levels of emissions do not only depend on age but also on income and employment status, which are correlated with age. Thus, bivariate analyses, neglecting other relevant variables, might overstate the decline in emissions for older cohorts. The paper shows that this hypothesis is correct. A bivariate approach overestimates the decline of emissions caused by population aging. Policy decisions favoring a longer work life may reverse the dampening effect of aging on emissions.
J11|On the macroeconomic effects of immigration: A VAR analysis for the US|This paper estimates the quarterly flow of migrants to the US working age population using data based on the Current Population Survey (CPS). The dynamic responses to immigration shocks are estimated in a vector autoregression. Immigration shocks, as well as technology shocks are identified through long-run restrictions. The responses to immigration shocks are consistent with standard growth theory. Investment increases, while real wages fall in the short run. Overall, immigration has been of little importance for US business cycles, while investment-specific technology shocks have been a major driver of immigration during the 1990s and 2000s.
J11|Population growth, the natural rate of interest, and inflation|Population growth rates have fallen considerably in most developed countries. An important question for monetary policy is whether this has led to a fall in the natural rate of interest. In representative agent models, the response of the natural rate to a fertility shock crucially depends on the preference parameter determining how households weight generations of different size. Estimating a medium-scale model of the US-economy featuring fertility shocks, I find that declining population growth has lowered both the natural rate and inflation by about 0.4 percentage points in recent decades.
J11|Population and poverty in Ireland on the eve of the Great Famine|The link between demographic pressure and economic conditions in pre-Famine Ireland has long interested economists. This paper re-visits the topic, harnessing the highly disaggregated parish-level data from the 1841 Census of Ireland. Using population per value adjusted acre as a measure of population pressure, our results indicate that on the eve of the Great Famine of 1846{50, population pressure was positively associated with both illiteracy rates and the prevalence of poor quality housing. But while our analysis shows that population pressure was one of the primary factors underpinning pre-Famine poverty, it also highlights the importance of geography and human agency. A counterfactual computation indicates that had Ireland's population stayed at its 1800 level, this would have led to only modest improvements in literacy and housing.
J11|Eradicating Poverty by 2030: Implications for Income Inequality, Population Policies, Food Prices (and Faster Growth?)|The paper examines whether the planned eradication of poverty to the year 2030 part of the Sustainable Development Goals strategy is compatible with the trends expected over the next 15 years in key economic variables such as GDP growth, population growth, income inequality and food prices. To do so, the paper develops a comparative-static, poverty-accounting model that allows to simulate to 2030 the impact on SDG1 (poverty eradication) of the fastest improvements recorded for the above four variables during the last 30 years. Numerous model simulations show that â€“ even under the most favorable assumptions â€“ between 16 and 28 countries (mainly from Africa) out of the 78 analyzed will not reach the SDG1 target. Policy suggestions on how to improve on such results are presented at the end of the paper.
J11|The serendipity theorem for an endogenous open economy growth model|A Samuelsonian serendipity theorem for an endogenous growth model is derived. The formula for optimal population growth rate deviates from those of the model with exogenous population growth rates in a third best endogenous growth model of the Lucas type with imperfect international capital movements and human capital externalities. Calibration shows that the effect of variation of the exogenous population growth rates on other variables and the deviation of population growth rates from its optimal value are small. The reason is that labour supply, interest rates and technical change are endogenous. There is not much of an incentive for population growth policy unless Frisch parameters change with ageing.
J11|Changes in Inequality in Mortality: New Evidence for Spain|We analyze the evolution of inequality in mortality in Spain during 1990-2014. We focus on age-specific mortality and consider inequality across narrowly defined geographical areas, ranked by average socioeconomic status. We find substantial decreases in mortality over the past 25 years for all age groups, which were particularly pronounced for men, resulting in a sizeable reduction in the gender gap in mortality. Inequality in mortality also decreased during this period, including during the recent recession, so that by the 2010’s mortality presents a flat socioeconomic gradient for most age groups. Compared to the US and Canada, decreases in mortality have been larger in Spain, and inequality is the lowest of the three countries. We find essentially no change in inequality among the elderly, in contrast to the increase found in the US.
J11|Lost Inflation?|Concern about “lost inflation” has been heightened recently by the apparent inability of central banks in the largest democracies, a decade beyond the GFC, to restore their “safe” CPI inflation ranges. This paper examines the deflationary forces against which monetary policy is now aligned, namely migration, the race to the bottom in capital taxation, and biased technical change, and assesses the consequences looking forward. While inflation rates have edged lower over the past two decades the most important change has been declines in long maturity yields, initially driven by strong growth in high-saving Asia and by redistribution in the advanced economies to high-saving households, and bolstered subsequently by return pessimism due to low growth in measured productivity. Ironically, today’s low rates also stem from conventional monetary policy failure, expanded central bank balance sheets and the resulting global “bond bubble”. Future monetary policy effectiveness as deflationary forces continue will depend in the advanced economies on government interventions to address underlying inequality and financial market “normalisation”.
J11|Deflation forces and inequality|Proximity to short yield zero lower bounds has challenged the inflation targeting central banks of the advanced regions. Central to this development are three-decade declining trends in long yields and underlying real, equilibrium interest rates that have flattened yield curves, restricting “normalisation” and adding deflationary pressure by boosting demand for portfolio money. Inflationary forces, such as fiscal deficits, industrial protection and resurgent regional growth, have proved comparatively weak. In this paper global modelling is used to show that key deflationary forces in these regions include automation, the race to the bottom in capital taxation and immigration. Each is shown to redistribute income so as to expand the welfare gap between the low-skilled and capital owners by 2.5 to 3.5 per cent per year. The high saving rates of capital owners depress real equilibrium rates and their expanding portfolios demand monetary expansion. These forces ensure that the challenges of macro stabilisation and distributional policy making are both intertwined and urgent.
J11|Labor market effects of demographic shifts and migration in OECD countries|The labor force of each industrial country is being shaped by three forces: ageing, education and migration. Drawing on a new database for the OECD countries and a standard analytical framework, this paper focuses on the relative and aggregate effects of these three forces on wages across different skill and age groups over 2000–2010. The variation in the age and educational structure of the labor force emerges as the dominant influence on wage changes. The impact is uniform and egalitarian: in almost all countries, the changes in the age and skill structure favor the low-skilled and hurt the highly skilled across age groups. Immigration plays a relatively minor role, except in a handful of open countries, like Australia and Canada, where it accentuates the wage-equalizing impact of ageing and education. Emigration is the only inegalitarian influence, especially in Ireland and a few Eastern European countries which have seen significant outflows of high-skilled labor to Western European Union countries.
J11|BRATISLAVA and VIENNA: Twin Cities with big Development Potentials|The German version can be found here. The economies of Vienna and Bratislava have followed quite different development paths over the last decades. While Vienna’s population increased by about 20% within two decades, Bratislava’s population mostly stagnated. However, when measured in GDP per capita at purchasing power parties, average income in Bratislava has surpassed that of Vienna and is now among the top-10 leading regions in Europe. Massive foreign direct investment, particularly in the automotive sector, has created full employment in Bratislava. Nevertheless, Vienna, as one of the world’s most liveable cities, is still attracting more immigration and labour markets are in less favourable conditions. Transport infrastructure between the two close cities has only recently been improving, which has left considerable scope for further reductions in travel time. Regional cooperation is under way and should be reinforced in order to meet the challenges ahead. Mass-emigration of young Slovaks over the last decades will lead to a rapid ageing in Slovakia over the next decades and the working age population is expected to shrink by almost a third by the end of the century, while Austria’s will mostly stagnate. By creating a truly common labour market in the twin-city region, Bratislava could solve the problem of labour shortages and Vienna could solve its youth unemployment problem. Policy recommendations in this respect include inter alia a more substantial improvement of intercity public transport; common educational planning and training programmes; and, commuter allowances during the nominal wage-equalisation-transition. Other major long-run challenges are the ongoing processes of digitalisation and robotisation. Here, policy recommendations include projects of innovation cooperation; coordination of innovation oriented public procurement; and, improvement of transport infrastructure to connect the twin-city region with the rest of the world in order to reap potential future gains from increased economies of scale.
J11|BRATISLAVA und Wien: Twin Cities mit großem Entwicklungspotenzial|The English version can be found here. Die Wirtschaften von Wien und Bratislava haben sich in den letzten Jahrzehnten sehr unterschiedlich entwickelt. Die Bevölkerung Wiens ist um etwa 20% angestiegen, jene von Bratislava hat dagegen stagniert. Nimmt man allerdings das BIP pro Kopf zu Kaufkraftparitäten als Maß, so hat das Durchschnittseinkommen in Bratislava jenes in Wien bereits überholt und liegt nun unter den Top-10 führenden Regionen in Europa. Massive Investitionen, besonders im Automobilsektor, haben dazu beigetragen, dass in Bratislava Vollbeschäftigung herrscht. Wien, eine der lebenswertesten Städte der Welt, zieht immer noch Zuwanderung an; die Arbeitsmarktsituation ist weniger günstig. Die Transportinfrastruktur zwischen den beiden Städten hat sich nur in jüngster Zeit verbessert. Es gibt jedoch durchaus noch Potential zu einer erheblichen Reduktion der Reisezeit. Eine Zusammenarbeit auf regionaler Ebene besteht schon seit geraumer Zeit. Diese sollte aber verbessert werden, um gemeinsam künftige Herausforderungen zu bewältigen. Die bisherige Emigration, vorwiegend junger Personen, aus der Slowakei wird dort in den nächsten Jahrzehnten zu einer starken Überalterung führen; die Bevölkerung im arbeitsfähigen Alter wird bis zum Ende des Jahrhunderts voraussichtlich um beinahe ein Drittel zurückgehen; jene in Österreich wird voraussichtlich stagnieren. Ein echter gemeinsamer Arbeitsmarkt der beiden Städte könnte daher für beide vorteilhaft sein, die Arbeitskräfteknappheit in Bratislava senken und das Problem der Jugendarbeitslosigkeit in Wien reduzieren. Wirtschaftspolitische Empfehlungen gehen daher in die Richtung einer deutlichen Verbesserung des öffentlichen Transports; Entwicklung einer gemeinsamen Planung von Ausbildung und Pendlerunterstützung, um zu einem Lohnausgleich beizutragen. Der Prozess der Digitalisierung und Robotisierung stellt eine zweite große Herausforderung dar. Politikempfehlungen dazu umfassen Kooperationsprojekte im Bereich Innovation; die Koordination einer innovationsorientierten öffentlichen Beschaffung und die Verbesserung der Transportinfrastruktur, die die Region mit dem Rest der Welt verbindet, um so für die Zukunft von günstigeren Skaleneffekten zu profitieren.
J11|Die Lohnentwicklung in den mittel- und osteuropäischen Mitgliedsländern der EU|This publication is available in German language only. For a brief English summary see further below. Die Arbeitsmärkte in den mittel- und osteuropäischen Mitgliedsländern der EU (EU-MOE-8) haben sich seit der globalen Wirtschaftskrise von 2008-2009 deutlich verbessert. Die Arbeitslosenraten gingen kontinuierlich zurück, in erster Linie aufgrund rückläufiger demographischer Entwicklungen und massiver Auswanderung Richtung Westen, was eine Schrumpfung der Bevölkerung im erwerbsfähigen Alter zur Folge hatte. Trotzdem war das Lohnwachstum in den EU-MOE-8 noch bis vor kurzem eher verhalten, was dazu führte, dass die Lohnquote generell stabil blieb. Die sogenannte Phillips-Kurve, die einen negativen Zusammenhang zwischen Arbeitslosigkeit und Lohnwachstum darstellt, gilt also in diesem Zeitraum für die meisten EU-MOE-8 nicht – anders als etwa in Österreich oder Deutschland. Der Hauptgrund dafür ist die voranschreitende Flexibilisierung und Liberalisierung der Arbeitsmärkte der EU-MOE-Länder in den Jahren seit der Wirtschaftskrise. Vor allem die Lohnverhandlungsmechanismen wurden dezentralisiert, und der Grad der kollektivvertraglichen Abdeckung ging, zum Teil dramatisch, zurück. Dies hatte tendenziell eine Verschlechterung der Verhandlungsposition der ArbeitnehmerInnen zur Folge, wodurch die positiven Effekte der allgemeinen Verbesserung der Arbeitsmarktlage konterkariert wurden. English Summary Wage developments in the Central and East European Member States of the EU Labour markets in the Central and East European Member States of the EU (EU-CEE-8) have improved significantly since the global economic crisis of 2008-2009. Unemployment rates declined steadily, primarily due to adverse demographic trends and massive outward migration to the West, which resulted in a decline in the working-age population. Nevertheless, until recently wage growth in EU-CEE-8 was rather restrained, resulting in generally stable wage shares. The so-called Phillips curve, which represents a ne<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J11|Demographics and FDI: Lessons from China’s One-Child Policy|Lucas (1990) argues that the neoclassical adjustment process fails to explain the relative paucity of FDI inflows from rich to poor countries. In this paper we consider a natural experiment: using China as the treated country and India as the control, we show that the dynamics of the relative FDI flows subsequent to the implementation of China’s one-child policy, as seen in the data, are consistent with neoclassical fundamentals. In particular, following the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the capital-labor (K/L) ratio of China increased relative to that of India, and, simultaneously, relative FDI inflows into China vs. India declined. These observations are explained in the context of a simple neoclassical OLG paradigm. The adjustment mechanism works as follows: the reduction in the (urban) labor force due to the one-child policy increases the savings per capita. This increases the K/L ratio and reduces the marginal product of capital (MPK). The reduction in MPK (relative to India) reduces the relative attractiveness of investment in China and is thus associated with lower FDI/GDP ratios. Our paper contributes to the nascent literature exploring demographic transitions and their effects on FDI flows.
J11|A VAR evaluation of classical growth theory|Over the past two decades, there have been numerous attempts in economic theory to model the historical regime of a Malthusian trap as well as the transition to growth in one coherent framework, or in other words, a unified growth theory. However, in most of these models, an important effect suggested by Malthus has been frequently omitted. By including what he had called ?the great preventive check? in the traditional Malthusian model which is based on the principle of population, the principle of diminishing returns and the principle of labour division, the transition can be modelled in a very simple dynamic macroeconomic framework. The aim of this paper is to first construct and calibrate the suggested classical model and to eventually employ a conventional VAR-Method to provide evidence of the above principles using country-specific annual historical data on crude birth rate, crude death rate and GDP per capita growth rate. As a result, it is argued that emerging economies follow a universal macroeconomic pattern of development. A decreasing death rate is succeeded by a decreasing birth rate which at the same time induces GDP per capita to rise sustainably. The correspondingly advanced microeconomic theory suggests that increasing life expectancy tends to create a demographic structure that is much less prone to overpopulation.
J11|Fachkräftemangel in der Pflege: Kritische Situationsbewertung und Skizzierung einer Handlungsalternative|Das Bundeskabinett hat am 01.08.2018 das Pflegepersonal-Stärkungsgesetz beschlossen. Unter anderem ist darin die Einstellung von 13.000 zusätzlichen Pflegefachkräften vorgesehen. Angesichts der derzeitigen Mangelsituation in diesem Berufsfeld bestehen starke Zweifel, ob diese Stellen adäquat besetzt werden können. Zukunftsprojektionen für das Jahr 2030 zeigen, dass sich die Pflegekraftlücke noch deutlich vergrößern wird. Auch der Zugriff auf bislang unerschlossene Arbeitskräftepotenziale wird zur Schließung nicht ausreichend sein. Die soziale Dramatik dieses Problems verbietet eine abwartende Haltung. Bisher beschlossene Maßnahmen sind zu kleinteilig und zu reaktiv angelegt. Es sind kurzfristig Handlungen erforderlich, die einen aktiven Lösungsbeitrag in einer substanziellen Größenordnung leisten. Vorgeschlagen wird in einem stark fokussierten Handlungsansatz die Errichtung einer groß dimensionierten Pflegefachschule (10.000 Plätze) in einem Drittland. Es wird ein begründeter Kriterienkatalog für die Auswahl geeigneter Länder vorgestellt. Als potenziell geeignetes Land wird Vietnam diskutiert.
J11|Fertility and population policy|There have been significant changes in both the fertility rates and fertility perception since 1970s. In this paper, we examine the relationship between government policies towards fertility and the fertility trends. Total fertility rate, defined as the number of children per woman, is used as the main fertility trend variable. We use panel data from the United Nations World Population Policies database, and the World Bank World Development Indicators for the period 1976 through 2013. We find a significant negative association between a countryâ€™s fertility rate and its anti-fertility policy. On the other hand, there is no significant and robust relationship between the fertility rate and a countryâ€™s pro-fertility or family-planning policies. In addition we find evidence of spatial autocorrelation in the total fertility rate, and spatial spillovers from a governmentâ€™s policy on fertility.
J11|Ageing, the socioeconomic burden, labour market and migration. The Chinese case in an international perspective|China still lags behind Europe along the path of the demographic transition and therefore is still much younger. However, due to the speed with which the fertility rate dropped and life expectancy increased, China ageing process will proceed at a very fast space and around the middle of the century the population of China is projected to be as old as that of France and the UK and older than that of the USA. The paper tries to evaluate the labour market and welfare implications of this process, also by an economic indicator of dependency and socioeconomic burden.
J11|Fertility Transitions in Developing Countries: Convergence, Timing, and Causes|This paper studies the dynamics of fertility in 180 countries in the period 1950-2015 and investigates the determinants of the onset of fertility transitions. The application of Phillips and Sul's (2007) test to fertility rates provides evidence of convergence in three groups of countries. This information is used to distinguish the transitioning countries from those not transitioning. The estimation of the year of onset of the fertility transition is followed by an econometric analysis of the causes of this event. Instrumental-variable estimates show that increasing female education and reduced infant mortality are important determinants of fertility decline, while per-capita GDP has probably worked in the opposite direction. The instruments for per-capita income are the trade-weighted world income (Acemoglu et al., 2008) and the oil price shock (Brueckner and Schwandt, 2015). Mortality is instrumented with the predicted mortality (Acemoglu and Johnson, 2007), and mothers' education with the years of schooling of people aged 40-64. These results are confirmed by the application of Lewbel's (2012) methods where identification is based on heteroskedasticity.
J11|Drivers of Labor Force Participation in Advanced Economies: Macro and Micro Evidence|Despite signi cant headwinds from population aging in most advanced economies (AEs), labor force participation rates show remarkably divergent trajectories both across countries and across di erent groups of workers. Participation increased sharply among prime-age women and, more recently, older workers, but fell among the young and prime-age men. This pa- per investigates the determinants of these trends using aggregate and individual-level data. We nd that the bulk of the dramatic increase in the labor force attachment of prime-age women and older workers in the past three decades can be explained by changes in labor mar- ket policies and institutions, structural transformation, and gains in educational attainment. Technological advances such as automation, on the other hand, weighed on the labor supply of prime-age and older workers. In light of the dramatic demographic shifts expected in the coming decades in many AEs, our ndings underscore the need to invest in education and training, reform the tax system, reduce early retirement incentives, improve the job-matching process, and help individuals combine family and work life in order to alleviate the pressures from aging on labor supply.
J11|Does size matter? Implications of household size for economic growth and convergence|We assess the effects of changes in household size on the long‐run evolution of living standards and on cross‐country convergence. When the observed changes in average household size across countries are taken into consideration, growth in living standards is slower throughout the 20th century as compared to a measure based on per capita GDP. Furthermore, the speed of divergence between different countries before 1950 is faster and the speed of convergence after 1950 is slower after adjusting for the evolution in household size.
J11|Der Umgang kleiner und mittlerer Unternehmen mit den demografischen Herausforderungen: Eine Trendstudie|Das IfM Bonn untersucht anhand einer repräsentativen Trendstudie für den Zeitraum 2007 bis 2017, wie KMU dem demografischen Wandel begegnen. Demnach sind die KMU aktuell besser als 2007 über den demografischen Wandel informiert. Die Mehrheit der KMU hat ihre Absatzstrategie an die bereits alternde Bevölkerung angepasst und mehr Maßnahmen zum Erhalt der Arbeitsfähigkeit und zur Bindung von Arbeitskräften als 2007 ergriffen. Auf die erwartete Knappheit von Arbeitskräften reagieren sie mit einer Rekrutierung von Jüngeren sowie Frauen, Älteren und Zuwanderern. Unternehmen in strukturell schwachen Gebieten sind stärker vom demografischen Wandel betroffen. Die Wirtschaftspolitik sollte daher auch regionale Besonderheiten bei der Entwicklung von Unterstützungsangeboten beachten.
J11|The new global agenda and the future of the multilateral development bank system|The authors assess the role of the multilateral development system and the reforms needed to support the new global agenda. There is an urgency to the reforms. The coming decades will see the largest urban expansion in history. More infrastructure needs to be built in the next 15 years than the existing stock of infrastructure in the world. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) are uniquely placed to support policy and institutional reforms and build institutional capacity, enhance the quality of projects and programs, and scale up for transformative change. They are the best mechanism today for leveraging public resources. By our calculations, each dollar of paid-in capital could reasonably translate into $50 of public investments if properly allocated. Despite these inherent strengths, MDBs are constrained by their financial and institutional capacities, effectiveness of instruments, and unclear mandates and governance shortcomings. The authors suggest MDBs do more in three client groups: (i) fragile states; (ii) high-debt countries; and (iii) upper middle-income countries, adjusting strategies and use of instruments in each case. With so many issues on the table, they believe that the greatest risk to the system lies in active inertia, a tendency to make changes on the margin that fall short of a collective response that is scaled to the task at hand. Individual MDBs each perform well, according to evaluation results, but their impact could be enhanced if they cooperated more as a system and developed scalable platform approaches. Major expansion is not feasible under current business and financial models. Shareholders need to reach consensus on capital and governance to unlock the financial potential and effectiveness of the MDB system.
J11|What accounts for the increase in female labor force participation in Spain|Over the last three decades, Spanish female labor force participation (LFP) has tremendously increased, particularly, that of married women. At the same time, the income tax structure, the fiscal treatment of families, policies to reconcile family and work, and the education distribution of married couples have substantially changed. By contrast, the gender wage gap has remained quite stable. In this paper the author investigates the relevance of these factors in accounting for the growth in Spanish married women labor force participation from 1994 to 2008. For that purpose, she uses Kaygusuz' model of household labor market participation, and data from Eurostat to calibrate the model and evaluate its performance. The model successfully accounts for the rise in aggregate female labor force participation, and matches hours worked by males and females. The model is also able to replicate the pattern of female labor force participation by age and education. From this analysis we can conclude that changes in tax rates and in the education distribution are the main factors behind the increase in female LFP during the late nineties, while changes in child care costs and earning profiles are mainly responsible for the subsequent growth in the 2000s.
J11|How the baby boomers' retirement wave distorts model‐based output gap estimates|This paper illustrates, based on an example, the importance of consistency between empirical measurement and the concept of variables in estimated macroeconomic models. Since standard New Keynesian models do not account for demographic trends and sectoral shifts, I propose adjusting hours worked per capita used to estimate such models accordingly to enhance the consistency between the data and the model. Without this adjustment, low‐frequency shifts in hours lead to unreasonable trends in the output gap, caused by the close link between hours and the output gap in such models. The retirement wave of baby boomers, for example, lowers US aggregate hours per capita, which leads to erroneous permanently negative output gap estimates following the Great Recession. After correcting hours for changes in the age composition, the estimated output gap closes gradually instead following the years after the Great Recession.
J11|Die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung Sachsen-Anhalts seit 1990|In diesem Beitrag wird die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung Sachsen-Anhalts seit 1990 im Kontext des ostdeutschen Transformationsprozesses von einer Zentralverwaltungswirtschaft zu einer Marktwirtschaft beschrieben. Die wirtschaftliche Leistungsfähigkeit Sachsen-Anhalts hat in den frühen 1990er Jahren zunächst schnell gegenüber Westdeutschland aufgeholt, vor allem weil der Kapitalstock modernisiert und erweitert worden ist. Seit einiger Zeit stagniert der Aufholprozess jedoch, und das Bruttoinlandsprodukt je Erwerbstätigen liegt etwa 20% unter dem westdeutschen Niveau. Die wirtschaftspolitische Herausforderung besteht darin, den Aufholprozess durch die Förderung von Forschung und Innovation und durch bessere Qualifizierung der Erwerbstätigen weiter voranzubringen.
J11|Finanzierung von Sofortprogrammen für mehr Personal in der Alten- und Krankenpflege|Die personelle Ausstattung der Kranken- und Altenpflege beschäftigt nicht nur die mediale Berichterstattung, auch der Ausschuss für Gesundheit des Deutschen Bundestags hat sich am 18.4.2018 mit den Anträgen der Fraktionen DIE LINKE und BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN zur Beseitigung des beklagten Pflegepersonalmangels beschäftigt. Aufgrund einer zunehmenden Arbeitsverdichtung wird unter anderem für die Krankenpflege in der akut-stationären Versorgung gefordert, verbindliche Personalbemessungsinstrumente mit dem Ziel einzuführen, das Pflegepersonal aufzustocken. Höhere Personalaufwendungen sollen über separate Budgets jenseits diagnosebezogener Fallpauschalen (DRGs) finanziert werden, auf die nach dem Willen der Partei DIE LINKE gänzlich verzichtet werden sollte. Tatsächlich kann das Bild einer zunehmenden Arbeitsverdichtung für die stationäre Krankenpflege statistisch nachvollzogen, aber nicht ursächlich auf die Einführung der DRGs zurückgeführt werden. Für den Fall, dass eine personelle Aufstockung der Krankenpflege aus medizinischen oder pflegewissenschaftlichen Gründen erforderlich wird, spricht das aber nicht zwingend gegen DRGs. Denn die bieten unabhängig von der für notwendig erachteten Personalbemessung notwendige Anreize für die wirtschaftliche Organisation der stationären Versorgung. Sollte der Gesetzgeber eine verbindliche Personalbemessung vorschreiben, besteht die Aufgabe deshalb vielmehr darin, diese in das DRG-System einzupflegen. Für den Bereich der Altenpflege wird eine Umwidmung des Pflegevorsorgefonds gefordert, dessen Mittel alternativ für den Aufbau weiterer personeller Kapazitäten eingesetzt werden sollen. Tatsächlich glättet der Pflegevorsorgefonds den im demografischen Wandel zu erwartenden Anstieg des Beitragssatzes über einen Zeitraum bis 2050. Es geht also darum, die durch die Bevölkerungsalterung entstehenden Lasten gerechter zwischen den Generationen zu verteilen. Mit der Auflösung dieses Fonds und der gleichzeitigen Erhöhung der umlagefinanzierten Leistungsversprechen würde die im Umlageverfahren ohnehin angelegte intergenerative Lastverschiebung auf die Mitglieder jüngerer Kohorten stattdessen noch verstärkt. Darüber hinaus fordert die Fraktion DIE LINKE, auf den Anspruch auf Entlohnung von Unternehmerrisiken im Zuge der Entgelte für stationäre Pflegeeinrichtungen zu verzichten. Der vermeintliche Widerspruch zwischen privat- und sozialwirtschaftlichen Interessen führt in die Irre. Denn erst die überdurchschnittliche Wachstumsdynamik privater Angebote hat in den vergangenen Jahren ermöglicht, den steigenden Pflegebedarf zu decken. Angesichts einer weiterhin demografisch bedingt steigenden Nachfrage wird diese Wachstumsdynamik auch künftig vonnöten sein. Dafür ist eine Entlohnung des unternehmerischen Risikos in der stationären Pflege ein dringend benötigter Anreiz. Nur wenn das persönliche und finanzielle Engagement selbständiger Unternehmer eine Entlohnung und Verzinsung verspricht, die gegenüber einer Festanstellung als Heimleitung oder einer Investitionen in alternative Anlagen hinreichend attraktiv erscheint, darf auch künftig mit privaten Investitionen in die dringend benötigte Pflege-Infrastruktur gerechnet werden.
J11|On the relevance and perspectives of commercial construction in the EU|This paper presents the current state of construction investments in the European Union and illustrates its development pre-, during and post- the recent economic and financial crisis. Construction investments were affected strongly by the economic turbulences caused by the crisis. In several EU member states construction investments are not yet back to pre-crisis levels. We further illustrate the importance of construction investments for the EU's gross fixed capital formation and in terms of gross domestic product. The analysis then presents potential challenges for the EU's construction sector. Based on the development of office employment in the past, and its current state, it is likely that demand for commercial construc-tion in the form of office buildings will increase in the future. In addition, infrastructure in-vestments must increase in order to meet the current and future needs.
J11|Die Entwicklung der Pflegefallzahlen in den Bundesländern: Eine Simulation bis 2035|Die Bundesregierung hat angekündigt, die Bedingungen in der Pflege weiter verbessern zu wollen. Allerdings hat der Bund keineswegs die alleinige Gestaltungshoheit im Bereich der Pflege. Insbesondere das Angebot an Pflegeheimplätzen und an ambulanter Pflege vor Ort wird maßgeblich durch das Handeln anderer staatlicher Ebenen beeinflusst. Länder und Kommunen haben grundsätzlich heute schon die Möglichkeit, einiges für die Situation in der Altenpflege zu tun und die Weichen für die Zukunft zu stellen. Dass deutschlandweit mit steigenden Pflegefallzahlen allein aufgrund des demografischen Wandels gerechnet werden muss, zeigt eine Simulation. Bei unverändertem Gesundheitszustand nimmt die Zahl der Pflegebedürftigen bis 2035 auf über vier Millionen zu. Selbst wenn sich die Pflegebedürftigkeit mit zunehmender Lebenserwartung in höhere Lebensalter verschiebt, müsste noch mit knapp 3,9 Millionen Pflegebedürftigen gerechnet werden. Insgesamt sind diese Ergebnisse eher als Untergrenze zu interpretieren, da hier die aktuellen Entwicklungen, die sich durch die Einführung der Pflegegrade ergeben, noch nicht eingerechnet sind. Die Simulationsrechnungen verdeutlichen zudem, dass eine wirkliche Entspannung der Lage in keinem Bundesland zu erwarten ist, alle Bundesländer müssen sich auf einen Zuwachs der Zahl der Pflegebedürftigen einstellen. Allerdings sind die Bundesländer unter anderem aufgrund ihrer spezifischen Bevölkerungsentwicklung unterschiedlich stark betroffen: Während der Anteil der Pflegebedürftigen an der Gesamtbevölkerung im wachsenden Berlin mit 3,5 Prozent konstant bleibt, steigt er in allen anderen Ländern weiter. Dieser Anstieg ist aber wiederum in den ostdeutschen Bundesländern Brandenburg und Sachsen-Anhalt mit 2 Prozentpunkten beziehungsweise Mecklenburg-Vorpommern und Thüringen mit sogar über 2 Prozentpunkten zwi-schen 2015 und 2035 vergleichsweise am stärksten. Für diese ostdeutschen Bundesländer liegt der Anteil der Pflegebedürftigen an der Gesamtbevölkerung in 2035 mit 7,3 Prozent (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) beziehungsweise 6,8 Prozent (Brandenburg und Thüringen) und 6,7 Prozent (Sachsen-Anhalt) deutschlandweit am höchsten - in Hamburg (3,8 Prozent), Bayern (3,9 Prozent) und Baden-Württemberg (4,3 Prozent) hingegen am niedrigsten. Deshalb ist schon heute darüber nachzudenken, wie dieser Anstieg an Pflegefallzahlen bewältigt werden kann. In der Pflicht sind dabei neben dem Bund auch die Bundesländer zusammen mit ihren Kommunen, um den jeweiligen regionalen Herausforderungen in diesem Bereich zu begegnen.
J11|Neue Haltelinien in der Rentenversicherung - und was dann? Variationen der Rentenanpassungsformel in einem einfachen Simulationsmodell|"In dem im Februar vorgestellten Koalitionsvertrag der CDU/CSU und SPD findet sich der Vorschlag, zwei neue Haltelinien für die gesetzliche Rentenversicherung einzuführen: Bis 2025 soll ein Sicherungsniveau von 48 Prozent nicht unter- und ein Beitragssatz von 20 Prozent nicht überschritten werden. Die weitere Entwicklung dieser Größen nach 2025 wird hingegen nicht weiter thematisiert. In diesem Beitrag werden drei mögliche Varianten für die Zeit nach 2025 vorgestellt: Die Rückkehr zum ursprünglichen Anpassungspfad dieser beiden Größen, ein Einfrieren dieser Größen über 2025 hinaus oder die Berechnung eines neuen Anpassungspfades beginnend mit dem Niveau in 2025. Anhand eines einfachen Simulationsmodells wird gezeigt, dass die Varianten, die von dem ursprünglichen Anpassungspfad abweichen, zwar zu einem höheren Sicherungsniveau führen, gleichzeitig jedoch nur mit einem höheren Beitragssatz beziehungsweise mit zusätzlichen Steuermitteln finanziert werden können. Insbesondere, wenn diese beiden Haltelinien über 2025 hinaus festgeschrieben werden, muss der Anteil der Bundesmittel an der Finanzierung der Rentenversicherung von gegenwärtig rund 30 Prozent auf über 37 Prozent in 2030 erhöht werden. In allen Varianten wird die künftige Beitragszahlergeneration stärker belastet, als es unter Beibehaltung der gegenwärtigen Rentenanpassungsformel der Fall wäre. Damit würde sich die Politik jedoch zusätzlichem Druck aussetzen: Erstens muss sie relativ schnell eine Antwort darauf liefern, wie es nach 2025, also bereits in sieben Jahre weitergehen soll. Zweitens besteht dann die Gefahr, dass sich die neu definierten Haltelinien nicht auf den alten Anpassungspfad zurückführen lassen, da dies mit ""politischen Sachzwängen"", sprich erheblichen Risiken für eine mögliche Wiederwahl der Sozialpolitiker verbunden wäre. Damit würden jedoch die höheren Belastungen für die künftigen Beitragszahler festgeschrieben. Drittens kann eine Verschlechterung der künftigen Arbeitsmarktsituation den Druck zusätzlich erhöhen und Handlungsbedarf schon vor 2025 erforderlich machen. Dann wird die Rentenpolitik jedoch zur Krisenpolitik und nimmt sich die Chance, gestalterisch tätig zu werden."
J11|Schrumpfende Boomregionen in Deutschland|Mit dem Verlust von Beschäftigungsmöglichkeiten in wirtschaftlich stagnierenden Regionen verschlechtern sich die Zukunftsaussichten der dort lebenden Bevölkerung. Ein Rückgang der Beschäftigung kann ökonomische Schrumpfungsprozesse verstärken, wenn ein Teil der jüngeren und besser ausgebildeten Bevölkerung in andere prosperierende Regionen abwandert. Umgekehrt gibt es aber auch Regionen, in denen die Bevölkerung - entgegen dem gegenwärtigen Trend in Deutschland - zurückgeht, während die Beschäftigung deutlich ansteigt. Dort ist es für die boomenden Unternehmen schwer, die notwendigen Fachkräfte zu gewinnen, um das Wachstum des Unternehmens zu gewährleisten. Die demografische Entwicklung dieser Regio-nen stellt ein Wachstumshindernis dar. Wenn sich diese Situation weiter verschlechtert, müssen Unternehmen möglicherweise einzelne Funktionen oder das ganze Betriebe an andere inländi-sche oder ausländische Standorte verlagern, die attraktiver für qualifizierte Mitarbeiter sind. Anhand der Entwicklung von Bevölkerung und sozialversicherungspflichtiger Beschäftigung werden die schrumpfenden Boomregionen in Deutschland ermittelt. Die dabei identifizierten Problemregionen weisen deutlich eine überdurchschnittlich ausgeprägte Anspannung am Arbeitsmarkt auf. Darauf aufbauend wird untersucht, in welche Richtung der gesamtdeutsche Zusammenhang zwischen Bevölkerung und Beschäftigung ausgeprägt ist. Es zeigt sich, sich beide Indikatoren gegenseitig positiv beeinflussen. Den drohenden Abwärtstendenzen, die sich trotz positiver wirtschaftlicher Aussichten ergeben können, muss durch Anstrengungen der beteiligten Unternehmen und Kommunen begegnet werden. Gemeinsam müssen sie die Attraktivität der Städte besonders für mobile und gut qualifizierte Bevölkerungsgruppen stärken.
J11|Population and Poverty in Ireland on the Eve of the Great Famine|The link between demographic pressure and economic conditions in pre-Famine Ireland has long interested economists. This paper re-visits the topic, harnessing the highly disaggregated parish-level data from the 1841 Census of Ireland. Using population per value adjusted acre as a measure of population pressure, our results indicate that on the eve of the Great Famine of 1846{50, population pressure was positively associated with both illiteracy rates and the prevalence of poor quality housing. But while our analysis shows that population pressure was one of the primary factors underpinning pre-Famine poverty, it also highlights the importance of geography and human agency. A counterfactual computation indicates that had Ireland's population stayed at its 1800 level, this would have led to only modest improvements in literacy and housing.
J11|Endogenous Retirement Behavior of Heterogeneous Households Under Pension Reforms|We propose a unified framework to measure the effects of different reforms of the pension system on retirement ages and macroeconomic indicators in the face of demographic change. A rich overlapping generations (OLG) model is built and endogenous retirement decisions are explicitly modeled within a public pension system. Heterogeneity with respect to consumption preferences, wage profiles, and survival rates is embedded in the model. Besides the expected direct effects of these reforms on the behavior of households, we observe that feedback effects do occur. Results suggest that individual retirement decisions are strongly influenced by numerous incentives produced by the pension system and macroeconomic variables, such as the statutory eligibility age, adjustment rates, the presence of a replacement rate, and interest rates. Those decisions, in turn, have several impacts on the macro-economy which can create feedback cycles working through equilibrium effects on interest rates and wages. Taken together, these reform scenarios have strong implications for the sustainability of pension systems. Because of the rich nature of our unified model framework, we are able to rank the reform proposals according to several individual and macroeconomic measures, thereby providing important support for policy recommendations on pension systems.
J11|Health insurance, endogenous medical progress, and health expenditure growth|We study the impact of health insurance expansion in the US on health expenditure, longevity growth and welfare in an overlapping generations economy in which individuals purchase health care to lower mortality. We consider three sectors: final goods production; a health care sector, selling medical services to individuals; and an R&D sector, selling increasingly effective medical technology to the health care sector. We calibrate the model to match the development of the US economy/health care system from 1965 to 2005 and study numerically the impact of the insurance expansion on health expenditures, medical progress and longevity. We find that more extensive health insurance accounts for a large share of the rise in US health spending but also boosts the rate of medical progress. A welfare analysis shows that while the moral hazard associated with subsidized health care creates excessive health care expenditure, the gains in life expectancy brought about by induced medical progress more than compensate for this. By mitigating an intergenerational externality associated with the longevity benefits from current medical innovation the expansion of health insurance constitutes a Pareto improvement.
J11|Population aging and cross-country redistribution in integrated capital markets|Population aging challenges the financing of social security systems in developed economies, as the fraction of the population in working age declines. The resulting pressure on capital-labor ratios translates into a pressure on factor prices and production. While European countries all face this challenge, the speed at which their population ages differs, and thus the pressure on capital-labor ratios. If capital markets are integrated, differences in population aging may lead to cross-country spillovers, as investors freely seek the best returns on capital. Using a multi-country overlapping-generations model covering 14 European Union countries, I quantify spillovers and find that capital market integration leads to redistribution across countries over the long run. For instance, GDP per capita would on average be 2.9 %-points lower in Germany in each of the next 50 years if capital markets were perfectly integrated and public debts kept constants with increases in labor income taxes, compared to a closed economy case; by contrast, GDP per capita would on average be 2.1 %-points higher in France, whose population ages slower than in Germany. I also show that pension reforms can change the cross-country redistribution patterns, some countries losing from capital market integration without the reform but winning with it.
J11|Can education compensate the effect of population ageing on macroeconomic performance?|This paper investigates the consequences of population ageing and of changes in the education composition of the population for macroeconomic performance. Estimation results from a theoretically founded empirical framework show that ageing as well as the education composition of the population influence economic performance. The estimates and simulations based on population projections and different counterfactual scenarios show that population ageing will have a substantial negative consequence for macroeconomic performance in many countries in the years to come. The results also suggest that education expansions tend to offset the negative effects, but that the extent to which they compensate the ageing effects differs vastly across countries. The simulations illustrate the heterogeneity in the effects of population ageing on economic performance across countries, depending on their current age and education composition. The estimates provide a method to quantify the increase in education that is required to offset the negative consequences of population ageing. Counterfactual changes in labour force participation and productivity required to neutralise ageing are found to be substantial.
J11|The Challenge for Regional Development| This working paper reproduces the speech by Professor Geoffrey J.D. Hewings at the Nomination Ceremony as Member of the Andalusian Regional Science Academy, on 28 May 2018 at Loyola Andalusia University.Professor Hewings reviews the evolution of Regional Science since the sixties, highlighting the key and forgotten role of the space when the outcomes of the economic policies are assessed in terms of developments. In addition,the challenges posed by demographic change are drawn, pointing out the future research directions to be addressed by regional modelers.
J11|The Differential Effects of Population Aging on Provincial GDP per capita and the Role of Productivity Growth as a Possible offset|A shift in population distribution toward older ages is underway in industrialised countries throughout the world and will continue well into the future. We provide a framework for isolating the pure effects of population aging on per capita GDP, employ the framework in calculations for the ten provinces of Canada, and derive the rates of productivity growth required to offset those effects. For comparison, as possible alternative offsets, we consider also some changes relating to the supply of labour.

Because of the rich nature of our unified model framework, we are able to rank the reform proposals according to several individual and macroeconomic measures, thereby providing important support for policy recommendations on pension systems.
J11|Macroeconomic consequences of the demographic and educational transition in Poland|Soon after the start of the transition to market economy in the early 1990s, Poland has experi- enced both a dramatic decline in the fertility rate and an increase in the share of students among young high-school graduates. These two processes significantly changed the age structure of the population and average income characteristics of households. Using a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous households and uninsured income shocks I try to assess the impact of these demographic and educational changes on the Polish economic performance and inequalities. I find that in the long term the positive effects of educational transition on output per capita more than offset the negative impact of lower fertility, but the outcome strongly depends on the adjustments in the structure of labor demand. I also show that the educational transition increases income and consumption inequalities, while the demographic transition decreases inequality in assets.
J11|Demographics, monetary policy and the zero lower bound|The recent literature shows that demographic trends may affect the natural rate of interest (NRI), which is one of the key parameters affecting stabilization policies implemented by central banks. However, little is known about the quantitative impact of these processes on monetary policy, especially in the European context, despite persistently low fertility rates and an ongoing increase in longevity in many euro area economies. In this paper we develop a New Keynesian life-cycle model, and use it to assess the importance of population ageing for monetary policy. The model is fitted to euro area data and successfully matches the age profiles of consumption-savings decisions made by European households. It implies that demographic trends have contributed significantly to the decline in the NRI, lowering it by 2 percentage points between 1980 and 2030. Despite being spread over a long time, the impact of ageing on the NRI may lead to a sizable and persistent deflationary bias if the monetary authority fails to account for this slow moving process in real time. We also show that, with the current level of the inflation target, demographic trends have already exacerbated the risk of hitting the lower bound (ZLB) and that the pressure is expected to continue. Delays in updating the NRI estimates by the central bank elevate the ZLB risk even further.
J11|Population aging and housing prices: who are we calling old?|This paper empirically studies through which channel - between short expected remaining life and withdrawal from the labor market - population aging affects real house price more and how the effect can vary if old-age population is defined alternatively in a way to reflect different aspects of aging, using a panel data of OECD countries. It finds that the main driver of a negative relationship between aging and real house price comes from the later stage of life and not immediately after the age of 65 or retirement. It also shows that the effective retirement age matters more in explaining the relationship between aging and real house price than the age 65, since the share of retired population has a nonlinear effect on real house price, while the standard old-age population aged over 65 does not. When I project future real house price, the standard old-age population only predicts a further decrease in real house price as aging continues, whereas the retired population captures a positive marginal effect and leaves room for policy intervention.
J11|Deaths of Despair or Drug Problems?|The United States is in the midst of a fatal drug epidemic. This study uses data from the Multiple Cause of Death Files to examine the extent to which increases in county-level drug mortality rates from 1999-2015 are due to “deaths of despair”, measured here by deterioration in medium-run economic conditions, or if they instead are more likely to reflect changes in the “drug environment” in ways that present differential risks to population subgroups. A primary finding is that counties experiencing relative economic decline did experience higher growth in drug mortality than those with more robust growth, but the relationship is weak and mostly explained by confounding factors. In the preferred estimates, changes in economic conditions account for less than one-tenth of the rise in drug and opioid-involved mortality rates. The contribution of economic factors is even less when accounting for plausible selection on unobservables, with even a small amount of remaining confounding factors being sufficient to entirely eliminate the relationship. These results suggest that the “deaths of despair” framing, while provocative, is unlikely to explain the main sources of the fatal drug epidemic and that efforts to improve economic conditions in distressed locations, while desirable for other reasons, are not likely to yield significant reductions in drug mortality. Conversely, the risk of drug deaths varies systematically over time across population subgroups in ways that are consistent with an important role for the public health environment related to the availability and cost of drugs. Put succinctly, the fatal overdose epidemic is likely to primarily reflect drug problems rather than deaths of despair.
J11|Earnings test, non-actuarial adjustments and flexible retirement|In response to the challenges of increasing longevity, many countries have introduced “flexibility reforms” for their public pension systems. A key measure of these reforms is the abolishment of earnings tests. It is claimed that these reforms increase labor supply and therefore the financial sustainability of pension systems. We build a simulation model to show that abolishing an earnings test may indeed create more labor supply but simultaneously reduce the average claiming age when adjustments remain less than actuarial, as is the case in most European pension systems. Flexibility reforms may therefore worsen rather than improve the sustainability of public pension systems.
J11|Is Fertility a Leading Economic Indicator?|Many papers show that aggregate fertility is pro-cyclical over the business cycle. In this paper we do something else: using data on more than 100 million births and focusing on within-year changes in fertility, we show that for recent recessions in the United States, the growth rate for conceptions begins to fall several quarters prior to economic decline. Our findings suggest that fertility behavior is more forward-looking and sensitive to changes in short-run expectations about the economy than previously thought.
J11|Demographics and Automation|We argue theoretically and document empirically that aging leads to greater (industrial) automation, and in particular, to more intensive use and development of robots. Using US data, we document that robots substitute for middle-aged workers (those between the ages of 36 and 55). We then show that demographic changeâ€”corresponding to an increasing ratio of older to middle-aged workersâ€”is associated with greater adoption of robots and other automation technologies across countries and with more robotics-related activities across US commuting zones. We also provide evidence of more rapid development of automation technologies in coun- tries undergoing greater demographic change. Our directed technological change model further predicts that the induced adoption of automation technology should be more pronounced in industries that rely more on middle-aged workers and those that present greater opportunities for automation. Both of these predictions receive support from country-industry variation in the adoption of robots. Our model also implies that the productivity implications of aging are ambiguous when technology responds to demographic change, but we should expect produc- tivity to increase and labor share to decline relatively in industries that are most amenable to automation, and this is indeed the pattern we find in the data.
J11|Older Men’s Labor Force Participation in Belgium|The paper studies the labor market participation of older workers in Belgium over the last 3 decades. It outlines the changes to the institutional framework of relevance for labor market participation and employment. Drawing on data from the European Union Labour Force Survey (LFS) over the period 1983-2013, we provide evidence of the trends in participation in (early-) retirement routes. We also explore how the jobs occupied by older workers have changed over time, both in terms of their “quality” and the “quantity” of work involved. Part-time work is found to become more common, though with different attributes for men and women.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J11|Demography, Unemployment, Automation, and Digitalization: Implications for the Creation of (Decent) Jobs, 2010–2030|"Globally, an estimated 734 million jobs will be required between 2010 and 2030 to accommodate recent and ongoing demographic shifts, account for plausible changes in labour force participation rates, and achieve target unemployment rates of at or below 4 percent for adults and at or below 8 percent for youth. The facts that i) most new jobs will be required in countries where ""decent"" jobs are less prevalent and ii) workers in many occupations are increasingly subject to risks of automation further compound the challenge of job creation, which is already quite sizable in historical perspective. Failure to create the jobs that are needed through 2030 would put currently operative social security systems under pressure and undermine efforts to guarantee the national social protection floors enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."
J11|The Evolution of Longevity: Evidence from Canada|We find a steep earnings-longevity gradient using fifty years of administrative data from Canada, with men in the top ventile of earnings living eight years (11 percent) longer than those in the bottom ventile. For women, the difference is 3.6 years. Unlike the United States, this longevity gradient in Canada has shifted uniformly through time, with approximately equal gains across the earnings distribution. We compare our results using cross-sectional and cohort-based methods, finding similar trends but a steeper gradient when using cohorts. For middle-aged men, we find a cessation of mortality improvements in recent years, comparable to changes observed in the United States. Changes in income do not explain cross-time or cross-country differences.
J11|Will Brexit Age Well? Cohorts, Seasoning and the Age-Leave Gradient, Past, Present and Future|In the UK's 2016 referendum on EU membership, young voters were more likely than their elders to vote Remain. Applying new methods to a half century of data, we show that this pattern reflects both ageing and cohort effects. Although voters become more Eurosceptical as they age, recent cohorts are also more pro-European than their predecessors. Much of the pro-Europeanism of these recent cohorts is accounted for by their greater years of education. Going forward, the ageing of the electorate will thus be offset at least in part by the replacement of older cohorts with younger, better-educated and more pro-European ones. But we also document large nationwide swings in sentiment that have little to do with either seasoning or cohort effects. Hence these demographic trends are unlikely to be the decisive determinants of future changes in European sentiment. Rather, nationwide changes in sentiment, reflecting macroeconomic or other conditions, and the age-turnout gradient will be key.
J11|The Long-run Impact of New Medical Ideas on Cancer Survival and Mortality|I investigate whether the types of cancer (breast, colon, lung, etc.) subject to greater penetration of new ideas had larger subsequent survival gains and mortality reductions, controlling for changing incidence. I use the MEDLINE/PubMED database, which contains more than 23 million references to journal articles published in 5400 leading biomedical journals, to construct longitudinal measures of the penetration of new medical ideas. The 5-year survival rate is strongly positively related to the novelty of ideas in articles published 12-24 years earlier. This finding is consistent with evidence from case studies that it takes a long time for research evidence to reach clinical practice. The estimates suggest that about 70% of the 1994-2008 increase in the 5-year observed survival rate for all cancer sites combined may have been due to the increase in the novelty of medical ideas 12-24 years earlier. The number of years of potential life lost from cancer before ages 80 and 70 are inversely related to the novelty of ideas in articles published 12-24 years earlier, conditional on incidence. The increase in medical idea novelty was estimated to have caused a 38% decline in the premature (before age 80) cancer mortality rate 12-24 years later.
J11|From Population Growth to Firm Demographics: Implications for Concentration, Entrepreneurship and the Labor Share|The US economy has undergone a number of puzzling changes in recent decades. Large firms now account for a greater share of economic activity, new firms are being created at a slower rate, and workers are getting paid a smaller share of GDP. This paper shows that changes in population growth provide a unified quantitative explanation for these long-term changes. The mechanism goes through firm entry rates. A decrease in population growth lowers firm entry rates, shifting the firm-age distribution towards older firms. Heterogeneity across firm age groups combined with an aging firm distribution replicates the observed trends. Micro data show that an aging firm distribution fully explains i) the concentration of employment in large firms, ii) and trends in average firm size and exit rates, key determinants of the firm entry rate. An aging firm distribution also explains the decline in labor’s share of GDP. In our model, older firms have lower labor shares because of lower overhead labor to employment ratios. Consistent with our mechanism, we find that the ratio of nonproduction workers to total employment has declined in the US.
J11|Demographics and FDI: Lessons from China's one-child policy|"Following the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the capital-labor (K/L) ratio of China increased relative to that of India, and, simultaneously, FDI inflows relative to GDP for China versus India declined. These observations are explained in the context of a simple neoclassical OLG paradigm. The adjustment mechanism works as follows: the reduction in the growth rate of the (urban) labor force due to the one-child policy permanently increases the capital per worker inherited from the previous generation. The resulting increase in China's (domestic K)/L thus ""crowds out"" the need for FDI in China relative to India. Our paper is a contribution to the nascent literature exploring demographic transitions and their effects on FDI flows."
J11|The introduction of a social gradient in mortality in the Destinie 2 model|We use here the mortality tables by education level recently published by Blanpain (2016b) to significantly improve the projected differential mortality in the Destinie 2 model that was usually only based on Insee mortality projections broken down by age and sex categories. We show that the relational proportionality method better predicts the evolution of differential mortality over the recent past than the Brass relationality method, used in other microsimulation models. The introduction of heterogeneous mortality according to education level aims at better reproducing the positive correlation that exists beteen life expectancy and pension levels. To quantify it, we compare the elasticities of survival to the amount of the retirement pension, by sex and age, obtained by microsimulation with those estimated on the Échantillon Interrégimes de Retraités (EIR). The simulated elasticities are lower than the empirical elasticities, especially for women. For men, however, they are statistically significant and at least two-thirds of the empirically observed values. At the aggregate level, this introduction also slightly increases projected pension expenditure.
J11|The Long View: Scenarios for the World Economy to 2060|This paper presents long-run economic projections for 46 countries, extending the short-run projections of the Spring 2018 OECD Economic Outlook. It first sets out a baseline scenario under the assumption that countries do not carry out institutional and policy reforms. This scenario is then used as a reference point to illustrate the potential impact of structural reforms in alternative scenarios, including better governance and educational attainment in the large emerging-market economies and competition-friendly product market and labour market reforms in OECD economies. Flexibility-enhancing labour market reforms not only boost living standards but, by raising the employment rate, also help alleviate fiscal pressures associated with population ageing. Another scenario illustrates the potential positive impact of linking the pensionable age to life expectancy on the participation rate of older workers, and in particular that of women. Additional scenarios illustrate the potential economic gains from raising public investment and spending more on research and development. A final ‘negative’ scenario shows how slipping back on trade liberalisation – returning to 1990 average tariff rates – might depress standards of living everywhere.
J11|The contribution of migration to the dynamics of the labour force in OECD countries: 2005-2015|This paper presents the methodology as well as the results of the joint OECD-EC project Migration-Demography Database: A monitoring system of the demographic impact of migration and mobility. The objective of the project is to evaluate the contribution of migration to past and future labour market dynamics across OECD countries. After assessing the role of migration over the last five to 10 years in shaping the occupational and educational composition of the labour force, this project looks at the potential contribution of migration to the labour force in a range of alternative scenarios. This paper presents the results from the first part of the project: it focuses on the changes that have taken place in the last 10 years and studies how migration flows have contributed to the dynamics of the labour force, in particular in comparison to other labour market entries. It also analyses the contribution of migration in specific skills categories and in specific occupations.
J11|Assessing the role of migration in European labour force growth by 2030|This paper presents the methodology as well as the results of the joint OECD-European Commission project Migration-Demography Database: A monitoring system of the demographic impact of migration and mobility. The objective of the project is to evaluate the contribution of migration to past and future labour market dynamics across EU and OECD countries. After assessing the role of migration over the last five to 10 years in shaping the occupational and educational composition of the labour force, this project looks at the potential contribution of migration to the labour force in a range of alternative scenarios. This paper presents the results from the second part of the project: it focuses on projections over the period 2015-2030, and aims at identifying the drivers of changes in working-age population and active population in European countries, and in particular the role of migration flows.
J11|Identifying the Factors Driving West African Migration|Since 2014 over 600 000 African migrants have arrived in Italy through the perilous Central Mediterranean route, and nearly 120 000 arrived in 2017. This paper is the first examination of migration motivations at the individual level using nationally representative surveys and focus group data collected in West Africa. Respondents in six West African countries cite economic factors as the reason for migrating and those who wish to stay claim family and love of country as the ties that bind. The study then specifically focuses on Nigeria, the country of origin for a quarter of all Africans traveling through the Central Mediterranean route. Half of the Nigerians were interested in leaving their country of origin if given the opportunity, well above the number in neighbouring countries. Evidence from the six-country survey suggests individuals are migrating for economic reasons but statistical analysis of the Nigeria data reveals a different set of push factors behind the desire to migrate. In fact, economic standing has a limited effect on Nigerians’ desire to leave their home. Instead, individual perceptions of the strength of Nigeria’s democracy are most strongly associated with Nigerians’ desire to migrate abroad, in addition to low levels of trust in local security institutions. Urban and more highly educated Nigerians, especially from Lagos, are also more likely to want to migrate abroad. These findings shed new light on domestic policy steps that could address the grievances and concerns of those who seek to migrate.
J11|A cautionary note on the reliability of the online survey data – the case of Wage Indicator|We investigate the reliability of data from the Wage Indicator (WI), the largest online survey on earnings and working conditions. Comparing WI to nationally representative data sources for 17 countries reveals that participants of WI are not likely to have been representatively drawn from the respective populations. Previous literature has proposed to utilize weights based on inverse propensity scores, but this procedure was shown to leave reweighted WI samples different from the benchmark nationally representative data. We propose a novel procedure, building on covariate balancing propensity score, which achieves complete reweighting of the WI data, making it able to replicate the structure of nationally representative samples on observable characteristics. While rebalancing assures the match between WI and representative benchmark data sources, we show that the wage schedules remain different for a large group of countries. Using the example of a Mincerian wage regression, we find that in more than a third of the cases, our proposed novel reweighting assures that estimates obtained on WI data are not biased relative to nationally representative data. However, in the remaining 60% of the analyzed 95 datasets systematic differences in the estimated coefficients of the Mincerian wage regression between WI and nationally representative data persists even after reweighting. We provide some intuition about the reasons behind these biases. Notably, objective factors such as access to the Internet or richness appear to matter, but self-selection (on unobservable characteristics) among WI participants appears to constitute an important source of bias

The first approach shows the impact of alternative future development scenarios for the population growth components. The effects of some of these scenarios on the development in social expenditure and the at-risk-of-poverty rate for pensioners are also analysed. The second approach consists in carrying out a sensitivity analysis of the population projection to some model parameters, in particular the observation periods selected to estimate trends.
J11|Working Paper 07-18 - Multiregional Population Projection Model at the EU level|This paper explores the possibility of building a multiregional migration model at the EU level based on Eurostat statistics on migration by country of previous and next residence, by country of birth or by citizenship. These statistics are used to build a consistent origin-destination matrix for the EU Member States. In this case, 'consistent' means that the sum of all intra-EU movements should be equal to 0. This matrix is then used to compute migration rates between EU countries, which can be inserted into a multiregional population projection model.This paper shows that the currently available official statistics on migration flows can be used to build a multiregional migration model at the EU level. Although more developments should be implemented to test and improve the model, it produces promising results.
J11|Eradicating poverty by 2030: Implications for Income Inequality, Population Policies, Food Prices (and Faster Growth?)|The paper examines whether the planned eradication of poverty to the year 2030 part of the SDG strategy is compatible with the expected trends in key economic variables such as GDP growth, population growth, income inequality and food prices. To do so, the paper develops a comparativestatic, poverty-accounting model that allows to simulate to 2030 the impact on SDG1 of the fastest improvements recorded for the above four variables during the last 30 years. Numerous model simulations show that – even under the most favorable assumptions – between 16 and 28 countries (mainly from Africa) out of the 78 analyzed will not reach the SDG1 target. Policy suggestions on how to improve on such results are presented at the end.
J11|Social Sphere in Russia in 2017|The positive economic trends of 2017 – GDP growth, record-low inflation rate, revival of consumption and other – were estimated by most experts and analysts as evidence of the country’s embarking on a positive economic trajectory and the year 2017 was generally regarded as the year of economic revival. However, such a conclusion would not be complete without assessment of households’ well-being and other parameters which serve as indicators of the state of things in the social sphere. Economic processes have a decisive effect on the ongoing main social processes. In the past three years, an unstable and inconsistent economic situation in Russia could not but give rise to substantial changes in households’ social and economic situation. At the same time, the entire number of factors which were not related to the macroeconomic and volatile dynamics, but justified by other processes preset by lengthy previous periods affected much the social sphere.
J11|Testing the effect of population ageing on national saving rates: panel data evidence from Europe|The objective of this study is to test the relationships between population ageing and gross saving rates in European countries. We use panel data techniques to explore the possible non-linearity between it. We show that the dependency ratio, when is significant, negatively affects gross saving rates. Besides, life expectancy has non-linear effects on saving rates and rising longevity is a main factor to explain saving rates at national levels. European countries are concerned about the delivery of benefits and services and financial sustainability of their welfare state and increase gross national savings rates can help to fill this gap.
J11|The Khoikhoi Population, 1652-1780: A Review of the Evidence and Two New Estimates|Fourie and Green construct estimates of the Khoikhoi population over the 1652-1780 period using benchmarks for the initial and terminal Khoi populations and benchmarks for the punctuated population declines from smallpox epidemics in 1713 and 1755. I review the evidence underlying each of the four population benchmarks and argue for a revised 1780 benchmark. Qualitative evidence also points to a higher rate of population decline between 1652 and 1723 and a smaller rate of decline between 1723 and 1780. Using the Fourie-Green methodology and adopting 3 of their 4 population benchmarks, I develop two revised estimates of the Khoi population to supplement the original Fourie and Green estimates.
J11|Global Migration in the 20th and 21st Centuries: the Unstoppable Force of Demography|This paper sheds light on the global migration patterns of the past 40 years, and produces migration projections for the 21st century, for two skill groups, and for all relevant pairs of countries. To do this, we build a simple model of the world economy, and we parameterize it to match the economic and socio-demographic characteristics of the world in the year 2010. We conduct a backcasting exercise which demonstrates that our model fits the past trends in international migration very well, and that historical trends were mostly governed by demographic changes. We then describe a set of migration projections for the 21st century. In line with backcasts, our world migration prospects and emigration rates from developing countries are mainly governed by socio-demographic changes: they are virtually insensitive to the technological environment. As far as OECD countries are concerned, we predict a highly robust increase in immigration pressures in general (from 12 in 2010 to 17-19% in 2050 and 25-28% in 2100), and in European immigration in particular (from 15% in 2010 to 23-25% in 2050 and 36-39% in 2100). Using development policies to curb these pressures requires triggering unprecedented economic takeoffs in migrants countries of origin. Increasing migration is therefore a likely phenomenon for the 21st century, and this raises societal and political challenges for most industrialized countries.
J11|Development, fertility and childbearing age: A Unified Growth Theory|During the last century, fertility has exhibited, in industrialized economies, two distinct trends: the cohort total fertility rate follows a decreasing pattern, while the cohort average age at motherhood exhibits a U-shaped pattern. This paper proposes a Unified Growth Theory aimed at rationalizing those two demographic stylized facts. We develop a three-period OLG model with two periods of fertility, and show how a traditional economy, where individuals do not invest in education, and where income rises push towards advancing births, can progressively converge towards a modern economy, where individuals invest in education, and where income rises encourage postponing births. Our findings are illustrated numerically by replicating the dynamics of the quantum and the tempo of births for cohorts 1906–1975 of the Human Fertility Database.
J11|Évolutions démographiques et marché de l’immobilier neuf|Using household survey data from the ?Enqu?tes Logement? collected from 1973 to 2013, this article studies the effects of demography on the new-build housing market dynamics in France, as well as in the Paris Region, Provence-Alpes-C?te d?Azur, and in coastal regions and in landlocked regions. After computing how frequently individuals buy a new-build house for their primary residence by age, the effects of behavioral changes and demographic changes (population size and age structure) on the market dynamics are evaluated. The article analyzes the impact of population ageing and provides projections on the needs for home construction by 2060. Results suggest that while the changes in population size are in favor of acquisitions all the period long, the age structure becomes an adverse factor from the beginning of the nineties onwards. The decomposition shows that these effects are region-specific.
J11|Endogenous Childlessness and Stages of Development|Although developing countries are characterized by high average fertility rates, they are as concerned by childlessness as developed countries. Beyond natural sterility, there are two main types of childlessness: one driven by poverty and another by the high opportunity cost of childrearing. We measure the importance of the components of childlessness with a structural model of fertility and marriage. Deep parameters are identified using census data from 36 developing countries. As average education increases, poverty-driven childlessness first decreases to a minimum, and then the opportunity-driven part of childlessness increases. We show that neglecting the endogenous response of marriage and childlessness may lead to a poor understanding of the impact that social progress, such as universal primary education, may have on completed fertility. The same holds for family planning, closing the gender pay gap, and the eradication of child mortality.
J11|A Principal Component Simulation of Age-Specific Fertility - Impacts of Family and Social Policy on Reproductive Behavior in Germany|This contribution proposes a simulation approach for the indirect estimation of age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) and the total fertility rate (TFR) for Germany via time series modeling of the principal components of the ASFRs. The model accounts for cross-correlation and autocorrelation among the ASFR time series. The effects of certain measures are also quantified through the introduction of policy variables. Our approach is applicable to probabilistic sensitivity analyses investigating the potential outcome of political intervention. A slight increase in the TFR is probable until 2040. In the median scenario, the TFR will increase from 1.6 in 2016 to 1.68 in 2040 and will be between 1.46 and 1.92 with a probability of 75 percent. Based on this result, it is unlikely that the fertility level will fall back to its extremely low levels of the mid-1990s. Two simple alternate scenarios are used to illustrate the estimated ceteris paribus effect of changes in our policy variables on the TFR.
J11|A Probabilistic Cohort-Component Model for Population Forecasting - The Case of Germany|The future development of population size and structure is of importance since planning in many areas of politics and business is conducted based on expectations about the future makeup of the population. Countries with both decreasing mortality and low fertility rates, which is the case for most countries in Europe, urgently need adequate population forecasts to identify future problems regarding social security systems as one determinant of overall macroeconomic development. This contribution proposes a stochastic cohort-component model that uses simulation techniques based on stochastic models for fertility, migration and mortality to forecast the population by age and sex. We specifically focus on quantifying the uncertainty of future development as previous studies have tended to underestimate future risk. The results provide detailed insight into the future population structure, disaggregated into both sexes and 116 age groups. Moreover, the uncertainty in the forecast is quantified as prediction intervals for each subgroup. The underlying models for forecasting the demographic components have been developed in earlier studies and rely on principal component time series models. Since the proposed model is fully probabilistic, it offers a wide range of information, not only identifying the most probable course of the population but also a vast number of possible scenarios for future development of the population and quantifying their respective likelihoods. The model is applied to forecast the population of Germany until 2040. The results indicate a larger future population for Germany compared to the population predicted in studies conducted before 2015. The driving factors are lower mortality, higher fertility and higher net migration as derived by us statistically in contrast to widely used qualitative assumptions. The present study shows that the increase in population is mainly due to a larger proportion of older individuals.
J11|From Immigrants to Americans: Race and Assimilation during the Great Migration|How does the appearance of a new immigrant group affect the integration of earlier generations of migrants? We study this question in the context of the first Great Migration (1915-1930), when 1.5 million African Americans moved from the US South to northern urban centers, where 30 million Europeans had arrived since 1850. We exploit plausibly exogenous variation induced by the interaction between 1900 settlements of southern-born blacks in northern cities and state-level outmigration from the US South after 1910. Black arrivals increased both the effort exerted by immigrants to assimilate and their eventual Americanization. These average effects mask substantial heterogeneity: while initially less integrated groups (i.e. Southern and Eastern Europeans) exerted more assimilation effort, assimilation success was larger for those culturally closer to native whites (i.e. Western and Northern Europeans). Labor market outcomes do not display similar heterogeneity, suggesting that these patterns cannot be entirely explained by economic forces. Our findings are instead more consistent with a framework in which changing perceptions of outgroup distance among native whites lowered the barriers to the assimilation of white immigrants.
J11|Testing for normality in truncated anthropometric samples|Anthropometric historical analysis depends on the assumption that human characteristics—such as height—are normally distributed. I propose and evaluate a metric entropy, based on nonparametrically estimated densities, as a statistic for a consistent test of normality. My first test applies to full distributions for which other tests already exist and performs similarly. A modified version applies to truncated samples for which no test has been previously devised. This second test exhibits correct size and high power against standard alternatives. In contrast to the distributional prior of Floud et al. (1990), the test rejects normality in large parts of their sample; the remaining data reveal a downward trend in height, not upward as they argue.

J11|Marriage, Divorce and Wage Uncertainty along the Life-cycle|The American family underwent important transformations in the last decades. Mating patterns changed, college graduates and high earners marry with each other more and more frequently. On the other hand, those at the bottom of the wage and schooling distributions have become more and more likely to stay single, and, once married or cohabiting, more likely to break up. This increasing gap in family achievements has important implications for both income and consumption inequalities, as well as intergenerational mobility. In this paper, I aim to quantify the importance of the marriage market as a channel of inequality, both at household and individual level. I build on the matching literature and set up a model of marriage, divorce and remarriage along the life- cycle in order to reproduce the afore-mentioned aggregate trends and understand the underlying drivers. In the model, risk-averse agents get married in order to benefit from joint public good expenditure, but economic gains from marriage are volatile due to labor market shocks. I show that the underlying structure of preferences and of the meeting technology are identified with matched data on the distribution of couples’ and singles’ traits, jointly with data on newlyweds and divorcees. I propose an estimation method based on indirect inference and estimate the model with PSID data. Preliminary findings suggest that differences in the productivity of household public good expenditure appear as a key driving force behind differentials in the odds of staying single, mating patterns, and, ultimately, household income inequality.
J11|Social Norms and Fertility|We first document three stylized facts about marriage and fertility in East Asian societies: They have the highest marriage rates in the world, but the lowest total fertility; they have the lowest total fertility, but almost all married women have at least one child. By contrast, almost no single women have any children. We then explain these three facts, focusing on two social norms associated with Confucianism: the unequal gender division of childcare within a household and the stigma attached to out-of-wedlock births. We incorporate the two social norms into an economic model, and structurally estimate it using data from South Korea’s censuses and household surveys. We find that, on the one hand, the social norm of unequal gender division of childcare significantly contributes to the low fertility of South Korea, and its effect varies across education: The social norm lowers fertility for highly educated women but increases it for the less educated. Pro-natal policies can increase average fertility, but they are not effective in mitigating the role of this norm as they cannot sufficiently boost fertility for highly educated women. On the other hand, the social stigma has negligible effects on marriage and fertility. Historical simulation results show that fertility would have decreased less dramatically in the absence of the first norm, especially for younger birth cohorts. Our results suggest that the tension between the persistent gender ideology and rapid socioeconomic development is the main driving force behind the unique marriage and fertility patterns of East Asian societies, and that this tension has escalated in recent decades.
J11|On welfare effects of increasing retirement age|We develop an OLG model with realistic assumptions about longevity to analyze the welfare effects of raising the retirement age. We look at a scenario where an economy has a pay-as-you-go defined benefit scheme and compare it to a scenario with defined contribution schemes (funded or notional). We show that, initially, in both types of pension system schemes the majority of welfare effects comes from adjustments in taxes and/or prices. After the transition period, welfare effects are predominantly generated by the preference for smoothing inherent in many widely used models. We also show that although incentives differ between defined benefit and defined contribution systems, the welfare effects are of comparable magnitude under both schemes. We provide an explanation for this counter-intuitive result.
J11|Population Aging and Cross-Country Redistribution in Integrated Capital Markets|Population aging challenges the financing of social security systems in developed economies, as the share of the working age population declines. The resulting pressure on capital-labor ratios tends to push up factor prices and production. While European countries all face this challenge, the speed at which their populations are aging differs. If capital markets are integrated, differences in population aging may lead to cross-country spillovers, as investors freely seek the best returns on their capital. Using a multi-country overlapping-generations model covering 14 European Union countries, this paper quantifies spillovers and finds that capital market integration leads to redistribution across countries over the long run. It also shows that pension reforms can change the cross-country redistribution patterns, some countries losing from capital market integration without the reform but winning with it.
J11|Drivers of Labor Force Participation in Advanced Economies: Macro and Micro Evidence|Despite significant headwinds from population aging in most advanced economies (AEs), labor force participation rates show remarkably divergent trajectories both across countries and across different groups of workers. Participation increased sharply among prime-age women and, more recently, older workers, but fell among the young and prime-age men. This paper investigates the determinants of these trends using aggregate and individual-level data. We find that the bulk of the dramatic increase in the labor force attachment of prime-age women and older workers in the past three decades can be explained by changes in labor market policies and institutions, structural transformation, and gains in educational attainment. Technological advances such as automation, on the other hand, weighed on the labor supply of prime-age and older workers. In light of the dramatic demographic shifts expected in the coming decades in many AEs, our findings underscore the need to invest in education and training, reform the tax system, reduce early retirement incentives, improve the job-matching process, and help individuals combine family and work life in order to alleviate the pressures from aging on labor supply.
J11|An Horizontal Innovation Growth Model with Endogenous Time Allocation and Non-Stable Demography|We propose a decentralized endogenous growth model in order to study the transitional dynamics associated with the process of population aging in a small open economy, that has endogenous time allocation and two growth engines: R&D and human capital accumulation. Growth of per capita output is affected negatively by the difference in the rates of growth of labor force and of the total population in the period where the weight of the labor force decreases to a new and lower level. The biggest impact on per capita output growth should be during the period where labor force grows at a lower rate than the popu- lation unless it is compensated by some other effect. Under some assumptions, a decrease in the corporate tax improves growth.
J11|Intimate Partner Violence and the Business Cycle|We examine the impact of business cycle variation on intimate partner violence using representative data from thirty one developing countries, through 2005 to 2016. We distinguish male from female unemployment rates, identifying the influence of each conditional upon the other. We find that a one percent increase in the male unemployment rate increases the incidence of physical violence against women by 0.50 percentage points, or 2.75 percent. This is consistent with the financial and psychological stress generated by unemployment. Increases in female unemployment rates (corresponding to decreases in women's employment opportunities), conditional upon rates of male unemployment reduce the incidence of violence; a one percent increase being associated with a decrease in the probability of victimization of 0.52 percentage points, or 2.87 percent. This is consistent with 'male backlash'. These patterns of behaviour are stronger among better educated women and weaker among women who have had at least one son.
J11|Demographic Uncertainty and Generational Consumption Risk with Endogenous Human Capital|This paper uses a model with overlapping generations to demonstrate that human capital accumulation can potentially attenuate factor price movements in response to birth rate shocks. Specifically, we show that if education spending per child is inversely related to the size of the generation, then there will be less movement in factor prices in response to the relative size of each generation. The degree of this attenuation effect will depend on the effectiveness of education spending in producing human capital. We also demonstrate that this attenuation effect tends to concentrate generational consumption risk around the generation subject to the birth rate shock. In a limiting case, we show that an i.i.d birth rate shock translates into an i.i.d. generational consumption shock. In other words, each generation bears all of the risk associated with their own demographic uncertainty. As a final exercise, we demonstrate that if the tax rate funding education spending varies with the size of the generation rather than education spending per child, then human capital does not influence the dynamic behavior of the economy in response to a birth rate shock.
J11|A Tale of Two Academic Tracks|Given asymmetric information, this paper explores the need for non-tenure-track jobs in academia alongside the usual tenure-track positions. It also explains the coexistence of these two types of jobs in research universities as an equilibrium phenomenon. The increased effort needed to produce research, accompanied by imprecisions in the academic editorial process, explains the recent increasing trend in the share of non-tenure-track jobs in academia as well as the widening wage gap between tenure-track and non-tenure-track academics.
J11|Demographic change and the European income distribution|Abstract This paper assesses the effect of key demographic changes (population ageing and increasing educational attainment) that are expected by 2030 on the income distribution in the EU-27 and examines the potential of tax-benefit systems to counterbalance negative developments. Theory predicts that population ageing should increase income inequality, while the effect of upskilling is more ambiguous. Tax-benefit systems may stabilize these expected changes though this is largely an empirical question given their typically complex nature. We use a decomposition technique to isolate the effect of projected demographic change on income inequality and poverty from the reaction of the labor market to this demographic change through wage adjustments. Our results show that demographic change is likely to lead to increasing inequality while related wage adjustments work mainly in the opposite direction. Changes to projected relative poverty are minimal for most countries. With a few exceptions, EU tax-benefit systems are able to absorb most of projected increase in market income inequality.
J11|The Labor Market Effects of Immigration Enforcement|This paper examines the effects of reducing the supply of low-skilled immigrant workers on the labor market outcomes of domestic workers. We use temporal and geographic variation in the introduction of Secure Communities (SC), a county-based immigration enforcement policy, combined with data over 2005-2014 from the American Community Survey to estimate a difference-in-difference model with geographic and time fixed effects. We find evidence that SC had a negative impact on the employment of low-skilled non-citizen workers, who are likely to be directly affected by the policy. Importantly, we also find that SC negatively impacted the employment of citizens working in middle to high-skill occupations. This is the first paper to provide quasi-experimental evidence on the labor market effects of immigration enforcement policies on citizens across the occupational skill distribution, which is of paramount importance given the current immigration policy debates.
J11|Bismarck’s Health Insurance and the Mortality Decline|We investigate the impact on mortality of the world’s first compulsory health insurance, established by Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor of the German Empire, in 1884. Employing a multi-layered empirical setup, we draw on international comparisons and difference-in-differences strategies using Prussian administrative panel data to exploit differences in eligibility for insurance across occupations. All approaches yield a consistent pattern suggesting that Bismarck’s Health Insurance generated a significant mortality reduction. The results are largely driven by a decline of deaths from infectious diseases. We present prima facie evidence that diffusion of new hygiene knowledge through physicians was an important channel.Keywords: health insurance, mortality, demographic transition, Prussia JEL Classification: : I13, I18, N33, J11<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J11|Demography, Unemployment, Automation, and Digitalization: Implications for the Creation of (Decent) Jobs, 2010–2030|Globally, an estimated 734 million jobs will be required between 2010 and 2030 to accommodate recent and ongoing demographic shifts, account for plausible changes in labour force participation rates, and achieve target unemployment rates of at or below 4 percent for adults and at or below 8 percent for youth. The facts that i) most new jobs will be required in countries where “decent” jobs are less prevalent and ii) workers in many occupations are increasingly subject to risks of automation further compound the challenge of job creation, which is already quite sizable in historical perspective. Failure to create the jobs that are needed through 2030 would put currently operative social security systems under pressure and undermine efforts to guarantee the national social protection floors enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

J11|Changing Sex-Ratios among Immigrant Communities in the U.S|Marriage patterns of immigrants are an important indicator of the degree of immigrant integration into their host countries. Literature on the economics of the household has focused on the role of the sex-ratio as an important determining factor in marriage market outcomes. Therefore, it is important to understand if and how the sex-ratio has changed over time and the mechanisms that may drive that change. In this paper, we explore recent changes in the sex-ratio among immigrants to the United States. First, building upon previous research, we document the nongender neutral nature of declining immigration to the United States. We approach this study from two different dimensions to document some of the forces driving this change in the sex-ratio. The first approach, focusing on changes between birth cohorts, demonstrates that immigration is declining more quickly for men than it is for women, leading to a decrease in the sex-ratio from above 100 and thus bringing about more gender balanced migration. Second, we present results from an analysis of data on recently granted green cards, suggests that the sex-ratio among this population is increasing from below 100, also bringing about more gender-balance among immigrants.
J11|Health and Economic Growth: Reconciling the Micro and Macro Evidence|There are two prominent methods to assess the effects of health on economic growth. The first is based on the estimated returns on health by means of Mincer wage regressions that are aggregated to derive the macroeconomic effects of population health. The second approach is based on the estimation of a generalized aggregate production function that decomposes human capital into its different components, in particular, population health. While the overwhelming majority of studies based on both methods indicates a positive effect of health on economic growth, the size of the effect is still subject to intensive debate. We show that, after appropriately controlling for potential spillover effects of population health at the aggregate level, the point estimate of the macroeconomic effect of health is remarkably close to the one found by aggregating the microeconomic effects. Specifically, an increase in the adult survival rate of 10 percentage points is associated with a 9.1 percent increase in labor productivity. This effect is sizable and adds a strong argument for investments in population health over and above the direct welfare benefits of good health.
J11|Early Career Research Production in Economics: Does Mentoring Matter?|We assess the role played by advisory supervision on the early stage productivity of recent PhDs in economics using a tailor-made data set based on RePEc. After allowing for the potential effects of other relevant determinants, including gender and field of specialisation, we find as expected that both advisory quality and rank of the graduation institution are positively related to the academic productivity of graduates. However, students in top institutions do not benefit from working with the most productive academics, unless they become co-authors. For students in non-top institutions, being advised by the best academics is always associated with a higher research output. Possible explanations for this difference can be advising styles, with advisors in top-institutions devoting less time to their advisees unless they are co-authors, or a larger role of learning from peers, relative to advisors, in top-institutions.
J11|Migration restrictions and long-term regional development: evidence from large-scale expulsions of Germans after World War II|Migration restrictions are a hotly debated topic in the current refugee crisis in Europe. This paper investigates the long-term effect of a restrictive migration policy on regional development. The analysis is based on the large-scale expulsion of Germans from Central and Eastern Europe after World War II (WWII). Expellees were not allowed to resettle in the French occupation zone in the first years after the War while there was no such legislation in the other occupation zones (U.S.; U.K; Soviet Union). The temporary migration barrier had long-lasting consequences. In a nutshell, results of a Difference-in-Difference (DiD) analysis show that growth of population has been significantly lower in the long run, if a region was part of the French occupation zone. Even 60 years after the removal of the barrier the degree of agglomeration is still significantly lower in these areas. The paper discusses implications for the current refugee crisis.
J11|Long-run Economic, Budgetary and Fiscal Effects of Roma Integration Policies|Although, the need for an efficient Roma integration policy is growing in Europe, surprisingly little robust scientific evidence regarding potential policy costs and expected benefits of alternative policy options has supported the policy design and implementation so far. The present study attempts to narrow this evidence gap and aims to shed light on long-run economic, budgetary and fiscal effects of selected education and employment policies for the inclusion of the marginalised Roma in the EU. We employ a general equilibrium approach that allows us to assess not only the direct impact of alternative Roma integration policies but also to capture all induced feedback effects. Our simulation results suggest that, although Roma integration policies would be costly for the public budget, in the medium- to long-run, economic, budgetary and fiscal benefits may significantly outweigh short- to medium-run Roma integration costs. Depending on the integration policy scenario and the analysed country, the full repayment of the integration policy investment (positive net present value) may be achieved after 7 to 9 years. In terms of the GDP, employment and earnings, the universal basic income scenario may have the highest potential, particularly in the medium- to long-run.
J11|The Determinants of Population Growth: Literature review and empirical analysis|This report studies population dynamics in Europe. Its purpose is threefold. First, the report offers a literature review of the main drivers of population growth. Second, an empirical analysis is carried out in order to unveil the determinants of population growth in EU sub-regions (NUTS3 level) over the period 2000-2010. Spatial econometrics is employed to account for spatial dependence among neighbouring regions. Third, the existing evidence on the long-run relationship between economic and population growth is discussed, followed by an empirical assessment of the relationship between these two aggregates in Europe over the period 1960-2010. Time-series econometric tools are used for this analysis. The main findings of both the literature reviews and empirical analyses are discussed, along with their implications and future extensions.
J11|Fertility, Income Growth and Inflation|This paper sets an endogenous fertility model with human capital accumulation and monetary policy in a closed economy, with subsequent examination of how fertility, education investment for children, and the inflation rate change. Results of theoretical analysis indicate that the child allowance raises fertility and reduces educational investment. However, the effect of the subsidy for education investment on fertility and educational investment is ambiguous because of the closed economy. Because of the change of fertility and income growth, the inflation rate can be changed by the child care policy. An increase in monetary stock policy raises human capital growth because the physical capital accumulation is facilitated.
J11|Labor Market Inequality and Marital Segregation in East Asia|This study examines the effects of inequalities in male educational wages and gender-such as the gender wage gap and barriers for labor force participation of female workers-on the labor market. It considers the effects of social infrastructure or public goods on marital segregation in Japan, South Korea, Republic of China, and Taiwan. The theoretical hypothesis that Fernández et al. (2005) build is empirically analyzed using individual data from East Asian Social Survey. The estimation results suggest that wage and gender inequalities in the labor market, such as skill wage premiums for men and full-time rates for married women, significantly affect marital segregation. These results show that policies to decrease inequality in the parental generation can decrease future inequality.
J11|Black Employment Trends since the Great Recession|The Great Recession had a devastating impact on labor force participation and employment. This impact was not unlike other recessions, except in size. The recovery, however, has been unusual not so much for its sluggishness but for the unusual pattern of recovery in employment by race. The black employment-population ratio has increased since bottoming out in 2010, while the white employment-population ratio has remained flat. This paper examines trends in labor force participation and employment by race, sex, and age and determines that the explanation is a combination of an aging white population and an increase in labor force participation among younger black people. It estimates the likelihood of labor force participation and employment among young men and women to control for confounding factors (such as changes in educational characteristics) and decomposes the gaps among groups and the changes over time in labor force participation using a Oaxaca-Blinder-like technique for nonlinear estimations. Findings indicate that much smaller negative impacts of characteristics and greater returns to characteristics among young black men and women than among young white men and women explain the observed trends.
J11|The inherited inequality: How demographic aging and pension reforms can change the intergenerational transmission of wealth|The role of inherited wealth in modern economies has increasingly come under scrutiny. This study presents one of the first attempts to shed light on how demographic aging could shape this role. It shows that, in the absence of retirement annuities, or for a given level of annuitization, both increasing longevity and decreasing fertility should reduce the inherited share of total wealth in a given economy. Thus, aging is not likely to explain a recent surge in this share in some advanced economies. Shrinking retirement annuities, however could offset and potentially reverse these effects. The paper also shows that individual bequests will be more unequally distributed if aging is driven by a drop in fertility. In comparison, the effect of increasing longevity on their distribution is non-monotonic.
J11|Child Care and Human Development: Insights from Jewish History in Central and Eastern Europe, 1500-1930|"Economists growingly highlight the fundamental role that human capital formation, institutions, cultural transmission, and religious norms may each distinctively play in shaping health, knowledge, and wealth. We contribute to this debate by studying one of the most remarkable instances in which religious norms and child care practices had a major impact on demographic and economic patterns: the history of the Jews in central and eastern Europe from 1500 to 1930. After documenting that the Jewish population in Poland Lithuania increased at a strikingly high annual rate of 1.37 percent during this period, we investigate the engines of this exceptional growth. We show that while Jewish and non-Jewish birth rates were about the same, infant and child mortality among Jews was much lower and account for the main difference (70 percent) in Jewish versus non-Jewish natural population growth. Our contribution stems from documenting that Jewish families routinely adopted childcare practices that recent medical research has shown as enhancing infants' and children's well-being. These practices, deeply rooted in Talmudic rulings, account for the lower infant and child mortality among Jews, and in turn, for the higher Jewish population growth rate in eastern and central Europe between 1500 and 1930. The key insight of our work is that once Judaism became a ""literate religion,"" infant and child care, as well as enhancing offspring's' cognitive skills, became focal activities of Jewish households."
J11|Capital Flows in an Aging World|We investigate the importance of worldwide demographic evolutions in shaping capital flows across countries and over time. Our lifecycle model incorporates cross-country differences in fertility and longevity as well as differences in countries’ ability to borrow inter-temporally and across generations through social security. In this environment, global aging triggers uphill capital flows from emerging to advanced economies, while country-specific demographic evolutions reallocate capital towards countries aging more slowly. Our quantitative multi-country overlapping generations model explains a large fraction of long-term capital flows across advanced and emerging countries.
