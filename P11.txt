P11|Wirtschaftspolitik-Fehlorientierung des Westens nach 1989: Bankenkrise, Globalisierungs-Ordnungsdefizit und Desintegrationsdruck|Der Zerfall der sozialistischen Wirtschaftssysteme vollzog sich Ende der 1980er Jahre in den Ländern Osteuropas und der Sowjetunion, wobei osteuropäische EU-Länder einen ökonomischen Aufholprozess begonnen haben. 1991 hat aber der Westen teilweise keine vernünftigen Konsequenzen aus der beginnenden Systemtransformation gezogen und eine Phase geringer politischer Selbstdisziplin bei manchen westlichen Regierungen bzw. eine Expansion des Populismus - erklärbar unter Bezug auf Harry-Johnson-Ansätze und Identity Economics - begonnen. Die Transatlantische Bankenkrise ergab sich aus überzogener Bankenderegulierung in den USA und UK, die faktisch auch die Länder der Eurozone zur Bankenderegulierung brachte und sich absehbar wiederholen könnte; auch als Folge des BREXIT. Bei der Digitalisierung fehlt ein Ordnungsrahmen. Dessen Fehlen hat zu einer Art digitalem Sozialismus geführt – mit negativen Konsequenzen für Effizienz in der Marktwirtschaft und für die Demokratie. Mit dem Populismus in UK, dem strukturellen US-Populismus – inklusive Anti-Multilateralismus - und dem Anti-Liberalismus in Teilen der EU(27) steht der Westen vor einer Abstiegs- und die EU vor einer politischen Spannungsphase; eine sinnvolle Reformagenda wäre eine Stabilisierungschance für die EU, wird aber teilweise blockiert, während zugleich verfrühte Vergemeinschaftung, etwa bei Einlagensicherung, droht. Der US-Sachverständigenrat unter Trump sieht die USA wohlfahrtsmäßig vor Nordeuropa, was eine Fehlsicht ist.
P11|Financial Crises and Liberalization: Progress or Reversals?|Financial crisis can trigger policy reversals, i.e. they can lead to a process of re- regulation of financial markets. Using a recent comprehensive dataset on financial liberalization across 94 countries for the period between 1973 and 2015, we formally test the validity of this prediction for the member states of the European Union as well as for a global sample. We contribute by (a) using a new up-to-date dataset of reforms and crises and (b) subjecting it to a combination of difference-in-differences and local projection estimations. In the global sample, our findings consistently confirm that crises lead to a reversal of liberal reforms, suggesting that governments react to crises by re-regulating financial markets. However, in a dynamic setting with impulse-responses, we also find that these new regulations are only temporary and a liberalization process restarts a few years after a financial crisis. One decade later, financial markets have returned to their pre-crisis level of liberalization. In the EU sample, however, we do not find sufficient evidence to support these observations.

P11|Timing of Government Intervention and the Multiple Equilibria of Currency Crisis|This paper examines how currency crisis is affected by different timing of government intervention in the currency market. Since the seminal paper of Morris and Shin (1998), which shows that the self-fulfilling crisis can be avoided when noisy signals are considered, the conditions for the multiple equilibria have been widely studied. We contribute the studies by focusing on the timing of government intervention in the currency market. When the government intervenes in the market as a first mover, while speculators move as a second mover, the unique equilibrium of the currency market collapses since speculators can successfully coordinate after observing the government?s decisions. If the government moves as a second mover as in the case of Morris and Shin (1998), the unique equilibrium exists with noisy signals. When the government and speculators move simultaneously, there is no equilibrium with noisy information while there might be a unique equilibrium with perfect information. The results implicate that rash government intervention as a first mover might aggravate the currency crisis since the speculators have bigger opportunity for speculative coordination after observing the government?s action. The equilibria are also defined when the government intervention occurs in a repeated fashion, and the implications are discussed.
P11|A new societal contract|"This paper argues that the traditional societal contract that underlies the market economy has run its course and needs to be replaced by a new contract, based on a new conception of the ""empowering economy."" Whereas different societal contracts are relevant to different societies, there must be some features that all societal contracts will have in common, in order to address some basic human needs that every thriving society must satisfy and to promote popular approval for multilateral agreements to address multilateral problems. The paper proposes a new societal contract that promotes three building blocks of economic policies: (1) automatic stabilizers that reduce inequalities of economic power, (2) policies that focus not just on material prosperity, but also on personal and social empowerment and (3) policies that develop the human capabilities of cooperation and innovation."
P11|Marx, the Predisposition to Reject Markets and Private Property, and Attractive Alternatives to Capitalism|Ever since capitalism came to be recognized as a new economic system, its principal institutions of private property and markets have had vociferous critics, of whom none was more wide-ranging and influential than Karl Marx. Marx claimed that not only were private property and markets critical to creating an ideological patina of freedom behind which, as in slavery and feudalism, a small class extracted from the mass of producers practically all output above that necessary for bare subsistence, they were also corrupting. Yet Marx recognized that capitalism, unlike earlier exploitative systems, was radically dynamic, producing unprecedented wealth, while transforming not only all it inherited from the past, but also its own nature so as to eventually empower even the producers, who he believed would abandon these capitalist institutions. This article claims Marx was correct in identifying the core problem of capitalism to be its extreme inequality in the ownership and control of the means of production, but that finding fault with private property and markets has been a mistake that has impeded the generation of an attractive and viable alternative to capitalism. It concludes with an outline of an alternative which would eliminate the core problem of exploitation due to unequal ownership and control of the means of production, while retaining roles for private property and markets. It would entail two components: Guaranteed employment at living wages and democratic worker control of firms.
P11|Pareto-improving structural reforms|Economists recommend to partly redistribute gains to losers from a structural reform, which in many cases may be required for making the reform politically viable. However, taxation is distortionary. Then, it is unclear that compensatory transfers can support a Pareto-improving reform. This paper provides sufficient conditions for this to occur, despite tax distortions. I consider an economy where workers have sector-specific skills and some sectors are regulated by a price floor. Transfers have to be financed by proportional taxation on firm's revenues or, equivalently, labor income. Labor supply is elastic to net post-tax real wages, and hence reduced by taxation. In a setting where preferences are isolelastic, deregulation is implementable in a Pareto-improving way through compensatory lump-sum transfers, despite that these are financed by distortionary taxes. In a more general setting, there always exist Pareto-improving reforms but they may involve tightening regulation for some goods. I provide sufficient conditions for deregulation, i.e. a general reduction in price floors, to be Pareto-improving. They imply that demand cross-price elasticities should not be too large and that the reform should not be too unbalanced. Finally, I consider counter-examples where some people earn rents associated with informational or institutional frictions. In such situations, Pareto improvements are unlikely. If losers have veto power, the reform may only be supported by a minority of people. Broadening reform scope is especially useful to raise its political support when its impact is uneven across consumers.

P11|Entrepreneurship, institutional economics, and economic growth: an ecosystem perspective|Abstract We analyze conceptually and in an empirical counterpart the relationship between economic growth, factor inputs, institutions, and entrepreneurship. In particular, we investigate whether entrepreneurship and institutions, in combination in an ecosystem, can be viewed as a “missing link” in an aggregate production function analysis of cross-country differences in economic growth. To do this, we build on the concept of National Systems of Entrepreneurship (NSE) as resource allocation systems that combine institutions and human agency into an interdependent system of complementarities. We explore the empirical relevance of these ideas using data from a representative global survey and institutional sources for 46 countries over the period 2002–2011. We find support for the role of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in economic growth.
P11|Do voters dislike liberalizing reforms? New evidence using data on satisfaction with democracy|Since the early 1980s a wave of liberalizing reforms has swept over the world. While the stated motivation for these reforms has usually been to increase economic efficiency, some critics have instead inferred ulterior motives and a desire to enrich certain (already rich) people at the expense of others. This critique, coupled with the claim that many of the reforms have been undertaken during different crises so as to bypass potential opponents, suggests that people will dislike the reforms and even be less satisfied with democracy as such. We test this hypothesis empirically, using panel data from 30 European countries in the period 1993–2015. The dependent variable is the average satisfaction with democracy, while the reform measures are constructed as distinct changes in four policy areas: government size, the rule of law, openness and regulation. Our results indicate that while reforms of government size are not robustly related to satisfaction with democracy, reforms of the other three kinds are – and in a way that runs counter to the anti-liberalization claims. Reforms that reduce economic freedom are generally related to satisfaction with democracy in a negative way, while reforms that increase economic freedom are positively associated with satisfaction with democracy. Voters also react more negatively to left-wing governments introducing reforms that de-liberalize. It thus seems as if the hypothesis of a general negative reaction towards liberalizing reforms taking the form of reduced satisfaction with democracy does not stand up to empirical scrutiny, at least not in our European sample.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P11|Financial and Institutional Reforms for an Entrepreneurial Society|Abstract In this paper, we introduce the special issue on Financial and Institutional Reforms for an Entrepreneurial Society in Europe. There are many reasons for Europe to want to make the transition to a more Entrepreneurial Society. And for decades now, policy makers are trying to bring that transition about with variations on the “educate, deregulate and finance” approach to entrepreneurship. We argue that more fundamental reforms are required to improve the entrepreneurial ecosystem and bring about this transition. We then discuss the 12 contributions that pertain to five different facets of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. The first two papers address the most fundamental institutional foundations of the ecosystem. The next three papers discuss the (lack of) access to knowledge and incentives to start innovative entrepreneurial ventures. That is followed by three papers that focus on the institutions that (fail to) channel financial resources to such ventures and two papers that analyze the relevance of labor market institutions. The special issue concludes with two papers investigating how the interplay of institutions and productive entrepreneurship results in economic growth.
P11|Economic Integration and State Capacity: Evidence from the Eastern Enlargement of the European Union|We investigate whether and how economic integration increases state capacity. This important relationship has not been studied in detail so far. We put together a conceptual framework to guide our analysis that highlights what we call the Montesquieu, Weber and Smith channels. Each of these correspond to a series of mechanisms in three distinct institutional arenas: judiciary, bureaucracy, and competition policy. To test our framework, we introduce a new panel of institutional reform measures which allow us to investigate how changes in these three arenas interact with each other and what sequence of changes yields increase in state capacity. The yearly data set covers all the 17 countries that became candidates to join the European Union (EU) after the 1995 enlargement. Our main finding is that the relationship between bureaucratic independence and judiciary capacity seems to be the key engine of the process of state capacity building engendered by the prospect of EU membership. Deep integration, we find, can induce broad institutional change by providing incentives for simultaneous change in core state institutions. Yet early and abrupt removal of external anchors might generate significant backsliding, or reversals, in domestic institutional change.
P11|Федеральное Агенство Развития. Оно Необходимо Для Разработки И Реализации Успешных Стратегий<BR>[Federal development agency. It is necessary to design and implement successful strategies]|It is shown that in the success of catching-up development, an important role was played by special structures - general development agencies- that coordinated the activities of ministries and offices. The functions of such agencies are considered, the main tasks that the similar Russian Federal Development Agency (FDR) should solve, are described. The creation in late 2016 of the Department of Project Activities of the Government Office of the Russian Federation can be considered as the first stage of the creation of FDR. A number of further steps are proposed for its formation.
P11|К Общей Теории Социально-Экономического Развития<BR>[Towards a general theory of social and economic development: evolution of coordination mechanisms]|"A new approach to understanding social and economic development is proposed, based on consideration of the evolution of coordination mechanisms. The work consists of two parts. In the first part, a critical analysis of four recently proposed theories of social development, focusing on geographical, institutional or cultural factors, is given. These theories have greatly enriched our understanding of the evolution of society, however, as analysis shows, none of them provides a satisfactory description of the driving forces and mechanisms of this evolution; the main reason is rooted in their common shortcoming - monocausality. It is proposed to distinguish between two types of development, catching up and leading. The basic ideas of the theory of catching-up development are presented. This approach makes it possible to explain the phenomenon of the ""economic miracle"" as a result of mutually conditioned changes in culture, institutions, technological progress and well-being in the context of interaction of competition, power and collaboration mechanisms. The second part is devoted to the theory of leading socioeconomic development. . It is shown how in Western Europe, as a result of the interaction of the above four factors, specific forms and combinations of the three main mechanisms of coordination - competition, power and cooperation - emerged at each stage of evolution. I emphasize the importance of ideology and the phenomenon of technical progress in the formation of institutions of economic and political competition that contributed to the creation of the welfare state. These changes and economic growth created the conditions for further transformation of civil culture: increasing levels of trust, tolerance, altruism and cosmopolitanism, expanding the planned horizon. The decrease in the level of coercion built into the mechanisms of power and competition are demonstrated as well as the expansion of the role of collaboration. A hypothesis is advanced that the speed of this process depends on geographical factors. The idea of welfare world is discussed."
P11|Indonesian Business Environment - VOC Model and Local Culture|Our presentation focuses on the structure of Indonesian political economy and how local form of capitalism is underpinned by social relations and culture. Specifically, in our research, we: i) analyze Indonesian business environment through the Varieties of Capitalism (henceforth VOC) model as developed by Hall and Soskice, ii) look into the reform and dynamic changes of Indonesian business environment following 1997 crisis in East Asia through the lens of VOC model, and iii) examine how Indonesian form of capitalism is underpinned by local culture by the use of GLOBE Project and Hofstede dimensions of culture. Our findings suggest that the case of Indonesia can be presented as a special type of a coordinated market economy driven by local culture with some aspects of liberal market economy, which are, to a large extent, imported from the outside. Our research also shows that the influence of international business environment and globalization combined with post-1997-crisis reform push Indonesian economy further towards modes of coordination more typical for liberal market economies, causing tensions among various actors of local political economy. Considering limited body of literature on the topic, the main contributions of our research is twofold. First, to study Indonesian form of capitalism, we apply a VOC model and connect local form of capitalism with socio-cultural characteristics of the country. Second, we apply VOC model to look at the interplay between domestic forces shaping local political economy and the influence of international environment and globalization largely reflecting (neo)liberal view of economic and business relations.

P11|Aristotle vs. Plato: The distributive origins of the Cold War|Competing definitions of justice in Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Politics indicate the existence of two distinct economic systems with different normative priorities. The three-class society of the Platonic economy (guardians, auxiliaries, producers) gives rise to guardians who by virtue are expected to enforce output targets on producers directly or through auxiliaries. The three-class society of the Aristotelian economy (rich, middle, poor) facilitates the emergence of different ruling coalitions and compensates efficiency losses of vertical production processes with political gains derived from representative governance. In the Aristotelian economy, the middle class is better off than in the Platonic economy (auxiliaries), because a just society (polity) is achieved under its rule. I argue that the equilibrium solutions of the Platonic and Aristotelian systems provide the normative foundations for the distinction between plan and market.
P11|When do countries implement structural reforms?|The objective of this paper is to investigate which factors macroeconomic, policy‐related or institutional ‐ foster the implementation of structural reforms. To this objective, we look at episodes of structural reforms over three decades across 40 OECD and EU countries and link them to such factors. Our results suggest that structural reforms implementation is more likely during deep recessions and when unemployment rates are high. Moreover, the further distant from best practices, the more likely a country implements reforms. External pressures, such as being subject to a financial assistance programme, or being part of the EU Single Market facilitated pro‐competitive reforms. If at all, low interest rates tend to promote rather than discourage structural reforms, while there seems no clear link between fiscal policy and reforms. Moreover, reforms in product markets tend to increase the likelihood of labour market reforms following suit. Many robustness checks have been carried out which confirm our main results.

P11|East Asian Financial and Economic Development|Japan, an isolated, backward country in the 1860s, industrialized rapidly to become a major industrial power by the 1930s. South Korea, among the world’s poorest countries in the 1960s, joined the ranks of First World economies in little over a single generation. China now seems poised to follow a similar trajectory. All three cases highlight the importance of marginalized traditional elites, intensive early investment in education, a degree of economic openness, free markets, equity financing, early-stage coordination of firms in diverse industries via arrangements such as business groups, and political institutions capable of curbing the power of families grown wealthy in early-stage rapid development to make way for prosperity sustained by efficient resource allocation to high-productivity firms.
P11|Financialization and industrial policies in Japan and Korea: Evolving institutional complementarities and loss of state capabilities|The purpose of this article is to analyze the revival of industrial policies from the late 2000s in Japan and Korea and their limitations. Our approach has two major characteristics. First, we adopt the perspective of historical institutionalism to focus on the relation between IPs and financial systems and study their evolution over the last 40 years. Second, by mobilizing the concepts of institutional complementarities and hierarchy, we discuss the limits of this revival in a context of liberalized financial systems, to which government entities in charge of industrial policies have contributed. Our major result is that, in the context of financialization, past complementarities of the developmental state have weakened and contradictions have arisen. It resulted in a restructuration of state capabilities to design and implement industrial policies, and to its inability to subordinate finance to its goals, despite the discourses and ambitions of governments. However, and this is our second result, comparison between Japan and Korea also allows us to identify some significant differences in the initial institutional arrangements and in the process of institutional change, which are analyzed as sources of greater state capabilities in Korea than in Japan in the current period.
P11|Ethnographic Agency Relationship in The Context of Budget: Portrait of Local Wisdom Harmonization in Bali Pakraman Village|"""Objective – This study aims to explore the interaction between principal and agent relationship in traditional villages in the context of the budget. Also, this study shows the importance of local wisdom as a guide and as a source of knowledge, to fill and form the pattern of an agency relationship in the context of a more harmonious budget. Methodology/Technique – The research method used is ethnography. Ethnography is the science of writing about race, using a more contemporary language. Ethnography can provide detailed information on the daily activities of a culture in a group. Therefore, it could make detailed notes about the behavior and beliefs of the group from time to time. Findings – This study found that the interaction between principal and agent in traditional villages in the context of the budget have using local wisdom as a guide and as a source of knowledge. Balinese local wisdom forms the pattern of an agency relationship in the frame of a harmonious budget. The characteristics of Bali is very obvious from Hindu religion, customs, and culture. All are united in a harmonious atmosphere, which cannot be separated from the participation of all the components, as well as cultural heritage. The principle of people unity has been there long before Indonesia's independence, namely Pakraman village. Novelty – This study has explored the myth and value of traditional village in Bali by using ethnography methodology, which is taken the deep value of Bali tradition."""
P11|The Market‐Promoting and Market‐Preserving Role of Social Trust in Reforms of Policies and Institutions|Social trust has been identified as a catalyst for reforms. We take the literature further in two ways. First, we analyze mechanisms through which social trust enables liberalizing reforms—by overcoming obstacles in the political process (stemming from ideology, ideological fractionalization, coalition government, minority government, and legislature‐seat instability). Second, we define reforms as distinct changes in the quality of the legal institutions and in the scope of regulation and separate reforms that increase economic freedom in these two areas from reforms that decrease it. We study separately how social trust, interacted with the different types of political hindrances, affects the probability of reforms. We find a dual role of social trust in the political process—facilitating liberalizing reforms and making deliberalizing ones more difficult. This suggests that trust does not make agreement on any reform more probable—the content of the reform is crucial.
P11|Toothless Reforms? The Remarkable Stability of Female Labor Force Participation in a Top-Reforming Country|Low Female Labor Force Participation (FLFP) constitutes a foregone opportunity at both the macro and at the micro levels, potentially increasing the vulnerability of households and lowering the long-run development perspectives of a country. Most international organizations and national policy makers see low FLFP as a serious issue that needs to be addressed by adopting appropriate policies. We investigate the possible reasons of the remarkable stability of FLFP in a top-reforming upper-middle income country. Our goal is to in disentangle the different forces at work and to draw useful lessons for the design of participation-enhancing policies. Using data from a nationally representative Household Survey covering the period 2003-2015, we employ Blinder-Oaxaca (Blinder, 1973 and Oaxaca, 1973) type decomposition to decompose changes over time in FLFP levels into parts that are due to changes in observable factors versus changes in the strength of impact of these factors. This allows us to identify possible shifters of the FLFP rate and propose areas of special interest for policy making. We show that the stability of FLFP in Georgia during the period 2003-2013 is due to offsetting socio-economic changes taking place in the country, and that the increase in the last period covered by our dataset – 2013-2015 – can be attributed to the emergence of new labor opportunities for women. We conclude that, while useful, supply-side economic reforms are not sufficient to increase FLFP and need to be complemented by demand-side policies aiming at creating more and better work opportunities for women.
P11|Mexican 2014 Strategy That Promotes Business Formality, Employment Generation, Financing, Growth And Competitiveness , Reforma Fiscal Mexicana 2014 Estrategia Que Fomenta La Formalidad Empresarial, Generacion De Empleo, Financiamiento, Crecimiento Y Competitividad|This research addresses the issue of Fiscal reform in 2014. We examine an administrative strategy adopted by the Executive federal power to foster business formation, generation of employment, access to financing, growth and business competitiveness. For several decades in Mexico, millions of small business owners have conducted economic activities in an irregular way. The operate without registering to the fiscal register or expressing, revenues, costs, home, workers. They have generally not paid taxes. In response to this situation, the Mexican Government from the year 2014 unveiled a fiscal reform. This reform encourages these merchants to sign up voluntarily to the fiscal register, which gives them a reduction of taxes and administrative facilities. We considered 300 small businesses in Mexicali, Baja California. Research was carried out in laws, decrees, journals and articles by specialists. In addition, we designed and a questionnaire and applied it to merchants. We wished to know if they consider tax reform strategy, which has fostered formality, employment, funding, growth and competitiveness. The information was processed using descriptive statistics, the results allowed to identify effect of the tax reform and make the relevant recommendations
P11|Understanding Social Market Economy, Francesco Forte and His Interpretation|Abstract The social thought which emerges from Francesco Forte’s economic writings proves to be mainly inspired by methodological individualism, though interpreted through a peculiar “personalistic” key. We will analyze the peculiar traits of his thought and the specific contribution that Forte gave to the understanding of a specific economic theory based on the doctrine of “Ordoliberalism” or the “Freiburg School.” In our work, we will show how Forte proposes an interpretation of that doctrine, according to two of his main points of reference in economic and philosophical thought: Luigi Einaudi and Antonio Rosmini Serbati. Finally, we will present an important aspect of Forte’s work: his institutional analysis in the light of the particular civil philosophy expressed by Christian social teaching.
P11|Dynamic coordinating non-equilibrium|Abstract Neo-Walrasian conceptualizations and DSGE models are incompatible with the emergence of coordination and discoordination in economic activity. While many conceptualizations stemming from the Austrian tradition are generally consistent with these fundamental problems, their process driven approach is hampered by the use of equilibrium constructs. This paper argues for the adoption of formal models that avoid this problem by addressing the following questions. Why should Austrian macroeconomists model? Where do models fit in with respect to pure and applied theory? How to model without equilibrium? To answer this final question I present a structure that aids in the construction and communication of such models.
P11|The European Railway Sectors: Understanding and Assessing Change|This paper aims at explaining and assessing the process of change that European railway sectors have experienced over the last decades. It has been organized in two parts: the first part (section 2) explains change and the second part (section 3) empirically assesses change. In the first part we argue that the roots of this change process date back to the 1950s when, because of competitiveness reasons, the market share of most European railways began to decrease compared to other transport modes. Since national reformers ascribed these performance shortcomings to the traditional organization of the railway sector which was that of vertically-integrated state- owned monopoly. Therefore, between the 1970s and 1980s many governments in Europe adopted reforms that tried to inject competition in national railway sectors by supporting liberalization policies. Then, since early-1990s the European Commission has released a number of regulatory instruments aimed at pursuing three main goals: 1) liberalization of the rail services; 2) unbundling of infrastructure and service level, and 3) creation of the common transport market. The empirical analysis conducted in the second part of this paper suggests that state-controlled structures still play a crucial role in the management and performance of national railway industries as lower service prices are associated with greater presence of the state in the sector. Results show that liberalization-friendly regulation does not necessarily benefit railway service consumers since increased levels of market access, unbundling and privatization are not necessarily associated with lower prices. Our analysis shows that the long-lasting transition from state-owned monopolies to competitive market arrangements in the railway sectors provided mitigated results. We conclude this paper by launching a reflection on the future developments of railways in Europe.
P11|East Asian Financial and Economic Development|Japan, an isolated, backward country in the 1860s, industrialized rapidly to become a major industrial power by the 1930s. South Korea, among the worldâ€™s poorest countries in the 1960s,joined the ranks of First World economies in little over a single generation. China now seems poised to follow a similar trajectory. All three cases highlight the importance of marginalized traditional elites, intensive early investment in education, a degree of economic openness, free markets, equity financing, early-stage coordination of firms in diverse industries via arrangements such as business groups, and political institutions capable of curbing the power of families grown wealthy in early-stage rapid development to make way for prosperity sustained by efficient resource allocation to high-productivity firms.
P11|Planning and opportunism|The paper analyzes the occurrence of opportunistic behaviour opportunities in the planning processes. The following types of planning are distinguished: self-planning, collective planning, planning on behalf (or by contract), and directive (or prescriptive) planning. It is shown that any type of it excluding self-planning generates incentives to opportunistic behavior. Within this framework, two popular approaches in the planning theory are analyzed: participative planning and communicative one; it is shown that they are open to opportunism too. Basing on this analysis, the spheres of economy where government planning can be more efficient than market coordination mechanism are outlined.
P11|Political economy of trade protection and liberalization: in search of agency-based and holistic framework of policy change|The paper provides comprehensive review of alternative explanations of the trade policy formation, associated rise of trade protectionism, and difficulties of trade liberalisation. Normative economic, systemic, public interest, political, institutional and constitutional economic theories of trade policy, together with political science models of trade cooperation are considered. The paper shows that current research in the area tends to accentuate the factors that entrench trade protectionism, while paying insufficient attention to the role of agency, policy dynamics and informal institutions that may bring in trade liberalisation. Requirements for holistic and dynamic analysis of trade policy are outlined.
P11|Effect of welfare and economic performance on good governance outcomes in Pakistan|The paper undertakes a detailed analysis of economic progress and welfare measures in determining good governance outcomes in Pakistan. There is evidence that inequality stifles the capacity of political, economic and social governance by creating an elite class that protect their economic and political interests and undertake legislation primarily to the benefit of ruling elites. Furthermore our results also suggest that economic development empower the economically and socially excluded groups of the society and give them more voice in favor of policies that are representative of the issues like accountability against corruption or favoritism.
P11|Globalization, political orientation and wage inequality: From Donald Trump’s election to Angela Merkal’s re-election|The recent election results in US, Germany, Japan and China and vote for BRIXIT in Britian suggest that political outcomes increasingly relate to the economic, political and social orientation in both developed and developing countries. Countries that have not promoted social and economic harmony in the country - democracy eventually puts the pressure through the discontent local polity resulting in election outcomes similar to US presidential elections in 2016. To avoid anti-globalization feelings among local population and its negative outcomes, improving political orientation towards greater participation of local polity and investments in education in developing countries would result in more equality. The research is applicable to countries like India, China, Pakistan, Argentina, Sub-Saharan Africa who have all liberalised but still need to draw lessons from East Asia for their Industrialisation and Growth Promotion with early emphasis on Social and Institutional Development.
P11|Economic Crises and Globalisation as Drivers of Pension Privatisation: an Empirical Analysis|Pension systems are core institutional arrangements that are expected to be stable and reliable over consecutive generations. Nevertheless, reforms in pension provision intensified over the past decades, with several countries opting for privatisation of their pension system. We ask which factors lead governments to privatise pension systems and focus on economic crises and different facets of increased global pressures. We conduct duration analyses on a cross-section of nearly 100 economies among which 28 privatise their pension system between 1981 and 2012. Consistent with the crisis-begets-reform hypothesis, we find that severe economic crises speed up reform implementation. Likewise, high growth in economic and political globalisation is conducive for pension privatisation. These findings are robust to a variety of alternations in the empirical methodology.
P11|Optimal adjustment paths in a monetary union|What to do when a country experiences a sudden stop in capital inflows and has to adjust externally? Sticky wages make adjustment to an external imbalance more difficult within a monetary union. Periods of high unemployment are usually necessary to achieve the required real depreciation (internal devaluation). Gradual adjustment is usually recommended to distribute the output and employment cost over time. But a gradual adjustment also implies that current account deficits persist for longer, leading to higher debt, and higher debt-service costs. The optimal path of price and wage adjustment thus involves a trade-off between the pain (unemployment) and the gain (lower debt) from adjustment. A simple model shows the determinants of the optimal path in terms of deeper parameters, such as the slope of the Phillips curve and the degree of openness. The rules for the resolution of future crises within the euro area should take this into account. Gradual adjustment is not always the optimal choice, and sometimes the alternative path of introducing abrupt changes produces the desired results.
P11|State Capacity and Economic Integration: Evidence from the Eastern Enlargement|We study whether and how economic integration increases state capacity. Despite the recent surge in economist’s interest in state capacity, there remains a lack of theory-based detailed empirical measures. This paper introduces a new panel of institutional reform measures. We present a political economy framework highlighting the Montesquieu, Weber and Smith channels and yielding hypotheses about the judiciary, bureaucracy, and competition policy. Our main finding is that the relationship between bureaucratic independence and judiciary capacity seems to be the main engine of the process of state capacity building engendered by the prospect of European Union membership.
P11|Age of politicians and Regulatory Reform|This article discusses the relationship between the identity of the rulers of the executive and reform. Thus, we enrich the literature on the determinants of reform and the result of the executive. This is a new and very important literature, as these are the reforms that allow progress. We use a sample of 141 countries over the period 2003-2013 to investigate the link between the age of politicians and regulatory reforms. We created an ad hoc database for the age of politicians and for reform, we use micro-reform data. An econometric model is used to discover if the age of a political leader in office can be a driving force that is more or less likely to bring about regulatory reforms. Our results suggest that the age of politicians has a positive incidence on the reform that they bring about. The results are robust for the reform measures and techniques used. The results also indicate that older politicians implement more reforms than the young ones. More precisely, the paper found that older politicians who are in their sixties bring about the most regulatory reforms than politicians of any other age ranges.
P11|Les transformations de la finance chinoise|Depuis 2014, les autorités chinoises ont pris la mesure des déséquilibres financiers et entrepris de les réduire. Le poids du shadow banking dans le total du financement de l’économie a baissé. Les surcapacités de production ont détérioré la qualité des crédits, mais, pour y faire face, le gouvernement a mis en place une démarche de sortie des créances douteuses des bilans bancaires sur trois ans, la banque centrale ayant au préalable estimé que le risque systémique était faible. Le développement des marchés obligataires est l’un des pivots de la transformation en cours de la finance chinoise en vue des deux grands objectifs de la réforme : devenir leader dans la transition vers l’économie verte et proposer un modèle d’intégration internationale par le financement à long terme des infrastructures.
P11|China’s 13th Five-Year Plan. In Pursuit of a “Moderately Prosperous Society”|Chinese reform is an endogenous process that feeds on its own contradictions, and creates its own way through stages, interspersed by crises that are part of the reform. The Directives paper issued by the central committee of the CCP at its third plenum in November 2013 is a theoretical compendium of a strategic view of the reform. The 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020), adopted in March 2016 by the People’s National Assembly of China, is the most articulated document to date and explains the objectives and their implementation over the next five years. In order to understand the Plan, this paper focuses on six paramount objectives from this long and detailed document: shift from capital accumulation-led growth to innovation-led growth; integrated urban-rural development; green development; inclusive development; finance and State-owned Enterprise-(SOE) reform; opening up to the world. The process of reform is acknowledged to be under way. The paper analyzes the objectives identified and their content and it highlights their interdependencies to underline the comprehensive “new normal” strategy. Quantitative targets: • Bottom line: 6.5% annual average growth GDP from 2016 to 2020 to double 2010 GDP per capita. • R&D expenditure: 2.5% GDP in 2020 from 2.1% in 2015. • Urbanization rate: 60% of population in 2020 from 56.1% in 2015. • Green development: by 2020 to reduce emissions per unit of GDP by 40, to 45% compared to 2005 levels. Increase the share of non-fossil fuel energy to 15% by 2020. • Social welfare: lift 55.75 million more people out of poverty by 2020. One-child limit increased to two children per couple. Extend coverage of urban welfare services to all residents. • Financial targets: merge 106 SOEs under central government ownership into 40 world-class groups in strategic industries. Achieve full Yuan convertibility by 2020.
P11|State capacity, redistributive compensation and the political economy of economic policy reform|If governments can compensate “losers” from large-scale economic reform, such as trade liberalization, by redistributing some of the “winners'” gains, then any potentially Pareto-improving reform should be implemented. However, in many economies, the state's capacity to identify and tax winners is limited. How do such limitations impact the adoption of reforms? We show that for reforms where the distribution of winners and losers is exogenously given, higher state capacity unambiguously helps the adoption of Pareto-improving reforms. However, for reforms which require individual investment decisions by potential winners, better state capacity may not always translate into higher political support for reform.
P11|How to Get Out of the Multiple Crisis? Contours of a Critical Theory of Social-Ecological Transformation|The concept of transformation has become a buzzword within the last few years. This has to do, first, with the ever broader recognition of the profound character of the environmental crisis, secondly, with increasingly obvious limits to existing forms of (global) environmental governance, thirdly, with the emergence of other dimensions of the crisis since 2008 and, fourthly, with intensified debates about required profound social change, especially of societal nature relations. However, the term transformation itself is contested. It largely depends on theoretical assumptions as well as the plausibility and applicability of the arguments which are made. In this paper, a historical-materialist approach to social-ecological transformation is outlined by referring to a theoretically sophisticated understanding of 'subject(s)' of transformation as well as the 'object(s)' of what is to be transformed. Theoretical concepts like the capitalist mode of production, regulation and hegemony, a critical understanding of the state and governance as well as the term societal nature relations are key. Such a perspective contributes to a more sophisticated understanding of the obstacles and requirements of real-world transformation. Finally, the argument has implications for visions and strategies, i.e., an emancipatory and democratic shaping of social relations and societal nature relations.
P11|Developmental states in the 21st century - analytical structure of a new approach|The financial and economic crisis of 2008-9 and the following difficulties have brought back the analysis of active state involvement in the economy to the research agenda of economists, and a new renaissance of developmental state (DS) approach can be observed. The aim of our paper is to draw up a new approach of DS in the twenty-first century by reviewing most recent literature. In our analysis we argue that to construct a new DS concept one has to break up with the historical and geographical limitation of the classic DS paradigm and the ideological debate around it. Meanwhile one has to build upon most recent results of new institutional, political and development economics’ analysis as well as the more than half century long experiences of classic DS. While presenting the structure and main elements of the new DS approach we aim to highlight those questions and areas of analysis, where consensus seems to emerge in literature.
P11|Planification: Potential and role in XXI century market economy|"The authors, basing on a critical analysis of the experience of planning during the 20th century in a number of countries of Europe and Asia, and also on the lessons from the economics of ""real socialism"", set out to substantiate their conclusions on the advisability of ""reloading"" this institution. The aim is to create planning mechanisms, suited to the new economy, that incorporate forecasting, projections, direct and indirect selective regulation and so forth into integral programs of economic development and that set a vector of development for particular limited spheres of what remains on the whole a market economy. New planning institutions presuppose a supersession of the forms of bureaucratic centralism and a reliance on network forms of organization of the subject and process of planning."

P11|Positive collaboration: Factors and mechanisms of evolution|This article proposes that two types of collaboration can be distinguished: a positive collaboration (not directed against third parties) and negative collaboration. I consider the hypothesis that in the process of social development, the transaction costs ratio of the three main types of coordination — competition, power, and collaboration — is changing in favor of the latter. The article examines the mechanisms that are responsible for the implementation of this tendency and attempts to explain its nonmonotonicity. It is shown that the strengthening role of positive collaboration is largely explained by cultural changes, including the enhancement of tolerance culture, spread of cosmopolitanism and altruism, and increase in the planning horizon as well as trust radius. I demonstrate the importance of the institutions that support positive collaboration in the process of catching-up development; it is shown that shock reforms could lead to the formation of negative collaboration mechanisms. A program of interdisciplinary research is outlined for the further development of these ideas.

P11|Институциональные Реформы И Гражданская Культура<BR>[Institutional Reforms and Civic Culture]|"The influence of civic culture is considered on the effective choice of the reform plan which is defined as a sequence of interim institutions that ""connects"" the initial institution with final, desirable for reformer. Accounting for prevailing values, characteristics of mass behavior and competencies under designing intermediate institutions contributes to the success of reform, whereas ignoring them leads to high costs and dysfunctions. In addition, interim institutions can influence the cultural shifts, causing further advancement or failure of reforms. The validity of these theses is demonstrated in the analysis of the privatization and democratization processes in various countries. The hypothesis is put forward and discussed that, in developing countries, one of the important causes of reform failures is a cultural gap between the elite of society and the mass of citizens."
P11|A “Statute of the Firm” as an antitrust law during the Seventies. Guido Carli’s chairmanship of the Italian Industrial Association (Confindustria)|This paper aims to highlight a newsworthy initiative built up by the Italian Industrial Association which tried to give the Italian economy a forerunner “competition law”; however, in the Seventies Italy proved incapable of tying itself with rules of conduct, which were substituted, empowering an “external constraint”. We will firstly provide an economic and historical-institutional framework of that period; we will then describe the making and the contents of the “Statute of the Firm”, together with a critical analysis on it; finally, we will report some critics around the debate on this proposal, and why the Statute was rejected by entrepreneurs themselves.
P11|About Political Change in Greece|There have been almost 40 years after the restoration of democracy in Greece and a peculiar prosperity, which was consciously cultivated by the leaders of political and economic elites, was promoted before the onset of the financial crisis. However, from the beginning of the financial recession, the temporal illusions have been revealed and the need of a complete transformation of the financial policies has been expressed, while a significant transformation of the entire political culture has started. Parties such as SYRIZA, Independent Greeks(ANEL) and Golden Dawn took advantage of the growing social discontent by propagating their selves as exponents of ordinary people and of their concerns or their fears, as the expression of resistance against an avoidable sellout of public values. However, crisis has exposed a number of successive truths which were elaborately hiding in the underbelly of the detaining political and socioeconomic system. These truths were exteriorized once it became clear that the foundations on which the Greek society was based after the restoration of democracy, were weak and insufficient to guide the country’s way towards a modern future.
P11|Институты Догоняющего Развития<BR>[Institutions of Catching-up Development]|"It is shown that the institutional trajectories of catching-up development in successful countries contained similar interim institutions; this similarity is explained by common technological, institutional and cultural constraints that should be taken into account and to overcome. Corporatism, indicative planning, the presence of the ""main"" development agencies with broad powers, maintaining an undervalued exchange rate - due to these and a number of other mechanisms, countries of economic miracle were able to initiate and maintain rapid growth, despite low level of human capital, underdevelopment of civic culture, and market failures. Institutes of catching-up development contributed to the formation of collaborative relationships between the government, business and society. They softened the existed constraints, and they itself were gradually modified to ensure the transition to modern democracy with effective market economy. The analysis allows to outline а plan of institutional reform , taking into account the institutional particularities of Russia. The principles of the administrative reform are considered. The problem of the formation of a hybrid national planning system is formulated, which includes indicative planning and program budgeting. To finance the planned projects, it is offered a mix of public-private partnership and project financing. It is proposed to use the Japanese experience of stimulating temporary association of companies for the development of modernization projects. The principles of reforming of the state property governance, as well as education and science sectors are discussed."

P11|The SKY Model of Limited BlockChain in an App Ecosystem|Mobile App based market is rapidly becoming popular. As such, it is an opportunity to bring hassle-free transactions to people’s mobile phones. But the multi-billion dollar App market pays a great amount of money in transaction costs and banking services. This paper provides a solution by integrating BlockChain technology with Mobile-App based economy. We first describe the various concepts involved in BlockChain and App technology. Then we deliberate on how the two can be brought together without a glitch in either of the systems. This model is named as the SKY Model, each letter in the word SKY respectively standing for the initials of the authors. We also discuss the various merits of a BlockChain amalgamated with Mobile App based economy. We then go on to show how a decentralised economic system can be brought about on Mobile Apps through The SKY Model of Limited BlockChain.
P11|Developmental State: A Theoretical and Methodological Critique|This article aims to critically reassess the theoretical and methodological premises of developmental state. It is argued that developmental state as a theoretical framework is misleading in terms of grasping the nature of the state by regarding it existing above the social relations, particularly class conflicts, and separating it from the international context within which it flourished. Moreover, in an attempt to explain the inherent contradictions of the developmental state, which have largely been obscured within the statist theoretical framework, I argue that the concept of the developmental state mystifies the exploitative nature of the capitalist state on the one hand, while overlooking the contradictions intrinsic to capitalist development on the other.
P11|Механизмы формирования стратегических приоритетов со- циально-экономического развития. The mechanisms of formation of strategic socio-economic priorities|Целью статьи является определение методов и способов выработки приоритетов социально-экономического развития, применяемых на федеральном уровне. Исходными данными для исследования явились документы стратегического планирования, а также указы, постановления и распоряжения органов исполнительной власти Российской Федерации и субъектов Российской Федерации, определяющие стратегические приоритеты социально-экономического развития в 20-летний период. На основе проведенного содержательного анализа нормативной правовой базы Российской Федерации определен термин «приоритеты социально-экономического развития» и аналогичные понятия, а также подходы к их формированию. Проведенный обзор приоритетов в составе документов стратегического планирования позволил провести типологизацию приоритетов социально-экономического развития Российской Федерации. Авторы определили механизм формирования приоритетов под воздействием основных эндогенных (внешнеэкономические, внешнеполитические, миграционные и пр.) и экзогенных (интересы бизнеса, населения, региональных властей) факторов, который может быть рекомендован для учета при подготовке документов стратегического планирования федерального уровня. The article is devoted to definition of methods and techniques to identify priorities of socio-economic development, applicable at the Federal level. The initial data for the study was strategic planning documents, as well as the decrees, resolutions and orders of the Executive authorities of the Russian Federation and of constituent entities of the Russian Federation, defining the strategic priorities of socio-economic development in the 20-year period. The article presents the defining the term ‘priorities of economic and development’ and the approaches to their formation, which are represented at Russia’s normative acts and other federal documents. The content analysis of priorities in the strategic planning documents has allowed drawing the typology of economic and social development priorities of the Russian Federation. The authors determined the mechanism of creating the priorities under the influence of main endogenous (foreign trade, foreign policy, macro, etc.) and exogenous (the interests of business, communities, regional authorities) factors which could be recommended for consideration at the strategy developing process at federal level.
P11|Churning, power laws, and inequality in a spatial agent-based model of social networks|Abstract Amidst many previous network models lacking a spatial dimension, this paper proposes a dynamic agent-based model of social network formation that explicitly considers space. We find that varying the dynamics of agent interaction causes the emergence of differential degree distributions as well as nonlinear dynamics in social and spatial inequalities. The scale-free property of degree connectivity vanishes when tie formation dominates tie dissolution, with power laws re-emerging when tie dissolution is of equal strength or stronger than tie formation. Furthermore, we find a nonlinear relationship between network density and agent inequality in social resources. In particular, multiple phase transitions occur where the relationship is positive in one phase but negative in another. This suggests that, contrary to intuition, higher connectivity can have an adverse distributional impact by benefiting the already privileged. Critically, we find a tradeoff between agent inequality and spatial inequality where the geographic concentration of social resources accompanies a more equal distribution of connectivity. Finally, the disadvantage of agents with limited spatial reach is exacerbated as network density increases. Our results thus highlight the importance of distinguishing between social and spatial inequality in policymaking.
P11|Productividad y competitividad del Sistema de Ciudades|Este estudio caracteriza el Sistema de Ciudades de Colombia desde el punto de vista de la productividad y la competitividad, y analiza los factores que inciden en ellos con el fin de proponer estrategias y políticas para fortalecerlos. Se encuentra que las diferencias en la productividad por hora trabajada son las que explican en mayor grado las diferencias en el PIB per cápita entre las trece principales áreas metropolitanas. A su vez, las diferencias en productividad están positivamente asociadas con la densidad empresarial formal, el tamaño promedio de los establecimientos formales, el capital humano y la presencia de clústers de alta productividad. Con base en estos resultados se discuten políticas transversales y verticales que permitan la consolidación de un Sistema de Ciudades en Colombia a través de un aumento sustancial de la productividad de sus centros urbanos.
P11|Productivity growth, technical change and economies of scale of Korean fossil-fuel generation companies, 2001–2012: A dual approach|This paper examines total factor productivity (TFP) growth, technical change and economies of scale measure of Korean fossil-fuel power generation companies (GENCOs) between 2001 and 2012. For the empirical investigation, we estimated the cost function along with specification tests in order to find the most appropriate empirical model. Empirical results show TFP deterioration, technical regress, and economies of scale for the study period. The optimal size of the Korean GENCOs was also found, which is employed in developing policies regarding TFP growth and technical advance.
P11|What determines the likelihood of structural reforms?|We use data for a panel of 60 countries over the period 1980–2005 to investigate the main drivers of the likelihood of structural reforms. We find that: (i) external debt crises are the main trigger of financial and banking reforms; (ii) inflation and banking crises are the key drivers of external capital account reforms; (iii) banking crises also hasten financial reforms; and (iv) economic recessions play an important role in promoting the necessary consensus for financial, capital, banking and trade reforms, especially in the group of OECD-countries. Additionally, we also observe that the degree of globalisation is relevant for financial reforms, in particular in the group of non-OECD countries. Moreover, an increase in the income gap accelerates the implementation of structural reforms, but increased political fragmentation does not seem to have a significant impact.
P11|Social trust, institutional and political constraints on the executive and deregulation of markets|Social trust is frequently claimed to be conducive for economic reforms. Likewise, the scope of policy liberalization is influenced by the political power structure as manifested in institutional and political constraints on the executive (IPCE). However, social trust and IPCE are possibly intertwined in their effects on economic liberalization. This paper empirically explores the relationship between social trust, IPCE and the scope of economic deregulation as measured by the first difference in the regulation subindex of the Economic Freedom of the World index. The results provide evidence in favor of a positive association of social trust with deregulation and of a negative association between institutional or partisan veto-points and deregulation. Yet, according to our analysis IPCE are an obstacle for economic deregulation only in relatively low trusting environments and social trust unfolds a particular strength as driver of deregulation with increasing levels of IPCE.
P11|Kinds of Scientific Rationalism: The Case for Methodological Liberalism|The present paper considers the implications of the postulate that the activities of scientists constitute complex phenomena in the sense associated with the methodological writings of the Nobel Prize-winning Austrian economist, methodologist, and political philosopher, F.A. Hayek. Although Hayek wrote extensively on the methodology of sciences that investigate systems of complex phenomena, he never addressed the possibility that science itself is such a system. The application of Hayek’s method ology of sciences of complex phenomena to science itself implies some minimal criteria for explanations of scientific rationality. If science is complex in Hayek’s sense, then scientific belief may be rational in more than one way. It is argued that a failure to recognize the possibility of multiple kinds of scientific rationality contributes to an error theory of certain unsuccessful accounts of scientific belief in the history of philosophy of science. It is further argued that, where ecological rationality is operative, rational belief requires an element of methodological liberty. It is shown that acceptance of the possibility of ecologically-rational scientific outcomes–a view here dubbed methodological liberalism–is closely related to Hayek's denial of the possibility of a successful scientism, a denial crucial to his arguments against socialism and Keynesian macroeconomics.
P11|Innovation Bureaucracy: Does the organization of government matter when promoting innovation?|Current research on how to organize the role of government in innovation – both how governments support innovation in markets and how governments achieve innovations within public organizations for improving its market supporting activities – converges around a rather simplified single-organization explanations: innovations are driven by either (Weberian) elite expert organizations or (Schumpeterian) fluid peripheral organizations. We show that looking at history of innovation bureaucracy, a more complex picture emerges: historically we find a rich organizational variety for implementing diverse innovation policy goals. We show that historically the organizational variety is, first, driven by highly diverse public-private relationships; and second, the variety itself is an important factor in success and failure of innovation policies. Combining analytical lenses created by Weber and Mintzberg we build analytical framework based on routines and capacities to analyze organizational variety in innovation bureaucracy. We show how different kinds of public organizations are successful at delivering different kinds of innovation policy goals and impacts. Particularly important is the distinction between organizations capable of innovations in policies (instrumental performance) vs organizations supporting innovations in private sector (substantive performance). We finish with discussing the importance of organizational variety for the concept of entrepreneurial state.
P11|Structural changes in the evolution of entrepreneurship in Romania (1990-2013)|This paper proposes a descriptive analysis of the institutional transformation of entrepreneurship in Romania and identifies the main factors that determined its evolution after 1989. The process of structural transformation of the economy is marked by a decreasing number of large enterprises and the broadening of the SME sector. Using a model proposed by Kuczi (2000) the article concludes that this change can be largely explained by the pressure of recession and fragmentation effects. In turn these processes were determined by: 1. the restructuring of the economy as a result of privatization and transition to market economy (especially in the 90s) and 2. changes in the global regulative environment (especially after Romaniaâ€™s accession to the EU).
P11|Will The Eu`S Boat Float In Murky Post-Crisis Waters? An Assessment Of Eu`S Economic And Financial Agenda|The EU multilevel governance is a theoretical standpoint that allows us to measure the costs of nowadays European integration. This article addresses current issues of the EU institutional Agenda regarding the logic beyond the changing nature of the economic climate. Our contribution aims to analyze the impact of economic and financial reforms upon the institutional framework of the European Union. In this article we will explore how the post crisis economic agenda is being forged and which are the consequences of following different integration paths. It is also important to determine if a working scenario build around the Community method will address pressing issues in a successful manner or will the intergovernmental standpoint prevail? Is this crisis close to a positive response, is the EU economic governance an endangered construction, or can it be the rise of a great opportunity for the European integration process, a new boost each member state seeks and might nurture?
P11|Macroculture, sports and democracy in classical Greece|In the present essay we examine whether and how sports affected the emergence of democracy as a political phenomenon in Classical Greece. To achieve this we introduce in a model the concept of macroculture as a complex of mutually supporting values, norms and beliefs in various areas of human activity, like athletics, war, politics, etc. Then, we proceed through a historical review on the history of sports in Ancient Greece and we investigate various aspects of how and under which terms athletics performed during classical Greece, predominantly, in ancient Athens. We found that the values that gradually emerged through sports during an extended period that goes back as far as the Bronze Age times, led to the development of an environment of mutually supporting norms and values such as equality and trust, that by being correlated and coordinated each other, led to the creation of new values and norms, as the theory of macroculture proposes. We also found that these new values were “diffused” from athletics to the field of politics and played a key role to the emergence of democracy.

P11|The Digital Disruption and its Societal Impacts|Deepening digitalization and globalization has induced an ongoing societal transformation that may ultimately prove to be as significant as the original industrial revolution. Even as the ICT industry is being restructured, global competition is being transformed. Previously dominant firms—including telecommunications carriers, equipment providers, and powerful legacy software firms—are under assault from the move to cloud computing, in the network center, and mobile computing, on the network periphery. This transformation of the computing and communication infrastructure has been occurring simultaneously with the spread of ever more complicated and sophisticated global value chains. The articles in this special issue explore a number of the key facets of this transformation in a comparative lens. The authors find that the social, legal, and economic arrangements will impact how these changes affect nation-states. For policy-makers there will be serious dilemmas, as they will have to simultaneously nurture and support many aspects of these changes, while also mitigating or channeling some of the outcomes so as to protect privacy, income equality, and fair taxation.

P11|Alienation and rationality—The retreat of postwar socialism|Postwar socialist thought, such as the Frankfurt School, retreated from the Social Sciences due to its theoretical and empirical failures, as well as the discovery of Marx’ Paris Manuscripts. It shifted its emphasis away from exploitation. Instead, it dealt with human alienation in a prosperous world and other more philosophical concerns, such as the nature of rationality. We show that the Frankfurt School is not unique in dealing with these topics. The writings of F.A. Hayek, and, to a lesser extent, James Buchanan, focus on surprisingly similar observations but arrive at different conclusions. We also argue that the modern version of socialism is flawed.

Thus, an incentive model is formulated for more efficient resource allocation and within this framework; decisions taken could be evaluated based on the outcomes.
P11|Neoliberalism, ‘Digitization’, and Creativity: the Issue of Applied Ontology|The paper extends Foucault’s analysis of neoliberalism in The Birth of Biopolitics. More specifically, I construct and defend an anti-Husserlian approach to the labour process with the objective of investigating how collectively generated forms of intellectual labour have been appropriated under capitalist relations of production. I also interrogate the way that different notions of (computational) applied ontology influence both the nature of and our very conception of social creativity. What, quite wrongly, has been thought of in Spinoza as pantheism is simply the reduction of the field of God to the universality of the signifier, which produces a serene, exceptional detachment from human desire. In so far as Spinoza says—desire is the essence of man, and in the radical dependence of the universality of the divine attributes, which is possible only through the function of the signifier, in so far as he does this, he obtains that unique position by which the philosopher—and it is no accident that it is a Jew detached from his tradition who embodies it—may be confused with a transcendent love. This position is not tenable for us. Experience shows us that Kant is more true, and I have proved that his theory of consciousness, when he writes of practical reason, is sustained only by giving a specification of the moral law which, looked at more closely, is simply desire in its pure state, that very desire that culminates in sacrifice, strictly speaking, of everything that is the object of love in one’s human tenderness—I would say, not only in the rejection of the pathological object, but also in its sacrifice and murder. That is why I wrote Kant avec Sade. (Lacan, 1979: 275-6) But it is like the story of the Resistance fighters who, wanting to destroy a pylon, balanced the plastic charges so well that the pylon blew up and fell back into its hole. From the Symbolic to the Imaginary, from castration to Oedipus, and from the despotic age to capitalism, inversely, there is the progress leading to the withdrawal of the overseeing and overcoding object from on high, which gives way to a social field of immanence where the decoded flows produce images and level them down. Whence the two aspects of the signifier: a barred transcendent signifier taken in a maximum that distributes lack, and an immanent system of relations between minimal elements that come to fill the uncovered field (somewhat similar in traditional terms to the way one goes from Parmenidean Being to the atoms of Democritus). (Deleuze and Guattari,1987: 290-1). Marx was vexed by the bourgeois character of the American working class. But it turned out that the prosperous Americans were merely showing the way for the British and the French and the Japanese. The universal class into which we are merging is not the revolutionary proletariat but the innovative bourgeoisie. (McClosky, D. 2009)
P11|On the Formation of National Planning System in Russia|"We propose to distinguish between two ""ideal"" types of national planning: the universal and the program planning. The first is aimed at accelerating the balanced development of industries and regions through large-scale investment projects; it requires a hierarchy of specialized planning institutions. The second uses a relatively small number of programs aimed at addressing key economic problems. These programs are worked out by the ministries and agencies, which are also engaged in the current management. In developing countries, national planning tends to be the first type, and in the developed ones, it tends to be the second. In Russia, elements of both types of systems have spontaneously arisen. From them, it is necessary to form a mixed system that would be adequate to the Russian level of development. Its contours are discussed in the paper."
P11|Economic Strategy for the Peripheral System|"Russian economic system is considered as a peripheral capitalist economy. For this type of economy the concept of ""economic strategy"" does not seem applicable, since the system itself rigidly defines the logic of development. It determines such features of Russia's economy as a large role of export of mineral resources, dependence on external financial markets and on foreign investments as the source of new technologies; government and business interweaving; financial flows configured by rent income extraction through administration and corruption. With lacking civil society, weak institutions and subordinated position within the world economy the system can be transformed only through conscious efforts of authorities. However political regime which evolved in the country - peripheral autocracy - makes only more conspicuous the lack of political will to reform the system. So a scenario of Russia implementing the strategy of breaking through the limitations of the peripheral area of world capitalism is postponed for an indefinite period of time."
P11|Our Debts Heavy…|"(On the Monograph ""Debt as a Phenomenon of the XXI Century"") Lending capital, credit and debt financing have been around and used to fuel economic development since the time immemorial. There are innumerable studies by international and Russian scholars that look into the evolution of these notions and lending instruments employed. The collective monograph edited by A. Porokhovsky and published by the MSU in 2014 intends to provide an all-around political and economic as well as applied review of the current debt issues faced by the global economy, national economies of Russia, U.S.A. and countries of the European Union. It uses a variety of academic and methodological postulates that range from the reproduction approach to modern macroeconomic doctrines."
P11|Two Opposing Economic-Literary Critiques of Socialism: George Orwell Versus Eugen Richter and Henry Hazlitt|Orwell's famous fictions, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four criticized totalitarian forms of socialism from a Public Choice perspective, assuming that socialism would work as an economic system as long as the proper political institutions were in place to curb the potential for the abuse of power. This is contrasted with two novels by others who took the opposite approach: Richter's Pictures of the Socialistic Future and Hazlitt's Time Will Run Back. These two assumed that the political implementation of socialism would be perfect but that socialism would necessarily turn totalitarian because of the problem of economic calculation. These novels assumed away the Public Choice problem of institutions and the abuse of power and focused on the political implications of socialism as a purely economic system. Contrasting these two sets of novels shows how the Austrian and Public Choice schools criticize socialism in two entirely different ways.
P11|От Социального Либерализма - К Философии Сотрудничества<BR>[From social liberalism towards the philosophy of collaboration]|It is shown that the evolution of modern developed societies results into reduction of the role of centralized governance as well as economic and political competition, whereas the role of collaboration mechanisms is growing. This process is supported by cultural changes: increasing trust, internalization of honesty norms, and thus mitigates the problem of free-riding. Collectivism and individualism in their extreme forms are being replaced by the culture of constructive collaboration and compromise. The cultural transformation creates new institutions and, the same time, is supported by them. Thereby the failures of market, state and parliamentary democracy are gradually being overcome. Instead of social liberalism, which reflects just a certain stage of this process and operates mainly by extremes such as the individual - the state or the state - the market, a more general view - the philosophy of collaboration (collaborativism) is suggested.
P11|Эволюция Институтов Конкуренции, Власти И Сотрудничества<BR>[Institutions of competition, power and collaboration]|It is shown that the evolution of modern developed societies leads to a decrease in the significance of both centralized governance and economic competition, while the role of collaboration mechanisms is being strengthened. This process is supported by cultural changes - by increasing trust, by internalization of the honesty norms, and thus free-rider problem is mitigated. Collectivism and individualism in their extreme forms are being replaced by the culture of constructive interactions and compromises. This cultural transformation creates new institutions and the same time supports them. Thus, both market and state failures are being overcome.

P11|The Greek referendum: an alternative approach|"Admittedly, the balance of power within the European institutions, especially those related to financial stability and economic policy, is controlled by Germany. The German Federal Republic as the ""main creditor"" controls the Eurogroup, the Euro Working Group and has privileged relations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank (ECB). Due to this fact, Wolfgang Schäuble as the exponent of the hard German economic strategy has a leading role within the European decision-making institutions. France, Italy and other countries are unsuccessfully trying to counteract and mitigate the German influence, as shown by the Greek issue. This framework is tightly connected with the negotiating ability of any country that inconsistently attempts to reverse the status quo, modify the rules or change the terms of an agreement. The Greek government of Alexis Tsipras sufficiently experienced this suffocating experience and announced a referendum as an attempt to open the field of negotiations."
P11|Worker problem-solving and the nature of the firm: new theory, new evidence|This paper proposes a different theory of the firm and demonstrates how it can be employed to yield hypotheses about differences in innovation and human resource strategy according to the shareholder/stakeholder and liberal/coordinated market dichotomies. The theory assumes that feasible production and demand sets are nonconvex due to interaction among activities; thus firms exist to permit the identification and exploitation of profit opportunities through coordinated action. This implies that firms face a nonconvex profit landscape comparable to the fitness landscapes invoked in evolutionary biology. Given the complexity of these landscapes and the uncertainty of the location of profit hills, there is a tradeoff between exploiting existing or adjacent hills and prospecting for more distant ones: the first minimizes risk, the second maximizes potential profit. A further assumption is then introduced, that shareholder firms seek to maximizes the present value of expected future profit streams, while stakeholder firms maximize the likelihood of achieving profitability over a given time horizon. Combining these theoretical priors, we characterize the likely innovation, organizational and human resource characteristics of the two types of firms and the effects exerted by their external environment, as described in the Varieties of Capitalism literature. These theoretical predictions are confirmed in a set of case studies of a stakeholder firm in liberal and coordinated environments and a shareholder firm in a coordinated environment. This is seen through differences in the role of worker problem-solving, which brings together innovation and learning, organizational structure and human resource strategy.

P11|Penzijní reforma v Chile: aktuální vývoj plně fondového DC systému a analýza dopadů<BR>[Chilean Pension System: Current Development of Fully Funded DC System and Its Impacts]|General elections in Chile in the autumn of 2013 have unleashed a discussion about the shortcomings of the Chilean pension system and the necessary changes. Radical solutions contains various forms of return of the PAYG system. The paper deals with the preparation and the main implication of the pension reform in 1981 which led to the transition from the PAYG system to the capital system. Thanks to the reconstruction of the time series from the 70s and 80s of the 20th century using the latest data from 2013 and own calculations the article confirmed that the transition meant a noticeable increase in pensions for everybody included in the system. This outcome is driven mainly by the lower tax burden, generated savings and positive impact, particularly on the country´s GDP and government budget. The paper also summarize the available knowledge about the pension reform in Chile in the Czech language.
P11|Economic Policy without Politics|Commentators on market-oriented policy reform, e.g. John Williamson and Naomi Klein, have observed that radical policy change is often enacted in the wake of a â€œcrisisâ€ which is perceived to necessitate and justify the change. In section 2, I critically examine Williamsonâ€™s work and his analysis of the enabling conditions of policy changes based on the â€œWashington Consensus.â€ I also consider Kleinâ€™s work, and use, as a case study, the economic reforms in Chile in the 1970s. Whilst Williamson and Klein provide insights into the introduction of policy change, they do not offer plausible accounts of its persistence after a crisis has passed. Drawing on insights from behavioral economics, an explanation of persistence is offered (section 3). In section 4, the notion of â€œpoliticsâ€ contained in the work of proponents of market-oriented policy reform is scrutinized. I conclude with remarks on strategies for resisting market-oriented policy change.
P11|O debate Gudin/Simonsen paralelo ao debate do cálculo econômico socialista|This paper analyzes the historical context of the debate between Roberto Simonsen and Eugênio Gudin on the role of state planning in the post-war Brazilian economy. Both had different views on how to develop the Brazilian economy: Simonsen defended the active state intervention with the objective of closing production bottlenecks and to coordinate efforts in order to increase the productive efficiency; Gudin defended the adoption of liberalization policies and incentive to private entrepreneurship. Such positions resemble a lot the positions adopted by socialists and liberals during the socialist economic calculation debate, which occurred a decade before. Although Simonsen had been influenced by other traditions (such as the Old American Institutionalism), he defended practical applications of planning that emerged from that debate, Gudin was directly influenced by the liberal positions, citing Hayek, Mises and Robbins. In the end, I argue that the debate can open way to understand complexity questions in the economy and the relation between complexity of the productive structure and development
P11|L’opérateur de transport public à Bruxelles (STIB) et la Région de Bruxelles-Capitale :25 ans de vie commune|Since 1989 and the regionalization of public transports in Belgium, the Société des transports intercommunaux de Bruxelles (STIB), i.e. the public operator of urban transport in Brussels, has undergone many changes, both structural and organizational. Meanwhile, the company has managed to improve its financial health in accordance with the objectives set by the regulatory transport authority, the Region of Brussels-Capital. The analysis of the system of actors shows that, in a principal-agent relationship characterized by high information asymmetry, the convergence of interests between the supervisory authority and the public company is neither natural nor automatic: it is built. This construction takes place at several levels and materializes incrementally, particularly through the management contract. In this regulatory system, the process organizing the dialogue between the company and the authority produces the desired beneficial effects, more than the legal value of the contract does. The interdependence between the actions of the Region and those of the STIB implies practices that can be described as a partnership. Finally, the analysis shows that the contractualization is not inconsistent with an evolution of the roles of each actor.
P11|No Countries for Old Technology Assessment? Sketching the Efforts and Opportunities to Establish Parliamentary TA in Spain and Portugal|If the question is whether there is a parliamentary technology assessment (PTA) unit in Portugal or Spain, the clear answer is that there is still no such unit at the central state level at the present time, neither in Portugal nor in Spain. The question then has to be modified addressing previous and current efforts to establish PTA and the current framework conditions and opportunities. Practices of PTA are framed here as a democratic innovation in the context of changes in representative democracies. Against this backdrop, the efforts and opportunities to establish PTA in Spain and Portugal are studied. By sketching these developments and outlining the opportunities in these countries, our aim is to contribute to the debate about the likelihood of a new wave of PTA in Europe (Hennen/Nierling 2014).
P11|Transition Town Initiativen im deutschsprachigen Raum: Ein systematischer Überblick über Vorkommen, Schwerpunkte und Einfluss auf die Energiewende vor Ort|Klimawandel, Verknappung der Ressourcen, peak oil, die Sorge um unsere Lebensgrundlagen und deren Erhaltung und die Notwendigkeit zur Energiewende, sind Themen, die die Transition Town Initiativen antreiben, auf eine Veränderung der bisherigen ressourcen- und energieintensiven Lebens- und Wirtschaftsweise, hin zu einer nachhaltigen, ressourcen- und umweltschonenden Gestaltung des Lebens zu wirken. Der Transformationsansatz liegt in Lokalisierungsstrategien, die durch Vielfalt und Flexibiliät eine hohe Resilienz besitzen. Vorliegende Untersuchung prüft, ob dies im deutschsprachigen Raum auch auf die Energiebemühungen der Transition Initiativen zutrifft und welcher Einfluss auf die Energiewende von den lokalen Transition Initiativen zu erwarten ist. Daraus werden mögliche Entwicklungsszenarien abgeleitet.

Negativzinspolitik der Europäischen Zentralbank|Das vorliegende Papier wirft die Frage auf, ob Grundrechte institutioneller Anleger und Sparer durch die Negativ- bzw. Niedrigzinspolitik der EZB, insbesondere durch das Staatsanleihenkaufprogramm (Quantitative Easing) verletzt sind. Drei Aspekte werden aus rechtlicher Sicht diskutiert: Ist die Eigentumsgarantie für Geld in der Grundrechtecharta der Europäischen Union und dem deutschen Grundgesetz nur eine formale oder auch eine materielle? Verletzt das QE-Programm der EZB das fundamentale Recht institutioneller Anleger und Sparer zur Generierung von Zinseinnahmen? Sind Vermögensverluste durch entgangene Zinseinnahmen oder Negativzinsen in Wahrheit Steuern ohne Rechtsgrundlage?
P11|Capitalism and Inequality Re-Examined| Ever since capitalism came to be recognized as a new economic system, it has had vociferous critics, of whom none was more wide-ranging than Karl Marx. Marx recognized that behind its ideological patina of freedom, capitalism, like the exploitative systems of slavery and feudalism, was a social system in which a small class extracted from the mass of producers practically all output above that necessary for bare subsistence. An elite's ability to do so was grounded in its monopoly ownership of the means of production. However, Marx, and other critics faulted it for more than its exploitation and extreme inequality. Sharing much with romanticism, they believed that its very institutions of private property and markets corrupt society and its members. Nevertheless, Marx in particular recognized that capitalism, unlike earlier exploitative systems, was radically dynamic, producing unprecedented wealth, while Â transforming not only all it inherited from the past, but also its own nature so as to eventually even empower the producers. Yet his anti-private property and anti-market animus led him to believe that empowered producers would abandon these capitalist institutions. He did not imagine that the dynamism, wealth, and potential freedom that capitalism was delivering might have little chance of flourishing in the absence of these institutions. This article claims that Marx and other critics were wrong to fault capitalism's central institutions for the injustices that accompanied them. These institutions are not the problem. Instead it is the inequality that co-evolved with them and enables them to be used for exploitation.

P11|Varianten von Marktwirtschaften: Lehren für Russland<BR>[Varieties of Market Economies: Lessons for Russia]|The ordo-liberal inspired Social Market Economy that emerged from west German economists and lawyers of the second half of the 1940s has perhaps attracted more attention in the international academic debate. Than prior to the financial crisis that became obvious to a wider public in 2008. Prior to this even the approach of ‘German neo-liberalism’ (i.e. ordo-liberalism) was neglected by many mainstream economists outside of Germany. Unexpectedly, Ge3rmany coped with turbulent economic times since 2008 much better than many spectators particularly in the Anglo-Saxon economies that support ‘free market’-principles more than the German establishment have anticipated. Simultaneously, these latter economies have lost much of their former appeal as a result of their decreased dynamism and problems to cope with the current problems in recent years. The renaissance of German ordoliberal concepts during both the financial crisis and the crisis in the euro area leads to the question whether the principles of the Social Market Economy can also serve as a guide for reforms in Russia. According to the author, an appropriate implementation of these principles would lead to lastingly superior prospects of prosperity in Russia.
P11|Perspectiva histórica do planejamento regional no Brasil|O trabalho apresenta uma perspectiva evolutiva das políticas brasileiras de desenvolvimento regional. Para tanto, parte da experiência do Grupo de Trabalho para o Desenvolvimento do Nordeste, nos anos de 1950, e alcança a atual Política Nacional de Desenvolvimento Regional (PNDR), considerando os principais determinantes sociais, econômicos e políticos que separam as duas políticas. Procura-se destacar a complexidade de fatores –contexto geopolítico, (macro)-estratégia nacional de desenvolvimento econômico, diagnóstico e concepção do problema regional, enfoque escalar das políticas, estruturação institucional, entre outros– que tem condicionado o planejamento regional brasileiro. Pretende-se evidenciar a desconexão entre os processos concretos e as intervenções políticas, o que inibe a perspectiva de uma estratégia nacional, principalmente no bojo de uma notória desconstituição estrutural da prática de planejamento. Na conclusão, o trabalho se propõe a extrair algumas lições e subsidiar um debate sobre as perspectivas para a efetiva retomada de políticas de desenvolvimento regional no Brasil.

Justifica-se a pesquisa pela sua relevância em problematizar o tema a respeito do pensamento político dominante para a condução da ação política, o objeto de estudo proporciona o conhecimento e a caracterização do processo de modernização, crescimento e desenvolvimento da região, a eleição de tal questão explica-se por ser ela fundamental para a compreensão do progresso produzido. É possível destacar pretexto relevante para a abordagem do tema também no que se refere à condição atual da América Latina, no que diz respeito a seu nível de progresso. A contribuição teórica ocorre no pensar sobre o desenvolvimento e o fazer política, para construção de planos de ação comprometidos com o bem-estar.
P11|Democratic institutions and regulatory reforms|We use a sample of 144 countries over the period 2003–2013 to investigate the link between democratic institutions and regulatory reforms. Democracy may be conducive to reform, as politicians embrace growth-enhancing reforms to win elections. On the other hand, authoritarian regimes may not worry as much about public opinion and could undertake reforms that are painful in the short run but bring long-term benefits. We test these alternative hypotheses, using data on regulatory reforms from the World Bank’s Doing Business database. The results provide mixed support for the hypothesis that democracy is good for regulatory reforms. We also show that regulatory reforms are more likely just after parliamentary elections in poor and middle-income countries.
P11|Growth in public finances as tool for control: Norwegian development 1850-1950|By drawing on information from public accounts from the nineteenth and twentieth century the present paper aims at mapping the development of key financial indicators for the Norwegian central government sector. It concludes that growth in the size of this sector often, but clearly not always, reflects political economy regimes. The paper concludes that persistant growth in public finances as tool for control over the economy did not take place before the introduction of the social-democratic regime in 1935.
P11|Structural Changes in the Labor Market and Social Security System in China:From the Viewpoint of Flexicurity|The global financial crisis triggered by the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States in 2008 revealed the unsustainability of China’s export-led growth regime, which supported the country’s rapid economic growth for over 20 years. Today, the Chinese economy has been forced to break away from export-led growth. Furthermore, the large financial investment made to compensate for the decreased export demand has helped China maintain high economic growth after the effects of the financial crisis started to wane in 2011. Thus, in recent years, the Chinese economy has had to transition from export- and investment -led growth to consumption-led growth. In this paper, we analyze the most important factors promoting the change from export- and investment-led growth to consumption-led growth in China’s economic growth regime. That is, we examine the correlation between the recent structural changes in the reproduction of labor force in the labor market and the social security system. Especially, we focus on the changes in the income-labor nexus due to labor market reforms and the present state of the Chinese social security system from the view point of flexicurity, which increases flexibility and security simultaneously.

P11|The Crisis, New Eu Policies, And The Republic Of Croatia|The period from 2007 until today has been characterized by two extreme events: a) an economic crisis of global extent and reach; and b) rapid and powerful reactions by individual countries and regions of the world in response to those disturbances, keeping in mind the consequences of the dilatory reactions to the Great Depression of 1929-1933. In this context, and after a certain time, the EU began a series of systematic changes and coordination within its institutional framework and undertook concrete measures with the goal of correcting national economic policies, and at the same time it also established the coordination, supervision, and implementation of (non)binding recommendations for individual member countries. The measures were applied to public finance, to reducing deficits in national budgets at the level of the Maastricht criteria and to encouraging structural reforms, proportionately to each particular member state. Since 2010, the overall program of these coordinating activities and their regular monitoring has taken place within the framework of the European Semester. On the basis of its full membership in the EU (since 1 July 2013) the Republic of Croatia in 2014 has been completely included in the regulations and obligations that arise from that program: from procedures to reduce excessive deficits over the next three years (2014-2016) to a series of structural changes within a special national program in the framework of the European Semester. What to do to fulfill the formal conditions and criteria, and moreover to raise the performance level of the national economy not only within the EU but globally, is the fundamental question and challenge that the Republic of Croatia is facing in the new economic framework of the EU.
P11|Structural Heterogeneity Between Eu 15 And 12 New Eu Members – The Obstacle To Lisbon Strategy Implementation?|The aim of this article is to identify diversity between the EU-15 and the New Members in their implementation of the Lisbon Strategy in the period 2000-2010. By analyzing a set of structural indicators, we aim to fill a gap in the literature: the lack of publications providing complex evaluation of the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy using measurable indicators. Given their suitability for international comparisons, we use two taxonomic methods: Ward’s cluster analysis and the synthetic variable method proposed by Hellwig. The results of our analyses confirm the hypothesis of a large gap between the EU-15 countries and the 12 New Members in the key areas of the Lisbon Strategy. According to rankings given by our taxonomic analyses, a high level of the indicators selected is confirmed only for the EU-15 countries and only three New Members belong to a group presenting the average level of these indicators. This study demonstrates a need for a significant intensification of the EU cohesion policy, which is one of the main tools for achieving the Lisbon Strategy goals.
P11|Institutional Monitoring, Coordination and Acquisition Decision in Chinese Public Listed Companies|This paper endeavors to explore the roles that institutional investors play in acquisition decision of Chinese Public Listed Companies (PLCs). Acquisition decision is assumed as a cost-benefit analysis process of shareholders as strategic alliances. Using micro data in the Chinese stock market during 2003-2008, we find that institutional investors including Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFII), Social Security Funds (SSF), Security Firms (SF) and Security Investment Funds (SIF), as well as tradable share (TS) concentration affect a PLC’s acquisition likelihood rather than its annual acquisition size. SSF, SIF and TS concentration can increase acquisition likelihood while QFII decrease it. This paper suggests a strategic alliance model in which institutional investors choose whether to coordinate with controlling shareholder and management. Our paper contributes to the published literature in three ways. First, we offer a conceptual framework to understand the coordination process of acquisition decision in China. Second, we identify which institutional investors could benefit from their monitoring on corporate acquisition through better post-acquisition performance and which could not. Third, we investigate whether institutional investors effectively monitor acquisiton decision or just pick cherry.

P11|Analysis of Production - Inventory Decisions in a Decentralized Supply Chain|Many contracts, such as buy-back policy, cost- and revenue- sharing policies, are widely applied in the literature for supply chain coordination problem. However, the additional gain from coordination may not necessarily cover the extra administrative costs incurred by applying these contracts. In this paper, a production inventory problem is considered in a two-level supply chain. The problém is formulated as a Stackelberg game. Then, the retail fixed mark-up (RFM) policy is examined in order to investigate its performance on supply chain. We apply this policy because of its lower administrative costs compared to other policies. We found that RFM policy is not capable of coordinating the channel; however, it leads to considerable improvements over the channel. For example, it is shown that it improves each member´s profit and leads to Pareto improvement over Stackelberg policy. Besides, its average efficiency is about 96% of that of integrated policy approach.

P11|Economics of Policy Errors and Learning in the European Union|Policy errors occur regularly in EU Member States. Learning from these errors can be beneficial. This paper explains how the European Union can facilitate this learning. At present, much attention is given to “best practices”. But learning from mistakes is also valuable. The paper develops the concept of “avoidable error” and examines evidence from infringement proceedings and special reports of the European Court of Auditors which indicate that Member States do indeed commit avoidable errors. The paper considers how Member States may take measures not to repeat avoidable or predictable errors and makes appropriate proposals.
P11|Economic integration and government revenue from financial repression|We study a relationship between economic openness via financial and trade integration and government revenue from financial repression. An implicit budgetary saving, the financial repression revenue, as measured by the stock of government domestic debt multiplied by the difference between effective foreign and domestic interest rate, has declined significantly from the 1980s into the 2000s across the upper-income, the middle-income, and the low-income developing countries. While we find that both the financial and trade openness have a negative association with the financial repression revenue in the panel of countries, the effect of financial openness is stronger and the empirical correlations depend on the quality of governmental and budgetary management.
P11|Which institutions encourage entrepreneurial growth aspirations?|We develop entrepreneurship and institutional theory to explain entrepreneurial growth aspirations across individuals and institutional contexts. Our framework generates hypotheses at the national level about the negative impact of higher levels of corruption, weaker property rights and greater government activity on entrepreneurs' aspirations to increase employment. We further explore whether individual's social networks compensate for weaknesses in national institutions. We use the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor surveys in 42 countries for 2001–2006, applying a multilevel estimation framework to test our ideas. We find that the relationship between growth aspiring entrepreneurs and institutions is complex; they benefit simultaneously from strong government (in the sense of property rights enforcement), and smaller government, but are constrained by corruption. Social networks mediate some but not all institutional deficiencies.
P11|South Korea's economic future: Industrial policy, or economic democracy?|Many South Koreans believe that the country's remarkable economic successes over the past half-century are the product of an industrial policy that made Korean industry competitive in world markets. While there is widespread sentiment in favor of maintaining the emphasis on industrial policy, others believe industrial policy has generated benefits for some Koreans at the expense of the welfare of working-class Koreans. This has resulted in a push toward economic democracy to more equitably distribute the gains from increased productivity. Neither industrial policy nor economic democracy are in the best interest of Koreans. Rather, a laissez faire policy of minimal government interference will provide the best environment to foster South Korea's continued economic progress.
P11|Property rights, entrepreneurship and coordination|The notion of plan coordination enjoys a central place in the analysis of institutions and competitive market processes. The conventional wisdom is that institutions and policies vary in the extent to which they promote competition and how quickly and completely they bring individuals’ plans into closer coordination with one another. Kirzner has provided the most fully elaborated statement on the use of coordination as a positive analytical device for explaining market dynamics and as a normative criterion for evaluating economic policies. We identify the core propositions in his analysis that elucidate how economic coordination depends upon that most fundamental of market institutions – the system of private property rights. We also probe into Kirzner's claims about inherent limitations in our ability to compare the coordinative potential of alternative property rights systems. We unpack the consequences of these core propositions using the economic theory of property rights. We also examine Kirzner's assertion that dynamic competition – including Schumpeterian innovation – is necessarily coordinative in its market effects. We find that his argument rests on the implicit assumption that property rights remain constant during the process of market adjustment. We provide a case study of the advent of commercial aviation as a potential counterexample to his claims.
P11|Hard Facts and Software: The Co-production of Indicators in a Land-use Planning Model|Using land-use models in deliberative planning is promoted as an example of how environmental decision-making can be subject to both: 1) facts about how the interaction between human action and natural processes; and, 2) local perspectives on how land-use planning processes can incorporate normative concerns. This 'normative' input is often shaped and limited by the presentation of the modelled facts. This paper, however, shows that the selection and measurement of indicators, the primary outcomes of modelling exercises, are subject to a highly particular assessment, influenced by social factors, political choices and technical limitations. This revised understanding does not invalidate the use of models in participatory planning. But it does open up considerable space for stakeholders in deliberative contexts to question and challenge the evidence-based policy implications of so-called 'fact-based' modelling exercises.
P11|The Political Economy of Structural Reform and Fiscal Consolidation Revisited|Europe is going through an unprecedented period of fiscal consolidation and structural economic policy reforms. However, reforms undertaken in times of financial market stress may not be politically viable in the long run if they lack the necessary social balance. This paper studies the distributional consequences of European fiscal consolidation and structural reforms and the scope for further reforms. Suggestions for the efficient bundling of reforms are made. The paper also makes suggestions regarding the strategy of international advice to countries which need structural reforms and it discusses the design of international incentives and a possible role for international mediation.
P11|Lisbon Strategy implementation in 12 New EU Members – multivariate analysis of structural indicators|The aim of this article is to identify diversity between the EU-15 and the New Members in their implementation of the Lisbon Strategy in the period 2000-2010. By analyzing a set of structural indicators, we aim to fill a gap in the literature: a lack of publications providing complex evaluation of the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy using measurable indicators. The results of our analyses confirm the hypothesis of a large gap between the EU-15 countries and the 12 New Members in key areas of the Lisbon Strategy. According to rankings given by our taxonomic analyses, a high level of the indicators selected is confirmed only for the EU-15 countries and only three New Members belong to a group presenting the average level of these indicators. This study demonstrates a need for a significant intensification of the EU cohesion policy, which is one of the main tools for achieving the Lisbon Strategy goals.
P11|State Aid Policy, Territoriality and Federalism: EU Scrutiny and Control of Regional Aid and the Supranationalisation of Subnational Autonomy in Federal Member States|Whilst its impact on national industrial policy has attracted considerable attention in the scholarly literature, the implications of EU state aid policy on regional development policy and its effects on territorial relations inside EU member states have been largely neglected. Drawing on the experience of Bavaria, Flanders and Upper Austria, this article shows how EU action has imposed increasingly wide reaching and detailed constraints on subnational authorities, undermining and eroding their capacity to define and implement regional policy. It thereby also challenges the widely held presumption in the EU literature, as for example by proponents of multi-level governance, that European integration works invariably to empower and strengthen regions in Europe. To the contrary, the case studies show that the autonomy of subnational states in EU member countries with federal systems has been eroded as they have been forced to abandon traditional policies and practices. More generally, the article invites reconsideration of the relationship between European integration and subnational authorities. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013
P11|The Freiburg school and the Hayekian challenge|At first sight and in terms of explicit references, the relationship between Hayek and the early Freiburg School seems to have been one of mutually benign neglect. It took several decades before the “Hayekian challenge” was fully understood in Freiburg; in a way one could even argue that the challenge arrived in Freiburg only with Hayek himself in 1962. This delay can mostly be explained by different foci of attention. Hayek’s evolutionary economics and his classical-liberal social philosophy centers around the problem of private, dispersed knowledge. The (early) Freiburg School’s economics and its ordo-liberal social philosophy centers around the problem of private, concentrated power. This difference of perspective has consequences and can partly be explained by the different intellectual sources the proponents were drawing upon, and the different political struggles they were engaged in.

P11|Road to EURO|The process of adopting the single European current represents an enormous challenge for all countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 respectively, with major implications in terms of monetary policy, but also on the economic or social one. We intend to analyze the way in which our country now fulfills the criteria established by the Treaty of Maastricht and the advantages/disadvantages of the rapid changeover to the euro.

Analysing the EPS forecasting error in Hungary and Austria]|A szerző a 2008-ban kezdődött gazdasági világválság hatását vizsgálja az egy részvényre jutó nyereség előrejelzésének hibájára. Számos publikáció bizonyította, hogy az elemzők a tényértékeknél szisztematikusan kedvezőbb tervértéket adnak meg az egy részvényre jutó előrejelzéseikben. Más vizsgálatok azt igazolták, hogy az egy részvényre jutó előrejelzési hiba bizonytalan környezetben növekszik, míg arra is számos bizonyítékot lehet találni, hogy a negatív hírek hatását az elemzők alulsúlyozzák. A gazdasági világválság miatt az elemzőknek számtalan negatív hírt kellett figyelembe venniük az előrejelzések készítésekor, továbbá a válság az egész gazdaságban jelentősen növelte a bizonytalanságot. A szerző azt vizsgálja, hogy miként hatott a gazdasági világválság az egy részvényre jutó nyereség- előrejelzés hibájára, megkülönböztetve azt az időszakot, amíg a válság negatív hír volt, attól, amikor már hatásaként jelentősen megnőtt a bizonytalanság.

P11|The Political Economy of Banking Regulation – Does the Basel 3 Accord Imply a Change?|Literature on the international financial architecture suggests that financial crises have had profound effects on both the balance of power in the establishment of financial regulation, and the economic impact of regulation on countries and regulated entities. In this article, we seek to add to this knowledge by studying the process by which the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) developed its third capital accord, the so-called Basel 3 accord. We also describe changes in BCBS’s governance and standard setting process, and ask whether these may have caused the economic impact of Basel 3 to differ from the Committee’s preceding capital accords (Basel 1 and 2). Our findings indicate that while BCBS still seem to develop standards that favor their traditional member countries, large international banks no longer seem as clearly favored by its latest capital accord. And while private actors still seem to dominate the exertion of influence over the committee, the governance structure of BCBS has changed towards a more transparent and politically accountable set-up.
P11|What Is the Future of the Market Economy?|"(On the Book by Justin Yifu Lin ""The Quest for Prosperity: How Developing Economies Can Take Off"") According to the opinion of Chinese economist J. Y. Lin, industrial structure of economy is endogenously determined by factors of production. Its effective operation is possible only under the influence of market forces. The main role of the government is to target the strategic support for specific industries with comparative advantages, as well as to improve the infrastructure."
P11|Реформа Ран: Экспертный Анализ: Часть I. Реформа Ран: Проект Минобрнауки<BR>[Reform of the Russian Academy of Sciences: An Expert Analysis: Part I. Reform of the Russian Academy of Sciences: a project of the Ministry of Education and Science]|The theory of reforms usually assumes that a designer aims to increase public welfare under existing constraints. In practice, however, initiators of reforms quite often proceed from false premises, and pursue political and-or self-interested goals. In this paper, we analyze an example of such an initiative - the project of reform of the Russian Academy of Science, offered by The Ministry of Education and Science in June 2013. It is shown, that among the political motives which stimulated the appearance of the project, the main one was the intention to deprive the community of researchers of its organizational independence. This motive was supported by the erroneous thesis, according to which Russian Academy of Science is not capable to provide innovation-based development whereas for successful imitation of technologies, fundamental researches are ostensibly not necessary at all. The analysis shows the exigency of reforming the Russian system of preparation and realization of reforms.
P11|Coordination des Politiques Economiques au Sein de la Zone UEMOA : Bilan et Perspectives<BR>[Economic Policy Coordination in the WAEMU: Results and Prospects]|The recent economic and financial crisis in the euro area seems to question the theoretical solutions to coordinate economic policies in monetary unions. In this paper, we adress the current system of economic policy coordination within the WAEMU during 1994-2010. Using game theory and econometric techniques, we analyze the prospects of this framework. Thus, the effects of the coordination of the Central Bank and the WAEMU Commission on key macroeconomic variables are analyzed and the effects of fiscal policy coordination on intermediate goals including budget deficits and inflation. It appears that a mechanism for coordinating policies to strengthen the foundations for institutional convergence to support economic growth in the long term and that clearly specifies the set of monetary and fiscal contracts between on one side the monetary authority and fiscal authorities of the other, is a must for the optimality of the effects of monetary and fiscal policy item.
P11|Japanese Economy in 2007-2010|This article focuses on the Japanese economy and its development in 2007-2010. It pays special attention to the deep economic crisis in 2008-2009 (the biggest economic slump in Japan after World War II). Factors of this crisis were mostly external (strong decline in Japanese exports and foreign inward investment due to the falling external demand, instability and strong uncertainty in the world economy during the financial crisis in the USA and other developed countries). Nevertheless, the economic slump in Japan was fuelled by low domestic demand and investment as well. The aim of this study is to remind of and analyse the most important trends, achievements and problems of the Japanese economy in 2007-2010. It focuses especially on the economic crisis in 2008- 2009, development of Japanese external trade during the crisis and the governmental countermeasures, both fiscal and monetary. The study outlines the development of the Japanese economy both before and after the crisis.
P11|Uninsurable Risks of Floods, Deluges, Overflows and the System of Solution|Uninsurable risks have significant impact on expenses of private and public sectors of economy. In spite of several commercial insurance products and high quality of insurance services current trend of insurance industry is set to define exceptions of insurance protection. The highest losses caused by realization of uninsurable risks in the Czech Republic are constituted by consequences of floods, deluges and overflows. Recent history of flood occurrence emphasizes insufficiency of prevention, protection and loss solution. Due to these risk factors we have focused our research on issues of uninsurable risks in conditions of the Czech insurance market. The system solution is based on fund approach to ensure commercial insurance protection. Multi-Source System Solution of Uninsurable Risks is purposed in the form of fund with participation of the state authority. Our solution depends on pool creation and primarily should cover enormous claims development. Assumption of fund profitability encourages insurer motivation to become a pool member. Important part of research represents calculation of gross premium. Assessment of input data and calculation of premium are based on real published data and conform to real market development in the Czech Republic. Calculations are also based on our estimations of risk development. This research highlights the importance of uninsurable risks solution. Effective instrument able to protect lives and property is an innovative commercial insurance product. Our commercial solution is a way to strengthen the role of insurance in a field of uninsurable risks. The system solution is designed to conditions of the Czech insurance market and takes into account special domestic factors. We suppose that our solution is possible to be adopted in conditions of any insurance market in case of relevant data and risk factors using.

P11|Are we there yet? On the convergence of financial reforms|Since the 1970s, there have been substantial financial reforms across the world, however little research has been devoted to studying the convergence path of these reforms. While Abiad and Mody (Am Econ Rev 95:66–88, 2005 ) find that there is movement towards a global ‘norm’ of financial reform, their findings are based upon a cross-sectional approach that has been widely criticized in the literature. In this paper we offer new time-series evidence on the convergence of financial reforms both across and within regions, which can also act as a metric to measure the degree of globalization among countries’ financial systems. We find that some regions of the world have fully converged, but the advanced economies and Sub-Saharan Africa are not converging. In addition, while most countries have fully converged within their own region, notable exceptions are also identified. These results suggest that while financial reforms have largely become homogenized, important distinctions still remain. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013
P11|Priorities and Pathways in Services Reform — Part I :Quantitative Studies|This book presents a state-of-the-art evaluation of the benefits and costs of behind-the-border services reform. It introduces new, second-generation methods for quantifying regulatory barriers and applies those methods to a wide range of services sectors ¡ª financial, infrastructure and social ¡ª in a broad spectrum of countries. It uses advanced modeling techniques to project the sectoral, economy-wide and regional effects of services reforms, as well as highlight their adjustment costs. The empirical results offer fresh guidance to policy-makers, who need better information bases with which to prioritize services reforms and devise pathways to achieving them. The empirical methods provide invaluable tools to academics, researchers and policy advisors, who can use them to further improve those information bases. Priorities and Pathways in Services Reform: Part I ¡ª Quantitative Studies presents new methodological frameworks for assessing and prioritizing services reforms, and provides an up-to-date evaluation of the policy impacts across a range of services markets and countries. Part II ¡ª Political Economy furthers the conversation by analyzing what it takes for a reform to succeed.

P11|Priorities and Pathways in Services Reform — Part II:Political Economy Studies|Services markets remain highly regulated and international trade and investment is restricted. Previous works have identified the scope for significant gains from trade, yet those results are often debated and the progress on reform has been slow. Parts I and II in Priorities and Pathways in Services Reform help fill the gap in the research around this debate. Part I ¡ª Quantitative Studies contains up-to-date assessment and evaluations of the impact of policy in a range of services markets in different countries (through cross-country modelling of the impacts of a reform program). Part II ¡ª Political Economy Studies builds on this to address the understanding of what makes a reform successful, going beyond a quantification of the benefits of reform. This book fills that gap by reporting and reviewing the experience of reform across different sectors and countries. Ten key lessons are identified for successful reform.

P11|Services Trade Reform:Making Sense of It|With the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations moribund, it is time to reconsider the future of trade negotiations as an impetus for reform. Services trade is a leading-edge behind-the-border issue, so a services perspective offers critical insights into the future of trade negotiations more generally. This book traces the author's thinking on how to make sense of services trade reform, drawing on her analytical, empirical and policy-related work on services issues from both academic and government perspectives. It covers policy reform, policy forums, and what it takes politically to achieve reform, and offers critical new insights into the future of trade negotiations. The book shows policy makers how to approach the economics and politics of services trade reform domestically, consistent with relevant special features of services trade. It shows analysts the full policy implications of those special features, including what they mean and how services reform should be treated in the future in national and international forums. In covering such broad territory, the book draws together published material that previously has been scattered across place and time, including modelling that establishes empirically the special features of services that are relevant.

P11|Creative Accounting In The Context Of An “Efficient” Management|This paper proposes an analysis of the creative accounting connection with the managing factor which administers informational resources in a company activity. Creative accounting, as it is defined in scientific literature, takes different shapes, “existential complexity” which makes it become the suitable environment of strategic and tactical steps, initiated and performed from the major objective point of view represented by the performance of the company. The manager is the one who connects the internal information, upon which he has control, with external information, in order to manage properly economic circumstances, the way of reporting financial results with influences on the perceptive of the company. An efficient management will follow the increase of financial indicators of the company and implicit of its performance, through financial insurance turnover necessary to the continuity and development of the activity of the company.
P11|Impact and Response to the Financial Crisis: Comparing the EU and China Policies|This article, in a comparative approach, assesses the impact of governments’ policies both in the EU and in China to handle the impact of the international financial crisis. Europe, recovered quickly from the crisis, but it continues to experience low overall macro-economic performance, with noticeable variations among the EU’s 27 member-nations and the 17 Eurozone members. Debt levels and unemployment rates remain relatively high, and European authorities are forced to look for a balance between fighting inflation by raising interest rates and supporting demand, which necessitates a more permissive policy. The collateral impact of the financial crisis on Europe resulted in a currency crisis that endangered the euro and was caused by Maastricht mechanisms for convergence and stability that regulate the functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). China quickly returned to a high growth rate that was fueled by the implementation of vast expansionist policies by the national and provincial governments. After a brief recession, the Chinese economy very rapidly resumed its high performance levels in terms of GDP growth, trade balance, and currency reserves. The Chinese economy’s recovery from raises questions about its ability to change its growth model by abandoning a model based on promoting exports and on heavy investments in infrastructures, particularly in economic sectors that are not always productive, a strategy that creates a drain on households, whose savings finance the current growth model.
P11|Management Challenges - A Preview In Future Of Capitalism|The economic crisis comes in the context the deepest political crisis faced by the EU today. Economic catastrophe led to the strongest economic crisis since the '30s. Downturns were commonly explained using technical arguments, economic or financial reasons. Because they were discussed by experts in language often inaccessible, so often we face today and dangerous misunderstanding of the population crisis. When talking about economic crises tend to forget that they come in a political context, social and cultural. At the same time, how society reacts to the crisis is decisively influenced by the values it embraces.
P11|The Effect of Enterprise Break-Ups on Performance. The Case of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia|The transition literature on the comparison of restructuring prior to privatization has been theoretically well researched, yet the empirical evidence is limited. Virtually no study has dealt with the Macedonian economy at all. Using firm level data, we estimate the effects of the break-ups of enterprises on the subsequent performance of the “master enterprises” and spun-off divisions. We estimate the performance effects by comparing the performance of enterprises that remained intact with the performance of enterprises that experienced spin-offs and the newly established subsidiaries. Our results suggest that the break-ups were guided not by efficiency goals, but rather by managerial self-interest.
P11|Project Management for a Country with Multiple Objectives|This paper proposes project management for a national economy in search for new projects, even with competition between projects. Traditional Cost-Benefit does not respond to this purpose. Indeed Cost-Benefit is only interested in one specific project and not in a competition between projects. In addition all goals (objectives) have to be translated into money terms, leading sometimes to immoral consequences. On the contrary Multi-Objective Optimization takes care of different objectives, whereas the objectives keep their own units. However different methods exist for the application of Multi-Objective Optimization. The author tested them after their robustness resulting in seven necessary conditions for acceptance. Nevertheless these seven conditions concern only Discrete Optimization and not Continuous Optimization or Interactive Multi-Objective Methods. MOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio Analysis coupled with Reference Point Theory) and MULTIMOORA (MOORA plus the Full Multiplicative For m), assisted by Ameliorated Nominal Group and Delphi Techniques, satisfy the seven conditions, although in a theoretical way. A simulation exercise illustrates the use of these methods, ideals to be strived for as much as possible.
P11|Economic Freedom and Institutional Convergence|Francis Fukuyama argues that liberal democracy is the final form of human government and will become more and more prevalent in the long term. If this prediction is true, countries should converge in their political and economic systems toward liberal democracy, a form of institutional convergence. In this paper, we examine whether there is convergence in economic institutions, drawing on the literatures of economic convergence and of industrial organization. We use the Economic Freedom of the World-index over the period 1970-2009 to proxy for economic institutions. Our results indicate that countries with lower institutional quality experience faster institutional change than countries with higher quality, i.e., we observe institutional convergence. But countries with lower institutional quality have higher variability of institutional change. Using distributional analysis, we examine institutional transition probabilities, and find that the probability of a country ending up with high-quality institutions is high in the long-run. These findings support Fukuyama's prediction.

P11|The cost of registering property: does legal origin matter?|There is a large literature that finds that common law countries perform better than civil law countries in various aspects of the institutional environment. This article extends these findings to another dimension of institutional quality--the cost of registering property. In a sample of 121 countries, we find that the cost of registering property is lower by 26 percent of the world average in common law compared with civil law countries, a result largely driven by differences in non-notary costs of registering property. We provide plausible explanations for these findings.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P11|Evolving Regional Governance Structures for future EU Cohesion Policy: Croatian Perspectives|European cohesion policy has been inspiring Croatian national policy makers for a decade in the attempt to organize and prepare the institutional structures for new ways of designing and implementing a modern regional development policy. Emphasis has been put to a large extent on the design of strategic development documents, while implementation remains problematic. As Croatia is becoming an EU member in July 2013, the future EU Cohesion policy becomes also important for national development policy. Through EU pre-accession funded projects, the first regional operational programmes have been drafted in the period 2001-2003. At that time, no NUTS classification of regions existed and focus was on counties, which today have NUTS III level status. Croatiaâ€™s regional policy was rather fragmented and oriented towards areas of special concern such as war torn areas, island, hilly and mountainous areas. The process of creating an integrated regional policy framework including a law, by-laws and a national strategy started in 2003 and ended in May 2010. Since then, all counties were obliged to formulate 3 year integrated strategic programmes involving local stakeholders into partnerships. The process is designed according to a legally prescribed methodology that is based on EU programming and partnership principles. On NUTS II level, functioning as statistical regions, three coordination partnerships of county representatives meet and discuss joint project proposals to be submitted to the national level institutions. These in turn try to establish project pipelines on national level to be ready for EU structural funding. The entire process is promising, but is full of complex and intertwined problems on all governance levels, which significantly influences policy implementation. While policymakers and public administrations are thinking more of the efficiency of the system and its institutions, the regional and local stakeholdersâ€™ and the research communityâ€™s attention is more on effectiveness of the policy. In order to establish regional governance system that works, cooperation and coordinated actions of all sides is required. The main aim of this paper is to present the evolution of the partnership based regional development approach in Croatia across governance levels and to critically reflect on the outcomes of this process. It is about the creation of new governance structures and new ways of how institutions work. Many problems appear along the way, but some positive experiences can be presented and analysed. Results from a recent survey and research study on experiences in regional development planning in all Croatian counties will be presented. Key words: regional development policy, cohesion policy, governance, institutions, strategic planning JEL: R58 (Regional Development Planning and Policy), H83 (Public Administration), P11 (Capitalist Planning, Coordination and Reform)
P11|The Making of Captains of Lives:Prison Reform in Singapore: 1999 to 2007|This book tells a story of successful prison reform that brought the recidivism rate of prisoners down from 44% to 24%. In the process of this reform, the entire Prison Service was transformed from a custody focused mindset to a rehabilitation centred culture. This change was wrought despite the lack of enthusiasm of the then political leadership.
P11|Finance and Governance in Developing Economies|Classic Big Push industrialization envisions state planners coordinating economic activity to internalize a range of externalities that otherwise lock in a low-income equilibrium, but runs afoul of well-known government failure problems. Successful Big Push coordination may occur instead when a large business group, acting in its controlling shareholder's self-interest, coordinates the establishment and expansion of businesses in diverse sectors. Where business groups play this role, many basic axioms of Anglo-American corporate governance, including the advocacy of shareholder value maximization and contestable corporate control, must be qualified.

Se estudia desde diversas perspectivas, el impacto que esas fuerzas y poderes han tenido en detrimento de uno de los sectores más importantes para el desarrollo del país, teniendo en cuenta que el sectorrural ha sido predominante en Colombia. Por último se hace un acercamientoal debate actual sobre políticas públicas agrarias desde diferentes miradas, con el fin de contribuir al estudio y comprensión delcaso colombiano.
P11|Which Institutions Encourage Entrepreneurs to Create Larger Firms?|We develop entrepreneurship and institutional theory to explain variation in different types of entrepreneurship across individuals and institutional contexts. Our framework generates hypotheses about the negative impact of higher levels of corruption, weaker property rights and especially intellectual property rights, and a larger state on entrepreneurs who plan to grow faster. We test these hypotheses using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor surveys in 55 countries for 2001-2006, applying a multilevel estimation framework. We confirm our main hypotheses but we find no significant impact from intellectual property rights.
P11|Subsidizing National Champions: An Evolutionary Perspective|A national-champions-related industrial policy has become (again) en vogue among European politicians. Against this background, our work orders different types of national champions along the industry lifecycle. Different types of locally bound externalities appear along the lifecycle. In a simple model, we show that it may be efficient to subsidize innovative firms in their early stages or to protect mature firms from competition to appropriate these externalities. However, non-benevolent politicians may not choose efficient policies. Real-world examples indicate that politicians tend to concentrate on externalities at the mature stage of the lifecycle. These externalities may be transitory or at the expense of foreign country consumers.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

Cet article étudie l’expérience européenne de l’analyse input-output en passant en revue certaines expériences nationales et en particulier les travaux de Richard Stone et de son équipe en Grande-Bretagne. Nous montrons en particulier comment depuis les années 1950 et plus récemment avec la création en 1989 du journal de l’International Input-Output Association, Economic System Research , les économistes européens ont pris le rôle de leader dans la recherche input-output, la tirant vers des considérations traditionnellement européennes plutôt théoriques.
P11|A ‘Walrasian Post-Keynesian’ model? Resolving the paradox of Oskar Lange's 1938 theory of interest|This paper investigates Oskar Lange’s 1938 article, “The Rate of Interest and the Optimum Propensity to Consume”, with the intention of providing a thorough interpretation of this rather obscure work. We explore in depth Lange’s theory of interest and its relationship with both Keynes’ General Theory (1936) and Hicks’ synthesis (1937), developing two graphical models that show the non-linearity of Lange’s investment function as well as the consequentiality of his equilibrium solution. Through an unedited manuscript, we also reconstruct Lange’s beliefs about the chronic sub-optimality of the capitalist economy and his scientific endorsement of the socialist economy. We conclude that the purposes of Lange’s article predate and are independent of the General Theory. They consisted of a theoretical generalization and analysis of institutional data, intended to separate economic theory from the tacit assumption of a capitalist economy.
P11|Macro-Regional Strategies|The EU’s economic policy is based on political experiment and innovation. We are placing the macro-regional strategies into this learning procedure and positioning them compared to the economic policy toolkit of the EU. After analysing and comparing these new concepts (Baltic Sea, Danube and other potential macro-regional strategies) we classify the EU’s economic policy in terms of implementation and coordination. Accordingly, macro-regional strategies are cooperative, have soft coordination and their territorial-functional focuses reflect increasing differentiation and integration. In our view, potentially feasible, more tightened fiscal and sectoral coordination through macro-regions can give a new impulse to the cooperation on EU level and improve EU’s competitiveness. Still, limited EU resources, insufficiently deep integration and softer coordination can all enhance the fragmentation further and can notably limit the room for manoeuvring of the EU in tackling external, internal challenges.

We structured our research on two chapters, as follows: the first one studies the main barriers affecting this process while the second analyze the major actions aimed at increasing the degree of financial integration of EMU markets. Our concluding remark outline that the reform of financial services is a key pillar of European growth and an essential complement to fiscal consolidation and structural change.
P11|“Economic freedom” and economic growth: questioning the claim that freer markets make societies more prosperous|A conventional reading of economic history implies that free market reforms rescued the world’s economies from stagnancy during the 1970s and 1980s. I reexamine a well-established econometric literature linking economic freedom to growth, and argue that their positive findings hinge on two problems: conceptual conflation and ahistoricity. When these criticisms are taken seriously, a very different view of the historical record emerges. There does not appear to be enduring relationship between economic liberalism and growth. Much of the observed relationship between these two variables involves a one-shot transition to freer markets around the Cold War’s end. Several concurrent changes took place in this historical context, and it is hasty to conclude that it was market liberalization alone that produced the economic turnaround of the 1990s and early-2000s. I also question market fundamentalists’ view that all forms of liberalization are helpful, arguing that the data show little to no benefit from reforms that did not attract foreign investment.
P11|Social Dividend Based on Overproduction|At present, although there are many cases of governments distributing money to their citizens, the fund sources are still very limited. This paper argues that, with overproduction as the material basis of a social dividend, it is possible to raise funding for this social dividend by issuing currency. This can not only expand the fund sources of the social dividend, but also help to solve the fundamental contradiction of capitalist overproduction and to realize socialism as soon as possible.

P11|Ulusal Kalkınma Sorunsalı Açısından Türkiye’de Kamu Yönetiminin Rolü ve Önemi|Globalization has led into a debate on the new roles of government including on economics, as well as public administration in general. Today’s trend of decentralization for public administration (in the sense of both service delivery and territorial facilities) is considered as being a pioneering power of national development and causes governments to constitute policies and required legislation in this direction. Anyone may come to ask these questions: Whether the lack of management for development policies and processes is a reason for main social, economical, political and cultural problems confronted by Turkey which has eagerly run for increasing its development since the last few centuries? Is it possible to find out effective solutions to these problems and to make a better development planning through focusing on the analysis of self-owned problems and sources? This study aims at discussing problematic issues of development administration in the context of new roles, tools, policies, and values of the current public administration, and to search for overcoming Turkey’s problems of development administration.
P11|The Serbian Regulatory Reform And Governance|More and more, society is becoming aware that regulations, while necessary, also impose high costs on individuals, businesses and the public sector. Regulations that are unclear, obsolete and bad-ly designed prevent achievement of the intended social and economic goals. Therefore, governments all over the world initiate programs on better regulation. As the Serbian government recognized the problem of a large number of inefficient regulations in its system, it enacted in July 2008 its regulatory reform project or its well known “guillotine” in-volving the one-time rendering of inefficient regulations ineffective or their amendment. After introduction, it is elaborated upon the drivers of the OECD and the European Union Pol-icy on Better Regulation, their experience in improving regulatory environment and policy lessons gained. The next part examines how the Serbian government actually goes about creating better busi-ness regulation. Here is the review of the Serbian Comprehensive Regulatory Reform or Regulatory Guillotine as a first stage in the Strategy of Regulatory Reform. The last part of article points to the coming challenges in governance architecture for steering regulatory reform in Serbia: credibility, evidence based solution for any kind of regulation problem, legitimacy, transparency.
P11|The Washington Consensus: Assessing a Damaged Brand - Working Paper 213|In this paper we analyze the Washington Consensus, which at its original formulation reflected views not only from Washington but also from Latin America. We trace the life of the Consensus from a Latin American perspective in terms of evolving economic development paradigms. We document the extensive implementation of Consensus-style reforms in the region as well as the mismatch between reformers’ expectations and actual outcomes, in terms of growth, poverty reduction, and inequality. We then present an assessment of what went wrong with the Washington Consensus-style reform agenda, using a taxonomy of views that put the blame, alternatively, on (i) shortfalls in the implementation of reforms combined with impatience regarding their expected effects; (ii) fundamental flaws—in either the design, sequencing, or basic premises of the reform agenda; and (iii) incompleteness of the agenda that left out crucial reform needs, such as volatility, technological innovation, institutional change and inequality.

P11|OECD recommends: A Consensus For or Against Welfare States? Evidence from a New Database|We describe the policy consensus in the OECD publication Economic Surveys, by constructing a database that contains both quotations and a quantification of the perceived reform need for 23 OECD countries around 1985, 1995 and 2005. Using the database, we examine whether or not the policy recommendations given by the OECD require welfare state cutbacks. We also examine how reform need correlates with social expenditure and income inequality. The recommendations in OECD Economic Surveys describe a policy consensus based on competition, work incentives, monetary reform, fiscal discipline and labor market reform. Reforms in these areas do not necessarily require welfare state cutbacks. Quantitatively, we find a significant positive correlation between reform need and social expenditure only for the mid 1990s, and no significant correlations between reform need and inequality. We conclude that OECD countries with large welfare states have managed to implement reforms without substantial welfare state retrenchment. The policy recommendations in Economic Surveys imply a restructuring of the welfare state but not necessarily welfare state cutbacks.
P11|Female Ministers, Governance and Reforms|In this paper, we test whether the gender composition of government affects the quality of governance and reform efforts, thus connecting the literature that documents the effects of gender on decision making to the literature on the determinants of reforms. We find that countries with a higher share of female ministers and a higher share of female MPs tend to score somewhat better in terms of regulatory quality and government effectiveness, and in terms of reforms in these areas, but also that tackling possible endogeneity shows most of these effects to be insignificant. Our results thus do not provide support for the claim that ‘conducting reforms is not women’s business’, they rather suggest that reform is as much women’s business as it is men’s business.
P11|National Strategies Necessary to the Development of the Rural Romanian Economy|Knowing, examining, ameliorating and developing the rural area, these are all activities of vital importance to a country, by the size of the rural area, expressed through the surface owned, as well as by the population weight occupied in productive activities, of socio-cultural services, of habitat and tourism. In the Report on the European Charter of the rural area, the board of agriculture and rural development of the European Council estimates that the rural area of Europe represents 85% of its total surface and affects, directly or indirectly, more than half of the European population. The rural Rumanian area also includes most of Romania’s surface, having, according to the statistics, a share of 93,7%. The importance of the rural area in Romania can be easily proved through the numerical stability of the rural population during 80 years. Thus, in the 20th century, in Romania, while the total of the country’s population grew by ten million of inhabitants, the rural population maintained, with little fluctuation, around the size of 10 to 12 million inhabitants. With all the rapid urbanization, as a result of the industrialization without precedent in the 21st century, considering the diminution of the occupied population in agriculture, sylviculture and pisciculture (without, however, diminishing also the rural population) and the diminution of the relative share of the agriculture in the internal gross profit, the importance of the rural area must not diminish, but on the contrary, needs to be more and more studied, examined and submitted to a complex development process. The share of the rural population and of the surface occupied by the rural area, as well as the importance of rural life to a country, turn the aspect of the rural development and management into a problem of high proportions and of both national and international importance.
P11|Institutions and Economic Reforms|Recent studies in economic development seek to establish that institutional quality is an important determinant of long-run living standards. Moreover, it appears that property rights institutions are causal for development whereas contracting institutions affect the nature of financial intermediation in the economy. I use these results to explore two questions. If property rights institutions matter for economic growth, can they help explain large-scale reform surprises? The reforms in Western Germany in 1948 are viewed as 'miraculous' whereas those in the early 1990s in the former Soviet transition economies are viewed as disappointing. I argue that the former had a limited task because they only had to restore existing property rights institutions whereas the latter had to create new ones and find new owners for assets. The second question is whether the persistence of variety in contracting institutions across countries that have developed successfully has implications for the design of financial and corporate governance reforms.
P11|The transition of China and Ussr: A political economy perspective|This paper will focus on how the transition in China differs from that of USSR in terms of the Big Bang (shock therapy) and the Gradualist approach. While many econometric studies show that nations which apply both shock therapy and or gradualism end up at the same point, making the debate unnecessary, the author believes that gradualism was far more successfully implemented than the latter. When reforming the structure of the economy, it has to be remembered that a market based solution is a means not an end and it is more important “getting it right” than transitioning as fast as possible to ensure a level of playing field and long term sustainable growth.
P11|Neoliberalism’s relationship with economic growth in the developing world: Was it the power of the market or the resolution of financial crisis?|"This article examines the relationship between ""economic freedom"" and economic growth. Previous studies have found a positive relationship between economic growth rates and ""economic freedom"", and used this relationship as a basis for arguing that more liberal economic policies promote development. ""Economic freedom"" conflates laissez-faire policy with other important concepts, like good governance and macroeconomic stability. When laissez-faire is parsed from these other concepts, it shows no positive relationship with growth outside of the early-1990s, a period in which financially-strained developing governments and financial systems enjoyed debt bailouts in exchange for liberalization reforms. Further analysis shows that laissez-faire exerts no discernible effect on economic growth net of the debt relief, inflation containment and improved inward investment that occurred after the Cold War. I argue that free market capitalism itself may not have promoted economic development in the post-Cold War era. Instead, free market reforms occurred alongside domestic and international political developments that helped developing countries resolve a serious financial crises, and that the resolution of these crises were most important in explaining the comparative prosperity of the 1990s and 2000s."

P11|China's increasing policy shift towards more sustainable growth|Many have increasingly questioned if and how Chinese policy has evolved or will evolve to ensure that the country’s development is not only focused on immediate economic growth, but also economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. This paper addresses this question by tracing key issues in China’s past and current path to development. It finds that China is clearly increasingly shifting its policies to foster more sustainable growth, which provides a good indication that its upcoming policies will head in the same positive direction.
P11|Der systematische Ort der Moral ist die Ethik! Einige kritische Anmerkungen zur oekonomischen Ethik Karl Homanns (Ethics is the Systematic Place of Morality! A Critical Comment on Karl Homann’s ‘Economic Ethics’)|Mit Blick auf die Funktionslogik moderner Wirtschaftsgesellschaften zielt Karl Homanns Ansatz einer „oekonomischen Ethik“ auf die Rekonstruktion der Moral „in terms of economics“, um so moralische Forderungen direkt in die Funktionslogik der Oekonomie integrieren zu koennen. Moral, so die zentrale These Homanns, laesst sich nur durch die Implementierung allgemein verpflichtender Regeln auf Ebene einer Rahmenordnung durchsetzen, die alle Akteure in gleicher Weise bindet. Jedoch bewirkt diese Verschiebung moralischer Anforderungen ausschliesslich auf die Makroebene der Rahmenordnung und die damit einhergehende Bewertung moralischer Forderungen nach ihrer oekonomischen Nuetzlichkeit, dass Homann die Bedeutung individueller Moral gerade auch in der modernen Gesellschaft unterschaetzt und diese systematisch aus seinem Ansatz ausblendet. Indessen gilt es, so die Argumentation unseres Beitrages, die Bedeutung individueller Moral auch im Kontext der Wirt-schafts- und Unternehmensethik neu zu ueberdenken und ihr erneut einen systematischen Stellenwert zuzuweisen. (In consideration of the functional logic of modern economic societies Karl Homann’s approach of “Economic Ethics” aims at recon-structing morality in terms of economics by integrating moral demands into the logic of economic theories. According to Homann, morality in modern economic societies depends on the ability to enforce moral norms by formal regulations binding all actors to commonly accepted norms the same manner. But, by shifting moral considerations exclusively to the macro-level of a political frame order and assessing moral regulations solely according to their economic usefulness, Homann misses the point of which role morality plays even in the modern society and systematically fades out the importance of individual morality. In this article we plead for reconsidering the important role of individual morality and replacing it into the systematic context of business ethics.)
P11|Impacts and Benefits of COAG Reforms: Reporting Framework|The Commission has been requested to report every two to three years to COAG on the economic 'impacts and benefits' of COAG reforms. The Commission is also required to consider the extent to which Australia's reform potential is being achieved and opportunities for improvement. In preparation for its first report, the Commission has been requested to provide this framework report outlining its proposed approach. The Commission's 'framework' report was released in January 2011. It sets out for COAG's consideration the broad approach and a sequence of reporting priorities that the Commission could follow in its substantive reports. It highlights the need to look at both the direct and indirect impacts of any reform, and to recognise that not all of the impacts in some areas will be measureable in economic terms. Assessments will also require varying degrees of judgement, and these will need to be informed by effective consultation processes. The Commission has proposed that its first substantial report could cover reforms in the competition and regulation area, and reforms in the education area within the 'human capital' stream.
P11|The Aggregation of Individual Distributive Preferences through the Distributive Liberal Social Contract : Normative Analysis|We consider abstract social systems of private property, made of n individuals endowed with non-paternalistic interdependent preferences, who interact through exchanges on competitive markets and Pareto-efficient lumpsum transfers. The transfers follow from a distributive liberal social contract defined as a redistribution of initial endowments such that the resulting market equilibrium allocation is both Pareto-efficient relative to individual interdependent preferences, and unanimously weakly preferred to the initial market equilibrium. We notably elicit two global properties of Pareto-efficient redistribution in smooth differentiable social systems of the type above. The first one is the separability of allocation and distribution: Pareto-efficient redistribution leaves unaltered the role of market prices in the coordination of market exchanges, as expressed, notably, by the existence and efficiency properties of competitive equilibrium. The second one is the global structure of the set of Pareto-efficient allocations: its relative interior is a simply connected smooth manifold of dimension n-1, homeomorphic to the relative interior of the unit-simplex of Rn. Both properties obtain under three suitable conditions on the partial preordering of Pareto associated with individual interdependent preferences, which essentially state that: the social utility functions built from weighted sums of individual interdependent utilities, by means of arbitrary positive weights, exhibit a property of differentiable nonsatiation and some suitably defined property of inequality aversion; and individuals have diverging views on redistribution, in some suitable sense, at (inclusive) distributive optima. The set of market equilibrium allocations associated with the transfers of the inclusive distributive liberal social contracts then consists of the maxima, in the set of attainable allocations unanimously weakly preferred to the initial market equilibrium, of the weighted sums of individual interdependent utilities derived from arbitrary vectors of positive weights of R++ n. Its relative interior is a simply connected smooth manifold of dimension n-1 whenever the initial market equilibrium is not Paretoefficient relative to individual interdependent preferences. It is shown, finally, that the liberal social contract’s inclusive solutions for redistribution, so characterized, maximize a family of social welfare functionals that verify Arrow’s non-dictatorship axiom and Sen’s liberty axiom for the social systems to which it applies.
P11|Democracy and reforms|The authors use a sample of 147 countries to investigate the link between democracy and reforms. Democracy may be conducive to reforms, because politicians have the incentive to embrace growth-enhancing reforms to win elections. By contrast, authoritarian regimes do not have to worry as much about public opinion and may undertake reforms that are painful in the short run but bring future prosperity. This paper tests these hypotheses, using data on micro-economic reforms from the World Bank's Doing Business database. These data do not suffer the endogeneity issues associated with other datasets on changes in economic institutions. The results provide robust support for the claim that democracy is good for growth-enhancing reforms.
P11|Impacto de la reforma al sistema de pensiones en México sobre el ahorro|When the Mexican Pension Reform was discussed, one of the principal points argued in its favor was the positive effect over national savings. This paper carries out the first measurement of that impact using mandatory savings. We estimate a mandatory savings time series for Mexico and its relationship with voluntary private savings. Our results suggest that ten years after the reform, mandatory savings in conjunction with the change in public savings have a positive, but small, impact over national savings. There is no evidence of neutralization between voluntary and mandatory savings.
P11|Impacto de la reforma al sistema de pensiones en México sobre el ahorro|Uno de los principales argumentos esgrimidos en la reforma al sistema de pensiones en México fue su impacto positivo en el ahorro. Este trabajo realiza una primera cuantificación de este impacto. Para ello se estima una serie de ahorro contractual generado por este programa, así como la relación que esta variable guarda con el ahorro privado voluntario. Los resultados obtenidos sugieren que el ahorro contractual y los cambios en el ahorro público generados a diez años de la reforma al esquema de pensiones en México poseen efectos positivos en el ahorro y no existe un efecto compensación entre ahorro voluntario y el contractual.

P11|Analysis of reaching the Lisbon Strategy targets at the national level: the EU-27 and Slovenia|Adopted by the European Council in 2000, the Lisbon Strategy is a long-term strategy whose main target is to make Europe the most competitive, dynamic and knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. During the 2005 mid-term review, the Lisbon Strategy refocused its two main targets on economic growth and employment, and formally integrated the Cohesion policy into its implementation. In spite of the review, the efforts to meet the strategic targets have proven insufficient at both the EU and Slovenian levels. While certain progress has been observed, the strategy should be further adjusted, coordinated and supplemented at the national and pan-European levels so that the Lisbon targets can be attained. The article investigates the current stage of the achievement of the targets, using the time-distance method to calculate the time lead or lag in implementing the Lisbon Strategy targets at the levels of the European Union and Slovenia.
P11|Fiscal Transfers and Structural Reforms in the European Monetary Union|In a monetary union, fiscal transfers are an important policy tool to adjust to asymmetric shocks. However, fiscal transfers cannot substitute structural reforms especially when shocks are permanent. In this way, the design of fiscal transfer systems determine whether structural reforms or non-reforming is preferred by governments. Inter-regional transfers provide the lowest incentive for structural reforms. Inter-temporal transfers might promote structural reforms as long as debt cannot be accumulated. Therefore, I oppose an EU-tax budget, call for a strict application of the Stability and Growth Pact, and explain low reform activity in the EMU by interest rate convergence.
P11|Problém zastoupení v nové institucionální ekonomii<BR>[The Agency Problem in New Institutional Economics]|The aim of the paper is to set the agency problem into a broad context of New Institutional Economics with an emphasis on historical connections. In the first section, I explain the historical evolution of basic theoretical concepts like the theory of firm, the theory of market process and the theory of property rights. The second section is dedicated to the explanation of the general concept of agency problem extended with the problem of asymmetric information leading to adverse selection and the problem of moral hazard, in context of previous historical connections. In the last section, the author provides some suggestions for the further theoretical and empirical research.
P11|Why Capitalism Survives Crises: The Shock Absorbers|[Part I] The leading part of this volume, authored by Simon Stander and true to the interdisciplinary nature of political economy, focuses attention on why capitalism survives crises by developing the novel argument that it has moved on from its 19th century embodiment to include a class of shock absorbers. This class, consisting of fractionalised individuals, absorbs the massive surpluses of produced commodities while buffering capitalism against the declines of values during crises of the financial system. This gives rise to Reformism, rather than class conflict, which becomes a central feature in the political arena. The absorptive class in its dialectical relationship to the other two major classes, capitalist and working class, is vital for this reformist tendency; in this context consideration of the individual in a narcissistic social environment also becomes a focus of attention. With its distinct importance, the absorptive class helps glue capitalist economy and state together, and this provides an understanding of the contradiction between the need for a 'big' state in the interest of the absorption of commodities and the 'small state' in the interest of efficient resource allocation and profit. [Part II] The second part of the volume considers the application and conceptualization of the value theory by leading academics in political economy and concludes with an exposition of the methodology differences between two important Japanese marxian economists.
P11|Infrastructure of the Market Economy|Infrastructure is the economic growth framework of the market economy. The missing comprehensive approach to infrastructure corresponds to the practiced neglect of the long-term policy objective of economic growth in the economic order of the German social market economy since its creation after World War II. Starting from Jochimsen's distinction of material, institutional and personal infrastructure, infrastructure policy as an indirect approach to economic growth policy is suggested. The main reason for this approach is our lack of knowledge about the process and results of future economic growth. With respect to the three categories of infrastructure selected aspects are discussed. Concerning material infrastructure now a definition is presented that can be integrated into a general definition of infrastructure. Regarding institutional infrastructure, after the presentation of relevant terms (rule, order, institution, organization) the analysis of important implications of institutional economics and its integration into constitutional economics follows. As to personal infrastructure, a quantitative component (population) and a qualitative component (human capital) are consistently distinguished and their determinants systematically elaborated. The determinants of human capital are education and learning from experience, research and development as the production of new knowledge or technological progress (inventions, innovations and diffusion of innovations). All of these considerations can be brought together in a general definition of the infrastructure of a market economy so far missing. Basically, this definition refers to a number of specifically characterized individual economic agents interacting under secure living conditions according to certain rules in the presence and the future. The analysis of infrastructure in a growing economy essentially leads to the result that personal infrastructure, especially human capital, is most important for structuring future economic growth. In the growth process, material and institutional infrastructure depend on personal infrastructure which in turn is influenced by material infrastructure (producing existence goods and services) and institutional infrastructure (e.g., population and education policy). Thus we discover infrastructure of the market economy to constitute a system in the sense of systems theory. Personal infrastructure of today may determine economic growth in the medium, long, and very long term, whereas institutional and material infrastructure indicate, as a rule, to have shorter reference periods. Due to its character, material infrastructure must be controlled and permanently maintained within the medium term. What is needed is a comprehensive and balanced time-oriented infrastructure policy approach, observing the natural environment, to settle the growth problems of the market economy. This approach would result in a revision of the present economic order of the social market economy.

P11|Inter-linkages between Development Research and Policy Planning - Analytical Lessons from Indian Experiences in the Post Reforms Period|India is a success story of economic reforms. Because of its vast size, it also provides a good example of having a wide network of research institutes, and effective linkages between development research, policy planning and outcome. Country case study on India makes a critical appraisal of theses linkages attempted since 1991 in external sector reforms (which were very comprehensive and successful), privatization strategy and policies (which were incomplete and partially successful) and labor markets reforms (which remained non-starter and unsuccessful). Linkages between research-policy-implementation are very complex in a democratic set-up like India. The study supports the findings of other studies on BRP that the political institutional context is the most important factor determining the scope and extent of linkages among research, policy and implementation. Reforms in the external sector were most comprehensive and met lesser resistance from the political parties as the working class was not affected adversely by these policies. On the other hand, progress of privatization and labor market reforms was slow and the scope was very limited due to political economy constraints. Despite various studies done in India indicating substantial benefits from liberalization of labor markets over a medium and long term, Indian labor laws still remain highly restrictive. Most of the research studies were ignored by the policy makers due to strong resistance from the trade unions and left parties who now support the coalition government at the centre. Both researchers and policy makers agree that factors influencing successful uptake of research include significance and quality of research, good reputation of a research institute and its proximity to the government, qualifications and international experiences of policy makers, and involvement of all stakeholders from the early stages of research. Another important lesson of the study is that most of the research is not policy oriented and many policies are not research based, while setting up working/ expert/ advisory groups serves as a key mechanism for bridging research and policy. The study examines the strengths and weaknesses of interlinkages in terms of quality, relevance, extent of intra-communications, modes of links, dissemination and institutional arrangements, and recommends feasible measures for effective policy dialogue, efficient organizational and institutional set up and future policy agenda.
P11|Benchmarking the Lisbon Strategy|"This paper reviews the governance framework of the Lisbon Strategy and discusses the specific option of increasing the role of benchmarking as a means of improving the implementation record of structural reforms in the European Union. Against this background, the paper puts forward a possible avenue for developing a strong form of quantitative benchmarking, namely ranking. The ranking methodology relies on the construction of a synthetic indicator using the ""benefit of the doubt"" approach, which acknowledges differences in emphasis among Member States with regard to structural reform priorities. The methodology is applied by using the structural indicators that have been commonly agreed by the governments of the Member States, but could also be used for ranking exercises on the basis of other indicators.

P11|Institutionnalisation des régimes de gouvernance et rôle des institutions socles:le cas de la cogestion allemande|(VF)L’un des traits distinctifs du système de gouvernance à l’allemande est la représentation paritaire des salariés au sein des conseils de surveillance des grandes entreprises. Souvent considérée comme «culturellement» allemande, le présent article montre cependant qu’une supposée «tradition allemande» de cogestion relève du mythe. Le régime de gouvernance allemand est plutôt le fruit du contexte politique et institutionnel dramatique de la fin des années 1940 qui a vu des luttes et la mobilisation des acteurs politiques, économiques et syndicaux. Pour expliquer qu’un consensus institutionnel sur la cogestion ait finalement eu lieu en Allemagne dans une période de chaos institutionnel, nous montrons le rôle méconnu joué par l’Église catholique allemande. À la fois étrangère par nature à la question du gouvernement des entreprises, mais fortement impliquée dans les réflexions sur l’organisation du pouvoir économique avant et après la seconde guerre mondiale, elle a constitué une «institution socle» à partir de laquelle les effets de mobilisation ont pu générer un consensus sur la cogestion, qui s’est s’institutionnalisé dans le modèle dual paritaire, considéré depuis comme «typiquement germanique».(VA) Codetermined supervisory boards with half of the directors representing employees are one of the distinctive features of the German corporate governance system.

P11|A kapitalizmus néhány rendszerspecifikus vonása<BR>[Some system-specific features of capitalism]|A szerző korábban a szocialista rendszer és a posztszocialista átmenet elemzésére használta azt a szemléletet és módszertant, amelyet rendszerparadigmának nevezett el. A jelen tanulmány a kapitalizmus néhány általános vonásának vizsgálatára alkalmazza ezt a megközelítést. A cikk - fogalmi tisztázás után - példákat sorol fel a kapitalizmus néhány rendszerspecifikus vonására, majd kettővel részletesebben foglalkozik. Az egyik: a rendszer dinamizmusa. Az elmúlt évszázad nagy újításai, amelyek mélyrehatóan átalakították nemcsak a termelés technológiáját, hanem az emberek mindennapi életét is, a kapitalista rendszer és annak főszereplője, a vállalkozó vezette be és terjesztette el. Csak a kapitalizmusban tud kialakulni a vállalkozás és újítás mechanizmusa, az ehhez szükséges erőteljes ösztönzés és rugalmas tőkepiac. A másik példa: a kapitalista rendszer immanens tulajdonsága a munkaerőpiacon jelentkező tartós többlet, szemben a szocialista rendszerrel, amelynek kifejlett formájában tartós munkaerőhiány mutatkozik. Elméletileg és tapasztalatilag is igazolható, hogy minél dinamikusabb a kapitalista gazdaság állandó átalakulása, annál inkább keletkezik strukturális munkanélküliség. A hatékony bér elmélete megmagyarázza, miért érdeke a munkaadónak, hogy a piactisztító bérnél magasabb bért fizessen, és ezzel munkanélküliséget idézzen elő. A kapitalizmus reformálható rendszer. Ám ügyelni kell arra, hogy a részreformok között milyen a kapcsolat. Szerencsés esetben kiegészítik egymást. Ám ennél sokkal gyakoribb, hogy miközben szembeszállunk a rendszer egyik kedvezőtlen hajlamával, utat engedünk egy másik kedvezőtlen hajlam megerősödésének.

P11|"Mouvements de masse et organisations de classe en Amérique Latine aujourd'hui. ALBA, sortie du FMI, BancoSur et ""socialisme du XXIe siècle"""|This paper analyses both the recent transformations of capitalism in Latin America and the popular resistances of mass movements and class organizations. The revolutionary progresses observed on this continent are also examined, in particular the failure of the FTAA, the opening of the ALBA, the negociations for the constitution of PetroSur and the proposals to go out of the IMF and to create a BancoSur. Finally, we discuss the needs to rebuild an active internationalism and the basis of a project of socialist transition in the difficult conditions of the twenty-first century
P11|Reforma da Administração Pública: Antes e Depois da Democracia<BR>[Public Administration Reforms: Before and After Democracy]|After the micro politics, the complexity of the “public management”, polity and policies, is the same of the “private management” or the management of the others sectors of the social production reality. The science of management it is not defined by products, functions, sectors and so on, as occurs in the economic as discipline with it focus on finance or bank. The reasons for the activity of public and the private management are the same: the persons (market). In a post-modernism way and by influence or “imposition” of non-public big organizations, nowadays, we said “objectives”, corporate, agency theory and others best and next steps like new public management. In this form any drive is valid and, after all, the driver don’t require any content. In that form, we are entering in the world of anaesthetics impressionisms and modernism. The costs, crisis and bankruptcy of that are enormous. Nowadays we know it, but, in fact, we know it since 1960-1980 by project PIMS, MBO, bureaucracy/autocracy and others mechanics budgets accounts. That idealisticism and arithmetic management, economics, and influent organizations put in market one socio-psychologism and not an objective management. So, by descriptive and evidence mode, we conclude that when it applied in public administration, independently of the regime, the desired reform of the organization –in a strategic line, “society”- not occurs.
P11|A troubled relationship: corruption and reform of the public sector in development|Corruption is an issue of increasing visibility in the academic and policy literature on governance and public policy. Whilst it is often talked about, there appears to be some lack of clarity on both its nature and the nature of its determinants. This has led to some increase in the effort to combat it (in light of its significant costs for society) and it is questionable how effective these attempts have been to date. Corruption has a complex relationship with public sector reform. Reform is often executed which has as one of its objectives the control of corruption, but reform itself may be a cause of corruption according to some evidence from recent rounds of economic and public sector reform. The nature of the relationship is complicated by the fundamental nature of public sector reform. This is often ‘dual’ in nature, combining both destructive and constructive phases that redistribute the relative power of internal and external interest groups, create grievances, and present new opportunities for incumbents when compared to the pre-reform position. This paper presents an analysis of some of the data on corruption in relation to public sector reform, and attempts to clarify the nature of the corruption phenomenon in order to answer the question whether corruption can categorically be said to be a problem of public sector reform, or a consequence of it.
