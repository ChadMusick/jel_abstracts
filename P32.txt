P32|Communal Property Rights and Deforestation|Almost a third of world’s forest area is under communal management. In principle, this arrangement could lead to a “tragedy of the commons” and therefore more deforestation. But monitoring outsider’s deforestation may be easier if the owner is a community rather than an individual. We study the effect of communal titling on deforestation in Colombia using a difference-in-discontinuities strategy that compares areas just outside and inside a title, before and after titling. We find that deforestation decreased in communal areas after titling. Interestingly, we find evidence of positive spillovers of reduced deforestation in nearby areas.
P32|Cheap Talk and Coordination in the Lab and in the Field: Collective Commercialization in Senegal|Coordination is central to social interactions. Theory and conventional lab experiments suggest that cheap talk/communication can enhance coordination under certain conditions. Two aspects that remain underexplored are (1) the interaction between the number of players (group size) and communication and (2) how existing findings might play out in the field. We address both of these by studying a typical naturally-occurring setting that requires coordination; that is, one where members of agricultural cooperatives seek to jointly sell their output. Combining artefactual/lab-in-the-field experiments (LFEs), natural field experiments (RCTs), surveys, and cooperative records, we find that (1) revealing farmers' intended sales (i.e., cheap talk/communication) yields enhanced collective commercialization (i.e., coordination), particularly in larger groups; (2) such cheap talk may lead to higher incomes for small-scale farmers; (3) participants transfer learning from the LFEs thus affecting subsequent behavior in the RCTs (i.e., the day-to-day environment). Our results contribute to existing literature by highlighting the potential for cheap-talk institutions to (1) boost coordination, particularly in settings with greater strategic uncertainty (e.g., larger farmer cooperatives), and (2) promote collective entrepreneurship and development.
P32|An application of a two-step Delphi model in identification of factors affecting the competitive performance of the South African citrus industry| This paper seeks to understand the underlying factors driving the success or failure of the competitive performance of the South African citrus industry. In order to do this, a two-step Delphi technique was employed to capture the opinions from selected citrus industry experts. These views were obtained using a questionnaire designed in the form of Porter Diamond model. Results reveal that a range of endogenous and exogenous factors affects positively and/or negatively the competitive success of industry. The enhancing factors include the both the quality and availability of local input suppliers, economies of scale, diversity in foreign markets and quality of private funded research. Those negatively affecting the industry include both availability and quality of skilled citrus labour, current tax system, consumer education, labour policy, administrative regulations and quality of government-funded research. From these factors, displayed in a X-Y scatterplot of �impact ratings��based on first-step Delphi results and �relevance scores� �based on the second step Delphi results, strategies were drawn to improve the competitive success of the industry, for all determinants that were highly correlated. Key words; Citrus industry, South Africa, Delphi analysis, competitiveness, Porter Diamond model. JEL CLASSIFICATION: Q17, P32
P32|American Radical Economists in Maoâ€™s China: From Hopes to Disillusionment|American radical economists in the 1960s perceived China under Maoism as an important experiment in creating a new society, aspects of which they hoped could serve as a model for the developing world. But the knowledge of â€˜actually existing Maoismâ€™ was very limited due to the mutual isolation between China and the US. This paper analyses the First Friendship Delegation of American Radical Political Economists (FFDARPE) to the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China in 1972, consisting mainly of Union for Radical Political Economics (URPE) members, which was the first visit of a group of American economists to China since 1949. Based on interviews with trip participants as well as archival and published material, this paper studies what we can learn about the engagement with Maoism by American radical economists from their dialogues with Chinese hosts, from their on-the-ground observations, and their reflection upon return. We show how the visitorsâ€™ own ideas conflicted and intersected with their perception of the Maoist practice on gender relations; workersâ€™ management and life in the communes. We also shed light on the diverging conceptions of the role for economic expertise between URPE and late Maoism. As the first in-depth study on the FFDARPE we provide rich empirical insights into an ice-breaking event in the larger process of normalization in the Sino- U.S relations, that ultimately led to the disillusionment of the Left with China.
P32|Community Energy in Italy: Heterogeneous institutional characteristics and citizens engagement|Community energy (CE) initiatives for investments in the energy sector have been progressively spreading across Europe and are increasingly proposed as innovative and alternative approaches to guarantee higher citizens participation in the transition toward cleaner energy systems. This paper focuses the attention on Italy, a Southern European country characterized by relatively low CE sector development. It fills a gap in the literature by eliciting and presenting novel and comprehensive evidence on the recent Italian CE sector development. Through a step-wise approach it systematically map and review Italian CE initiatives, exploring heterogeneity in their institutional characteristics and analysing implications in terms of outcomes delivered and citizens' engagement. It finds a very novel CE sector, still at its niche level and characterized by a wide diversity of implementation approaches. The analysis allows to identify two alternative patterns in institutional characteristics which differently shape citizens engagement and outcomes delivered. The role of policy and its relevance for a renewed CE sector growth is also highlighted and discussed.
P32|The Analysis of Community Empowerment Process through Poor Community Group (The Comparative Study of Pilot and Replication Areas)|"""Objective – The objectives of this study are to find out how to empower the poor through community groups (Pokmaskin) at Wukirsari village. The second objective is to create a model for community empowerment with the basic of comparative for pilot and replication area. Methodology/Technique – The first method is Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to analyse the factors that affect the community empowerment through poor society in the pilot areas and the area will be used replication analysis. The second method will use qualitative method with Focus Group Discussion and in-depth interview to answer how the empowerment model that is right for the poor in urban and rural areas. FGD involve various stakeholders in the area of both the elements of society, leaders, NGOs and government. Findings – The result showed that the factors which is the most influenced on the community development as perceived by members of community groups in the pilot and replication areas are, internal factors, institutional factor and external factor. Increasing the internal factor with increased motivation main target group members in the community empowerment; increasing institutional support in the form of legality, the role of local government, support from community leaders, encourages community motivation, formed to develop the organization; and empower all stakeholders, especially the private sector to provide support in training, financial, increase production and marketing. Novelty – The study uses Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Focus Group Discussion to reach the results."""
P32|Economic Vitality of Communities for Urban Development: the Case of the Cities from Country of Small Economy|Economic vitality of community is one of the main factors and conditions for successful urban development. The article present the theoretical and empirical analysis of the concept of economic vitality of urban community in the country of small economy. The objective of the paper is to identify the challenges and factors of improving the economic vitality of community in cities of a country with a small economy and to develop the strategic recommendations and measures for strengthening the economic vitality of the community. Methods used: literature studies, document analysis, statistical data analysis, expert interview, survey, case analysis, Space Syntax analysis. The research showed that the communities in the country of small economy are still not entrepreneur and economically vital; there’s a lack of cooperation cultural and experience among of communities and businesses; there are favorable conditions to promote community (economic) vitality. Strategies to encourage and facilitate business and community cooperation at the local government level are necessary. Communities and companies are ready to cooperate together, but the cooperation based on shared value is not grown up yet. The article concludes with recommendations for promotion the vitality of communities and cooperation with business.
P32|Will climate change benefit or hurt Russian grain production? A statistical evidence from a panel approach<BR>[Wird der Klimawandel der russischen Getreideproduktion nutzen oder schaden? Statistische Evidenz auf der Grundlage eines Panel-Ansatzes]|We conduct an examination of the climate effect to analyze the historical dependence of grain production on temperatures and precipitation levels, and project this dependence to estimate the productivity of different grain types in the mid- and long-terms, given four greenhouse gas concentration pathways. We find that altering temperatures have an equivocal effect on agriculture. The most productive zones of the southern black soil belt is projected to face considerable declines in yields, due to insufficient precipitation levels and high probability of heat waves during the summer vegetation period. The northern part, on the contrary, can experience increases in productivity as a result of milder and drier winters and warmer springs.
P32|The Impact of Insurance Provision on Household Production and Financial Decisions|This paper uses a natural experiment to study the impact of an agricultural insurance program on household production, borrowing, and saving behavior. The empirical strategy includes difference-in-differences and triple difference estimations. The results show that insurance provision increases the insured crop production by 16 percent and raises borrowing by 29 percent. Interestingly, it does not affect total household savings; however, it does affect the relative proportion of flexible-term savings. Furthermore, effects on production and savings persist in the long run, while effects on borrowing are significant in only the medium run. Lastly, calibration results suggest that the policy is both welfare improving and cost-effective. (JEL D13, D14, G22, O16, P32, P36, Q12)
P32|Examining Irish farmers’ awareness of climate change and the factors affecting the adoption of an advisory tool for the reduction of GHG emissions| Livestock is a very significant sector in Irish agriculture and it could possibly mitigate a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions. However, farmers’ awareness and acceptance towards climate change might be a significant barrier to voluntary adoption of best practice techniques. This paper presents results from a supplementary survey of 747 Irish farmers conducted as part of the National Farm Survey (NFS) in 2014, with a view to understanding farmers’ awareness of and attitudes to climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Survey results showed that there was a general uncertainty towards a number of agricultural GHG emissions related questions and that farmers’ attitude towards GHG emissions reduction was not very positive. In order to explore further farmers’ attitudes towards climate change, a multinomial logit model was used to examine the socio-economic factors that affect farmers’ willingness to adopt an advisory tool that would show the potential reduction in GHG emissions from the adoption of new technologies. Results showed that investment in machinery, awareness, region, environmental subsidies, use of social networking, agri-training encouraged adoption while off-farm income was negatively related to adoption.
P32|Incentive provision to farm workers in post-socialist settings: evidence from East Germany and North Kazakhstan|This article explores the current practice of motivating agricultural workers in post-socialist settings. In addition, it attempts to evaluate the different wage systems observed in reality and better understand under which conditions they are reformed. It does so by contrasting the experience of two extreme cases representing fast and slow reform advance, East Germany and North Kazakhstan. The primary data for the analysis comes from cross-sectional farm surveys conducted by various researchers in both countries. East German farmers quickly replaced the inherited Soviet-style piece rate payment system by simple time rate schemes, augmented by wage premia for certain performance parameters, especially in livestock. To the contrary, the piece rate approach persists in many farms in North Kazakhstan. Moreover, the latter rarely use non-wage incentives to motivate their workers. In Kazakhstan, farms using either mixed systems or pure piece rates were more productive than the reference group using pure time rates. Labour cost per worker were lowest for pure time rate systems in both countries, followed by mixed bonus systems, whereas pure piece rate systems implied the highest cost in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstani managers tend to move away from the Soviet piece rate system if external investors become engaged in farming operations.

P32|The Impact Of Cross-Border Acquisitions In Serbia On Productivity, Wages, And Employment|Globalization created a new business environment, characterized by intensive privatization and economic liberalization. The changed business environment opened the way to increased use of crossborder acquisitions, which make the lion’s share of foreign direct investment in transition economies. The acquisitions accelerate transition, facilitating the restructuring of state-owned enterprises and making them more efficient. This paper analyses the impact of cross-border acquisitions in Serbia, an economy in transition, on employee productivity, employment, and wages in acquisition targets. Statistical analysis of a sample comprising 79 cross-border acquisitions carried out in Serbia in the period 2003-2009 shows that the change of ownership had a positive impact on employee productivity and real wages, while the number of employees in the acquired enterprises decreased.
P32|Desarrollo sostenible: enfoques desde las ciencias económicas|El concepto de desarrollo sostenible ha sido objeto de gran discusión y controversia durante décadas, de cuestionamientos y debates teórico–prácticos en el ámbito disciplinar económico. Las teorías que soportan esta diversidad conceptual permiten identificar en el tiempo no solo la construcción del concepto, sino también la transformación que este sufre, ya sea por parte de enfoques disciplinares o también multidisciplinares, como una diversidad de posturas frente a la evolución del mismo. A partir de allí surge la necesidad de relacionar algunos elementos clave, así como los diferentes puntos del desarrollo sostenible, dadas las condiciones que dieron origen a este desde la economía como ciencia social.
P32|Religious origins of democracy & dictatorship|Weber considered the Protestant work ethic the foundation of modern capitalism. I extend Weber's theory by arguing that states with predominantly Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Muslim populations have had a stronger inclination toward underdevelopment and dictatorship than states with Protestant or Jewish majorities. This is the case because their respective religious collectives (monastery, tariqa) promote the hierarchical provision of common goods at the expense of market incentives. I define the aforementioned three religions as collectivist, in contrast to Protestantism and Judaism, which I define as individualist. I provide a historical overview that designates the Jewish kibbutz as the collective of democracy and the Eastern Orthodox monastery as the collective of dictatorship. Focusing on collectivist economies, I find that modernization, as a credible commitment to the improved future provision of public goods, occurs when the threat of a radical government is imminent and when the leader has high extraction of rents from the economy. The emergence of radical governments is more likely in collectivist than in individualist economies. Historical illustrations from collectivist economies include the Russian Revolution, the Islamic Revolution in Iran, and the postwar welfare state in Western Europe.
P32|Market Impacts of New Land Market Regulations in Eastern EU Member States|The objective of this paper is to review new restrictions imposed on land sales in selected Eastern EU Member States and to investigate the potential impacts of these restrictions on land prices, transaction distortions, and access to land. The main common element of the new regulations across the four studied countries (Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia) is the introduction of the pre-emption rights to selected groups of potential buyers which tend to favor domestic and local farmers relative to external competition. However, the coverage of pre-emption rights differs strongly across countries. The regulation adopted in Slovakia is the most restrictive, followed by Latvia and Poland; Romania has adopted the least restrictive measures. We expect market transactions as well as land prices to decline due to reduced competition, causing foregone income to non-farming landowners.
P32|Land Markets in Europe: Institutions and Market Outcomes|In this chapter, we review land market institutions in the European Union (EU) and their potential impact on land markets. We first review land tenure-/ownership regulations and find that they vary heavily across EU Member States. Four types of tenure-/ownership measures are implemented in the EU: to protect the tenant, to protect the owner, to protect the (non-farm) land owner, and to prevent land fragmentation. We then examine EU land-related environmental regulations whose general objective is to address land market failures linked to externalities and the provision of public goods. Despite possibly reducing private benefits of land owners or users, environmental regulations may generate welfare gains to society by improving the environmental services on land. Finally, we investigate how area-based subsidies affect land prices. These subsidies are empirically found to be partially capitalized into land values, albeit at a lower rate than suggested by theory.

P32|Significación e historicidad en el paisaje campesino del valle Calchaquí Norte (provincia de Salta, Argentina)|In Andean peasant communities, ritual practices play a central role in the reproduction of the group. Ethno historical records show the existence of material elements in the pre-hispanic landscape that suggest they were constructed in order to promote the fertility of the fields and protect seeding. These stone structures, called huancas, have been located in the midst of agricultural fields. Their presence in the current landscape of the North Calchaqui Valley indicates that part of the ritual meaning they had for previous generations is preserved by modern peasants, and reinterpreted in a new social and cultural context based on the existence of pre-hispanic huancas in an Andean community of the province of Salta (Argentina), this article reflects on these issues through the correlation of archaeological and ethnographic records.
P32|The agricultural roots of industrial development: ‘forward linkages’ in reform era China|A classic literature argues that improvements in agricultural productivity result in higher non-agricultural output, particularly at low levels of development. The proposed mechanisms for these ‘forward linkages’ centre on increases in the supply of factors—usually labour or capital—or demand externalities in product markets. Regardless of the mechanism, empirical evidence for substantial linkages from agriculture is limited. In this paper, I show that improvements in agricultural productivity were an important factor in the growth of the non-agricultural sector in early reform-era China. I obtain plausibly exogenous variation in agricultural productivity growth by exploiting the fact that reforms between 1978 and 1984 were more beneficial to farmers endowed with land suited to cash crops. Then, using a newly digitised panel of economic data for 561 counties, I trace the growth of agricultural and non-agricultural output over forty years. Over the 15 or 25 year periods following the reforms, I estimate elasticities of county level non-agricultural output with respect to agricultural output of 1.2 or 0.8. Several pieces of additional evidence indicate that the linkages identified were primarily due to higher agricultural surpluses increasing the supply of capital to local non-state firms.
P32|An Application of Qualitative Risk Analysis as a Tool Adopted by Public Organizations for Evaluating “Green Projects”|This paper intends to explore the application of Qualitative Risk Analysis in evaluating the risk level associated with several public projects based on urban and peri-urban agriculture as a model of sustainable development of a territory. Therefore, urban agriculture is seen as an experimental model through which we can analyze the interaction between local institutions and citizens, as well as being a marketing tool to promote sustainability aspects linked to the territory. To this end, after a bibliographic review on the Qualitative Risk Analysis and the involvement of stakeholders in decisions relating to the public sector, a valuation of certain projects on the theme of urban and peri-urban agriculture, advanced by the local public Administration will be shown. The analysis proceeds with the classification of projects according to defined risk categories and their graphical representation through probability-impact matrix. The matrix shows that the data scores and the ranking vary significantly for each of the different projects involved. In this respect, the main purpose of this paper is to reveal how the success of a marketing policy based on the concept of sustainable marketing for promoting the territory depends, in many cases, not only on the characteristics of the territory analyzed, but also on the level of “riskiness” associated with the projects. Consequently, the empirical results of the paper can be a guide for public organizations, dealing with a plurality of projects but with limited resources, to assess and to prioritize projects using the level of “riskiness” as a criterion. Furthermore, economic resources could be directed to manage projects after taking into account the relevant risk ranking.
P32|Transaction costs and the market access in Sub-Saharan Africa: The case of maize| Staple crop production in developing countries contributes decisively to food safety. In Sub- Saharan Africa however, the Green Revolution, aiming at sustaining agricultural productivity growth was mostly viewed as not successful, compared to what happened in Asian countries. There is a widespread agreement on the fact that this statement is especially related to the food marketing environment and to transaction costs. Stagnant food crop productivity and poor market performance may then be at stake. The paper aims at identifying the relative importance of marketing and production behaviours. It focuses on the case of maize in Sub- Saharan Africa. The results show that, beyond production choices, two aspects should be taken into account in order to understand commercialisation decisions: the role of intermediation and that of storage.
P32|ソ連の家計貯蓄率，1965－1989：不足効果，非公式経済効果，相乗効果，強制貯蓄|1950年代末以降における家計貯蓄の急増は，不足の深刻化の結果生じた「強制貯蓄」の問題として取り上げられ，その結果発生する「金融危機」という観点からも活発に議論されてきた．しかし，資料制約を主たる理由として，十分に説得的な実証的結論を得ていない．ソ連家計の貯蓄行動に関する議論の中心的な論点は，貯蓄の増大が公式市場の不足に伴う非自発的な貯蓄によるものであるか，非公式経済において利用可能であるか否か，という点にあった．本稿では，この問題に取り組むために，1965－1989年のソ連構成共和国のオリジナル・パネルデータを構築し，家計貯蓄率に影響を与える自発的動機と非自発的動機を区別して，その決定要因の推定を行った．分析の結果，家計の貯蓄率に対して，（1）不足要因，（2）非公式経済要因，さらに，（3）両者の相乗効果，というソ連特有の要因の影響が確認された．即ち，不足は非自発的な貯蓄を形成し，非公式経済は取引動機としての自発的な貯蓄を形成する．一方で，公式市場の未充足需要が非公式経済に移転し消化される相乗効果の作用の結果，非自発的貯蓄の一部は解消される．推定結果に基づき算定したソ連の強制貯蓄は，1980年代以降に急増し，ソ連崩壊直前には貯蓄の4割にも達した．一方で，各決定要因の影響は地域ごとに異なり，不足が強く非公式経済が小さいスラブ・バルト地域では強制貯蓄率が貯蓄の3～5割と高い一方で，非公式経済が発達した中央アジア・コーカサス地域では強制貯蓄率が1割以下という明確な地域的分化が確認された．
P32|Forced Savings in the Soviet Republics: Re-examination|"The current paper empirically examines the determinants of household savings rates in the Soviet republics, by utilizing the panel data of an aggregated household budget survey in the period from 1965 to 1989. Earlier studies claimed that increases in household savings starting from the late 1950s were the direct result of worsening shortages of consumer goods; therefore, they considered Soviet households' savings to be involuntary ones and that households were ""forced"" to save under severe shortage conditions in the official consumer market. But they failed to fully investigate this problem mainly because of unavailability of data on household incomes and expenditures and of ignorance of a widespread informal economy (""second economy""). When the informal economy could at least partly provide households with opportunities to spend their money on lacking goods, households would be able to choose whether to save money and stand in line for scarce goods at the official retail shops, or move to the informal market. This understanding leads to the implication that there existed neither involuntary nor forced savings. In order to tackle this unsolved research problem, the Soviet households' savings rate function is estimated by taking into account shortages, the informal economy, and other factors, among them life-cycle factors, and then the ""forced savings rate"" is calculated. The main findings of this study are as follows: Firstly, even taking into account these factors, there existed Soviet-unique factors, namely the shortage factor, informal factor, and demand-spillover effect. Secondly, the magnitudes of these three factors varied among regions, so forced savings rates also varied. According to our estimation results, forced savings in the Slavic and Baltic regions accounted for more than 40% of the total savings just before the collapse of the Soviet Union, while those in the Caucasian and Central Asian regions accounted for less than 10%."
P32|Agricultural Exports, Growth Engine For Romania|The evolution of Romanian imports from the EU market was affected significantly, especially in 2009 and 2010 (due to lower domestic demand of operators and households). The global financial and economic crisis of 2008 strongly felt in Europe and affected its countries. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the main agricultural exports and food products that Romania can export to EU countries, but also outside the European Union.
P32|El capital y la aplicación de resultados en las sociedades agrarias de transformación: praxis y propuestas lege ferenda<BR>[The capital and application of results in agrarian processing companies: praxi and proposals lege ferenda]|El marco jurídico de las Sociedades Agrarias de Transformación (SAT) no regula con detalle aspectos jurídicos y económicos de estas sociedades, concediendo un amplísimo margen a la voluntad de los socios, quienes lo configurarán en los estatutos sociales. Esta ausencia de regulación u otorgamiento de libertad, como se quiera interpretar, en torno al régimen económico de esta figura societaria, ha dado lugar a la existencia de SAT muy distintas en función de su particular solución negocial plasmada en los estatutos. Ello motiva la existencia de SAT que toman como modelo económico-financiero de referencia el de las cooperativas, otras que han puesto la vista en la estructura económico-financiera de las sociedades anónimas y limitadas, y un tercer grupo, que no contienen apenas normas concretas relativas a su régimen económico y en alguna ocasión se han calificado como sociedades económicamente muy básicas. En este trabajo analizamos la configuración que en la realidad presentan estas organizaciones y que como se verá, da lugar en ocasiones a unas entidades híbridas. Para constatar la realidad de las SAT, analizamos todos los estatutos y actas fundacionales de las SAT inscritas en Baleares. Así hemos conocido la verdadera regulación estatutaria de aspectos políticos, económicos y sociales, que el legislador dejó a criterio de sus socios. Sobre lo anterior, expondremos propuestas de mejora en la regulación de estas entidades.
P32|Economic Aspects of Family Farming in the European Context| The International Year of Family Farming (IYFF) in 2014 has raised a number of issues related to the economic and policy context of family farming (FF), which covers a wide variety of organisations of farm production. In this paper, after some conceptual discussion, definitional issues are considered, in both qualitative and statistical terms, with evidence based mainly on Eurostat and FADN data on farm labour use, legal type and farm specialisation. The need or otherwise of quantitative thresholds is discussed, as well as the sensitivity of the scale of FF in the EU to different definitions. The economic nature of FF is then analysed, in terms of its significance for EU and national policy. Challenges to FF are identified, and the importance of farm succession legislation and taxation for the persistence of FF is stressed. Finally, based on the previous material, a number of discussion points are offered, for consideration in future economic analysis.
P32|The Impact of the 2013 Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy on Land Capitalization in the European Union|Decoupled direct payments to farmers were introduced in the European Union (EU) in the form of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) in 2005. The 2013 Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) reform changed both the implementation of the SPS and its budget. We assess the possible effects of the 2013 CAP reform on EU land markets, particularly the capitalization of the SPS in land rental values. Our analyses suggest that the implementation details of the 2013 CAP reform will largely determine the impact of the SPS on land markets. The key considerations are the reference period for entitlement allocation, regionalization, payment differentiation, and budgetary changes. Our analysis also implies that a number of relatively minor policy changes could have substantial impacts on land markets.
P32|Agro-holdings in Russia: Temporary phenomenon or a prevailing business form?| Since the 1990s, in Russia, numerous large scale agro-holdings emerged, which link various farms, entities of the upstream and downstream sectors, and even totally unrelated industries. As all these affiliates are legally registered as independent units, there is only scant information about the holdings' overall performance. Based on a unique panel data set from Moscow and Belgorod regions, we investigated the growth trajectories of farms belonging to agro-holdings vis-à-vis independent farms by applying a quantile regression approach. Evidence points to little differences among general performance indicators of both types. Any advantages of affiliated farms appear to be due to extramural factors; i.e. it is all about how to link individual production units, thus benefiting from strong positioning in local and regional markets and making the most of the lobbied ties to the relevant politics. In sum, agro-holdings are assumed to remain as a model for organizing agricultural production.
P32|Kazakhstan's wheat, beef and dairy sectors: An assessment of their development constraints and recent policy responses<BR>[Die Erzeugung von Weizen, Rindfleisch und Milchprodukten in Kasachstan: Entwicklungshemmnisse und Agrarpolitische Förderung]|Kazakhstan is now widely regarded as a key player on world agricultural markets, with considerable export potential in the wheat, beef and dairy sectors. Based on unique farm-level data covering all production systems currently relevant, we offer new insights into the constraints that hamper further economic growth and provide an assessment of the government´s agricultural development strategy. A frequently mentioned bottleneck is agriculture´s lacking access to finance. But most farm managers in the farm survey doubt that agricultural investments deliver a sufficiently reliable return required for credit funding and thus do not take loans. Despite the vast land resources, a lack of land supply is now the most cited constraint to farm expansion in the highly regulated land market of the northern grain region. Another set of constraints in wheat production is related to the market power of elevators, the vagaries of trading over long distances in an underdeveloped rail and seaport infrastructure, and the intervention activities of state agencies. In the cattle sector, there are significant problems in year-round fodder supply. The value chains for beef and dairy are bifurcated into an import-dependent chain for industrially processed products serving urban consumers, and a local chain of raw products serving rural consumers and urban bazaars. Recent modernisation strategies of the government tend to focus on the provision of subsidised capital, while they underestimate the knowledge and incentive problems inherent to a state-guided management of sector development. The government should rather focus on providing impartial, reliable and high-quality public services to the sector, making sure that the weakest links in food chain development are identified and private entrepreneurs are provided with the necessary incentives to strengthen them. Our evidence suggests that a bundle of measures improving the local institutional environment of agriculture is more important than massive state funding of certain production lines.
P32|Warehouse Receipts Functioning To Reduce Market Risk| Cereal production underlies the market risk to a great extent due to its elastic demand. Prices of grain have cyclic movements and significant decline in the harvest periods as a result of insufficient supply and high demand. The very specificity of agricultural production leads to the fact that agricultures are forced to sell their products at unfavourable conditions in order to resume production. The Public Warehouses System allows the agriculturers, who were previously unable to use the bank loans to finance the continuation of their production, to efficiently acquire the necessary funds, by the support of the warehouse receipts which serve as collaterals. Based on the results obtained by applying statistical methods (variance and standard deviation), as a measure of market risk under the assumption that warehouse receipts’ prices will approximately follow the overall consumer price index, it can be concluded that the warehouse receipts trade will have a significant impact on risk reduction in cereal production. Positive effects can be manifested through the stabilization of prices, reduction of cyclic movements in the production of basic grains and, in the final stage, on the country’s food security.
P32|Las distintas caras de la economía institucional|En este trabajo se pretende ofrecer una imagen general de las distintas tendencias de la economía institucional. El objetivo es mostrar sus complementariedades, es decir, en qué medida ha ido surgiendo un cuerpo general coherente y relevante para el análisis histórico. Se han seleccionado las propuestas de un amplio grupo de autores y se han intentado engarzar argumentalmente. Tanto la selección de autores, como la de los aspectos de sus trabajos a los que se hace referencia, implican una elección personal basada en la experiencia docente e investigadora del autor en los últimos años. El engarce argumental entre ellos incorpora además criterios y apreciaciones personales. Todo ello creo que ha permitido organizar un discurso coherente, en el que los distintos autores van mostrando las distintas caras y herramientas de la economía institucional. Quedaría muy satisfecho si al leerlo se ve la posibilidad de ir situando en la argumentación general, con las consiguientes matizaciones, los autores y las ideas que se hayan echado en falta.
P32|The Importance Of Agri-Food Sector In Romanian Economy|This paper proposes an analysis of food products market in Romania and its importance in the national economy. Grain market is an important part of Romanian agrifood sector, which is constantly developing, especially after Romania's accession to the EU, cereals occupying more than 65% of the cultivated area of the country. Grain market analysis is necessary because of the multitude of problems facing this sector: the high degree of perishability of production; existence of increased competition on the domestic and international market; high degree of self-consumption in the individual farmers; territorial dispersion of supply, with large regional differences and seasonal fluctuations; the imbalance of domestic supply-demand that facilitates recourse to imports or increased exports; existence of a price system directly affected by international prices; obtaining products uncompetitive in international markets in terms of quality; organizational and functional deficiencies in taking domestic production market, etc.
P32|Racionalidades y prácticas campesinas cafeteras en el departamento del Huila, Colombia|En este trabajo se evalúan algunas acciones económicas y ambientales de comunidades campesinas que habitan en los ecosistemas cafeteros del municipio de La Plata, departamento del Huila, en el suroccidente de Colombia. Para ello se emplea el enfoque de desarrollo sustentable. A este efecto se realizó el levantamiento de información primaria a través de la metodología de Diagnóstico Rural Participativo (DRP). Además, para analizar la probabilidad de que esas acciones económicas y ambientales se lleven a cabo en la región, se realizó un análisis econométrico con modelos logit. Se encuentra que en el uso y control del agua y el suelo en la caficultura, las acciones de aprovisionamiento de agua para las actividades agrícolas dependen en mayor grado del manejo de coberturas vegetales. Finalmente, las acciones antrópicas que inciden en las transformaciones ambientales de los paisajes cafeteros requieren de la acción colectiva y saberes locales en cada una de las actividades productivas.
P32|Community based tourism: is this progress?|Since the creation of the Sustainable Tourism - Eliminating Poverty (ST-EP) initiative, tourism has been presented to the world as an effective tool to eliminate poverty and to promote sustainable human development. One of the forms of tourism included in the scope of the ST-EP initiative is Community Based Tourism (CBT). This paper, which is based on the case study of Usme in Bogotá – Colombia, supports the idea that Community Based Tourism can no longer be approached as a paternalistic activity to support development through cooperation and donation. Contrarily, it should be considered as any other international business initiative. Furthermore, the paternalistic cooperation approach, as currently considered, leads to misunderstand the purpose of the community-based tourism initiatives and drives the communities into a vicious circle of undeveloped in order to attract tourists.
P32|La empresa agroindustrial colombiana: un análisis de relaciones de poder y configuración de la apropiación de factores productivos|Las organizaciones de producción agroindustrial se han convertido en una de las apuestas productivas más importantes para los países latinoamericanos. Este artículo parte de una pregunta: ¿Ha desarrollado el Gobierno colombiano herramientas jurídicas respecto a los factores productivos fundamentales (tierra y trabajo), a fin de permitir el aumento de las ganancias de las empresas agroindustriales? Para responder a este interrogante se establece un marco conceptual, en el cual el concepto fundamental es la concepción relacional del poder. Asimismo, se presenta una concepción de la tenencia de la tierra en Hispanoamérica, desde una perspectiva histórica que culmina en la caracterización de la agroindustria en el país. El marco general del análisis es el impacto del conflicto colombiano y su incidencia en la tenencia de la tierra.
P32|A history of resistance to privatization in Russia|We investigate the connection between privatization in post-communist Russia and a mass privatization reform in Imperial Russia, the 1906 Stolypin land reform. Specifically, we relate historical measures of conflicts associated with the Stolypin reform to contemporary views on whether the privatization of the 1990s should be revised. These historical measures could influence contemporary views in two ways: first, differences in privatization-related conflicts in the past could have directly altered attitudes towards privatization in the 1990s and, second, these differences could merely reflect pre-determined dissimilarities in preferences. We first show that historical measures of resistance to privatization are associated with views that favor state ownership. One standard deviation increase in the historical resistance to privatization explains a quarter of the negative sentiment toward private property today. We also find that negative experiences with the Stolypin reform are associated with views on the procedural unfairness of modern privatization reforms, suggesting that pre-determined preferences cannot fully explain the weight of history.
P32|The Structural Transformation in Central and Eastern European Agriculture|The paper analyses the agricultural transformation in ten Central and Eastern European countries between 1990 and 2010. We provide evidence that despite of diversity of farm structure, heterogeneous preconditions in agricultural policy and economic policy reforms these countries follow the Lewis path of structural transformation. Our results indicate that beyond to macroeconomic conditions and inter-sectoral linkages, micro-level factors especially farm structure play important role in agricultural development.
P32|Vladimir G. Wenger: Scientist and His Time|(To the 115th Birth Anniversary) The article is devoted to the creative work of the Soviet economist-agrarian Vladimir Grigorievich Wenger, doctor of economic sciences, the employee of Institute of Economics, Academy of Sciences of the USSR. He was not only a contemporary, but also an active participant of all the most important events of this time, having the ability to analyze and critically comprehend. Along with deep agrarian studies of collective farmers, agricultural production and rural development in the Soviet Union; that have lost their relevance at the present time, Wenger’s works contribute to the understanding of the Soviet system as a social phenomenon.
P32|«Reviviendo el sueño de varias generaciones»: comunales y reforma agraria en León en la II República (1931-1936)|In 1931, the provisional government of Spain’s Second Republic launched a true agrarian reform focused on improving the conditions of the peasantry. This ‘reformist’ agenda went beyond the expropriation and distribution of large estates (latifundios) to amend agricultural contracts and restructure the labour market, as well as proposing the abolition of seigniorial taxes and the recovery of commons that had been privatised. In León, within the framework of this reform programme, communal land rights that had been dispossessed in the 19th century were restored to the villages, and ploughing was allowed on common lands. While striving for the consolidation of small peasant farms and taking note of popular demands for access to and distribution of land, Republican reformism gave peasants a central role through a revision of liberal agrarian reforms. A moral and ethical explanation can be found behind peasant demands to recover common lands, relating to a defence of a peasant culture and way of life.
P32|Campesinos, Estado y mercado. La conflictividad forestal en el Noroeste de España, León (1870­ ‐1936)|"In the 19th Century the Spanish State privatised large areas of common lands and took over management of common wastelands and woodlands, thus stripping the peasants of all the control they had over them. Just as in many other parts of Spain, State intervention in wastelands and woodlands in León was a controversial issue because it was a symptom of conflicting visions or interests: between the State that promoted forestry uses and the peasants whose livelihood, based on agriculture and cattle, depended on common lands. The aim of this paper is to study the motivation behind peasant resistances to State intervention in Northwest Spain in the period 1870-1936. Although the conflicts have been explained from different perspectives (as resistance to market penetration, as ""weapons of the poor"", or as environmental conflicts), here we argue that the tensions and disputes over the common lands represent the peasants' defence of their livelihoods as well as the struggle for the ""opportunities"" the market offered."
P32|Os sentidos do passado: questão agrária e luta pela terra no interior de São Paulo (Brasil, 1949)|In this article, search the memories of the communist uprising of 1949, Fernandópolis, in the Northwest of São Paulo, Brazil. The dispute around the memory and the construction of meanings is related to the hiding the historical struggle for land and against exploitation in the country. The official versions about the movement are marked for limited communism memories. Other memories relate to the struggle of workers during the decades of 1940-50 to the land struggles of rural landless contemporary. This interpretive act is relevant, since attributes meaning to fact and constitute in evidence plural experiences.
P32|Community supported agriculture: Is it driven by economy or solidarity?<BR>[Solidarische Landwirtschaft in Rumänien: Überwiegen ökonomische oder solidarische Elemente?]|Searching for possible viable economic pathways for small-scale farms in Eastern Europe, this study is concerned with Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). We are mainly interested in the costs and benefits for both sides, the farmers and the consumers, when entering into a direct, trust-based market relationship in the form of CSA. The study is theoretically embedded in the concept of solidarity economy. The analysis is based on three cases of farmers pioneering the CSA concept in Romania by offering organic vegetable to their local contracted consumers in the Western part of the country. All three CSA groups were initiated by a local NGO. Our empirical results shed light on CSA partnerships in Romania. With regard to consumers we find that they are drawn from a specific group of urban dwellers with higher education and income, and a particular interest in health and nutrition. Consumers show a high level of trust to their partner farmers: this is the basis for a functioning economic relationship. Solidarity is a value that is aspired by the initiating NGO. It is existing as one of the values sought by consumers when taking part in CSA. More important than solidarity is, however, the consumers' wish for organic-quality fresh products, which are not available elsewhere. On the producers´ side, the need for a stable market with fair prices is the main motivation to get involved in CSA. Thus, both farmers and consumer compensate for market failures through the CSA partnership.
P32|Kazakhstan's wheat, beef and dairy sectors: An assessment of their development constraints and recent policy responses| Kazakhstan is now widely regarded as a key player on world agricultural markets, with considerable export potential in the wheat, beef and dairy sectors. Based on unique farm-level data covering all production systems currently relevant, we offer new insights into the constraints that hamper further economic growth and provide an assessment of the government’s agricultural development strategy. A frequently mentioned bottleneck is agriculture’s lacking access to finance. But most farm managers in the farm survey doubt that agricultural investments deliver a sufficiently reliable return required for credit funding and thus do not take loans. Despite the vast land resources, a lack of land supply is now the most cited constraint to farm expansion in the highly regulated land market of the northern grain region. Another set of constraints in wheat production is related to the market power of elevators, the vagaries of trading over long distances in an underdeveloped rail and seaport infrastructure, and the intervention activities of state agencies. In the cattle sector, there are significant problems in year-round fodder supply. The value chains for beef and dairy are bifurcated into an import-dependent chain for industrially processed products serving urban consumers, and a local chain of raw products serving rural consumers and urban bazaars. Recent modernisation strategies of the government tend to focus on the provision of subsidised capital, while they underestimate the knowledge and incentive problems inherent to a state-guided management of sector development. The government should rather focus on providing impartial, reliable and high-quality public services to the sector, making sure that the weakest links in food chain development are identified and private entrepreneurs are provided with the necessary incentives to strengthen them. Our evidence suggests that a bundle of measures improving the local institutional environment of agriculture is more important than massive state funding of certain production lines.
P32|Farmers’ Willingness to Pay for Index Based Crop Insurance in Pakistan: A Case Study on Food and Cash Crops of Rain-fed Areas| In Pakistan, agriculture is vulnerable to multiple risks, especially in the rain-fed areas. The crop insurance can serve as a useful tool to manage risks in the rain-fed areas of Pakistan. This study has assessed farmers’ willingness to pay for insurance in the rain-fed areas of Pakistan by conducting a survey of 531 farmers in the Soon valley and Talagang areas of Pakistan. The farmers’ willingness to pay for the index based crop insurance has been studied by employing the different econometric models. It has been found that these rain-fed areas consider indexed based insurance to be an important risk management strategy. The empirical results have indicated that farmers’ economic status, household assets and membership of community organization are the important determinants of their willingness to pay a higher insurance premium. The propensity score matching results have revealed that farmers were satisfied with index based insurance and were also willing to increase the area under food as well as cash crops. This study has suggested that to make agricultural insurance scheme more successful, the government should provide subsidy which will help in increasing the area under food and cash crops and shall ensure food security in the region.
P32|Empirical Evidence of the Distributional Effects of the CAP in New EU Member States|This study, carried out in the context of the Factor Markets research project, investigates the impact of the SAPS (Single Area Payment Scheme) on farmland rental rates in the new EU member states. Using a unique set of farm level panel data with 20,930 observations for 2004 and 2005 we are able to control for important sources of endogeneity. According to our results, the SAPS has a positive and statistically significant impact on land rents in the EU. However, the estimated incidence is smaller than predicted theoretically. Land rents capture only 19 cents of the marginal SAPS euro, and around 10% of the SAPS benefit non-farming landowners through higher farmland rental prices. As the share of rented land is higher in corporate farms than individual ones, family farms benefit more from the SAPS than corporate farms do.
P32|Competition for land and labour among individual farms and agricultural enterprises: Evidence from Kazakhstan's grain region<BR>[Der Wettbewerb zwischen Einzelbetrieben und Agrarunternehmen um Boden und Arbeit: Einsichten aus Kasachstans Getreideregion]|This article evaluates the recent evolution of farm structure in Kazakhstan's grain region against the reform objectives of the 1990s and the family farm theory that underpinned the latter. In the study region, super-large agroholdings, large-scale enterprises and smaller individual farms emerged side-by-side and now compete for resources in a homogenous production environment. Drawing on two survey rounds of farm-level data, we find that the agroholdings display the highest factor productivity and are the most competitive on land and labour markets among all farms. However, we also find constant technical returns to scale across farm types and a layer of smaller family farms that is highly competitive on land markets. It is thus too early to conclude that large corporate farms are economically superior to individual (family) farms. But the present analysis clearly calls into question that family farms are a per-se desirable or even the only viable way of organising agricultural production. A revision of the received family farm theory may thus be due.
P32|Intergenerational Income Persistence in Urban China|Intergenerational income elasticities are estimated using samples for urban China (covering many cities) for the years 1995 and 2002 and compared with results from other studies. We find that the income relation between the pairs: sons and fathers, sons and mothers and daughters and mothers, are in 2002 all similar in magnitude. In contrast the relation between daughters' and fathers' income is weaker. The income relationship between offspring and mothers was weaker in 1995 than in 2002. Our preferred estimates of income persistency for the son-father pairs of 0.47 for 1995 and 0.53 for 2002 are higher than what has been reported in the literature for several high-income countries with large welfare states. The strength of the income link between sons and fathers in urban China appears to be not very different from what has been reported for countries such as Brazil, Chile and the United States.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P32|The Impact Of The Future Communitarian Budget On The Common Agricultural Policy|"The main purpose of the Common Agricultural Policy was oriented towards production, within a short time span, due to massive subsidies from 2/3 of the communitarian budget. At this time the main objective of the Common Agricultural Policy is to reach quality, ecologic and food safety parameters, for which only 1/3 of the communitarian budget is allocated. The Common Agricultural Policy is supported by members with developed agricultural sectors, but also by states in Central and Eastern Europe, which have difficulties in this sector. The communitarian budget subsidizes the two main pillars of agriculture: ""direct payments"" and ""rural development""."

An original example is taken with the Habanos, the Cuban luxury cigars. In a first part, we analyse the main tendencies of the tobacco sector in general, and those of luxury tobacco in particular, in the case of Cuba. In a second part, the emphasis is put on the coexistence of traditional methods and the different forms of innovations characterizing this specific sector. These innovations can be scientific and technological ones, or linked to the production processes or to the products. JEL Codes: O13, O31, P32, Q16
P32|On the transaction values of land use rights in rural China|Land Use Rights (LURs) in China affect farmers’ productivity through investment incentives and the way land is allocated across households. LURs have implication and trade-offs between equity and growth. This paper examines how Chinese farmers might respond if the Chinese government made it legal for farmers to buy or sell LURs. Livelihood choices, labor substitution, market infrastructure, a lack of property right protections, entrepreneurship, bureaucracy, and political will are all influential factors that will determine whether such a program would work. The purpose of this paper is to examine the economics of transaction in LURs, estimate the value at which LURs could transact in equilibrium, and to analyze factors that would affect these price changes. We evaluate farmer’s intention to buy and sell LURs and how much they are willing to pay and receive for LURs.
P32|Rediscovering the Virgin Lands: Agricultural investment and rural livelihoods in a Eurasian frontier area|Against the global debate on socially responsible agro-investment, we explore the conditions, patterns, and impacts of recent agricultural recovery in Kazakhstan’s northern grain provinces. Vertically and horizontally integrated agroholdings brought outside investment and management to this region. With stable employment in agriculture, real consumption spending of rural households has doubled within an 8-year period. Due to the socialist tradition of industrialized farming operations, rural inhabitants regard themselves primarily as workers and not as land owners. We conclude that investment in large-scale farming can provide benefits to rural people even with less than ideal-type political representation.

P32|Understanding the puzzling resilience of the land share ownership in Russia: the input of Ostrom’s approach|This paper determines how the rule-in-use on access to agricultural land affects both the size of Russian farms and the nature of land property via enforcement mechanisms. The concept of “institutional arrangements”, developed by Ostrom, is used to show that land use practices by farmers can be considered a compromise between legal land access regimes and economic and social interests of nested communities. This compromise leads to the preservation of both large-scale agricultural production units and “land-share ownership” in Orel.

P32|A View Upon The History Of The Peasant Association|"The whole social and economic life is based on some form of association. People live in societies, so the idea association appeared in the most natural way, at first in an unconscious form, moving later towards the conscious and organized association. Seeing that through the association they were able to defend their professional interests, fulfil their economic goals and meet their common needs, peasants adopted its formula with confidence. The ways in which the association spread were diverse. Depending on the economic, social and moral circumstances and on the habits and goals of the various masses of peasants, there have been developed mainly one of the three forms: trade unions, cooperatives, and mutuality. The peasant associations helped the rural communities everywhere and were the object of interest of many theoreticians, who sought their roots, their forms, presented their principles and analyzed their results. One of them was Professor Nicolae Ghiulea, a Romanian economist and sociologist, fervent supporter of the association idea. Nicolae Ghiulea was among the most important representatives of the cooperative doctrine of the interwar period and was well-known for his prestigious academic career. He filled several administrative and social leading functions and had a rich publishing activity in the areas of statistical theory, social economy, cooperatives and sociology. This article sets out to present his view upon the history of the peasant association, as exposed in one of his books entitled ""The peasant associations"". The author focuses on the various forms of peasant associations, their history and their practical results in interwar Romania, explaining why they were beneficial. At a closer look, peasant associations are still a viable solution to many current social issues, especially those concerning agriculture."
P32|Chosen Institutional Arrangements In Trading Of Agricultural Land Of The State Treasury In Poland|This paper discusses the problem of state trading of agricultural land, for which is responsible a state institution – the Agency of Agricultural Real Estates (AARE). The legal conditions and effects of activity were to present. Analysis was bas ed on selected literature, data from the AARE and appropriate legal acts. In essence, the intervention of the Agency on the farmland market involves giving preference, when selling farmland, to people with adequate qualifications who run family farms. The distinguishing feature of the regional branch of the Agency in Warmia and Mazury is the considerable share of state - owned farmland found in this region in the past.
P32|Los efectos de las transformaciones agrícolas en los antiguos países socialistas: Algunas consideraciones para Cuba<BR>[The effects of agricultural transformations in former socialist countries: Some considerations for Cuba]|This paper examines the principal agricultural transformations in a selected group of former socialist countries in Asia and Eastern and Central Europe, using commonly-accepted indicators such as physical output, labor productivity, and agricultural yields, and offers some relevant recommendations for Cuba. The countries included in this study are: China, Vietnam, Russia, Ukraine, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Rumania and Slovenia. Section one presents a brief introduction. Section two analyzes the role of agriculture in the (post-socialist) transition countries included in the study. This is followed by a detailed analysis of general trends and indicators such as output, labor productivity, and agricultural yields in these countries during the first decade of agricultural transformations. Finally, section four discusses the relevance of these experiences in the case of Cuba within the context of the ongoing process of “updating” the country’s (socialist) economic model.
P32|A political theory of Russian orthodoxy: Evidence from public goods experiments|In this paper, I test the effects of religious norms on the provision of public goods. My evidence is drawn from public goods experiments that I ran with regional bureaucrats in Tomsk and Novosibirsk, Russia. I introduce three treatments, which I define as degrees of Eastern Orthodox collectivist enforcement: 1. Solidarity, 2. Obedience, and 3. Universal discipline. I argue for the existence of an Eastern Orthodox hierarchy in the Russian bureaucracy that facilitates the delivery of public goods under conditions of universal discipline and the principal´s overfulfillment. Eastern Orthodox hierarchy is enforced through universal disciplinary monitoring, which induces collective punishment when the public good is not delivered. Contrary to conventional wisdom about freeriding in administrative institutions, higher ranks in Russian bureaucracies are associated with less freeriding.
P32|Religious origins of democracies and dictatorships|In this paper, I argue that religion matters for the emergence of democracies and dictatorships. Religion is defined as a stochastically set demand for public goods. Different types of religious collectives reflect different tradeoffs between centralized resource distribution and market rewards. Religions are defined as collectivist, when their respective collectives facilitate the hierarchical provision of common pool resources toward their members at the expense of market incentives. Religions are defined as individualist, when their respective collectives recruit and preserve their members on the basis of market incentives. Islam, Orthodoxy and Catholicism are treated as collectivist religions, whereas Judaism and Protestantism as individualist ones. I provide a historical overview that designates the Jewish kibbutz as the collective of democracy and the Russian-Orthodox monastery as the collective of dictatorship. Assuming a collectivist economy, I solve the radical government and modernization stochastic games. I find that modernization occurs in a collectivist economy when the threat of a radical government is imminent and when the leader has high extraction rents over the economy. In order to stay in power, the leader credibly commits to provide more public goods in the future, and thus modernization occurs. Underdevelopment occurs at intermediate levels of state enforcement, modernization at low levels and centralization at high levels of state enforcement. The emergence of a radical government is more likely in a collectivist rather than in an individualist economy.
P32|The organisation of agricultural production in East Germany since World War II: Historical roots and present situation<BR>[Organisation der Agrarproduktion in Ostdeutschland seit dem 2. Weltkrieg: Historische Wurzeln und aktuelle Situation]|Up to the end of World War II, the political-economic framework had been relatively similar all over Germany. However, the farm structure was different. While in both parts, the West and the East, about 90 per cent of all farms cultivated less than 20 ha and about one per cent more than 100 ha, the large fams cultivated about 7 per cent of the agricultural area in the West, but about 30 per cent in the East. Following the unconditional surrender of Germany in 1945 and its division by the four Allies, the differences in the organisation of agricultural production between East and West became more pronounced. In the Soviet Occupation Zone and then with the creation of the German Democratic Republic in October 1949, the socialist model of agricultural production was introduced in three phases: (1) an enforced land reform between 1945-49; (2) the repression of farmers cultivating more than 20 ha, starting in 1949, and finally (3) the collectivization of agricultural production starting in 1952 and finalised in the Socialist Spring in April 1960. While socialist agriculture had been built up on blood and tears, it came to be fully accepted by the East German population over time and heavily defended also by those political forces which pushed for a regime change in 1989. With the collapse of the socialist regime in 1989 and German reunification in 1990, socialist agriculture had to be transformed into a system compatible with pluralistic democracy and market economy. Similarly, those whose assets had been confiscated were supposed to be restituted. However, the legal system at reunification differentiated between those who were expropriated either before 1945 or after 1949 and those between 1945 and 1949 under Soviet occupation. While the first group was entitled to restitution, the latter group received little compensation. At the time of transition, most politicians and agricultural economists assumed that family farming would re-emerge in the East and the modes of agricultural production would adjust between the two parts. However, even more than two decades after reunification, German agriculture is characterized by two distinguished different agricultural production systems. While West German agriculture continued the tradition of small-scale family farms relying on family labour, East German agriculture is characterised by large-scale corporate farms relying on permanently employed labour. In this way, German agriculture can be characterised as One country - Two systems.
P32|Competition for land and labour among individual farms and agricultural enterprises: Evidence from Kazakhstan's grain region| This article evaluates the recent evolution of farm structure in Kazakhstan's grain region against the reform objectives of the 1990s and the family farm theory that underpinned the latter. In the study region, super-large agroholdings, large-scale enterprises and smaller individual farms emerged side-by-side and now compete for resources in a homogenous production environment. Drawing on two survey rounds of farm-level data, we find that the agroholdings display the highest factor productivity and are the most competitive on land and labour markets among all farms. However, we also find constant technical returns to scale across farm types and a layer of smaller family farms that is highly competitive on land markets. It is thus too early to conclude that large corporate farms are economically superior to individual (family) farms. But the present analysis clearly calls into question that family farms are a per-se desirable or even the only viable way of organising agricultural production. A revision of the received family farm theory may thus be due.
P32|Food availability, food entitlements, and radicalism during the Chinese great leap forward famine: an econometric panel data analysis|The purpose of this article is to investigate the socio-economic as well as the political, institutional, and ideological causes of the Chinese famine of 1959–1961. The main hypothesis of this paper is that the radical policies implemented as part of the Great Leap Forward resulted in agricultural output decline (i.e., availability issues), and in the implementation of an ineffective food distribution policy affecting rural populations (i.e., accessibility issues). An econometric analysis, based on provincial panel data from the 1954–1966 period, stresses the effect of ill-advised economic policies in handling the famine. This analysis also confirms that the increase in mortality rates during the famine was caused by the simultaneous collapse in food availability and food accessibility in rural areas.
P32|Static and Dynamic Distributional Effects of Decoupled Payments|This paper analyses the distributional effects of the decoupled Single Farm Payments (SFP) in the European Union (EU). Previous studies have analyzed the impact of the SFP in a static context. We show that in the presence of dynamic structural changes the SFP implications may be different. A zero or symmetric SFP rental distortive effect on heterogeneous farms in the static context may switch to an asymmetric rental distortion in a dynamic context if the tradability of SFP entitlements is constrained leading to different SFP capitalization rate and having constraining effect on farm restructuring. With tradable entitlements the SFP affects farm incentives equally in static and dynamic environments. The preliminary empirical evidence indicates that landowners partially benefit from the SFP but more with the hybrid than with the historical model. The SFP capitalization is driven by higher abundance of entitlements in the hybrid model, and by structural change in the historical model, but is partially offset by the rigidity of the EU land markets.
P32|EU Land Markets and the Common Agricultural Policy|Economic theory, as well as empirical findings, suggest that the way in which agricultural support is provided has an influence on land markets, because payments capitalise to some degree into land values, affecting both the sale and rental price of land. The present paper analyses how the income distributional effects and farm restructuring are impacted by the SPS by accounting for entitlement tradability, cross-compliance requirements, different SPS implementation models, and the entitlement stock. Our results suggest that the SPS implication details are highly important: farmers’ benefits can range from 100% of the SPS value to a negative policy incidence, and farm structural change may be hindered by the SPS.
P32|Marketing, cooperatives and price heterogeneity: evidence from the CIS dairy sector| Drawing on survey data, this paper identifies the determinants of variations in farm gate milk prices for three CIS countries (Armenia, Moldova and Ukraine). We apply a multi-level modeling approach, specifically a bootstrapped and selectivity bias corrected mixed-effects linear regression model. The analysis suggests three main strategies for farmers to improve the price received for their output: consolidation, cooperation and stable supply chain relationships. While selling through a marketing cooperative has a significant and positive effect on farm gate milk prices, the majority of non-members are reluctant to join. The size of dairy operations, trust and contracting also impact positively on the prices received by farmers. Policy implications are drawn.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

P32|The Capitalization of Area Payments into Farmland Rents: Micro Evidence from the New EU Member States|This study investigates the impact of the SAPS (Simplified Area Payment Scheme) on rental land values in seven New EU Member States (NMS). Using the FADN farm level panel data with 20,930 observations from 2004 and 2005 we are able to control for unobserved heterogeneity, simultaneity, and omitted variable bias, which often distort the incidence measures. According to our results, the SAPS has a positive and statistically significant impact on land rents in the NMS. However, the effect is smaller than theoretically predicted. Land rents capture only 0.19 of the marginal Euro of the SAPS. Taking into account the level of land renting in the NMS, around 10 percent of the total value of SAPS payments benefit non-farming land owners through higher farmland rental prices. Because the share of rented land is higher for corporate than for individual farms, family farms will likely benefit more from the SAPS than corporate farms.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

P32|La mujer indígena campesina en Bolivia y su objetivo de igualdad. Propuesta de aplicación de un mapa estratégico basado en valores cooperativos<BR>[The indigenous rural woman in Bolivia and the equality aim. A strategic map application based on cooperatives values]|Los condicionantes económicos y sociales presentes en el entorno rural de Bolivia han relegado a la mujer a un papel secundario y, en muchas ocasiones, injusto. El movimiento cooperativo y, concretamente su filosofía basada en una serie de valores, se presenta como una alternativa muy viable para cambiar la situación anteriormente comentada y conseguir que la mujer campesina indígena sea considerada en términos de igualdad en los contextos familiares y comunales. Sin embargo, necesitamos para ello una herramienta de aplicación, la cual ha consistido en una adaptación personal e innovadora del tradicional mapa estratégico propuesto por Kaplan y Norton (1992), a través del cual, la interrelación entre los objetivos correspondientes a diferentes perspectivas, contribuyen al alcance de la visión planteada.
P32|Organisation et performance des filières alimentaires dans les pays du Sud : le rôle de la proximité. Synthèse des travaux pour l’habilitation à diriger des recherches|The document summarises the results of twenty years of coordination of research programmes on urban food supply in Africa and Asia in collaboration with national researchers. The main research questions are the following ones: What is the role of geographical and relational proximity in the performance of food chains in Africa and Asia? Does modern distribution change food chains in favour of the less wealthy stakeholders? The research is based on spatial economics, economics of rural organisations and global value chain analysis. The results show the role of geographical proximity in the supply of perishable commodities in line with Von Thünen predictions. We identify the role of relational proximity in reducing uncertainties in terms of quantity, price and quality, which the sellers and buyers of food commodities must face. Future research areas are presented, including a deeper evaluation of economic, environmental and social impact of proximity agriculture relative to more distant food supplying areas. ...French Abstract : Le document résume des recherches sur l’approvisionnement alimentaire des villes en Afrique et en Asie, menées en collaboration avec des chercheurs nationaux, sur une période de vingt ans. Les principales questions de recherche sont les suivantes : Quel est le rôle de la proximité géographique et relationnelle dans la performance des filières alimentaires en Afrique et en Asie? La grande distribution transforme-t-elle les filières au bénéfice des acteurs défavorisés ? Les travaux s’appuient sur la littérature en économie spatiale, en économie des organisations rurales et le cadre théorique des chaînes globales de valeur. Ils montrent le rôle de la proximité géographique dans l’alimentation des villes en aliments périssables selon les prédictions de Von Thünen. Nous soulignons le rôle de la proximité relationnelle dans la réduction des incertitudes en termes de quantité, de prix et de qualité, auxquelles sont soumis les vendeurs et acheteurs de produits alimentaires. Des pistes de recherche futures sont présentées, en particulier pour mieux quantifier l’impact économique, social et environnemental de l’agriculture de proximité par rapport à des approvisionnements alimentaires de longue distance.
P32|Performancevergleiche zwischen Genossenschaften und anderen Rechtsformen anhand von Erfolgs-, Liquiditäts- und Wachstumskennzahlen|Dieser Beitrag setzt sich zum Ziel, für die zwei Märkte Milch- und Weinwirtschaft, auf denen Genossenschaften eine starke Marktposition eingenommen haben, eine Analyse der Unternehmenssituation in Bezug auf wichtige Bilanzkennzahlen durchzuführen und damit den Markterfolg im Vergleich zu anderen Rechtsformen zu analysieren. Zur Bewertung wird das RSWVerfahren angewendet, welches eine ganzheitliche Unternehmensanalyse mit Hilfe der Bildung eines Gesamtscores ermöglicht (Schmidt u.a. 1987: 234-265). Die Untersuchung basiert auf der Anwendung von relativen Kennzahlen, die nach empirischen Analysen einen großen Erklärungsbeitrag für den Erfolg eines Unternehmens liefern (Baetge 1998: 551). Mit Hilfe von ausgewählten Kennzahlen wird ein Score gebildet, der eine Rangfolge und eine Zuordnung der Unternehmen zu einem Ratingwert zulässt. Die Analyse strebt eine umfassende Bewertung der Unternehmen für die Kriterien Rendite, Sicherheit und Wachstum an. Die Untersuchung eröffnet deutliche Unterschiede zwischen Genossenschaften und Unternehmen anderer Rechtsform auf den beiden betrachteten Märkten. Dadurch können Vor- und Nachteile von genossenschaftlich organisierten Unternehmen in Bezug auf den erzielten Markterfolg abgeleitet werden, die notwendige Maßnahmen aufzeigen, um auch weiterhin erfolgreich auf wettbewerbsintensiven Märkten tätig zu sein.
P32|Distributional Effects of CAP Subsidies: Micro Evidence from the EU|In this paper we estimate the income distributional effects of the common agricultural policy (CAP) for farmers and landowners. First, we theoretically analyse the level of farmers' and landowners' gains from coupled and decoupled payments. Second, using a unique farm level panel data set from the FADN for the period 1995-2007 we employ the fixed effects, the Heckman selection bias and the GMM estimators to estimate income distributional effects of CAP subsidies. The results do not confirm the theoretical hypothesis that landowners benefit a large share of the CAP subsidies. According to our estimates, farmers gain between 60% to 95%, 80% to 178% and 86% to 90% of the total value of coupled crop/animal, coupled RDP and decupled payments, respectively. The CAP subsidies are only marginally capitalised in land rents. Our results suggest that the rental rates are more responsive to structural variables and show a strong time dependency, suggesting the presence of rigidities in the EU rental markets, which constraint the adjustment of land rents to market signals and thus reduce landowners' gains from the CAP.
P32|Farm restructuring and agricultural recovery in Kazakhstan's grain region: An update|Against the rising global concern of how to achieve sustainable output expansion in food, we document the main outcomes of post-Soviet agricultural recovery and restructuring in the Kazakhstan grain region. Together with an expansion of cropland area and increasing capital input, real agricultural value added has almost doubled within the recent decade. Privatisation legislation has allowed private ownership of land. However, access to state land and capital continues to be strongly regulated, and private lenders even turn away from agriculture. There are now three dominant groups of agricultural producers in the region: large agricultural enterprises and smaller individual farms mostly engaged in grain, and tiny household economies focusing on vegetable and live-stock. While agricultural enterprises have been growing more persistently than individual farms in recent years, average land productivity of both farm types is practically identical and wheat yields are even higher in individual farms. Both vertically and horizontally integrated agroholdings have emerged among the agricultural enterprises and have brought outside investment and management to the region. With stable employment in agriculture, nominal consumption spending of rural households has tripled over the last decade and has risen much faster than the costs of living. While North Kazakhstan looks much like a success story, constrained factor markets are likely to dampen further growth. The Kazakh government should improve the legal conditions for a functioning land rental market, avoid driving commercial lenders out of the market, and make sure that future access to qualified labour in agriculture is warranted.
P32|La finance coopérative rurale en Chine : histoire, développement et perspectives|Rural cooperative finance, targeting small farmers, is one of the three pillars of rural finance in China. Historically, its development has taken three forms of organization: rural credit union, rural cooperative fund and mutual fund. Because of changes in market and policies? environment, but especially of the abandonment of cooperative principles, the credit union has become a commercial financial institution and cooperative fund disappeared. The current practices of mutual aid funds are paving the way for the future development of the rural cooperative finance relying on the integration of financial and economic cooperatives.

P32|Land Tenure Arrangements and Rural-Urban Migration in China|Summary Obstacles to internal migration in China contribute to inefficiency, inequality, and land degradation. Academic and policy debate has primarily focused on discrimination against rural migrants on arrival in urban areas. Meanwhile, barriers to migration out of rural areas have received less attention. This paper examines the role of incomplete rural property rights in the migration decisions of rural households. We examine the relationship between tenure insecurity and restrictions on land rentals, and participation in outside labor markets. The results indicate that tenure insecurity reduces migration. This relationship is particularly pronounced on forest land, which has implications for the conservation of recently replanted forest areas.
P32|Global Restructuring, Social Distancing, and a Community-Based Workerâ€™s Center Response|This paper addresses the impacts of global â€œsocial distancingâ€ on employers and workers and examines community-based worker center strategies to mitigate those impacts. Through a case study of El Centro Humanitario, Denverâ€™s human rights center for immigrant day laborers, the paper addresses how community organizations can respond to social distancing by â€œorganizing the unorganized,â€ and crafting strategies such as worker-owned cooperatives to promote workersâ€™ rights while reconnecting workers to their work and to each other.JEL classification: L31, L33, P32

P32|The dimensions of social capital and rural development: evidence from Water Communities in the Republic of Macedonia| Drawing on Nahapiet and Ghoshal's (1998) distinction between the structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions of social capital, this paper analyses the performance of Water Communities (WCs) in the Bregalnica region of the Republic of Macedonia. WCs are farmer-managed local irrigation systems which are critical to livelihoods in Bregalnica. Data on the performance of the WCs and role of social capital was collected via in-depth interviews and a farm survey (n=249) of both members and non-members. Results highlight the importance of social capital in explaining the decision to join a WC, the satisfaction of members with their WC, and payment behaviour.
P32|Embedded institutions and the persistence of large farms in Russia<BR>[Die Bedeutung eingebetteter Institutionen für den Fortbestand landwirtschaftlicher Großbetriebe in Russland]|Differences in farm structures between Russia and western market economies can hardly be made consistent with the neoclassical textbook idea of a technologically determined farm size operating in a perfect market environment. The main aim of the paper is to identify embedded institutions that provide an explanation for the persistent differences. It is shown that these institutions vary widely across countries. We argue that the historical contingency of a patrimonial society that is both hierarchical and egalitarian also has an important bearing on the current persistence of large farming structures in Russia. The cultural beliefs based on this contingency explain the relative absence of entrepreneurial attitude in the rural society, the lack of trust in formal transactions with strangers, and the unwillingness to deviate from collective behaviour. Managers of former collective farms together with regional government authorities had strong incentives to secure their status-quo rents by inhibiting individualisation in agriculture. In addition, based on their ideological background in communism and their lifelong experience, many of them simply could not imagine how food security and social safety in the countryside should be provided without large farms. It is argued that the evolution of super-large farms could only arise because cooperative and corporate farms survived up to bankruptcy and because embedded institutions impeded the foundation of family farms. Mental models of policy makers did contribute to the amalgamation of corporations and cooperatives into super-large farms. The paper ends with an evaluation from the economic point of view of the existence of super-large farms and with a projection of what may happen in the future.
P32|Economic Growth and Transition in Vietnam and China and its Consequences for their Agricultural Sectors: Policy and Agricultural Adjustment Issues| Secondary data are used to discuss and compare the consequences for agriculture of economic growth and transition in Vietnam and China. It is found that China and Vietnam have experienced similar adjustments in their agricultural sectors and face at this time, similar agricultural policy problems. China began its economic reforms in 1979 and Vietnam followed in 1986. Since then both countries have experienced rapid economic growth, falling poverty rates and significant rises in per capita income. At the same time, substantial restructuring of their economies has occurred, a feature of which has been a decline in the relative contribution of agriculture to total employment and output. These changes are outlined. Significant changes have also occurred within the agricultural sectors of China and Vietnam and these are reviewed. In both countries, the livestock sector has grown in relative importance. Households are the main contributors to agricultural production but their individual holdings of land are small by Western standards and households keeping livestock mostly only hold a few head. Given the exit of farmers from agriculture, pressures are mounting for increasing the size of agricultural units. This exit can add to economic efficiency and growth. Policies to facilitate movements from farm to non-farm employment are discussed and analysed. Property rights and the marketability of agricultural land can facilitate such movements and contribute to economic efficiency. In recent times, China and Vietnam have extended property rights in agricultural land and have increased its marketability. These measures are outlined. With further economic development and transition, it is predicted that these rights and the marketability of agricultural land will be further extended. However, if previous practice is followed, those policy changes are likely to be gradual.
P32|Romanian Rural Development And The Financing Policy|Romania has a large rural areas and a great potential, but the Romanian rural has many economic and social issues. The main idea is that the major risk for the Romanian rural development is generated of the combination between the transition problems, poverty and financing possibilities. For Romania is a need for benchmarking rural development and Romania looks at European Union and United States policy and programme. In Romania there is a vicious circle regarding the correlation between productivity and poverty. Because the poverty is a huge problem for Romanian rural areas, an essential problem is the access to the community funds. Important is the chain of the European structural funds financing: Allocation, Accession, and Absorption. One single error on every part of this chain would stop the investment. All insist that Romania should reform its administration and reduce red tape, to create a depoliticized and transparent system.
P32|Les petites exploitations roumaines connaissent elles une évolution sous contraintes de localisation?|This paper aims to clarify the recent evolution of Romanian small farms. As a result of complex historic process the category of subsistence and semi-subsistence farms is well represented within Romanian Farm structure (Mathijs and al., 2004; Giruca and al., 2006). The recent data collected by the General Census and Farm Structure surveys gave some signs of the recent evolution. We focus specifically on the smallest categories and try to differentiate their evolution among different factors. Farm survival and Farm growth literature is abundant and focuses especially on initial farm size, specialisation or pluriactivity of the farm (Weiss, 1999). In contrast, the role of localization, linked to historical background or physical constraints, as a factor is more limited in the literature. Other institutional factors such as inheritance and succession have not really been approached until now. We choose to investigate those factors using a multiple regression on the 3 recent data collections in Romania.
P32|Rethinking Agricultural Production Collectivities : The case for a group approach to energize agriculture and empower poor farmers|In the face of persistent rural poverty, an incomplete agrarian transition, the predominance of small and marginal farms and an emerging feminization of agriculture, this paper argues for a new institutional approach to poverty reduction, agricultural revival and social empowerment. It makes a strong case for a group approach to agricultural investment and production through promoting collectivities of the poor which, it argues, would be much more effective on all these counts than the traditional individual-oriented approaches. The collectivities proposed here, however, are small-sized, voluntary, socio-economically homogeneous, and participatory in decision-making, and in keeping with the principles emphasized in a human-rights approach to development. This is in sharp contrast to the largely failed historical efforts at early socialist collectivization, and some similar thrusts in non-socialist developing countries in the 1960s and 1970s, which were massive in scale, top-down, and typically coercive and non-participatory. The paper outlines the potential benefits of bottom-up agricultural production collectivities and describes a range of successful cases from the transition economies and South Asia. It also reflects on the contexts in which such collectivities may be expected to succeed, and how these efforts could be replicated for wider geographic coverage and impact.
P32|Food Availability and Food Entitlements during the Chinese Great Leap Forward Famine: A dynamic panel data analysis (In French)|The article aims at identifying socioeconomic factors which explain the Chinese famine of 1959-1961. The main hypothesis of this paper is that the radicalism of Great Leap Forward policies generated both a decline of agricultural output (availability problems) and the implementation of an inadequate food distribution policy which penalised rural populations (accessibility problems). An econometrical analysis with provincial panel data for the period 1954-1966 points out the role of bad political choices on the occurrence of the famine and confirms the simultaneous influence of food availability decline and food distribution issues on mortality rates.
P32|New Co-operatives in China: An Indigenous Model of Social Enterprises|This paper aims to fill the academic gaps in the study of the new co-operative movement in China and its innovative mechanisms, and to get a more comprehensive idea of new co-operatives operating as home-grown Chinese social enterprises, by exploring the dynamic process of co-operative practice and social innovation in rural China. As an alternative to the popularly ideal-co-operative perspective, the paper develops a conceptual model from the perspective of a real-type co-operative concept, by employing a historical neo-institutional perspective combined with power-and-resource-related theory. Using this model it shows how institutional legacies from the past as well as resources and environments in the present can influence and shape co-operative development in rural China. By providing a consistent, systematic analysis with an emphasis on the bottom-up institutional innovation process, the paper helps to explain some of the conceptual and practical difficulties that hamper the understanding of new co-operative development in China.

P32|Toward a harmonious countryside: rural development survey results of the People’s Republic of China|The construction of a New Socialist Countryside (NSC) is among the highlights in the People's Republic of China’s (PRC) 11th Five-Year Plan (2006–2010). The NSC aims to accelerate the development and modernization of the agricultural and rural economy in order to close the widening rural–urban income gap. In an effort to better understand the priorities of and binding constraints to the PRC's rural development, and to aid the development of the NSC, two surveys were undertaken by the Asian Development Bank in six rural areas—Chongqing, Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shaanxi, and Shangdong. The 2007 survey collected village and household information on the first year of the NSC program, and the 2010 survey captured the possible changes after a few years of the program's implementation. A special feature of these surveys is that they allow for comparison of villagers' and village cadres' views on the priorities of the PRC's rural development. This paper summarizes the findings emerging from these surveys, particularly with respect to the challenges and priority areas of the PRC's rural development in 2007 and 2010. Among the key findings are (i) income growth remains the highest priority in the PRC’s rural development agenda; and (ii) lack of capital and lack of necessary job skills are the most binding constraints for growth in agricultural income and nonagricultural income, respectively.
P32|Русская Аграрная Институциональная Система (Историко-Конструктивистский Анализ)<BR>[Russian agrarian institutional system (historico-constructivist analysis)]|In this paper, the current situation in Russian agriculture is analyzed on the basis of constructivist institutionalism as a result of the institutional evolution during several centuries. In particular this analysis has shown that such agrarian upheavals in Russia, as the abolition of serfdom in 1861, Stolypin reform in 1906, the October Revolution in 1917, the collectivization of the late 1920s - early 1930s., as well as post-Soviet reforms in the 1990’s and theirs adjustments at the beginning of this century, took place following specific cycles. These cycles can be summarized as follows: the functioning of institutions produces reactions of different actors, which are expressed in ideologies; ideologies are competing for influence, and for whatever reason one of these ideologies determines the content of the legislation, which is created to solve problems in the functioning of institutions; the new legislation affects (but does not define) the operation of institutions with the old and/or new problems, and we return to the starting point of the cycle. The legislation does not define the functioning of institutions, since the rules that underlie the institutions can be formal or informal. In order to understand the complementarity or incompatibility of formal and informal rules, it is necessary to analyze the dynamics of their links, as the socio-economic reality is very inertial. The perception of the institutions of different actors is going through the prism of their sense of justice, and it can provoke a conflict between legitimacy and legality.

P32|The Management of Agrarian Cooperatives: Cooperatives’ Typologies in the Olive Oil Sector in Spain|Cooperatives are the basis of the social economy in many agricultural sectors. The present research work investigates the management situation of the olive oil cooperatives in Spain. The study identifies a typology of cooperatives based on their attitudes towards to the sector: three categories are established and described attending its productivity activity, financial activity and commercial activity. The study concludes with important managerial aspects of olive oil cooperatives in Spain.
P32|Institutional change and collective action: The case of reclamation systems in Northwest Poland|This paper examines two drastic changes in the performance of local water associations in providing local public goods - appropriate levels of water table - in the reclamation system in the Powiat Pyrzyce in the Voivodship Zachodniopomorski in northwest Poland. Employing an institutional economics approach shows the results of processes of revalorisation of the interrelated property objects land and reclamation infrastructure that have been triggered and shaped not only by the drastic political, economic and administrative changes after the breakdown of the socialist regime in Poland in 1990, but also by the prospect of joining the European Union and the proactive leadership of the director of the Powiat Department of Environmental Protection, Forestry and Agriculture. More precisely, both processes - the discontinuation (from 1990 onwards) and revival (from 2002 onwards) of the local water associations - were mainly determined by changing market conditions together with variances in the ability of state authorities to effectively control and facilitate these associations. Further, the delay in overcoming the period of collective inaction was fostered by the time-delayed and cumulative effects of neglecting the cleaning and the maintenance of secondary ditches.

P32|Farm debt in transition countries: Lessons for Tajikistan| Farms in Tajikistan currently face a severe debt crisis that has been caused by a combination of two factors typical of such situations in many countries: (a) the inability of the farms to make a profit under current conditions and (b) continued lending by the banks to cotton producers regardless of reduced payment capacity and lack of credit-worthiness. The paper traces the accumulation of farm debt in Tajikistan to pervasive government intervention in both financing and production decisions, which has led to soft budget constraints and moral hazard behavior. The purpose of the paper is to inform the debate around the issue of cotton farm debt in Tajikistan by studying the experience of other countries that had to contend with farm debt overhangs in the 1980s and the 1990s. Five CIS transition countries (Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine) and one market economy (Israel) are studied using time series of aggregate financial reports of the farm sectors. The comparative analysis shows that the farm debt issue is not strictly a transition economy phenomenon. The problem can occur in market economies (e.g., Israel) if the state pursues policies directed toward the expansion of farm production without heed to creditworthiness of the farms and if the farm structure is incompatible with profitability and efficiency criteria. The basic reasons that led to debt accumulation in CIS and in Israel remain valid to this day, and the policy solutions implemented in these countries are relevant for Tajikistan.
P32|Sources of Agricultural Productivity Growth in Central Asia| The paper examines agricultural production and productivity growth in two Central Asian countries – Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Both countries are characterized by a significant shift of resources from the traditional Soviet model of collective agriculture to more market-compliant individual and family farming. In both countries, the beginning of the policy-driven switch to family farming around 1997 coincided with the beginning of recovery in agriculture, namely resumption of agricultural growth after a phase of transition decline since 1991. In addition to growth in total agricultural production, we also observe significant increases in productivity of both land and labor since 1997. These observations suggest that productivity growth may be attributable to the changes in farming structure in Central Asia. To check this conjecture we assess the sources of growth by applying the standard Solow growth accounting methodology. Using time series of country statistics for farms of different organizational forms, we decompose the growth in output into growth in the resource base (extensive growth) and growth in productivity (intensive growth). Solow growth accounting clearly shows that, first, much of the growth at the country level is attributable to increases in productivity rather than increases in resources and, second, the increases in productivity in family farms (especially household plots) outstrip the increases in productivity in former collective and state farms. These findings confirm that the recovery of agricultural production in Central Asia has been driven largely by productivity increases, and it is the individual farms that are the main source of agricultural productivity increases.
P32|Survival and Growth of Family Farms in a Transition Country – The Hungarian Case| The paper investigates the validity of Gibrat’s Law in Hungarian agriculture. We use FADN data between 2001 and 2007 and employ quantile regression techniques to test the validity of Gibrat’s Law across quantiles. The Law is strongly rejected for all quantiles, providing strong evidence that smaller farms tend to grow faster than larger ones. We provide a number of socio-economic factors that can explain farm growth. Of these we found that total subsidies received by farm and far operator’s age are the most significant factors.

P32|Twenty years of land reforms in Central and Eastern Europe: state of play and outlook|The purpose of this article is to gain a perspective on the land reforms in the Central and Eastern European countries to show the extent to which the structure of agricultural production left by the socialist period has influenced the restructuring dynamics. In this context, the observed dual agricultural structure is seen as the result of a sticking point exacerbated by the agricultural transition’s land component.
P32|Governance Structures and Resource Policy Reform: Insights from Agricultural Transition|New research on the political economy of policy-induced distortions to incentives for optimal resource use in agriculture and insights from the study of the dramatic reforms in former state-controlled economy has led to enhanced insights on the role of governance structures on policy making in agricultural and natural resources. This paper reviews these research developments and key new insights.
P32|The Dualistic Model of European Agriculture - a Theoretical Framework for the Endogenous Development|The European model of agriculture refers to a multifunctional and virtuous model of agriculture that is progressively substituting the productivist model of agriculture, that, in the recent past, has been supported by agricultural community policies. However, the European model of agriculture comprises heterogeneous realities and economic actors characterised by different local conducts. Schematizing this model, we can distinguish two agriculture typologies: modernised agriculture and traditional agriculture. In this article, we will develop a theoretical framework which encompasses the different patterns of endogenous development in both agriculture typologies. Through this article, we aim to create the theoretical basis necessary to undertake the study of the dualistic model of European agriculture.
P32|The Necessity for the Modernization of the Technical-Material Base of Agricultural Exploitations within the Process of Forming Competition-Economy|The necessity for the modernization of the production processes in agriculture resides in the fact that this is the most important means to raise agricultural productivity, especially in the long term, to reduce production costs and to raise economic profitability, with a direct positive impact on the raising of income for the ones who undergo their activity in the agricultural sector. The case study conducted in Galati county covers the 2006-2007 period regarding the situation of the tractor and agricultural engine fleet as well as the evolution of chemically applied fertilizer consumption.
P32|Land Rights Insecurity and Temporary Migration in Rural China|Like most other developing countries, China experiences huge migration outflows from rural areas. Their most striking characteristic is a high geographical and temporal mobility. Rural migrants keep going back and forth between origin villages and destination areas. In this paper, we show that this temporary feature of migration can be linked to land rights insecurity. As village land ownership remains collective and as land use rights can be periodically reallocated, individual out-migration can result in deprivation of those rights. Moreover, the intensity of this insecurity varies according to the village-level management of land and the contractual status of land plots. We use these variations to identify the effect of land rights insecurity on migration behavior. Empirical results based on representative 2002 rural data demonstrate substantial impact.
P32|A Start for Mild Liberalization? Building Civil Society through Co-operative Dynamics in China|This paper aims to understand the society-state relationship in China, by exploring this dynamics with other types of organizations, i.e. civil society organizations with economic objectives. The dynamics of co-operatives can influence and interact with civil society dynamics. In this sense, this paper presents the evolution of civil society in China by identifying the causal mechanisms of co-operatives’ development and the conditions needed for them to develop. This causal mechanisms are set within the context of one historical process evolving with path dependency. Using this theoretical framework, it further presents the empirical observation. The findings of the paper are that economic development shaped the new co-operative movement in China; this process was different from the former revolutionary communalist co-operative movement; like their counterparts from the liberal democratic tradition, new co-operatives participated in the market economy, developed in an evolutionary and peaceful way, had great respect for private property and especially, were self-motivated and voluntary in nature. The co-operative movement in China can thus be considered as a mild liberalization within civil society’s sphere. Furthermore, its spillover effect would be seen as the effect of enhancing the role of civil society as a critical dialogue partner with the state. The originality lies in its systematic analysis examining the conditions that underpin this dynamics, thus filling the academic gaps in the study of society-state relationship in another way different from the popularly-used perspective which examines the voluntary and non-profit nature of civil society organizations and excludes the economic spheres within civil society.
P32|Land rights insecurity and temporary migration in rural China|Like most other developing countries, China experiences huge migration outflows from rural areas. Their most striking characteristic is a high geographical and temporal mobility. Rural migrants keep going back and forth between origin villages and destination areas. In this paper, we show that this temporary feature of migration can be linked to land rights insecurity. As village land ownership remains collective and as land use rights can be periodically reallocated, individual out-migration can result in deprivation of those rights. Moreover, the intensity of this insecurity varies according to the village-level management of land and the contractual status of land plots. We use these variations to identify the effect of land rights insecurity on migration behavior. Empirical results based on representative 2002 rural data demonstrate substantial impact.
P32|Understanding of Social Capital in Gender-based Participatory JFM Programme: An Evidence from West Bengal|This paper presents an empirical investigation to measure the level of social capital in a gender sensitive planning on joint forest management programme in West Bengal. The study suggests that the pre-existing traditional characteristics of community solidarity, mutual trust and coordinated action are the inner dynamic for the development of social capital in JFM villages compared with non-JFM villages. Within JFM villages such a dynamics of social capital is more pronounced in female FPC-villages in general and among very poor (landless) category of households in particular, and the food livelihood insecurity cannot destroy such institution of social capital.
P32|Cambodia’s patient zero: The political economy of foreign aid and avian influenza|What happens when a developing country with poor health infrastructure and even poorer animal health surveillance is thought to be a potential source for the next emerging infectious disease? This is the story of Cambodia and Avian Influenza. This paper undertakes a review of the relevant literature and analyzes the results of detailed semi-structured interviews of individuals highly engaged in Avian Influenza work in Cambodia. First, the political economy context is detailed with particular attention to aid dependency, tourism and the role of the livestock sector. The role of politics and the bureaucracy in this context is explored. Three competing policy narratives emerge: first, kill the birds, but don’t compensate as it’s too difficult and costly; second, behaviour modification change is the answer; and third, whatever happened to poverty and livelihoods? Finally, the political economy of the policy process in Cambodia is described, including actors, networks and interests. The paper finds that in the context of avian influenza, donors are too often motivated by concerns other than protecting livelihoods, just as traditional aid activities are often dominated by the need to tie aid to donor countries, avian influenza activities have been overtly focused on detecting and preventing pandemic as a threat to the donor countries themselves. As of 2008, donors have committed $35 million to Cambodia, placing it seventh among the top 10 recipients of avian influenza funding globally, fourth in terms of per case and per death from A/H5N1, and second in terms of per capita and per outbreak funding. However, ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of policies in Cambodia must rest with those in charge. Poor governance and pervasive institutional failure have plagued the response in Cambodia. Effective disease response and effective governance must go hand-in-hand. A rushed, emergency oriented response to avian influenza may have undermined already weak governance capacity in Cambodia, fuelling patronage networks and encouraging rent seeking. Whether such funds have increased the ability of Cambodia—and the world—to prevent a future pandemic remains uncertain.
P32|Acceptance of biotechnology and social-cultural implications in Ghana|Despite major scientific progress in the application of biotechnology in agriculture, public attitudes towards biotechnology in general and genetically modified food (GM food) products in particular remain mixed in Africa. Examining responses on acceptance of GM food through a stakeholder survey in Ghana, it was established that half of the 100 people sample interviewed were not in favor of GM foods. To this group acceptance of GM foods would make farmers loose focus on the traditional ways of cultivation, putting the whole nation at the mercy of profit driven foreign companies who produce GM foods. In order to have clear and unbiased attitudes towards agricultural biotechnology in Africa, there is the need to substitute dominant ideologies in the way biotechnology research and dissemination are conducted in developed countries with tailor-made methodologies in developing countries. This paper emphasizes the social dynamic force of food focusing on the need for social shaping of biotechnologies to reflect local and regional needs. Respondents’ perceptions of GM foods suggest that food is seen as not just a commodity to be consumed but food has both cultural and national identities. Generally, people are identified by their consumption and nutrition lifestyles and therefore take pride in what they eat. A proposal is made to set biotechnology research agenda in the context of social choices; social scientific coalition of biotechnology with endogenous development pathways’ as opposed to ‘exogenous biotechnology research’. Also there is the need for adequate capacity building of the existing regulatory institutions to handle ethical and moral issues associated with biotechnology research since survey findings showed lacked of public confidence in them.
P32|Twenty years of land reforms in Central and Eastern Europe: state of play and outlook| The purpose of this article is to gain a perspective on the land reforms in the Central and Eastern European countries to show the extent to which the structure of agricultural production left by the socialist period has influenced the restructuring dynamics. In this context, the observed dual agricultural structure is seen as the result of a sticking point exacerbated by the agricultural transition’s land component.

P32|Functioning of Land Markets in the EU Member States|Economic theory, as well as empirical findings, suggest that the way in which agricultural support is provided has an influence on land markets, because payments capitalise to some degree into land values, affecting both the sale and rental price of land. The present paper analyses how the income distributional effects and farm restructuring are impacted by the SPS by accounting for entitlement tradability, cross-compliance requirements, different SPS implementation models, and the entitlement stock. Our results suggest that the SPS implication details are highly important: farmers’ benefits can range from 100% of the SPS value to a negative policy incidence, and farm structural change may be hindered by the SPS.
P32|Analyzing Cost-Efficient Production Behavior Under Economies of Scope: A Nonparametric Methodology|In designing a production model for firms that generate multiple outputs, we take as a starting point that such multioutput production refers to economies of scope, which in turn originate from joint input use and input externalities. We provide a nonparametric characterization of cost-efficient behavior under these conditions, and subsequently institute necessary and sufficient conditions for data consistency with such efficient behavior that only include observed firm demand and supply data. We illustrate our methodology by examining the cost efficiency of research programs in economics and business management faculties of Dutch universities. This application shows that the proposed methodology may entail robust conclusions regarding cost-efficiency differences between universities within specific specialization areas, even when using shadow prices to evaluate the different inputs.

P32|Análise setorial e topografia da estrutura produtiva: as cooperativas agropecuárias no Paraná<BR>[Sectoral analysis of production structure and topography: the agricultural cooperatives in Paraná]|In 1996, the agricultural cooperatives in Paraná were responsible for 55% of the state's agriculture GDP , and they act in the food industry. Analyze the evolution of industry structure of the state in 1990 and 1995, considering explicitly the Agricultural sector and the components of the Food Industry breakdown in Cooperative and Non-Cooperative, is the goal of this study. From the regional input-output matrices for 40 sectors , the analysis concludes that: the sectors Pulp, Paper and Printing and Textiles were key in 1990 and 1995;, the production structure of Paraná showed in a less clear way than in years 80, trend of change in the sectoral composition in favor of other sectors of manufacturing industry in the 90 years;, the technical coefficients of the agricultural cooperatives were very similar to the non-cooperative, showing the monitoring of technological evolution in the sectors in focus ; the sectors linked to the cooperatives were most impacted by the increase in final demand in relation to production, income and employment.
P32|Policy options of agricultural biotechnology R&D in Sub-Saharan Africa: key issues and aspects|This paper reviews the status of Agricultural Biotechnology in Sub-Saharan Africa. It addresses the potential economic benefits to Sub-Saharan Africa and the effect biotechnology policies may have on growth, production and poverty reduction. The extent to which agricultural biotechnology will compound or mitigate the constraints faced by smallholders/subsistence farmers is also discussed. The status of crop biotechnology research worldwide is reviewed and the influence of intellectual property rights (IPRs) and market concentration on the development and diffusion of biotechnology in Sub-Saharan Africa is analyzed. The paper also explores the potential of public-private partnerships and recommends policy measures and investments that could focus more biotechnology research on the problems of the poor and alleviate some of the concerns about the impacts of biotechnology.
P32|A stakeholder approach to investigating public perception and attitudes towards agricultural biotechnology in Ghana|A stakeholder survey was conducted in Ghana to assess the level of public perceptions and acceptance of agricultural biotechnologies. A total of 100 respondents drawn from academia, Non-governmental organizations, business community, government and other stakeholders were interviewed on their views on self-protection attitudes, health and economic benefits, skepticism and optimism about agricultural biotechnologies as well as the level of confidence in existing government regulatory systems to protect society against any negative effects of biotechnological issues. Although half of the sample interviewed did not accept biotechnologies in general and GM foods in particular, there was rather high approval of some specific health and economic benefits. About 80 percent of the sample interviewed lack confidence in existing government regulatory systems probably due to inadequate capacity. Upgrading of the existing regulatory system with adequate capacity to regulate the ethical and moral issues associated with biotechnologies and GM foods was recommended
P32|Emergence, Organizational Transformations, And Decline Of The Piquetero Movement: A Comparative Institutional Explanation|This paper offers an institutional explanation for the growth, organizational transformations, and decline of the piquetero social movement in Argentina, developed from a comparative perspective based on Latin America. I analyze which institutional arrangements, political actors, and configurations of power contributed to the success and decline of the piqueteros. Applying the basic principles of the rational choice approach, I find that the success, decline, and transformation of the organizational structures of the piquetero movement were mainly produced by a political cycle of deep political division within the ruling party (the Peronist party). Other socio-economic explanatory factors were the over-regulated Argentine labor market, and the exogenous impact of the Argentine economic crisis through relatively high unemployment rates.
P32|Forecasting Input Demand Shocks on China's Gross Value of Agricultural Output|This paper applies recent developments in forecasting spatial process models to estimate the impact of input shocks on China's 1999 gross value added output (GVAO) in agriculture. A Cobb-Douglas production function allowing total factor productivity to vary across regions is used to forecast the geographic distribution of GVAO following shocks in input availability. Results suggest that GVAO will be similar to baseline levels following input shocks, but the differential gains experienced in some areas may correspond with losses in neighboring administrative units.
P32|Study of Agricultural Productivity and Its Convergence across China's Regions|Because it has a large, growing population but only a small share of land that can be cultivated, it is important for China to enhance its agricultural productivity through technological progress. Using data envelopment analysis, we decompose productivity into pure technical efficiency change, scale efficiency change, and technological progress. We thereby find that annual growth of agricultural productivity in China is about 2.2 percent. Technological progress improved agricultural productivity at a rate of 4.2 percent annually from 1980 to 2005, but the technology efficiency dampened it by an average of 1.9 percent per year. TFP growth and technological progress are faster in eastern provinces than for those in central and western regions. Relative technology efficiency was stable in eastern provinces but declined in the central and western provinces during the study period. Thus, it was technological progress that boosted the TFP growth in china's agriculture. Tests also reveal that sigma convergence existed in Chinese agricultural productivity.
P32|The Limits of Equality: Insights from the Israeli Kibbutz|What limits the capacity of society to redistribute and provide insurance? What determines the structure of compensation in organizations striving for income equality? This paper addresses these questions by investigating the economic and sociological forces underlying the persistence of the Israeli kibbutzim, communities based on the principle of income equality. To do this, I exploit newly-assembled data on kibbutzim, and a financial crisis in the late-1980s that affected them differentially. The main findings are that: (1) productive individuals are the most likely to exit, and a kibbutz’s wealth serves as a lock-in device that increases the value of staying; (2) higher wealth reduces exit and supports a high degree of income equality; (3) ideology contributes to income equality. Using a simple model, I show that these findings are consistent with a view of the kibbutz as providing optimal insurance without commitment to stay, namely when participation is at-will. More generally, these findings contribute to an understanding of how mobility limits redistribution, and to an understanding of the determinants of the sharing rule in other types of organizations, such as professional partnerships, cooperatives and labor-managed firms.
P32|Landwirtschaft In Moldova| This paper provides an overview of the economic situation of agriculture in the Republic of Moldova.

P32|Productivity and Efficiency of Corporate and Individual Farms in Ukraine| The paper presents a comparative analysis of the productivity of corporate and individual farms in Ukraine based primarily on cross-section data from a farm survey conducted by FAO in 2005. We calculate partial land and labor productivity, total factor productivity, and technical efficiency scores (using Stochastic Frontier Analysis) for farms of different organizational forms. Our results demonstrate with considerable confidence that, contrary to established convictions among the Ukrainian decision makers, the large corporate farms are not more productive than the smaller family farms. This finding is not restricted to Ukraine, as a similar result has been obtained by in Moldova, Russia, and the U.S. Policies encouraging a shift from large corporate farms to smaller individual farms, rather than the reverse, can be expected to produce beneficial results for Ukrainian agriculture and the economy in general. The government of Ukraine should abandon its inherited preference for large-scale corporate farms and concentrate on policies to improve the operating conditions for small individual farms. At the very least, the government should ensure a level playing field for farms of all sizes and organizational forms, and desist from biasing its policies in favor of large farms.
P32|"Thirty Years of Agricultural Transition in China (1977-2007) and the ""New Rural Campaign"""| Agriculture in China has experienced a compelling growth in the early 1980s, a buoyant upbeat in the early 1990s, and an extended period of low growth after 1995. Decollectivization, mar-ket reforms, public investments and technology have played a critical role during this overall successful process. However, the transition has also led to increasing inequalities between the agricultural and non-agricultural population, and substantial institutional issues remain to be fully addressed. The Chinese government is now reemphasizing agriculture and rural develop-ment under its New Rural Campaign with the objective to address rural-urban inequalities, but a stronger emphasis on participation and tenure reforms is warranted.
P32|Profit efficiency analysis under limited information with an application to German farm types|Lack of information about technology and prices often hampers the empirical assessment of the profit maximization hypothesis (viz. by measuring the degree of profit efficiency). The non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology can deal with such incomplete information. We exploit the implicit but largely neglected profit interpretation of the DEA model that builds on assumptions of monotone and convex production possibility sets. We show how its embedded assessment of necessary conditions for profit maximization can be strengthened given partial information in the form of monetary sub-cost/-revenue data (that are often easier obtained than the pure quantity data). Finally, we argue that a 'mix' efficiency analysis is naturally complementary to such a profit efficiency analysis. An application to German farm types complements our methodological discussion. By using non-parametric statistical tests, we further demonstrate the potential of the non-parametric approach in deriving strong and robust statistical evidence while imposing minimal structure on the setting under study. In particular, we look for significant efficiency variation over regions.
P32|Česká úvěrová podpora zemědělství: analýza prvních deseti let (available in Czech only)|The paper is dealing with the credit support to the Czech agriculture provided by Supporting and Guarantee Agricultural and Forestry Fund (SGAFF) during the ten years period since the inception of its activities in 1994 do the year 2003 which preceeded to the Czech entry into European Union (EU) and accession to the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU. SGAFF guaranteed relatively stable inflow of commercial bank credit for agriculture provided according to the market determined allocation, which is considered as an opposite to the administrative decisions. We evaluated the multiplication effect of the credit support which shows that one monetary unit allocated from the government budget to the support of agricultural credit secured commercial credit in the range of 3–5 monetary units.
P32|Does It Pay To Pray? Costly Ritual and Cooperation|Time-consuming and costly religious rituals pose a puzzle for economists committed to rational choice theories of human behavior. We propose that either through selection or a causal relationship, the performance of religious rituals is associated with higher levels of cooperation. To test this hypothesis we design field experiments to measure the in-group cooperative behavior of members of religious and secular Israeli kibbutzim, communal societies for which mutual cooperation is a matter of survival. Our results show that religious males (the primary practitioners of collective religious ritual in Orthodox Judaism) are more cooperative than religious females, secular males and secular females. Moreover, the frequency with which religious males engage in collective religious rituals predicts well their degree of cooperative behavior.

P32|Evaluating the Financial Position and Performance of a typical Dairy Farm in Bulgaria|The aim of this paper is to explore the potentials of typical middle sized dairy farms (with 22 cows) to absorb the quotas and market shares released by the small scale farms after the EU accession in 2007. The hypothesis is that quota introduction combined with high quality standards for raw milk will significantly reduce the share of small scale farms in milk production for processing. If different opportunities for alternative income-generating activities become available for small farms (as a consequence of the EU accession), their willingness to give up dairy farming will increase. Middle sized farms will benefit from an improved access to resources and also from more favourable conditions for economic growth. In this paper the analysis was made on the International Farm Comparison Network (IFCN) concept of typical farm. The Trade Implication and Policy Implication CALculator (TIPICAL) modelling program provides financial statements and most of the calculations for business’ profitability, solvency, liquidity, cost analysis and comparisons. The results of the financial analysis show the poor credit power of farms, when calculated only on farm assets market price. In the same time, it reveals the potential of growing and carries out an economy of scale when both financial and farm management are improved.

The causality, nature and consequences of arsons in repopulated common lands in Galicia during the first two decades of Franco's regime will be discussed. Thus, an exhaustive analysis of the reports of fires affecting indirect common lands in the Forest District of the province of Lugo will be carried out.

P32|Environnement Institutionnel, Modes Organisationnels Et Performances Productives : Une Analyse Des Grandes Fermes Moldaves Au Début De La Transition|The empirical analysis of the relations between institutional environment and organisational modes and how they affect productive performances, is relatively rare in literature, due to a lack of data. This article is an attempt at developing an empirical methodology which could shed light on the nature of these relations, using data related to large farms during the privatization of state and collective farms in Moldavia (1991-1997). In the first part, the transformation process of the organisational modes in these large farms, which were formerly state or collectively owned, is given a new institutional interpretation. In the second part of this article we develop an empirical methodology in order to analyse the interaction between the choice of one of the new organisational modes and the farmer’s productive performances. This is based on the estimation of the farms’ technical efficiency, using the stochastic frontier model by Battese and Coelli (1995). With this model it is possible to take into account the influence of the organisational modes on the production process, through the endogenous specification of forms of organisation (with the estimation of a nested logit model).

Ergebnisse einer Fallstudie in Bałtów, Südostpolen]|Polskie obszary wiejskie nadal wykazują wysoki stopień zatrudnienia w rolnictwie w porównaniu z pozostałymi krajami Unii Europejskiej, co wynika z braku możliwości zatrudnienia w innych sektorach gospodarki na wsi. Szczególnie zamknięcie zakładów przemysłu ciężkiego we wczesnych latach 90-tych XX wieku pozostawiło wielu mieszkańców wsi na utrzymaniu jedynie z niewielkich dochodów prywatnych gospodarstw rolnych lub emerytur i rent. W gminie Bałtów (południowo-wschodnia Polska), w celu przeciwdziałania tej sytuacji, lokalne stowarzyszenia rozwojowe, wraz z lokalną grupą partnerską, podjęło inicjatywy stymulujące rozwój gospodarki regionalnej poprzez tworzenie infrastruktury turystycznej. Niniejsza praca przedstawia studium przypadku przeprowadzone w Bałtowie, w tym analizę lokalnych problemów, szans rozwojowych oraz doświadczeń w zakresie oddolnych inicjatyw. Głównym rezultatem wysiłków podjętych przez stowarzyszenia rozwojowe i grupę partnerską jest, stworzenie różnych atrakcji turystycznych. Dzięki nim powstają nie tylko nowe miejsca pracy poza sektorem rolniczym – tworzą one nowe źródła dochodu dla rolników i firm w wyniku wzmożonego zapotrzebowania na zakwaterowanie oraz inne usługi dla turystów. Infrastruktura turystyczna została sprawnie rozbudowana dzięki zaangażowaniu mieszkańców, obecności ludzi o cechach przywódczych, ścisłej współpracy z samorządem lokalnym oraz zaangażowaniu finansowemu jednego z lokalnych mieszkańców. Warsztaty, seminaria oraz otwarte spotkania organizowane przez stowarzyszenia przyniosły wzrost akceptacji dla inicjatyw wśród społeczności lokalnej. Regionalna grupa partnerska, które łączy różne stowarzyszenia lokalne i regionalne w zakresie wspólnej oferty turystycznej, zachęciło wielu mieszkańców do włączania się w późniejsze inicjatywy. W 2004 roku regionalna grupa partnerska złożyła wniosek o działanie pilotażowe dla wdrożenia inicjatywy wspólnotowej UE Leader+. Turystycznego rozwoju regionu wokół gminy Bałtów nie można rozważać jako bezpośredniej odpowiedzi na problemy zarobkowe lokalnych rolników i na brak zmian strukturalnych w rolnictwie, niemniej tworzy on nowe perspektywy dla lokalnych firm i zapewnia dodatkowy, niezwiązany z rolnictwem dochód dla rolników.
P32|Productivity And Efficiency Of Small And Large Farms In Moldova| The paper presents a comparative analysis of the productivity of small and large farms in Moldova based primarily on cross-section data from three farm surveys conducted by the World Bank and USAID in 2000 and 2003. The survey data are supplemented where feasible with time series from official national-level statistics. We calculate partial land and labor productivity, total factor productivity, and technical efficiency scores (using Stochastic Frontier and Data Envelopment Analysis algorithms) for the two categories of small individual farms and large corporate farms. Our results demonstrate with considerable confidence that small individual farms in Moldova are more productive and more efficient than large corporate farms. This finding is not restricted to Moldova, as a similar result has been obtained by other authors in Russia (2005) and in the U.S. (2002), where a recent study has found that an increase of farm size reduces, rather than increases, agricultural productivity. Policies encouraging a shift from large corporate farms to smaller individual farms, rather than the reverse, can be expected to produce beneficial results for Moldovan agriculture and the economy in general. The government of Moldova should abandon its inherited preference for large-scale corporate farms and concentrate on policies to improve the operating conditions for small individual farms. At the very least, the government should ensure a level playing field for farms of all sizes and organizational forms, and desist from biasing its policies in favor of large farms.
P32|Institutional Change in East German Water Management Systems| Like in many fen land regions in East Germany, long-standing intensive arable farming -enabled by reclamation - has caused soil deterioration and high water runoff in the Schraden region. More than ten years of economic and political transformation that followed the breakdown of the socialist regime has worsened the situation and even added new problems. The visible consequences are droughts in the summer, waterlogged plots in the spring, and worn-down water management facilities that operate in an uncoo rdinated or unautho rized way. Given the local public good character of so me features of the fen land, the common-pool character of the intermittently scarce resource water within the ecosystem, and the conflicting interests of regional stakeholders, it is argued that the reallocation of property rights over reclamation systems, together with ineffective coordination mechanisms, have caused the physical and institutional failure of the water management system and thus impeded app ropriate land use. More precisely, the combination of legal insecurities accompanied by enforcement problems, fragmented land ownership structure, and a high number of short-term lease contracts have reduced the incentives for the majority of farmers to maintain the reclamation works. Due to limited statutory rights in conjunction with limited financials, the present water association appears to be an inadequate local coordination mechanism. Furthermore, the complete and timeintensive restructuring process at all levels of water administration has resulted in cumbersome or even nonexistent interrelations between various governmental layers as well as in rare transboundary contacts.
P32|Cooperation and the in-group-out-group bias: A field test on Israeli kibbutz members and city residents|The in-group-out-group bias is among the most widely documented and analyzed phenomenon in the social sciences. We conduct field experiments to test whether the bias extends to the cooperative behavior of one of the most successful modern collectives, the Israeli kibbutz. Despite their promise as universal cooperators, kibbutz members are more cooperative toward anonymous kibbutz members than they are toward anonymous city residents. In fact, when paired with city residents, kibbutz members' observed levels of cooperation are identical to those of city residents. Moreover, self-selection rather than kibbutz socialization largely accounts for the extent to which kibbutz members are cooperative.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

P32|Villages where China's Ethnic Minorities Live|This paper investigates how ethnic minorities in rural China are faring compared with the ethnic majority. The village is the unit of analysis and large surveys for 2002 are used. Minority villages in northeast China are found to have a somewhat better economic situation than the average majority village, but minority villages in the southwest are clearly faring worse. Industrialisation, inputs in agricultural production, stock of human capital of the labour force, wage level on the local labour market as well as indicators of path dependency are all found to affect the economic situation of a village. Location is the single most important circumstance working against a favourable economic situation for minority villages in the north- and particularly the southwest. Low village income results in long-distance migration for many ethnic minorities, but for some minorities their ethnicity hinders migration.
P32|Ritorno alle Riduzioni|In one of his earlier articles, Giancarlo Mazzocchi argued that the Paraguay Reductions could not be considered communist since they showed an evolution towards more independent work on plots entrusted to individual families. But he did not give any evidence of this surmised evolution. Indeed, the historian Eberhard Gothein offered a compelling reason why this could not happen. Work on public and private plots had to be monitored, and it was almost impossible to monitor work performed on private plots. The Reductions can be seen as arising from an implicit contract whereby the Guarany tribes yielded sovereignty to the Jesuit leaders, in exchange for (i) safety from the Spanish colonists and (ii) subsistence. Thus subsistence for the Guaranis become a basic, public task of the Reductions. Thus considered, the «Guarany republics» do qualify as communistic. That education was also carried out publicly, thus engendering an «ethical state», is another concurrent consideration.
P32|Central and East European Agriculture in Integrating Europe|After the EU enlargement of May 2004, the exchange of agro-food goods between the EU 15 and the new member states (NMS) has accelerated considerably. In particular the expansion of Polish exports in 2005 resulted in the highest surplus registered by the NMS 4 (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia) in the past decade. Lower production costs in agriculture, especially for labour, are a fundamental cause of Poland's success to date. Despite remaining net importers, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have also slightly improved their position on the EU agro-food markets. Hungary's great ambitions - prior to EU accession - to further expand to EU markets have so far not materialized. The Hungarian setback is rooted in higher production costs, in particular in the livestock sector, and delayed preparations needed to meet European standards. Backed mostly by direct payments and by high EU internal farmgate prices for a number of products, the economic situation in agriculture in the NMS-4 has improved substantially after accession to the EU. In the years to come, price competitiveness in the NMS will erode as the slight deterioration in agricultural terms of trade visible in the past decade will continue. With ongoing integration into the EU, labour costs and land prices will be on the rise, while farmgate prices in the EU, under pressure from the WTO, will drop in the long run. Further liberalization of the agro-food markets and rising labour productivity will result in a reduction of agricultural jobs in the EU. Consequently, the production of organic foodstuffs and other labour-intensive regional specialties may become an increasingly attractive option to survive. The size and structure of farms will vary between countries depending on the different natural and climatic conditions, as well as their previous histories. It can be expected that large market-oriented farms will continue to constitute the majority in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and, to a lesser extent, in Hungary; the significance of smaller market-oriented farms is likely to dwindle. In Poland, this concentration process will ensue at a much slower pace owing to the country's completely different post-war development. Mounting WTO pressure and the growing reluctance of rich EU member states to contribute to the Brussels budget for the development of poorer countries of the Union will lead to a weakening of redistribution processes. As a result, the total amount of money available from Brussels for redistribution under the CAP will be less than today.
P32|"Doswiadczenia oddolnych inicjatyw rozwoju regionalnego oraz perspektywy dla programu leader+ w regionie Doliny Strugu w Polsce<BR>[Experience with Endogenous Rural Development Initiatives and the Prospects for Leader+ in the Region ""Dolina Strugu"", Poland]"|"Niniejsza praca przedstawia wyniki studium przypadku lokalnego rozwoju gospodarczego w Dolinie Strugu w województwie Podkarpackim w Polsce. Celem pracy jest analiza problemów i szans w rozwoju lokalnym, zbadanie potencjału inicjatyw oddolnych we wspieraniu rozwoju gospodarczego, zbadanie perspektyw wdrożenia inicjatywy Unii Europejskiej Leader+. Studium przypadku przede wszystkim opiera się na wywiadach przeprowadzonych z lokalnymi władzami, organizacjami pozarządowymi, właścicielami przedsiębiorstw i rolnikami latem 2005 roku. Dotychczasowy problem niewystarczających dochodów w rolnictwie był szczególnie dotkliwy w tym regionie, gdyż dwie trzecie jego mieszkańców w wieku produkcyjnym zatrudnionych jest w rolnictwie i praktycznie brakuje alternatywnych możliwości znalezienia zatrudnienia. Aby stawić czoła tym problemom, lokalna organizacja non-profit ""Dolina Strugu"" rozpoczęła serię działań rozwojowych. Inicjatywą z dużym wpływem na lokalną sytuację zarobkową jest spółka rynkowa ""Chmielnik Zdrój"", która obecnie zatrudnia 400 mieszkańców regionu. Zakupuje ona produkty u okolicznych rolników, przetwarza i sprzedaje do 70 tys. gospodarstw domowych. ""Dolina Strugu"" i władze lokalne skutecznie wnioskowały o strategie pilotażowe w celu wdrożenia Leader+ w ramach Polskiego Sektorowego Planu Operacyjnego. Potrzeba lokalnej strategii rozwojowej i wewnętrzne zachęty Leader+ skierowane na poprawienie i tworzenie źródeł dochodu powodują, że jego wdrożenie jest celem pożądanym. Należy poprawić lokalną znajomość inicjatywy społecznej, perspektywa planów krótkoterminowych lokalnej społeczności musi zostać zaspokojona odpowiednią ideą, trzeba wzmocnić lokalną wiarę w instytucje i programy UE oraz ustabilizować współpracą pomiędzy organizacją non-profit ""Dolina Strugu"" i przedstawicielami samorządów lokalnych."

Powiększające się różnice w poziomach zarobków i brak perspektyw znalezienia pracy spowodowały już odpływ młodych ludzi ze wsi oraz coraz bardziej zauważalne starzenie się terenów wiejskich. Inicjatywy lokalne, jak pokazują udane przypadki z różnych regionów Polski, mogą mieć trwały wpływ na rozwój gospodarczy terenów wiejskich i skutecznie przeciwdziałać wyżej wymienionym zjawiskom. Niniejsza praca przedstawia wyniki studium przypadku, które analizuje inicjatywy lokalne w gminie Debrzno w województwie pomorskim. Wyniki studium przypadku opierają się przede wszystkim na otwartych wywiadach przeprowadzonych wśród mieszkańców, przedstawicieli samorządu lokalnego oraz członków lokalnego stowarzyszenia rozwojowego. Poważnym problemem w regionie okalnym. W 2004 roku stowarzyszenie wraz z przedstawicielami dziesięciu innych gmin złożyło podanie o działania pilotażowe wdrażające Inicjatywę Wspólnotową Leader+. Konferencje przeprowadzone z potencjalnymi partnerami przyszłej grupy działania typu Leader, doświadczenie z inicjatywami lokalnymi w stowarzyszeniu oraz programie Naszyjnika Północy, a także wysoki poziom wiedzy zainteresowanych stron o projektach typu Leader stanowią obiecujące przesłanki dla skutecznego wdrożenia strategii pilotażowej w regionie.
P32|Endogenous initiatives as a chance to improve rural livelihood? Results of a case study in Bal­tow, South-Eastern Poland<BR>[Tourismus als eine Möglichkeit zur Erhöhung des ländlichen Einkommens? Ergebnisse einer Fallstudie in Bałtów, Südostpolen]|Polish rural areas, compared to other EU-25 member states, still show a high agricultural employment due to a lack of job opportunities in other rural economic sectors. In particular, in South eastern Poland the shut down of heavy industry companies in the early 1990s left many rural inhabitants only with small incomes from their peasant farms or pensions. In the communeBa?tów (South-eastern Poland) in order to counteract these developments, local development associations and a regional partnership undertook initiatives to stimulate the regional economy by creating a tourism infrastructure. This paper presents a case study, conducted in Ba?tów, which analyses local problems, development chances, and experience with local endogenous initiatives. The main results of the activities undertaken by the development associations and the partnership are seen in the creation of different tourist attractions. The latter do not only provide inhabitants with new non-agricultural jobs. They are also offering new income sources for peasants and local businesses as a result of an increased demand for accommodations and other tourist services. The successful implementation of tourist facilities was due to the involvement of local inhabitants, the presence of leader personalities, the close cooperation with the local government, and the financial engagement of a local inhabitant. Workshops, seminars, and open meetings organized by the associations led to an increasing acceptance of the initiatives by the local society. The regional partnership, which combines different local and regional associations in their ambitions to connect tourist offers, also encouraged many inhabitants to contribute to further initiatives. In 2004, the regional partnership also applied for the pilot measure to implement the EU Initiative Leader+. The tourism activities in the region around Ba?tów cannot be seen as a straight response to the incomerelated problems of the local peasant farms and the lacking structural change in agriculture, but they constitute new perspectives for local businesses and additional non-agricultural income sources for farmers.
P32|Local partnership as an incubator for rural development: the case of Debrzno, North-Western Poland<BR>[Lokale Partnerschaft als Inkubator für ländliche Entwicklung: Das Beispiel Dębrzno, Nordwestpolen]|Since the beginning of the 1990s, the gap in economic development between rural and urban regions in Poland has continuously grown. Increasing income disparities and the lack of job opportunities have already led to an outflow of young people out of and an increasing obsolescence in rural areas. As successful examples in different Polish regions show, endogenous initiatives may have a lasting impact on the economic development of rural areas and are able to counter the mentioned effects. This paper presents the results of a case study which analyses endogenous initiatives in the commune D?brzno, Pomorskie voivodship, Poland. The case study results primarily rely on open interviews conducted with inhabitants, representatives of the local government, and members of a local development association. A major problem for the region is the high unemployment rate, due to the shutdown of the local state farms and the local military base. To respond to this problem a local development association was founded in 1998. First results of the association's activities are, amongst others, the foundation of a local business start-up agency and a local labour agency. The association was also the main initiator of the regional Partnership of the Northern Necklace, which created an 870 km long bike trek, founded a local brand, and organized different workshops for rural inhabitants. On the way to develop the association's activities, the trust local inhabitants hold in the association members, the undertaken promotional actions in order to activate inhabitants, as well as the close cooperation with the local government turned out to be important success factors. In 2004, the association together with representatives of ten other communes applied for the pilot measure to implement the Community Initiative Leader+. Already conducted conferences with potential partners of a future Leader-type local action group, experience with endogenous initiative within the association and the Partnership of the Northern Necklace, as well as the high level of knowledge the involved partners have about Leader-type projects constitute promising preconditions for a successful implementation of the pilot measure in the region.

In the Czech Republic, agricultural production is characterised by a dualistic structure in these days, i.e. private farmers on the one side and corporate farms on the other. However, among both groups some had been economically more successful than others. In general, a varying adoption of production factors, i.e. land, labour and capital is identified as being of influence. Whether their ability to collaborate with other farms is an additional factor, which has been discussed under the concept of social capital since quite some time, will be analysed in this paper. Based on the findings of a survey among a sample of 62 farms by adopting factor and multiple regression analysis it can be deduced that social capital is indeed a significant factor determining the level of farm income.
P32|Land Reform and Development of Agricultural Land Markets in Russia| Russia has experienced dramatic changes in land ownership and tenure since 1991: agricultural land has been largely privatized, individual landowners now have legal rights to most agricultural land in the country, and prohibitions on buying and selling of land have been recently removed. The necessary pre-conditions for the development of agricultural land markets have been met and we are beginning to witness transactions that involve individual landowners, and not only the state. Further development of the land market is circumscribed by the inadequacy of the administrative and technical infrastructure. The paper discusses the evolving legal framework for land reform, considers the impacts on privatization and ownership structure of agricultural land, and analyzes the development of land market transactions. The analysis uses official statistical sources and the results of a 2003 survey in three regions.

P32|The Determinants of Polish Farmers' Credit Interest Rates: Hedonic Price Analysis and Implications for Government Policy|" Our micro-econometric analysis of agricultural credit market outcomes in Poland sheds new light on the relationship between contractual arrangements and interest rates. An innovative theoretical framework based on a hedonic market model is developed. We interpret the factors that influence interest rates as ""quality"" components of the credit contract. We use unique data including detailed information about Polish farmers' credit contracts. Both nominal interest rates and bank fees are considered. Results show that banks prefer liquid types of collateral, and care little about the loan's purpose. The effect of government subsidies on interest rates is small compared to the officially declared reduction of the nominal rate."
P32|Development of Individual Farming in Georgia: Descriptive Analysis and Comparisons|The purpose of this paper is to examine the situation of individual farms in Georgia using a survey conducted in 2003, in comparison to a similar survey conducted in 1996. The basic issue investigated is the progress of the land individualization process, and the consequences of this process for the development of the agricultural sector, and more generally for the well-being of farm families and rural poverty. We found significant changes in the farm sector. In particular, average landholdings have increased, mainly through leasing of plots. There is more specialization, with some farmers not producing at all and others expanding. Profits and income have deteriorated markedly, and many producers did not even sell their produce on the market. Those producers who leased land were much more likely to sell their produce on the market and they also had higher incomes and relied less on off-farm income and social assistance payments. Still, fewer than 15% of the farmers lease land. While the average age of the population has increased, the level of schooling declined. This indicates a possible “brain drain” process of selective outmigration. Another worrying implication of the income situation is the increase in the incidence of child labor. These findings indicate that the potential of increased land transactions is still there, and a continuing specialization process that will enable successful farmers to acquire more land could improve the economic well-being of farm families even in a period of depressed produce prices.

Even so, certain local dynamics confirm the strong agricultural potential of this small Christian state at the south 01 the Caucasus.
P32|"Rinder - Genossen - Exportweltmeister. Zur Evolution einer ""strukturellen Kopplung"""|Die systemtheoretische Betrachtung eines Netzwerk-­Phänomens kann bei einem Bullen und zwei Kühen anfangen. Für diese Arbeit hat das zwei Vorteile: Zum einen meiden wir dadurch größtenteils das Feld der babylonisierten Netzwerkdebatte (Faßler 2001: 22), und können im Ergebnis dennoch durch qualifizierte Impulsen an diese Debatte anschließen. Zum zweiten ergibt sich so die ausgezeichnete Gelegenheit, auch den Missionar Samuel Marsden zu würdigen, der die drei Rinder im Jahre 1814 nach Neuseeland brachte. Denn im Ergebnis dieses folgeschweren Imports produziert das Land bald einen Überschuss an Milch-­Produkten, den es 1846 erstmals exportieren kann: eine Ladung Käse wird nach Australien verschifft. Gegen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts umschiffen die ersten Kühltransporte schließlich das Haltbarkeitsdatum, wodurch der Anschluss an den Weltmarkt erfolgt. Heute begrasen drei Millionen unsubventionierte Rinder die subtropische Nordinsel Neuseelands. Hier werden 36% aller weltweit gehandelten Molkerei-­Produkte hergestellt, und damit 20% der Deviseneinnahmen des Landes erwirtschaftet (Donoso 2002). Kontrolliert wird der gesamte Prozess von der Fonterra Co-­operative Group Ltd., Neuseelands größtem Unternehmen, für das ca. 95% der neuseeländischen Milch-­Farmer arbeiten, weil es ihnen gehört. Die Genossenschaft übernimmt die Milch, deren Weiterverarbeitung zu preiswerten Markenprodukten und deren Platzierung am Markt. Dafür verfügt das Unternehmen über ein dichtes globales Netz von Produktionsstätten, Niederlassungen und Beteiligungen. Fonterra verkauft in 140 Länder, beschäftigt dafür 20.000 Mitarbeiter, machte NZ $ 12 Milliarden Gewinn (Donoso 2002) und gilt damit als größter Exporteur sowie viertgrößter Produzent im globalen Marktsegment. Größere Schlagzeilen brachte dem Unternehmen zuletzt eine strategische Allianz mit Nestlé ein. Inzwischen strebt es offen die globale Marktführerschaft an. Man kann Fonterra nun mit Blick auf die Organisation der 13.000 Milch-­Farmer als ein genossenschaftliches Netzwerk (Theurl 2004) einführen. Mit Blick auf die Funktion der 20.000 weiteren Mitarbeitern ist die Kooperative aber genauso gut ein hierarchisches Unternehmen oder schließlich in der Zusammenschau eine hybride Mischform (Sydow/Well 1996; Mayntz 1993). Wir stellen die Organisation schlicht als aber schlicht als das vor, was sie dem eigenen Vernehmen nach ist: eine Kooperative mit einer erstaunlichen Weltmarkt-­Performance, und das ausgerechnet in einem der meist umkämpften Marktsegmente (Wilson 2002), in dem andere Kooperativen systematisch an die Grenzen ihrer strukturellen Anpassungsfähigkeit stoßen (Harte 1997, Wilson 1999). Um dieses Phänomen multidimensional untersuchen zu können, betrachten wir das Konzept der Kooperative als Form der strukturellen Kopplung sozialer Systeme, die wir am Beispiel Fonterra genauer untersuchen. Kernanliegen des Aufsatzes bleibt es, Systemtheorie und Netzwerk-Begriff systematisch aufeinander zu beziehen. Konkret geschieht das aber, wie angedeutet, indem die systematische Suche nach einem umfassenden Netzwerk-­Begriff in weiten Strecken ausgeblendet wird. Diese Verlagerung bedeutet zunächst eine sichtbare Zumutung an den Leser (vgl. Abb. 1), führt aber zu Ergebnissen; ganz direkt etwa zu einer nachvollziehbaren Gliederung: Im Grunde besprechen wir einen Ausschnitt Gesellschaft, dem wir uns immer wieder in Ausschnitten oder unter spezifischen Fragestellungen nähern: Grundlage dafür sind systematische Überlegungen zum Begriff der strukturellen Kopplung (2), durch die wir Sequenzen einer Evolutionsgeschichte des Konzepts der Kooperative als strukturelle Kopplung zwischen Politik und Wirtschaft vorbereiten. Im Anschluss daran interessieren uns aktuelle Erscheinungsformen des Konzepts der Kooperative; auf Grundlage einer Typologie kooperativer Organisationsformen entwickeln wir ein vergleichsweise hoch auflösendes Bild des Konzepts der Kooperative als strukturelle Kopplung im Übergangsfeld zum Wirtschaftssystem (3). Nun können wir die aktuelle Organisationsform der Kooperative Fonterra und deren Funktion als produzenten-­optimale Form der strukturellen Kopplung zwischen Produzent und Absatzmarkt bestimmen (4); daran anschließend können wir Form und Funktion der neuseeländischen Molkerei‑Industrie präzise von früheren unterscheiden (5). Dabei skizzieren wir folgende Entwicklung: Angesichts der Liberalisierung des Weltagrarmarktes stoßen immer mehr Kooperativen an die Grenzen ihrer strukturellen Anpassungsfähigkeit. Während die einen in dieser Situation scheitern, agieren erfolgreiche Kooperativen neuerdings zunehmend, und zunehmend global, wie konventionelle Unternehmen. Setzt sich diese Tendenz fort, so lässt sich zeigen, ist mit dem Konzept der Kooperative bald eine spezifische Produktionsweise und damit eine spezifische Form der strukturellen Kopplung zwischen politischem und Wirtschaftssystem zerbrochen. Schließlich zeigen wir am Beispiel: Netzwerke sind Systeme, die wir als strukturelle Kopplungen betrachten. Und dass ein systemtheoretischer Zugang zum Netzwerkbegriff zu einer umfassenden Perspektive führt, die formale, funktionale, elementare, geografische und historische Unterscheidungen gleichermaßen integriert (6).
P32|"Experience with endogenous rural development initiatives and the prospects for Leader+ in the region Dolina Strugu, Poland<BR>[Erfahrungen mit endogenen ländlichen Entwicklungsmaßnahmen und Aussichten für Leader+ in der Region ""Dolina Strugu"" in Polen]"|This paper presents the results of a case study of local economic development in Dolina Strugu, Podkarpackie voivodship, Poland. Its aim is to analyse local development problems and chances, to investigate the potential of endogenous initiatives to support economic development, and to examine the prospects for an implementation of the EU's initiative Leader+. The case study primarily relies on interviews conducted with local government authorities, NGOs, business owners and farmers in summer 2005. The hitherto unsatisfactory income situation in agriculture has been particularly precarious for the region because two thirds of the people in working age are employed in agriculture and alternative job opportunities are mostly absent. To respond to these problems, a number of development activities have been initiated by a local non-profit organisation called Dolina Strugu. The initiative with the biggest influence on the regional income situation is the marketing cooperative Chmielnik Zdrój, which is currently employing 400 local people. It buys products from local peasant farms, processes them and sells them to 70 000 households in the further ambit. Dolina Strugu and the local authorities successfully applied for the pilot measure to implement Leader+ within the scope of the Polish Sectoral Operational Plan. The need for a local development strategy and Leader's inherent incentives to improve and create income sources make its implementation a desirable objective. But there are also a number of barriers to successful implementation. Local knowledge of the community initiative should be improved, the local inhabitants' short term planning perspective must be addressed by an appropriate vision, local trust in EU institutions and programmes should be strengthened, and the cooperation between the non-profit organisation Dolina Strugu and the representatives of local government should be stabilised.

This study focuses on new types of development cooperation, considering the role of both traditional technologies and more modern ones such as information and communication or genetic engineering technologies. After a brief introduction to the current situation, development cooperation is analysed as a concept and from the point of view of trends over the years. We then focus on specific areas such as international trade, the food industry and aspects of technical collaboration within the wide range of possibilities that exist for socio-economic development.
P32|Land Tenure Choice in Chinese Villages: The Rational versus the Political Model|The rational and political decision models are developed and tested for the land tenure choice in rural China. A novelty of the test is to link the collective decision with general relative factor scarcities. Competing hypotheses are developed for the two models and tested with panel data collected on 83 Chinese villages. The results show that neither model is strongly rejected although the political model fares slightly better in more sophisticated econometric testing. This suggests that popular political participation is emerging in Chinese villages. Implications of this finding to Chinese land policy are discussed.
P32|Milchproduktion und -verarbeitung in Weißrussland: eine Analyse der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit|Seit dem Beginn des Transformationsprozesses ist in Weißrussland eine stetige Reduktion der Milcherzeugung und Herstellung von Milchprodukten zu beobachten. Der Transformations-prozess führte zu verschiedenen Friktionen in der gesamten weißrussischen Agrar- und Ernährungswirtschaft. Aufgrund der Bedeutung des Milchsektors stellt die Erhöhung seiner Wettbewerbfähigkeit ein übergeordnetes Ziel der weißrussischen Agrarpolitik dar. Dies soll insbesondere durch eine Verbesserung der Anpassungsfähigkeit der Unternehmen an das sich ändernde ökonomische und institutionelle Umfeld erreicht werden, damit Effizienzsteigerungen mittel- und langfristig zu einem wettbewerbsfähigen Molkereisektor führen. Im Rahmen dieses Discussion Papers wird eine Analyse der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der weißrussischen Milchwirtschaft vorgenommen. Die Analyse wurde mit dem Ziel durchgeführt, die Merkmale der Wettbewerbsvorteile und -nachteile zu identifizieren und mögliche Empfehlungen für eine Verbesserung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit zu erarbeiten. Es wurden folgende Wettbewerbsvorteile Weißrusslands in der Milchwirtschaft definiert: großer Anteil an landwirtschaftlichen Betrieben, hohe Pro-Kopf-Milcherzeugung, großer Anlieferungsanteil. Als Nachteile werden staatliche Regulierung, Unrentabilität der Milch-erzeugung und niedriges Modernisierungs- und Investitionsniveau genannt.
P32|Credit access and borrowing costs in Poland's agricultural credit market: a hedonic pricing approach|The paper empirically investigates credit access and borrowing costs in Poland's rural financial market. We conduct an econometric analysis based on cross-sectional survey data including formal loans taken in the period 1997-1999. A hedonic regression of the effective interest rate, comprising both the nominal interest rate and additional transaction costs faced by farmers, allows the identification of the determinants of borrowing costs. These determinants can be interpreted as loan attributes and their implicit prices calculated. We proceed in two steps. In the first step, farmers' credit access is estimated by a Probit model. The second step is the hedonic regression, in which the Probit results are taken to test for selectivity. The results support the widely held view that formal lenders tend to discriminate against smaller farms. They also suggest that the presence of devices to screen and signal the quality of borrowers makes borrowing more likely and reduces borrowing costs. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that the choice of the type of bank has a significant effect on borrowing costs. All other loan attributes equal, the traditional institutions for agricultural lending (the cooperative banks and the governmentally controlled Bank for Food Economy) offer between 1.1 and 1.3 percentage point higher effective interest rates as compared with the most favourable terms available, which has implications for a potential future restructuring of the Polish rural banking sector. In addition, there is strong evidence that the government subsidisation of nominal interest rates is severely counteracted by increased transaction costs and an adverse selection of borrowers. However, there is still a net reduction of the effective interest rate by 1.4 percentage point on average, compared to non-subsidised loans. This raises the question whether lending procedures under the government programme are sufficiently streamlined and whether loans are effectively targeted.
P32|Méthodes de privatisation et évolution de l'output dans les économies en transition|Using a sample of 25 economies in transition from 1990 to 2001, this paper deals with the evolution of output and its relation to the different large-scale privatization policies applied by the countries. Ceteris paribus, we econometrically show that the choice of a privatization policy can lock a country into a path of underdevelopment, especially massive giveaways. We also find that macroeconomic performance gains come from gradual sales to outsiders and policies promoting the emergence of a new private sector (privatization from below).
P32|Broadening monitoring and evaluation within reforming national agricultural research systems|The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Ghana, together with the Natural Resources Institute of the United Kingdom and with input from the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration convened a one-day Policy Dialogue Forum on “Broadening Monitoring and Evaluation within Reforming National Agricultural Research Systems”. The meeting provided a platform for discussing current experiences with monitoring and evaluation by CSIR and for introducing alternative practices (frameworks, methods and tools) that would enable research bodies to manage and demonstrate their performance and contribution to national development targets in a consistent and coherent form. While the pilot project was conducted at institutional level, involving two CSIR institutes (CRI and FRI), the forum was conducted at the corporate level, and including other corporate organisations from the public and private sectors. The objectives of the forum were 1. To disseminate experiences from the first phase of a performance measurement action research project within NARS in Ghana and Uganda 2. To raise awareness among Ghana’s research management community and allied stakeholders of the importance of measuring institutional performance as an element of demonstrating developmental impact 3. To explore with key stakeholders opportunities for strengthening institutional performance measurement and management in the context of ongoing institutional reform in CSIR and other public sector organisations. Participants were made up of Senior Management Personnel from public organisations and training institutions.
P32|Agrarian reform and subsistence agriculture in Russia|Russian agrarian reform failure is a direct result of ignoring the nature of agrarian institutions inherited from Soviet times and the application of a liberal neo-classical approach in the law making process. The most important problem which presents impediments to agrarian reform is the role of collective farms as the mechanisms of survival for rural communities. Rural dwellers understand very well that if former collective/state farms were substituted by real private enterprises, then they would lose access to resources from collective/state farms for their subsistence household farms, the only source of their survival. They also understand that only a minority of them could create agricultural businesses and the majority would not be employed in the new private agricultural enterprises. That is why they resist any transformation of their collective/state farms. They resist not as individuals, but as a community. So members of the community who wish to create private enterprises are under pressure from the community worried about subsistence household farms. Agrarian reform legislation provided rural dwellers with a very powerful tool for this resistance: privatisation of collective and state farms by members of these farms on an egalitarian basis. The authors of land reform legislation did not worry about that because they were neo-classical economists. They estimated that the most important thing is the right of owners of land and asset shares to buy and sell them. According to them, the inclusion of this right into legislation is sufficient to start a process of creation of viable agricultural enterprises on the land of former collective and state farms, with the subsequent concentration of land and other assets in the hands of the most efficient farmers. The reformers did not pay any attention to the institution of subsistence household farms.
P32|La campagne russe face à l'accession du pays à l'OMC : analyse institutionnelle<BR>[The Russian countryside facing the country's accession to the WTO: institutional analysis]|Russian agrarian reform failure is a direct result of ignoring the nature of agrarian institutions inherited from Soviet times and the application of a liberal neo-classical approach in the law making process. The most important problem which presents impediments to agrarian reform is the role of collective farms as the mechanisms of survival for rural communities. Agrarian reform legislation provided rural dwellers with a very powerful tool for the resistance to any institutional change. The authors of land reform legislation estimated that the most important thing is the right of owners of land and asset shares to buy and sell them. According to them, the inclusion of this right into legislation is sufficient to start a process of creation of viable agricultural enterprises on the land of former collective and state farms, with the subsequent concentration of land and other assets in the hands of the most efficient farmers. The reformers did not pay any attention to the institution of subsistence household farms. The research presented in this paper is made in the framework of the pragmatic institutional economics. The first two sections of this paper are devoted to methodology and techniques of institutional analysis.
P32|Does It Pay To Pray? Evaluating the Economic Return to Religious Ritual|Time-consuming and costly religious rituals pose a puzzle for economists committed to rational choice theories of human behavior. We propose that religious rituals promote in-group trust and cooperation that help to overcome collective-action problems. We test this hypothesis on communal societies for whom mutual cooperation is a matter of survival. We design field experiments to measure the in-group cooperative behavior of members of religious and secular Israeli kibbutzim. Our results show that religious males (the primary practitioners of collective religious ritual in Orthodox Judaism) are more cooperative than religious females, secular males and secular females. Moreover, the frequency with which religious males engage in collective religious rituals predicts well their degree of cooperative behavior. We use our results to understand differences in the return to religious observance in capitalist and developing economies.
P32|Credit Access And Borrowing Costs In Poland'S Agricultural Credit Market: A Hedonic Pricing Approach| The paper empirically investigates credit access and borrowing costs in Poland's rural financial market. We conduct an econometric analysis based on cross-sectional survey data including formal loans taken in the period 1997-1999. A hedonic regression of the effective interest rate, comprising both the nominal interest rate and additional transaction costs faced by farmers, allows the identification of the determinants of borrowing costs. These determinants can be interpreted as loan attributes and their implicit prices calculated. We proceed in two steps. In the first step, farmers' credit access is estimated by a Probit model. The second step is the hedonic regression, in which the Probit results are taken to test for selectivity. The results support the widely held view that formal lenders tend to discriminate against smaller farms. They also suggest that the presence of devices to screen and signal the quality of borrowers makes borrowing more likely and reduces borrowing costs. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that the choice of the type of bank has a significant effect on borrowing costs. All other loan attributes equal, the traditional institutions for agricultural lending (the cooperative banks and the governmentally controlled Bank for Food Economy) offer between 1.1 and 1.3 percentage point higher effective interest rates as compared with the most favourable terms available, which has implications for a potential future restructuring of the Polish rural banking sector. In addition, there is strong evidence that the government subsidisation of nominal interest rates is severely counteracted by increased transaction costs and an adverse selection of borrowers. However, there is still a net reduction of the effective interest rate by 1.4 percentage point on average, compared to non-subsidised loans. This raises the question whether lending procedures under the government programme are sufficiently streamlined and whether loans are effectively targeted.
P32|Farm investment, credit rationing, and public credit policy in Poland: a microeconometric analysis|The aim of this paper is to empirically analyse the effects of governmentally promoted credit access on the investment behaviour of credit rationed farmers. This is done by specifying an empirical investment equation which is estimated on a cross-sectional sample of Polish farm household data. In contrast to conventional neo-classical investment models, the investment equation contains the financial variable long-term credit access, which plays the central role in this study. The econometric analysis is used to analyse the determinants of credit access and estimate the marginal effect of credit on investment, which in turn provides the key information for policy evaluation. The results suggest that access to subsidised credit has a significant role in determining investment behaviour of farmers who self-classified as being exogenously credit constrained. This classification applies to 45 percent of all respondents. Major determinants of credit rationing are the reputation of the borrower and the demographic household composition. In various specifications of the creditinvestment relationship, including a cubic Tobit model, the average marginal effect of credit on investment was smaller than one. This implies that credit is partly used for other purposes than productive investment. Every second borrower invests less in productive assets than borrowed. However, over a commonly observed range, the marginal effect increases with an increasing credit volume. Even so, the investment volume is negatively related to farm size. A government policy aiming at the promotion of productive investment should hence emphasise lending in larger amounts without discriminating small farms.
P32|Sequencing and the Success of Gradualism: Empirical Evidence from China's Agricultural Reform|This paper provides evidence regarding gains to agricultural market liberalization in China. We empirically identify the different effects that incentive reforms and gradual market liberalization have on China's agricultural economy during its transition period. We find that average gains within the agricultural sector to incentive reform exceed gains to market liberalization by a factor of ten. Our method of analyzing the effects of transition policies on economic performance can be generalized to other reform paths in other transition economies.
P32|Educational Debt Burden and Career Choice: Evidence from a Financial Aid Experiment at NYU Law School|This paper explores how the timing of career-contingent financial aid influences its effectiveness in encouraging law students to enter public interest work, and hence the isolated effect of educational debt timing on career choice. I analyze quasi-experimental data from NYU Law School's Innovative Financial Aid Study, in which careercontingent financial aid packages with equivalent net values but varying debt structures were randomly assigned to applicants. My results indicate that debt timing matters: law school graduates who receive tuition waivers rather than ex-post loan assistance have a 32% higher rate of first job placement in public interest law and a 91% higher rate of clerkships. Furthermore, recipients of tuition waivers are more likely to enroll in law school conditional on being admitted. Using propensity score methods to correct for sample selection bias at the matriculation stage, I find that differences in first job placement according to debt timing persist after controlling for differential enrollment rates, implying an independent post-enrollment influence of debt timing on career decisions. I present a behavioral model that rationalizes the time-inconsistency of career decisions when agents are both debt averse and loss averse.

P32|Poland's agriculture: serious competitor or Europe's poorhouse? Survey results on farm performance in selected Polish voivodships and a comparison with German farms|The aim of this paper is to present an analysis of farm-level data collected in a survey of 464 Polish farms in 2000. Performance indicators of farms in three Polish voivodships are compared with farm accountancy data from two German Länder. The results show that Polish farms were much less profitable than their German counterparts. The gap in income levels is much higher between persons employed in the agricultural sector than between average working persons in the two countries. Living standards within the Polish farm sector decline from the north-west to the south-east. The analysis suggests that the lower profitability of farms is a consequence of pronounced structural deficiencies due to a quite unfavourable workforce-land ratio on Polish farms and hardly a result of lower product prices. Serious technical and economic inefficiencies in the production process become visible in the data. There is a generally conservative attitude among farmers that prefers the continuation of farming over leaving the sector. Nevertheless, income from agriculture is to a substantial extent complemented by off-farm employment in the southern regions. Formal education of farm managers and access to finance appeared not to be crucial for their economic success in the past, although especially the most profitable farms in the north did not obtain as much credit as desired. Our overall conclusion is that Polish farms currently are in the midst of a regional, economic, and social differentiation process fuelled by huge imbalances in terms of income levels between rural and urban population groups. This process is however seriously slowed down or even halted by a number of effective institutional barriers, particularly with regard to rural labour markets. These barriers should be properly addressed by a formulation of future policies in order to avoid further social frictions in the course of the Polish EU accession.

They are the estate, the peasant farm and the rural community. Transformations of these institutions take place according to the following cycle: ideology, legislation and functioning of institutions. At the beginning as well as at the end of the 20th century, Russian agrarian reforms were based on liberal ideology, but in both cases they were rejected by the persistence of the hard core.

P32|State-Directed Diffusion of Technology: The Mechanization of Cotton-Farming in Soviet Central Asia|When Soviet central planners began to mechanize the cotton harvest in earnest in 1958, they expected more rapid diffusion than the market-driven process that had begun in the United States a decade earlier. But despite high output of cotton-picking machines, the share of the crop harvested mechanically grew more slowly than in the United States. The factor proportions in Central Asia did not justify mechanization: although planners could enforce introduction of the new technology, investment in cotton-harvesting machines was largely a waste of resources. The costs of premature introduction are estimated at over one billion US dollars in 1960s prices.

P32|O desenvolvimento de cooperativas de produção coletiva de trabalhadores rurais no capitalismo. Limites e possibilidades<BR>[The collective rural workers cooperatives development in capitalism.limits and possibilities]|This report has been prepared based on a comparative study which tries to analyze the process to establish and develop cooperatives of rural labourers collective production linked to the Landless Rural Labourers Movement (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra – MST). The main objective was to identify the contradictions which establish limits and possibilities of development of four cooperatives situated in the Southern Region of Brazil. All data was obtained through focused interviews and 46 formal surveys, information has also been collected from the archives of the cooperatives. For the data analysis,quantitative procedures (descriptive statistics and correlation analysis ) and qualitative procedures (documental and content analysis) were used. The research demonstrated a significant social development at the collective cooperatives, where their associates have reached important achievements such as: improvement on housing conditions, basic sanitation, health, improvement on the level of school education, a gradual increase on the income, annual vacations (in some cases, paid vacations), partial support in cases of pregnancy and sickness. These results represent, in fact, a higher achievement since, during this period, urban and rural life conditions worsened for the majority of the population in Brazil. The research made clear that the evolution of the social indicators occurs as the collective organizations receive the financing subsided by the federal government and invest in activities that will generate income and create jobs for the working force available in the community, what denotes the importance of this support in order to ensure the social-economic development of the Agrarian Reform settlements. The analysis of the empiric data made also clear that the cooperatives of collective production make use of democratic mechanisms of administration, which ensures a wide participation from the associates when defining operation norms, performance objectives, and their internal policies, configuring the form of administration adopted as self-government at the level of production unit. Nevertheless, the economic analysis showed that these organizations face serious deficiencies in terms of: capability of generating receipts, utilizing efficiently the working force available, remuneration of production factors and generation of economic surplus of which is possible reproduction as a productive unit able to compete against similar capitalists investments It was also noticed in two of the cooperatives the existence of contradiction among the self-governing and socialist ideals which inspire these experiences and the practice of remunerating (paying) non-associated workers. Due to historical and circumstantial factors these organizations began to hire labor as necessary condition for their reproduction. Certain organizational paradoxes has also been identified that, for the time being, would not represent risks for the development of these self-governing experiences but that could in the future turn into main contradictions. The study shows that if the main contradictions are not faced and overcome, the collective organization won’t be able to ensure its continuity as self-governing experiences from socialist inspiration.

P32|Développement portuaire et milieu innovateur le cas de Dunkerque|L'activité portuaire d'un territoire doit-elle être considérée comme un levier ou un frein au développement local ? Si l'application de la théorie des pôles de croissance s'est soldée dans les années 1960 par un développement des zones industrialo-portuaires (ZIP), la crise qui les a frappés dans la décennie suivante a cependant révélé certaines limites. La reconversion plus ou moins réussie de ces ZIP pose le problème de la transition vers un développement endogène. À partir du cas de Dunkerque, ce document présente une analyse des conditions nécessaires à la mise en place d'une nouvelle dynamique économique locale, en s'appuyant notamment sur la théorie des milieux innovateurs. Can the harbour activity of a territory be considered as a spingboard or a curb for local development ? If the implementation of the theory of growth poles has resulted in the development of Maritime Industrial Development Areas (MIDA), the crisis they have undergone during the next ten years has shown some limits. The more or less successful reconversion of the MIDAs asks the question of the transition towards an endogeneous development. Reviewing the case of Dunkirk, this document presents an analysis of the conditions necessary for the setting-up of a new local economic dynamics, relying on the innovative milieu theory.

P32|A mezőgazdaság működését szolgáló főbb intézmények. A piaci intézményrendszer és az állami szerepvállalás<BR>[Important institutions serving the functioning of agriculture]|A mezőgazdaságnak és a széles értelemben vett agrárüzletnek számos gazdaságszerkezeti, erőforrásbeli és kulturális sajátossága miatt speciális intézményekre van szüksége. Ezek létrehozásában az államnak kezdeményező és formáló szerepet kell vállalnia. A hazai kulturális hagyományok mellett és az EU-csatlakozásra készülve elkerülhetetlen, hogy állami szervezetek, a hatósági szerepeken túl, konkrét gazdaságbefolyásoló és gazdálkodásszervező szerepet is vállaljanak. Az állam által is patronált mezőgazdasági intézményrendszerrel szemben még a fejlett, beláthatóan változó üzemrendszerű gazdaságok esetében is ellentmondó igények fogalmazódnak meg. Ezért még ezek az országok sem képesek úgy megoldani az intézményrendszer kialakításának és változtatásának, illetve karbantartásának feladatát, hogy az ne adjon okot alapos kritikára. Az ellentmondó igényeket sűrítve megtaláljuk a szabályozott piac, a fenntartható fejlődés, a méltányos jövedelem kategóriákban. Ezek mögött az az igény fogalmazódik meg, hogy a termelés és a termelő megmérettessen a piacon azaz feleljen meg a gyakran igen távoli felhasználók minőségi (tehát kulturális) igényeinek, és bírja a költségversenyt a többi termelővel. Tehát alávetve a szelekciónak és külső kulturális kényszernek, biztonságosan tudjon berendezkedni gazdaságában, és legyen esélye a berendezkedésre is fedezetet nyújtó méltányos jövedelemre. A piaci verseny vele a minőségi és hatékonysági szelekció és a biztonság, sőt, a méltányos jövedelem igénye nyilvánvaló ellentmondás. Pedig a biztonságigény nem csupán a modern, szolidáris és faluvédő politikai meggondolásokból következik. Némi közgazdasági alapja is van. HiAhhoz, hogy aktív mezőgazdasági politikát lehessen folytatni, szükség van a szereplők együttműködését segítő intézmények kifejlesztésére. Ezek lehetővé teszik a gazdálkodási kockázatok számbavételét és szereplők közti elosztását, továbbá azt, hogy az állam a pénzügyi támogatásokkal felelősen vállaljon részt ezekben a kockázatokban. Ezek az intézmények azért is nélkülözhetetlenek, mert csak így formálódhat ki a piaci céloknak megfelelő együttműködés a mezőgazdasági és a pénzpiaci szereplők, valamint a szolgáltatók között. A cikk a fejlett országok tapasztalata alapján bemutatja a főbb szükséges és lehetséges intézményeket. Ezek egyfelől jogi természetűek, másfelől azokat a kereteket biztosítják, amelyekben a szereplők együtt tudnak működni. Mindezek az intézmények a mezőgazdaság versenyképességének javítását és az EU-intézményrendszerbe való beillesztését is szolgálják.
P32|Russian Reforms: the Return of the Peasant?|Russian agriculture in transition (1991-1998) was characterised by a production collapse due to aloss in quality and quantity of acreage, disinvestments, falling purchasingpower, and increasedimports. Neither traditional agriculture nor the nascent family farm sector havebeen able to ensure sustained food production. Instead, the impoverishment of the population hasresulted in a considerable increase in the relative importance of household food production.In the present paper some features of household food production are explored: (1) thedevelopment in acreage used forHFP, (2) the number of people involved over the years, (3) the availability anduse of the necessary factors of production, such as land, labour, and variable inputs, (4)characteristics of households involved, and (5) implications for welfare.
P32|Trigger Strategies in Chinese Agricultural Teams|In this paper, the reasons why Chinese agricultural teams could not reply on the threat of internal effort response to solve incentive problems are investigated. The detrimental effects of state extractive agricultural policies, the basic needs program, and Cultural-Revolution-era ideology on the dynamic self-enforcing mechanism in Chinese teams are analysed. Using the data on the teams of a moderately prosperous commune during the period 1970-76, the author estimates the discount factor and the impact of the trigger strategies on workers' effort decisions. It is found that the estimates of the discount factor and the trigger strategy effect are significantly greater than zero in some periods, but not large enough to eliminate the need for monitoring.

P32|Approche institutionnelle de l'analyse de la transition (le cas de l'agriculture du Nord-Kazakhstan)<BR>[Institutional approach for transition analysis (the case of Northern Kazakhstan's agriculture)]|The causes of the failure of the neoclassical approach to the economic transition in the countries formerly belonging to the Soviet Union are analyzed at a general level and then in the specific case of agriculture in North Kazakhstan. Three dimensions of Soviet-type economic institutions (legislation, organizations and culture) enter into the general analysis. Among the basic notions that are cursorily presented, attention is drawn to the economic culture. A description of the characteristics of Soviet agricultural institutions (state-owned land, collective farms, state farms, individual plots and local authorities in rural areas) completes this analysis at the general level. These theoretical patterns then serve to analyze the first two phases (stabilization and introduction of the market) in the neoclassical transition strategy as applied to farming in North Kazakhstan. In this area, the institutions inherited from the Soviet era continue to survive, sometimes under a slightly disguised form. They account for both the non-completion of a real transition and the gradual decline in farming. In these conditions, the third phase (structural corrections) of the transition under the neoclassical paradigm cannot be envisioned. Alternative proposals based on an institutional approach are presented.
P32|Soft Budget Constraints: An Analysis Based on a Survey of Chinese Township Enterprises|The reduced influence of soft budget constrints is often seen as an explanation for the successful growth of China's non-state sector. Views differ, however, as to whether collectively owned rural enterprise are in fact subject to hard financial discipline. This paper reports an inquiry into the issue. The study examines the financial behaviour of REs, particularly that of loss-making enterprises, by scrutinising a set of survey data of 630 rural enterprises in Sichuan and Zhejiang (China), Being primarily explorative and conceptual in nature, our study reveals that soft budget constraints can still be observed to be enjoyed by many rural enterprises, in particular among those collectively owned. As the budget constraints do appear to become more rigid, however, enterprises look for other opportunities to ease the financial dixcipline forced upon them by the market and by increasingly illiquid local governments. Accumulating inter-enterprise arrears, as well as withholding wage payments, are identified as means frequently used towards this end by REs in transitional Chinese economy.

P32|Production Efficiency in Peasant Agriculture: An Application of LISREL Model|The study examined a simplified conceptual model which incorporates variables that influence the processes and consequences of household decision-making in the Ada and Selale districts of the Ethiopian highlands. Linear structural relations (LISREL) analysis was performed on three conceptual models. The results of LISREL analysis indicate that the magnitude of contribution of factors to production efficiency in descending order as: skill variables (e.g., experience, secular education and production knowledge), consequences of access to resources or institutions (e.g., wealth), technologies adopted, physical factors (e.g., land and labour) and extension education. The impact of inputs on production efficiency was greater among farmers who have adopted one or two technologies (Ada) and two or more technologies (Selale). Successful adoption can be attained if, given appropriate socioeconomic environment, skills of producers are matched to the requirements of technologies, and when the choice of technologies are compatible with the goals of households, experience, region and enterprise specific comparative advantages.

P32|Vom Camarade zum Monsieur: Strukturanpassung und Demokratisierung in Benin|"From ""Comrade"" to ""Monsieur"": Structural Adjustment and Democratization in Benin: The process of political and economic liberalization in Benin is regarded as a model for the whole of Sub-Saharan Africa. Benin made history by becoming the first African country to overthrow a military dictator by democratic means. The civilian coup d'état cleared the way for economic recovery, too. The strengthening of democratic institutions, and the good will of the new government of the former high ranking World Bank-employee Soglo, to follow the recommendations of the structural adjustment programme have been honored by the donors' generosity. The recovery of the economy, however, was hampered by the underlying fabric of the socio-cultural structure of clientelism and patronage, which resulted in a situation in which the on-going structural adjustment programme mainly served the vested interests of the state class and rival strategic groups, bargaining for the booty of increasing development assistance. Thus, socio-economic conditions for a self-sustaining development process and, consequently, increased development assistance are not yet met. Nevertheless, areas of co-operation do exist in the fields of liberty of press and opinion, basic needs and self-help organizations."

A comparative analysis of the implementation of land reclamation projects during colonial and post-colonial times reveals astonishing similarities: especially the centralization of development efforts in the hands of administrators disconnected from the grassroots, lack of target group analysis and misconceptions about the aims and needs, as well as the resources, of the population involved in the development efforts, on the part of the administration. The effects of this negative conditioning process of 'development' over many years on the chances of cooperation between peasants and the administration are still largely unknown. Any development planner who wants to encourage the local population to take their future into their own hands, would have to take account of this negative conditioning process.
