H51|Modelling time-varying income elasticities of health care expenditure for the OECD|Income elasticity dynamics of health expenditure is considered for the OECD and the Eurozone over the period 1995-2014. This paper studies a novel non-linear cointegration model with fixed effects, controlling for cross-section dependence and unobserved heterogeneity. Most importantly, its coefficients can vary over time and its variables can be non-stationary. The resulting asymptotic theory is fundamentally different with a faster rate of convergence to similar kernel smoothing methodologies. A fully modified kernel regression method is also proposed to reduce the asymptotic bias. Results show a steep increase in the income elasticity for the OECD and a small increase for the Eurozone.
H51|Demand and Welfare Analysis in Discrete Choice Models with Social Interactions|Many real-life settings of consumer choice involve social interactions, causing targeted policies to have spillover effects. This paper develops novel empirical tools for analyzing demand and welfare effects of policy interventions in binary choice settings with social interactions. Examples include subsidies for health product adoption and vouchers for attending a high-achieving school. We establish the connection between econometrics of large games and Brock-Durlauf-type interaction models, under both I.I.D. and spatially correlated unobservables. We develop new convergence results for associated beliefs and estimates of preference parameters under increasing domain spatial asymptotics. Next, we show that even with fully parametric specifications and unique equilibrium, choice data, that are sufficient for counterfactual demand prediction under interactions, are insufficient for welfare calculations. This is because distinct underlying mechanisms producing the same interaction coefficient can imply different welfare effects and deadweight-loss from a policy intervention. Standard index-restrictions imply distribution-free bounds on welfare. We illustrate our results using experimental data on mosquito-net adoption in rural Kenya.
H51|Health spending in Italy: the impact of immigrants|The welfare impact of immigration is a hot topic especially for countries at the external borders of the European Union. This paper studies how immigrants affect public health expenditure across Italian regions during the period 2003-2015. Identification strategy is based on shift{share instruments, which are also robust to pull factors that might attract immigrants in Italy and to internal migration of natives. We find that a 1 percentage point increase in immigrants over total population leads to a decrease in public health expenditure per capita by about 3.9% (i.e. around 70 euro per capita). This evidence is confirmed when focusing on needy immigrants from low income countries with less developed welfare systems. Among possible channels, we find no support for any crowding out effects from public to private health services by natives due to increasing immigration neither for the effect of entry barriers limiting the immigrants' reliance on public healthcare. Our results are driven by immigrants' demographic structure: foreigners are mostly males and younger workers that call for less health spending, according to a positive selection mechanism.

H51|Disease management in diabetes care: when involving GPs improves patient compliance and health outcomes|Although the study of the association between interventions in primary care and health outcomes continues to produce mixed findings, programs designed to promote the greater compliance of General Practitioners and their diabetic patients with treatment guidelines have been increasingly introduced worldwide, in an attempt to achieve better quality diabetes care through the enhanced standardisation of patient supervision. In this study we use clinical data taken from the Diabetes Register of one Local Health Authority (LHAs) in Italy’s Emilia-Romagna Region for the period 2014-2015. Firstly, we test to see whether the monitoring activities prescribed for diabetics by regional diabetes guidelines, actually have a positive impact on patients’ health outcomes and increase appropriateness in health care utilization. Secondly, we investigate whether GPs’ participation in the local Diabetes Management Program (DMP) leads to improved patient compliance with regional guidelines. Our results show that such a program, which aims to increase GPs’ involvement and cooperation in following regional guidelines for best practices, achieves its goal of improved patient compliance with the prescribed actions. In turn, through the implementation of the DMP and the greater involvement of physicians, regional policies have succeeded in promoting better health outcomes and the improved appropriateness of health care utilization.
H51|Updated Budget Projections: 2019 to 2029|CBO estimates that the deficit for fiscal year 2019 will be $896 billion, which is $1 billion less than the agency estimated in January. If current laws generally remained unchanged, deficits would average 4.3 percent of gross domestic product over the 2020â€“2029 period. Other than the period immediately after World War II, the only other time the average deficit has been so large over so many years was after the 2007â€“2009 recession.
H51|An Analysis of the Presidentâ€™s 2020 Budget|By CBOâ€™s estimates, the federal deficit under the Presidentâ€™s budget would increase from $896 billion in 2019 to $966 billion (equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product, or GDP) in 2020. The cumulative deficit under the Presidentâ€™s policies would total $9.9 trillion over the 2020â€“2029 period, $1.5 trillion less than in CBOâ€™s baseline. (The Administration projects smaller deficits, totaling $7.3 trillion over that period.) Measured relative to the size of the economy, deficits would average 3.8 percent of GDP over the 10-year period, CBO estimates.
H51|The 2019 Long-Term Budget Outlook|If current laws generally remained unchanged, CBO projects, large budget deficits over the next 30 years would drive federal debt held by the public to unprecedented levelsâ€”from 78 percent of gross domestic product in 2019 to 144 percent by 2049. That level of debt would be the highest in the nationâ€™s history by far, and it would be on track to increase even more.
H51|Sources and Preparation of Data Used in HISIM2â€”CBOâ€™s Health Insurance Simulation Model: Working Paper 2019-04|CBOâ€™s new health insurance simulation model, HISIM2, is a microsimulation model, meaning that it uses individual-level input data to simulate population behavior. Beginning with the spring 2019 baseline budget projections, CBO completely revamped the way it models consumer and employer behavior; the agency also updated to new sources of individual-level input data. This paper describes the input data and the procedures for adjusting and adding to those data to form the sample used by HISIM2. The new model has been designed to use the Current Population Survey as its main
H51|How Do Changes in Medical Malpractice Liability Laws Affect Health Care Spending and the Federal Budget? Working Paper 2019-03|Changes to malpractice liability laws intended to decrease the liability of physicians and other medical providers have an ambiguous potential effect on overall health care spending (and the federal budget). Some providers may respond by performing fewer procedures that were undertaken mainly to avoid liability, whereas other providers may pursue more risky procedures and patients. This paper reviews the recent literature on the effect of changes in traditional liability laws on health care spending and presents new analyses of how such changes affect Medicare, Medicaid,
H51|CBOâ€™s Medicare Beneficiary Cost-Sharing Model: A Technical Description: Working Paper 2019-08|CBO uses a model to estimate the federal budgetary effects of proposed changes to the cost-sharing structure of the Medicare fee-for-service program. This paper describes that model, the analyses it can support, and an illustrative option for changing Medicareâ€™s cost-sharing structure.
H51|Effects of Market Structure and Patient Choice on Hospital Quality for Planned Patients|We investigate the change in the effect of market structure on planned hospital quality for three high-volume treatments, using a quasi difference-in-differences approach based on the relaxation of patient constraints on hospital choice in England. We employ control functions to allow for time-varying endogeneity from unobserved patient characteristics. We find that the choice reforms reduced quality for hip and knee replacement but not for coronary bypass, This is likely due to hospitals making a larger loss on hip and knee replacements, since robustness checks rule out changes in length of stay, new competitors’ entry and hospital-level mortality as possible confounders.
H51|Selection and moral hazard effects in healthcare|In the Netherlands, average healthcare expenditures of persons without a voluntary deductible are twice as high as average healthcare expenditures of persons with a voluntary deductible. When assessing the effects of voluntary cost-sharing in healthcare on healthcare expenditures, it is important to disentangle moral hazard from selection: are healthcare expenditures low because people pay (a bigger share of) their healthcare expenditures out-of-pocket? Or are people with higher cost-sharing levels healthier? In this study, we separate selection from moral hazard for the combined mandatory and voluntary deductible in the Netherlands. We use proprietary claims data from Dutch health insurers and exploit with a panel regression discontinuity design that we can observe healthcare expenditures before and after the deductibles kick in for 18 year olds. Our study shows that selection, not moral hazard, is the main effect explaining the difference in healthcare expenditures between persons with and without a voluntary deductible. Furthermore, we find that 18 year olds who never chose a voluntary deductible reduce their healthcare spending by 26 euros (on average) in response to a 100 euro increase in the (mandatory) deductible. However, for 18 year olds who chose a voluntary deductible (on top of the mandatory) we find that this choice does not result in a further reduction in healthcare spending.
H51|Information shocks and provider responsiveness: evidence from interventional cardiology|"We examine physician responses to global information shocks and the impact on patient outcomes. We exploit an international ""firestorm"" over the safety of an innovation in healthcare, drug-eluting stents. We use rich micro-data on interventional cardiologists' use of stents to de- fine and measure responsiveness to news shocks. We find substantial heterogeneity in responsiveness to both good and bad news and an association between speed of response to news and patient outcomes. Patients treated by cardiologists who respond slowly to news shocks have fewer adverse outcomes. These results cannot be attributed to financial incentives, patient-physician sorting or heterogeneity in skill."
H51|The Impact of CEOs in the Public Sector: Evidence from the English NHS|We investigate whether top managers affect the performance of large and complex public sector organizations, using as a case study CEOs of English public hospitals (large, complex organizations with multi-million turnover). We study the extent to which CEOs are differentiated in terms of their pay, as well as a wide range of hospital production measures including inputs, intermediate operational outcomes and clinical outcomes. Pay differentials suggest that the market perceives CEOs to be differentiated. However, we find little evidence of CEOs’ impact on hospital production. These results question the effectiveness of leadership changes to improve performance in the public sector.
H51|Success Factors of Crowdfunding Campaigns in Medical Research: Perceptions and Reality|Crowdfunding in medical research is becoming more popular due to the shrinking and increasingly competitive government funding. In order to inform researchers applying for this complementary source of research funding, we investigate the determinants of successful crowdfunding campaigns in medical research. We find that establishing and maintaining professional contacts through social media is of major importance for successful crowdfunding campaigns; an additional tweet or retweet significantly increases the success of crowdfunding campaigns. In contrast to the stated preferences of prospective donors, we document that crowdfunding campaigns might achieve their fundraising goal regardless of the disease characteristics. Scientists thus may ask funding for any kind of project, including therapies for rare diseases and diseases with lower mortality rate.
H51|The Effect of a Ban on Gender-Based Pricing on Risk Selection in the German Health Insurance Market|Starting from December 2012, insurers in the European Union were prohibited from charging gender-discriminatory prices. We examine the effect of this unisex mandate on risk segmentation in the German health insurance market. While gender used to be a pricing factor in Germany's private health insurance (PHI) sector, it was never used as a pricing factor in the social health insurance (SHI) sector. The unisex mandate makes PHI relatively more attractive for women and less attractive for men. Based on data from the SOEP we analyze how the unisex mandate affects the difference between women and men in switching rates between SHI and PHI. We find that the unisex mandate increases the probability of switching from SHI to PHI for women relative to men. This effect is strongest for self-employed individuals and mini-jobbers. On the other hand, the unisex mandate had no effect on the gender difference in switching rates from PHI to SHI. Because women have on average higher health care expenditures than men, our results imply a reduction of advantageous selection into PHI. Our results demonstrate that regulatory measures such as the unisex mandate can reduce risk selection between public and private health insurance sectors.
H51|The dynamics of health care and growth: A model with physician in dual practice|We present a growth model with micro-foundations of a mixed health care system and physician dual-practice, to analyze for welfare-optimal government financing strategy for a mixed health system in developing countries. Calibrating the model for Indonesia, we find that a government subsidy to private health care is both growth- and welfare-enhancing, whereas it is more effective for the government to invest in health infrastructure instead of a public-sector “rewarding” policy in raising government physicians’ wage if its goal is to improve physician effort in public practice. Indeed, for the “rewarding” policy, a dynamic trade-off in growth is found, which is not previously documented in the literature. We also find the model to produce two regimes with different welfare-optimal health financing (a “normal” regime and a low public-sector congestion regime). In the former, welfare-optimal health financing strategy appears to be promoting private health subsidy at the expense of public-sector physician wages. In the latter, the opposite is welfare-optimal.
H51|Digital Waste? Unintended Consequences of Health Information Technology|We exploit a large-scale natural experiment – the rollout of a nationwide electronic prescribing system in Finland – to study how digitization of prescriptions affects pharmaceutical use and health outcomes. We use comprehensive administrative data from patients treated with benzodiazepines, which are globally popular, effective but addictive psychotropic medications. We find no impact on benzodiazepine use on average, but among younger patients e-prescribing increases repeat prescription use. Younger patients' health outcomes do not improve but adverse outcomes, such as prescription drug abuse disorders and suicide attempts, increase dramatically. Improving access to medication through easier ordering may thus increase medication overuse.
H51|Implications of Increasing College Attainment for Aging in General Equilibrium|We develop and calibrate an overlapping generations general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy with heterogeneous consumers who face idiosyncratic earnings and health risk to study the implications of exogenous trends in increasing college attainment, decreasing fertility, and increasing longevity between 2005 and 2100. While all three trends contribute to a higher old age dependency ratio, increasing college attainment has different macroeconomic implications because it increases labor productivity. Decreasing fertility and increasing longevity require the government to increase the average labor tax rate from 32.0 to 44.4 percent. Increasing college attainment lowers the required tax increase by 10.1 percentage points. The required tax increase is higher under general equilibrium than in a small open economy with a constant interest rate because the reduction in the interest rate lowers capital income tax revenues.
H51|On Financing Retirement, Health Care, and Long-Term Care in Japan|Japan is facing the problem of how to finance retirement, health care, and long-term care expenditures as the population ages. This paper analyzes the impact of policy options intended to address this problem by employing a dynamic general equilibrium overlapping generations model, specifically parameterized to match both the macro- and microeconomic level data of Japan. We find that financing the costs of aging through gradual increases in the consumption tax rate delivers better macroeconomic performance and higher welfare for most individuals relative to other financing options, including raising social security contributions, debt financing, and a uniform increase in health care and long-term care copayments.
H51|Healthcare Spending Inequality: Evidence from Hungarian Administrative Data|Using administrative data on incomes and healthcare spending, we develop new evidence on the distribution of healthcare spending in Hungary. We document substantial geographic heterogeneity and a positive association between income and public healthcare spending.
H51|Kommunal medfinansiering og kampen for at forebygge indlæggelser: Viden om effekt / Municipal co-financing of regional health services and the fight to prevent hospital admissions: Knowledge about effects|Municipal co-payment is an arrangement where municipalities pay a variable amount to the regions whenever municipal citizens utilize regional health services, e.g. hospital services og GPs. The 5 Danish regions provide somatic and mental health services while municipalities mainly provide home nursing, home help, health visitors, rehabilitation, and child and youth dental services. Municipalities cannot employ physicians who actively treat patients. Municipal co-payment was introduced in 2007 in connection with the structural reform of municipalities and counties. The main idea was that economic incentives in the form of potential savings on co-payment would lead municipalities to look for alternatives to (some) regional health services. The municipalities have developed, among other things, acute beds (usually in conjunction with nursing homes) staffed by experienced home nurses that GPs can refer patients to instead of hospitalizing them, acute nursing teams that provide services in the homes of citizens, follow-home-service where home nurses follow discharged hospital patients to their homes (occasionally together with a GP) and evaluate care needs – in the hope of avoiding rehospitalizations. To the extent that these arrangements have been evaluated they are discussed in this paper. None have shown clear-cut indications of preventing or postponing hospitalizations. The paper services two aims: A literature review of above reports and an econometric analysis of panel data for 2007-2016/17. The econometric analysis did not show any significant effects on hospital admissions.
H51|Determinants Of Prepaid Systems Of Healthcare Financing - A Worldwide Country-Level Perspective|In this paper we examine determinants of prepaid modes of health care financing in a worldwide cross-country perspective. We use three different indicators to capture the role of prepaid modes in health care financing: (i) the share of total prepaid financing as percent of total current health expenditures, (ii) the share of voluntary prepaid financing as percent of total prepaid financing, and (iii) the share of compulsory health insurance as percent of total compulsory financing arrangements. We refer to a panel data set comprising 158 countries and covering the time period 2000-2015. We apply a static as well as a dynamic panel data model. We find that the current structure of prepaid financing is significantly determined by its different forms in the past. The significant influence of governmental revenues, development assistance for health and regulatory quality varies depending on the financing structure we look at. The country's GDP per capita, the agricultural value added, the degree of urbanization and the share of the elderly are only of minor importance for explaining the variation in a country's structure of health care financing. From our analysis we conclude that more detailed information on indicators which reflect the distribution of individual characteristics (such as income and health risks) within a country's population would be needed to gain deeper insight into the decisive determinants for prepaid health care financing.
H51|Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Take-Ups with Zero Cost: Evidence from an Experiment on Formatting Invitation Letters in Italy|We ran a randomized field experiment to ascertain whether a costless manipulation of the informational content (restricted or enhanced information) and the framing (gain or loss framing) of the invitation letter to the breast cancer screening program in Messina, Italy, affects the take-up rate. We show that giving enhanced loss-framed information about the risks of not having a mammography increases the take-up. This manipulation is especially effective among subjects with lower baseline take-ups – those living farther away from the screening site, residing in municipalities with low education, or with no recent screening experience – contributing to reduce socio-economic inequalities in screening. When we investigate the mechanisms behind our findings, we show that subjects exposed to our proposed manipulation are also less likely to postpone the appointment, signaling enhanced awareness about the risks related with delayed participation.

H51|MaÃ®triser les dÃ©penses de santÃ© face au changement dÃ©mographique : Une analyse de lâ€™Ã©volution des coÃ»ts Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital au QuÃ©bec|Ã€ partir de donnÃ©es mÃ©dico-administratives longitudinales sur les sÃ©jours Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital et les coÃ»ts au QuÃ©bec pour la pÃ©riode 1995-2012, une dÃ©composition de la variation des coÃ»ts de santÃ© Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital est effectuÃ©e afin dâ€™en analyser les principaux dÃ©terminants. Entre 1995 et 2012, la part des sÃ©jours hospitaliers a reprÃ©sentÃ© 86% de la hausse des coÃ»ts Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital, contre seulement 14% pour les services mÃ©dicaux Ã lâ€™acte. De 2008 Ã 2012, cette rÃ©partition a Ã©tÃ© respectivement de 41% et 59%. Sur la pÃ©riode la plus rÃ©cente observÃ©e, comme on aurait pu sâ€™y attendre du fait de la hausse des rÃ©munÃ©rations des mÃ©decins spÃ©cialistes, câ€™est donc la forte hausse des coÃ»ts des services mÃ©dicaux qui a le plus contribuÃ© Ã la hausse des coÃ»ts Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital. NÃ©anmoins, lâ€™augmentation des volumes dâ€™actes a davantage contribuÃ© Ã la hausse globale des coÃ»ts que la hausse des prix des actes. Il est de plus difficile dâ€™Ã©tablir un changement de comportement chez les mÃ©decins suite aux bonifications rÃ©centes des prix des actes, dans la mesure oÃ¹ la variation des volumes dâ€™actes apparaÃ®t assez dÃ©connectÃ©e de la variation des prix des actes. On montre enfin que lâ€™effet de vieillissement ne prÃ©domine pas tous les autres et semble avoir une relativement faible influence sur lâ€™Ã©volution des coÃ»ts de santÃ© Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital. Câ€™est donc davantage une combinaison des changements dans la prÃ©valence des maladies et des changements de pratiques qui ont eu pour effet dâ€™entraÃ®ner la hausse globale des coÃ»ts.
H51|The Impact of the Affordable Care Act: Evidence from California's Hospital Sector|The Affordable Care Act (ACA) authorized the largest expansion of public health insurance in the U.S. since the mid-1960s. We exploit ACA-induced changes in the discontinuity in coverage at age 65 using a regression discontinuity based design to examine effects of the expansion on health insurance coverage, hospital use, and patient health. We then link these changes to effects on hospital finances. We show that a substantial share of the federally-funded Medicaid expansion substituted for existing locally-funded safety net programs. Despite this offset, the expansion produced a substantial increase in hospital revenue and profitability, with larger gains for government hospitals. On the benefits side, we do not detect significant improvements in patient health, although the expansion led to substantially greater hospital and emergency room use, and a reallocation of care from public to private and better-quality hospitals.
H51|How Does Supplemental Medicare Coverage Affect the Disabled Under-65 Population?: An Exploratory Analysis of the Health Effects of States’ Medigap Policies for SSDI Beneficiaries|A substantial portion of the costs associated with, and the value to beneficiaries of, Social Security Disability Insurance is Medicare eligibility. However, the benefits of this eligibility can vary due to differences in state policies on supplemental Medicare coverage, also known as Medigap. Although Medigap policies are federally regulated to be issued to 65-and-over Medicare beneficiaries with specific restrictions over underwriting, these policies are left to states to regulate with regard to the under-65 SSDI population, generating substantial cross-state and temporal variation. This paper documents the variation in availability and generosity of under-65 Medigap eligibility for the SSDI population. Furthermore, it exploits this variation to provide initial estimates of how this eligibility affects the health status of non-Medicaid-eligible SSDI recipients. Our main finding is that requiring Medigap plans be offered for under-65 SSDI recipients substantially improves self-reported health of this population, with suggestive evidence that this improvement is stronger as underwriting restrictions increase and among SSDI beneficiaries with mental health conditions. The estimated effect is highly robust to alternative scaling or categorizations of self-reported health, choice of data set, inclusion of fixed effects, controls for local Medicare Advantage penetration, and falsification tests. This effect is nearly three times the size of the estimated increase in self-reported health in the Oregon Medicaid expansion.
H51|The Impact of CEOs in the Public Sector: Evidence from the English NHS|We investigate whether top managers affect the performance of large and complex public sector organizations, using as a case study CEOs of English public hospitals (large, complex organizations with multi-million turnover). We study the extent to which CEOs are differentiated in terms of their pay, as well as a wide range of hospital production measures including inputs, intermediate operational outcomes and clinical outcomes. Pay differentials suggest that the market perceives CEOs to be differentiated. However, we find little evidence of CEOs' impact on hospital production. These results question the effectiveness of leadership changes to improve performance in the public sector.
H51|Reclassification to Avoid Consumer Cost-Sharing in Group Health Plans|We examine how consumers respond to being effectively double insured under two systems: group health (GH) and workers’ compensation (WC). Many GH plans have substantial consumer cost-sharing burden, while WC coverage has no cost-sharing for medical services for work-related injuries. As a result, a consumer facing a large deductible under their group health plan will have a strong financial incentive to make a claim under WC instead. We use a unique data set of claims under both GH and WC to study how “case shifting” to WC responds to GH deductibles for the most common set of injuries that are covered under both types of insurance. We identify the impact of case shifting by using interactions of deductible levels and previous spending. We find that a typical claim is about 1.4 percentage points (5.3%) more likely to be filed as a WC claim when facing an average deductible (about $630) compared to a plan with no deductible, and that total WC costs in the U.S. are more than $1.2 billion higher as a result. At the same time, we find that consumers do not appear to be forward looking, focusing on the “spot price” rather than the full “end of year price” in deciding whether to claim under WC.
H51|The Affordable Care Act’s Effects on Patients, Providers and the Economy: What We’ve Learned So Far|As we approach the tenth anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, it is important to reflect on what has been learned about the impacts of this major reform. In this paper we review the literature on the impacts of the ACA on patients, providers and the economy. We find strong evidence that the ACA’s provisions have increased insurance coverage. There is also a clearly positive effect on access to and consumption of health care, with suggestive but more limited evidence on improved health outcomes. There is no evidence of significant reductions in provider access, changes in labor supply, or increased budgetary pressures on state governments, and the law’s total federal cost through 2018 has been less than predicted. We conclude by describing key policy implications and future areas for research.
H51|Are Quality-Adjusted Medical Prices Declining for Chronic Disease? Evidence from Diabetes Care in Four Health Systems|Improvements in medical treatment have contributed to rising health spending. Yet there is relatively little evidence on whether the spending increase is “worth it” in the sense of producing better health outcomes of commensurate value—a critical question for understanding productivity in the health sector and, as that sector grows, for deriving an accurate quality-adjusted price index for an entire economy. We analyze individual-level panel data on medical spending and health outcomes for 123,548 patients with type 2 diabetes in four health systems. Using a “cost-of-living” method that measures value based on improved survival, we find a positive net value of diabetes care: the value of improved survival outweighs the added costs of care in each of the four health systems. This finding is robust to accounting for selective survival, end-of-life spending, and a range of values for a life-year or, equivalently, to attributing only a fraction of survival improvements to medical care.
H51|Accounting for the Impact of Medicaid on Child Poverty|US Census Bureau poverty measures do not include an explicit need for health care or insurance nor do they consider health insurance benefits to be resources. Consequently, they cannot measure the direct impact of health insurance benefits on poverty. This paper reviews conceptual and practical considerations in incorporating health benefits and needs into poverty measures. We analyze the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches including variants of the Official Poverty Measure (OPM); the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM); using a threshold with medical out-of-pocket (MOOP) expenditures; a Medical Care Expenditure Risk (MCER) Index; willingness to pay (WTP) for Medicaid; and the Health-Inclusive Poverty Measure (HIPM; Korenman and Remler 2016). We present estimates of Medicaid’s impacts on child poverty, based on the HIPM. This paper was prepared as a background paper for the Committee on Building an Agenda to Reduce the Number of Children in Poverty by Half in 10 Years, of the Board of Children, Youth and Families of the National Academy of Sciences. The paper was submitted in October 2017 and embargoed until the release of the Committee’s report, A Roadmap to Reducing Child Poverty, in March of 2019.
H51|Place-Based Drivers of Mortality: Evidence from Migration|We estimate the effect of current location on elderly mortality by analyzing outcomes of movers in the Medicare population. We control for movers' origin locations as well as a rich vector of pre-move health measures. We also develop a novel strategy to adjust for remaining unobservables, based on the assumption that the relative importance of observables and unobservables correlated with movers' destinations is the same as the relative importance of those correlated with movers' origins. We estimate substantial effects of current location. Moving from a 10th to a 90th percentile location would increase life expectancy at age 65 by 1.1 years, and equalizing location effects would reduce cross-sectional variation in life expectancy by 15 percent. Places with favorable life expectancy effects tend to have higher quality and quantity of health care, less extreme climates, lower crime rates, and higher socioeconomic status
H51|How do Humans Interact with Algorithms? Experimental Evidence from Health Insurance|Algorithms increasingly assist consumers in making their purchase decisions across a variety of markets; yet little is known about how humans interact with algorithmic advice. We examine how algorithmic, personalized information affects consumer choice among complex financial products using data from a randomized, controlled trial of decision support software for choosing health insurance plans. The intervention significantly increased plan switching, cost savings, time spent choosing a plan, and choice process satisfaction, particularly when individuals were exposed to an algorithmic expert recommendation. We document systematic selection - individuals who would have responded to treatment the most were the least likely to participate. A model of consumer decision-making suggests that our intervention affected consumers’ signals about both product features (learning) and utility weights (interpretation).
H51|Implications of Increasing College Attainment for Aging in General Equilibrium|We develop and calibrate an overlapping generations general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy with heterogeneous consumers who face idiosyncratic earnings and health risk to study the implications of exogenous trends in increasing college attainment, decreasing fertility, and increasing longevity between 2005 and 2100. While all three trends contribute to a higher old age dependency ratio, increasing college attainment has different macroeconomic implications because it increases labor productivity. Decreasing fertility and increasing longevity require the government to increase the average labor tax rate from 32.0 to 44.4 percent. Increasing college attainment lowers the required tax increase by 10.1 percentage points. The required tax increase is higher under general equilibrium than in a small open economy with a constant interest rate because the reduction in the interest rate lowers capital income tax revenues.
H51|Is Great Information Good Enough? Evidence from Physicians as Patients|Stemming from the belief that the key barrier to achieving high-quality and low-cost health care is the deficiency of information and medical knowledge among patients, an enormous number of health policies are focused on patient education. In this paper, we attempt to place an upper bound on the improvements to health care quality that may emanate from such information campaigns. To do so, we compare the care received by a group of patients that should have the best possible information on health care service efficacy—i.e., physicians as patients—with a comparable group of non-physician patients, taking various steps to account for unobservable differences between the two groups. Our results suggest that physicians do only slightly better in adhering to both low- and high-value care guidelines than non-physicians – but not by much and not always.
H51|Private vs. Public Provision of Social Insurance: Evidence from Medicaid|Public health insurance benefits in the U.S. are increasingly provided by private firms, despite mixed evidence on welfare effects. We investigate the impact of privatization in Medicaid by exploiting the staggered introduction of county-level mandates in Texas that required disabled beneficiaries to switch from public to private plans. Compared to the public program, which used blunt rationing to control costs, we find privatization led to improvements in healthcare—including increased consumption of high-value drug treatments and fewer avoidable hospitalizations—but also higher Medicaid spending. We conclude that private provision can be beneficial when constraints in the public setting limit efficiency.
H51|The Impacts of Physician Payments on Patient Access, Use, and Health|We examine how the amount a physician is paid influences who they are willing to see. Exploiting large, exogenous changes in Medicaid reimbursement rates, we find that increasing payments for new patient office visits reduces reports of providers turning away beneficiaries: closing the gap in payments between Medicaid and private insurers would reduce more than two-thirds of disparities in access among adults and would eliminate disparities among children. These improvements in access lead to more office visits, better self-reported health, and reduced school absenteeism. Our results demonstrate that financial incentives for physicians drive access to care and have important implications for patient health.
H51|Medicaid Coverage across the Income Distribution under the Affordable Care Act|This paper examines trends in Medicaid enrollment across the income distribution after the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. Using data from the American Community Survey between 2012 and 2017, we compare Medicaid coverage over time in 9 states that expanded Medicaid in 2014 with no previous expansion for able-bodied, working-age adults with 12 states that had not expanded Medicaid by 2019 and also had no previous expansion for such adults. A difference-in-differences model is used to formalize this comparison. Similar to many previous studies, we find that Medicaid coverage increased dramatically for income-eligible adults under 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL). In addition, we show that Medicaid participation increased by 3.0 percentage points for those with incomes above 138% of the FPL from a pre-ACA baseline of 2.7% among this group. While we cannot say with certainty why these individuals were able to participate in Medicaid, we offer several potential explanations that should be the subject of future work. For example, it is possible that the ACA Medicaid expansions were administered differently at the state or local level than federal rules would require, similarly to differences between effective tax rates and statutory tax rates in many transfer programs.
H51|The Impact of the ACA on Insurance Coverage Disparities After Four Years|The purpose of this paper is to estimate the impact of the major components of the ACA (Medicaid expansion, subsidized Marketplace plans, and insurance market reforms) on disparities in insurance coverage after four years. We use data from the 2011–2017 waves of the American Community Survey (ACS), with the sample restricted to nonelderly adults. Our methods feature a difference-in-difference-in-differences model, developed in the recent ACA literature, which separately identifies the effects of the nationwide and Medicaid expansion portions of the law. The differences in this model come from time, state Medicaid expansion status, and local area pre-ACA uninsured rate. We stratify our sample separately by income, race/ethnicity, marital status, age, gender, and geography in order to examine access disparities. After four years, we find that the fully implemented ACA eliminated 44 percent of the coverage gap across income groups, with the Medicaid expansion accounting for this entire reduction. The ACA also reduced coverage disparities across racial groups by 26.7 percent, across marital status by 45 percent, and across age groups by 44 percent, with these changes being partly attributable to both the Medicaid expansion and nationwide components of the law.
H51|The Two Margin Problem in Insurance Markets|Insurance markets often feature consumer sorting along both an extensive margin (whether to buy) and an intensive margin (which plan to buy). We present a new graphical theoretical framework that extends the workhorse model to incorporate both selection margins simultaneously. A key insight from our framework is that policies aimed at addressing one margin of selection often involve an economically meaningful trade-off on the other margin in terms of prices, enrollment, and welfare. For example, while a larger penalty for opting to remain uninsured reduces the uninsurance rate, it also tends to lead to unraveling of generous coverage because the newly insured are healthier and sort into less generous plans, driving down the relative prices of those plans. While risk adjustment transfers shift enrollment from lower- to higher-generosity plans, they also sometimes increase the uninsurance rate by raising the prices of less generous plans, which are the entry points into the market. We illustrate these trade-offs in an empirical sufficient statistics approach that is tightly linked to the graphical framework. Using data from Massachusetts, we show that in many policy environments these trade-offs can be empirically meaningful and can cause these policies to have unexpected consequences for overall social welfare.
H51|Do-It-Yourself medicine? The impact of light cannabis liberalization on prescription drugs|This paper provides the first analysis of â€œDo-it-Yourself Medicineâ€ concerning marijuana consumption by studying the effects of the unintended liberalization of light cannabis that took place in Italy in 2016 on prescription drugs sales. Using a unique and high-frequency dataset on monthly sales of drugs and the location of light cannabis retailers and adopting a staggered DiD research design, we find that the local market accessibility of light cannabis led to a reduction in dispensed packets of opioids, anxiolytics, sedatives, anti-migraines, antiepileptics, anti-depressives and anti-psychotics. This calls for an effective regulation of the market and a proper evaluation of the use of light cannabis for medical purposes.
H51|Does the framing of patient cost-sharing incentives matter? The effects of deductibles vs. no-claim refunds|Understanding how health care utilization responds to cost-sharing incentives is of central importance for providing high quality care and limiting the growth of costs. While there is compelling evidence that patients react to financial incentives, it is less well understood how and why specific aspects of the design of contracts shape the size of this reaction. In this paper, we focus on the question whether the framing of cost-sharing incentives has an effect on health care utilization. To study this we make use of a policy change that occurred in the Netherlands. Until 2007, patients received a a no-claim refund if they consumed little or no health care; from 2008 onward there was a deductible. This means that very similar economic incentives were first framed in terms of smaller gains and later as losses. We use claims-level data for a broad sample from the Dutch population to estimate whether the reaction to economic incentives was affected by this. Our empirical approach is to exploit within-year variation using an instrumental variables approach while controlling for differences across years. Our central finding is that patients react to incentives much more strongly when they are framed in terms of losses. Simulations based on our estimates show that the effect on yearly spending is 8.6 percent. This suggests that discussions on the optimal design of cost-sharing incentives should not only involve coinsurance rates and cost-sharing limits, but also how these are presented to patients.
H51|Towards universal social protection: Lessons from the universal health coverage initiative|Universal social protection (USP) is becoming high priority in many developing countries’ agendas. However, information on what has worked well – and not so well – is limited. This study reviews a wide range of recent country experiences with universal health coverage (UHC) financing and implementation in order to draw lessons and help governments elaborate policies for USP and the extension of social protection. It looks at different pathways and delivery and financing challenges to universalism in health coverage and takes a close look at equity issues. It concludes with some key takeaways from UHC implementation and its implications for USP. One important message of this study is that while the UHC experience cannot be mechanically transposed to the USP agenda, a number of lessons can be drawn. Moreover, the benefits in terms of coverage and equity of better integrating USP and UHC appear tremendous.
H51|Fiscal challenges and inclusive growth in ageing societies|This paper was prepared in support of Japan’s G20 Presidency. It takes stock of ongoing and projected population ageing across G20 economies and its far-reaching implications for economic growth, productivity, inequality within and between generations and the sustainability of public finances. Rising old-age dependency ratios will put the financing of adequate pensions, health and long-term care under high pressure. The paper provides recommendations on policy responses to address ageing-related challenges and highlights good practices. A comprehensive approach is needed, tailored to each country’s institutional and policy settings and social preferences, and may span many areas of public policy: improving the design of public pensions, incentivising private savings, enhancing the efficiency of health care provision, expanding the coverage of social security systems, promoting employability and skills of older workers, and striving for a better labour market inclusion of women, youth and migrants.
H51|Health Spending Projections to 2030: New results based on a revised OECD methodology|To gain a better understanding of the financial sustainability of health systems, the OECD has produced a new set of health spending projections up to 2030 for all its member countries. Estimates are produced across a range of policy situations. Policy situations analysed include a “base” scenario – estimates of health spending growth in the absence of major policy changes – and a number of alternative scenarios that model the effect on health spending of policies that increase productivity or contribute to better lifestyles; or conversely, ineffective policies that contribute to additional cost pressures on health systems.
H51|The impact of technological advancements on health spending: A literature review|The measurement of the impact of technology as a driver of health care expenditure is complex since technological effects are closely interlinked with other determinants such as income and the composition and health status of a population. Furthermore, the impact of the supply of advances in technology on health expenditure cannot be considered in isolation from demand and the policy context and the broader institutional context governing the adoption of new technologies. Hence, it is the interaction of supply and demand factors and the context that determine the ultimate level of technology use.There are also important quality changes that come with technological progress that also have monetary costs and benefits attached. Modelling quality improvements, both in terms of benefits within the health system and outside (e.g. its impact on life expectancy, ageing populations, productivity and GDP), is a challenging task, and no macroeconomic models to date have tried to capture them.This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of the impact of technological advances on health expenditure growth, the ‘cost’ side of the equation.
H51|Credit, Default, and Optimal Health Insurance|How do defaults and bankruptcies affect optimal health insurance policy? I answer this question using a life-cycle model of health investment with the option to default on emergency room (ER) bills and financial debts. I calibrate the model for the U.S. economy and compare the optimal health insurance in the baseline economy with that in an economy with no option to default. With no option to default, the optimal health insurance is similar to the health insurance system in the baseline economy. In contrast, with the option to default, the optimal health insurance system (i) expands the eligibility of Medicaid to 22 percent of the working-age population, (ii) replaces 72 percent of employer-based health insurance with a private individual health insurance plus a progressive subsidy, and (iii) reforms the private individual health insurance market by improving coverage rates and preventing price discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions. This result implies that with the option to default, households rely on bankruptcies and defaults on ER bills as implicit health insurance. More redistributive healthcare reforms can improve welfare by reducing the dependence on this implicit health insurance and changing households’ medical spending behavior to be more preventative.
H51|Gasto Público Social, Gobernanza y Desarrollo Humano: Una Aplicación con Datos Municipales de Bolivia: 1994-2008<BR>[Social Public Expenditure, Governance and Human Development: An Application with Municipal Data of Bolivia: 1994-2008]|In this opportunity, we analyze the relationship among public social spending, governance and human development based on cross-sectional sample of data from more than 300 municipalities of Bolivia. Considering the municipal statistical information, we estimate a multiple linear regression model with instrumental variables, using least squares in two stages. We have instrumentalized the public social expenditure variable through an efficiency government index (governance). In the first stage, we have found that government efficiency explains the differences in total social public expenditure per capita executed between 1997 and 2005. In the second stage, we find a positive effect of total social public expenditure per capita executed between 1997 and 2005 on human development, measured in 2005. Therefore, estimates reveal that higher levels of social public spending tend to generate a higher level of human development in municipalities where government efficiency is higher. In quantitative terms, the results reveal that, keeping the rest of the variables constant and considering the importance of government efficiency, if the total social public expenditure per capita executed during 1997 to 2005 had increased by Bs 100 per capita, then human development measured in 2005, it would have increased by 6.6%.

H51|Economic Burden of Diabetes mellitus in Brazil|Background: Global economic burden of Diabetes mellitus will reach US$ 745 billion in 2030. The growing prevalence of the disease, mainly type 2, is related to the population aging, nutritional transition, and economic growth. Brazil is the fourth country in number of patients with diabetes and also follows the global trends, with continuous increase in prevalence. In this sense, a complete assessment of the economic burden of the disease in the country, considering all direct and indirect costs, is needed. Methods: We use a cost-of-illness approach to calculate total economic burden of DM. We use recent and complete data referring to 2016. Findings: We estimate the Brazilian economic burden of US$ 2.15 billion in 2016, of which 70.6% is indirect costs related to premature deaths, absenteeism, and early retirement. Interpretation: Our results are in accordance with the literature, that shows that indirect costs are more relevant to low- and middle-income countries due to weak health services and therefore higher mortality rates from chronic diseases. Funding: This study was supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies through a sub-award agreement 5104695 between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Center for Epidemiological Studies in Nutrition and Health.
H51|Attitudes Towards Public Health Spending: The Case of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom|The funding of the NHS in the UK is in perennial crisis. In times of austerity it is difficult to advocate extra health spending from tax revenue. Our central questions are: how much extra do people think should be spent on the NHS; how much extra tax might they be willing to pay; or to what extent would they like to see public money redistributed away from other public services towards the NHS? We answer these questions using a large survey of the UK general public. On average the answers to these questions are $279, $176 and $33 per person, per year, respectively. We examine people's appetite for other measures to increase spending on patients and find that their spending preferences are somewhat related to their own health but strongly related to their age, gender, religious beliefs, political sentiments, and views on the structure of the NHS.
H51|Wasted windfalls: Inefficiencies in health care spending in oil rich countries|This paper uses Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) to determine whether oil rents drive inefficiency in the healthcare sector. SFA simultaneously estimates a production function for health outputs and the determinants of inefficiency in production. Using a sample of 119 countries covering the period 2000 to 2015, unexpectedly high oil revenues are shown to increase inefficiency. Oil rents hinder countries in reaching their potential life expectancy. Exploiting exogenous variation in the international oil price reveals that causality runs from oil rents to inefficiency. The effect varies with institutions, sex and age. The effect is more pronounced in democracies, and women and children are affected more. Transparency and inequality are potential mechanisms.
H51|The Effect of Government Health Expenditure on the Income Distribution: A Comparison of Valuation Methods in Ghana|Government spending on services affects the level and distribution of welfare, but measuring its value is a challenge. To assess how publicly funded in-kind health care affects the income distribution, we must estimate its monetary value to beneficiaries. We describe and compare three approaches to measuring the distributional consequences of government health spending: average cost of provision, willingness-to-pay, and health outcomes. In addition, we estimate the value of financial risk protection from insurance, which is a benefit of health spending that can be added to each of the aforementioned approaches. Average cost is the standard method used in benefit-incidence studies (Lustig, 2018). This method values utilization of each unit of care at the government’s average cost of provision, calculated with national accounts data and administrative records. Willingness to pay uses revealed preference to estimate compensating variations for health care subsidies. The health outcomes method estimates the effect of government health spending on mortality and values those mortality reductions in monetary terms. We provide example applications for each of these methods using a national cross-section from Ghana for 2012/13. We estimate a willingness to pay model for outpatient services and find that, on average, users value those services at less than what the government pays for them. The estimated marginal effect of health spending for outpatient care on inequality are modest and somewhat smaller than those for the average cost approach. In contrast, the health outcomes method finds that the marginal effects of health spending for three causes of death and five health interventions are very large. Health interventions to reduce malaria mortality such as indoor residual spraying and distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets are strongly progressive and the averted mortality from providing anti-malarial medication dwarfs the distributional effects of any other public expenditure or tax in Ghana. Adopting the health outcomes approach dramatically changes our assessment of how public spending in Ghana affects the welfare distribution. The benefit of financial risk protection from Ghana’s National Health Insurance Scheme equals 0.25% to 0.5% of income for the three poorest quartiles and between 0.5% and 1% of income for the wealthiest, yet insurance is still distributed somewhat more equally than income itself.
H51|Correcting for Transitory Effects in RCTs: Application to the RAND Health Insurance Experiment|The long run price elasticity of healthcare spending is critically important to estimating the cost of provision. However, temporary randomized controlled trials may be confounded by transitory effects. This paper shows evidence of a 'deadline effect' – a spike in spending in the final year of the program – among participants of the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, long considered the definitive RCT in the field. The deadline effect is economically and statistically significant, with power to identify coming from random allocation to three- or five-year enrolment terms. The deadline effect interacts with the price elasticity: participants who face lower coinsurance rates show larger spending spikes. Crucially, controlling for the price-deadline interaction yields significantly smaller estimates of the price elasticity in non-deadline years, which we argue is a better approximation for the long run elasticity. This has important implications for public finance and the design of private/temporary subsidy programs.
H51|Assessing Public Expenditure Efficiency at Indian States|This paper attempts to understand what drives the public expenditure efficiency among the States. For this, it looks at the role of economic growth as well as quality of governance. The results of input-oriented and output-oriented DEA approach finds a large variation in the efficiency of public spending as well as scope for resource saving among Indian States. The results suggest that States are spending their resources more efficiently on education than on health and overall social sector spending. Further, it also finds that both quality of governance and economic growth affects the efficiency of education, health, and social sector with governance to have larger effect compared to growth. Overall, the study suggests that focus on good governance could yield better outcomes from public spending
H51|Development of Education and Health Services in Asia and the Role of the State|This paper analyses the dramatic spread of education and healthcare in Asia and also the large variations in that spread across and within countries over fifty years. Apart from differences in initial conditions and income levels, the nature of the State has also been an important determinant of these variations. This is because social development has typically been led by the State. But in most countries, public resource constraints and the growing dependence on private provision and private spending have generated a pattern of nested disparities in the access to education and healthcare between rich and poor regions, between rural and urban areas within regions, and between rich and poor households within these areas. However, as the better-off regions, areas, and households approach the upper limits of achievable education and health standards, a process of convergence is also underway as those left behind begin to catch up.
H51|Sustainable finance for inclusive growth in Thailand|The Partnerships pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development cuts across all the goals focusing on the mobilisation of resources needed to implement the agenda. Thailand’s “sufficiency economy philosophy” encourages the prioritisation of long-term sustainability over short-term benefits. As such, Thailand has a long history of fiscal prudence that has served the country well in times of economic and political instability. However, relying on current fiscal buffers to finance foreseeable expenditure pressures is not sufficient or sustainable. A rapidly ageing population and shrinking workforce will weigh on future public finances and on the ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. To ensure that Thailand is well placed over the medium term to meet growing social, environmental and infrastructure requirements, the government should: (i) increase tax revenues by broadening the tax base and enhancing collection efficiency; (ii) facilitate greater private sector investment in productive infrastructure; and (iii) reform the healthcare and pension systems to increase their efficiency and effectiveness. This Working Paper relates to the Initial Assessment report of the Multi-dimensional Country Review of Thailand. (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/multi-dimensional-review-thailand.htm)
H51|Costa Rica: Restoring fiscal sustainability and setting the basis for a more growth-friendly and inclusive fiscal policy|Consecutive years of primary deficits have led to mounting public debt of almost 50% of GDP, one of the fastest increases in Latin America over the last decade. Government attempts to restore fiscal health have been undermined by a gridlocked Congress. While only minor reforms have been enacted to contain spending, efforts to curb tax evasion and increase the efficiency of the tax administration are commendable. However, increases in tax revenue have been unable to match mandated increases in spending. As a consequence, sovereign debt ratings have declined to below investment level, and the negative outlook on Costa Rica’s debt signals increasing financing costs. Against this backdrop, the risk of a fiscal crisis is increasing, particularly as global financial conditions become less favourable and debt structure has shifted towards increased reliance on floating rates and dollar-denominated bonds. Enacting a three year fiscal consolidation programme of one percentage point of GDP each year, will enable debt to stabilise at current levels by 2032. The current draft bill to strengthen public finances – Ley de Fortalecimiento de las Finanzas Públicas – proposes a comprehensive fiscal reform package, with measures on both the revenue and the spending side, as well as a fiscal rule. It needs to be complemented with additional measures to contain revenue earmarking. In addition, reducing excessive fragmentation of the public sector would allow the Ministry of Finance to regain control of the budget. There is also room to reduce expenditure on remuneration of public sector workers, one of the fastest growing expenditure items and a source of income inequality. The proposed fiscal rule should be strengthened, including introducing a multi-year expenditure framework and a fiscal council. Debt management should be modernised by stepping up communication with markets and reducing the number of benchmark securities. Over time, improving social spending efficiency and quality as well as modifying the tax structure away from social security contributions and enlarging the tax base would allow for a much stronger contribution of fiscal policy to growth and equity.
H51|Cyclical vs structural effects on health care expenditure trends in OECD countries|Health care expenditure per person, after accounting for changes in overall price levels, began to slow in many OECD countries in the early-to-mid 2000s, well before the economic and fiscal crisis. Using available estimates from the OECD’s System of Health Accounts (SHA) database, we explore common trends in health care expenditure since 1996 in a set of 22 OECD countries. We assess the extent to which the trends observed are the results of cyclical economic influences, and the respective contributions of changes in relative prices, health care volumes and coverage to the slowdown in health care expenditure growth. Our analysis suggests that cyclical factors may account for a little less than one half of the estimated slowdown in health care spending since the crisis, suggesting that structural changes have contributed to the trends. Before the crisis the slowdown in health care expenditure growth was accounted for by health care prices growing less than general prices and a reduction in care volumes, whereas the latter accounts for most of the steeper deceleration after the crisis. Although both privately and publically financed health care expenditure grew at a reduced pace during the study period, the sharp post-crisis deceleration happened mostly in the public component. When examined by function, the slowdown in publicly-financed expenditure has been largest in curative and rehabilitative care (particularly after the crisis) and in medical goods (especially pharmaceuticals), whereas the deceleration in the privately financed component is largely in medical goods (including pharmaceuticals). We conclude that structural changes in publicly financed health care have constrained the growth of care volumes (especially) and prices leading to a marked reduction in health care expenditure growth rates, beyond what could be expected based on cyclical economic fluctuations. We examine a range of government policies enacted in a selection of OECD countries that likely contributed to the structural changes observed in our analysis.
H51|Which policies increase value for money in health care?|The incentive structures produced by different institutional arrangements in health systems are important determinants of their performance, and can explain some of the differences in cross-country performance patterns.This paper proposes an approach and quantitative method to investigate how different policies and institutions helped achieving better value for money across 26 OECD countries for the period of 2000-2015. To this aim, it uses a panel of health system characteristics indicators - derived from questionnaires sent to countries by OECD in 2008, 2012 and 2016 - that describes primarily health financing and coverage arrangements, health care delivery systems, and governance and resource allocation.
H51|The economics of patient safety in primary and ambulatory care: Flying blind|Building on published patient safety research literature, this paper aims to broaden the existing knowledge base on safety lapses occurring in primary and ambulatory care settings.The findings of this paper show that safety lapses in primary and ambulatory care are common. About half of the global burden of patient harm originates in primary and ambulatory care, and estimates suggest that nearly four out of ten patients experience safety issue(s) in their interaction with this setting. Safety lapses in primary and ambulatory care most often result in an increased need for care or hospitalisations. Available evidence estimates the direct costs of safety lapses – the additional tests, treatments and health care – in primary and ambulatory care to be around 2.5% of total health expenditure. Safety lapses resulting in hospitalisations each year may count 6% of total hospital bed days and more than 7 million admissions in the OECD.
H51|Price Discrimination in the Italian Medical Device Industry: An Empirical Analysis|In this paper we carry out an empirical analysis to show that the significant price dispersion in the Italian market for medical devices may also be due to price discrimination strategies. We find that ASL (Aziende Sanitarie Locali) incur higher costs than AO (Aziende Ospedaliere) that purchase larger quantities. Centralized purchasing agencies pay lower prices than single purchasers. Therefore second-degree price discrimination seems to be one cause of price differences. Product age has a negative effect on prices due to the impact of innovation on suppliers’ costs. Concerning geographical price discrimination, public procurers located in the south pay significantly higher prices than those located in Northern or Central Italy. However we show that this result may be due to the higher probability that southern public procurers purchase from independent retailers rather than from producers of medical devices, implying a potential double marginalization effect due to the market power of retailers at a local level.
H51| Derecho a la salud, cáncer y política fiscal en el Perú| El Perú registra grandes desigualdades sociales y un bajo gasto público en salud. Ha avanzado en enfermedades trasmisibles y salud materno-infantil, pero las no trasmisibles hoy constituyen tres quintas partes de la carga de enfermedad y hay 45 mil nuevos casos de cáncer al año. La baja inversión social y centralización de la atención del cáncer discriminan contra los indígenas. Un tercio de limeñas ha hecho mamografía en los últimos 2 años pero apenas 4% en zonas rurales. La cobertura del Papanicolaou, un examen preventivo básico, llega solo a 50% en sierra y selva. En Lima se concentran casi tres de cada cuatro de los especialistas y hay un alto costo del tratamiento. Habiendo gozado el Perú del boom de las materias primas, el Estado ha actuado de manera tardía e insuficiente ante el cáncer. Recién a partir de 2012, luego de 8 años de auge fiscal, se estableció un programa público de prevención y control. El cáncer da cuenta del 18% de las muertes en el Perú, pero menos del 6% presupuesto en salud, apenas 0,12% del PBI. Mientras entre 2008 y 2012 la recaudación tributaria aumentó de USD 13 mil a 26 mil millones anuales, en 2012 el programa contra el cáncer solo recibía 130 millones anuales. Desde el 2014 la recaudación tributaria ha caído y el gobierno ha frenado el gasto en salud y en especial en cáncer, que ha registrado reducciones presupuestales el 2016 y 2017.

H51|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.
H51|How Should A Government Finance for Pension Benefit?|Based on Ono (2010), this short note presents consideration of the consumption tax and examines how tax reform to maintain the neutrality of pension benefit affects income growth rate and the employment rate. A decrease in the contribution rate of workers with an increase in consumption tax raises employment, but the effect on income growth is ambiguous. A decrease in the contribution rate of firms with an increase in consumption tax decreases the employment and facilitates income growth.
H51|The Determinants of Public Health Expenditures: Comparing Canada and Spain|The determinants of public health care expenditure are examined in two of the most decentralized countries in the world (Canada and Spain) for two partly overlapping time-spans of data availability: Canada, 1981 to 2013 and Spain, 2002 to 2013. While Canada generally spends more per capita on health care than Spain, over time Spain’s macro level health indicator performance has surpassed Canada’s. Using regression analysis, we find the key determinants of public health care spending include time trend, income, physician numbers and regional fixed effects. Physician numbers are a significant driver of real per capita public health expenditures in Canada but not Spain despite the greater per capita number of physicians in Spain. Differences in the growth and performance of real per capita income explain much of the gap between public health spending between these two countries with some contribution from differences in per capita physician numbers. The differential health indicator outcomes raise the question of what Canada might do to be more efficient.
H51|Should Public Elderly Care Be Provided?|The study described in this short paper sets an elderly care model in which the public elderly care and informal elderly care provided by the family are substitutive, with examination of the dynamics of capital accumulation and the labor supply. By virtue of capital accumulation, informal elderly care is reduced by public elderly care. With certain conditions, by virtue of public elderly care, informal elderly care vanishes and a full labor supply is achieved. However, this paper presents derivation of the result that the economy with informal elderly care is socially optimal.
H51|Essai d’évaluation de la contribution de la santé à la croissance économique en Algérie<BR>[An assessment of the contribution of health to economic growth in Algeria]|The aim of the present study is to examine the contribution of health (through public health expenditure, life expectancy at birth, infant mortality and crude death rates) to economic growth Algeria in the period 1974-2013, in the augmented production function with health capital framework. We use for our empirical investigation, the ARDL approach to cointegration to estimate the long and short run relationships. The results of long and short-run estimates of four models clearly show that public spending on health, life expectancy and crude mortality rates have a positive and significant impact on real GDP, while the infant mortality rate is not statistically significant. In addition, long-term estimates also show that education has positive and significant impact; however, it is not significant for the short-term estimates. Furthermore, our estimates also show that gross fixed capital formation and export hydrocarbon revenues have significant impact on real GDP. Résumé : L’objectif de cette présente étude est d’examiner la contribution de la santé (à travers les dépenses publiques de santé, l’espérance de vie à la naissance, le taux de mortalité infantile et le taux brut de mortalité) à la croissance économique en Algérie durant la période 1974-2013, dans le cadre d’une fonction de production augmentée de capital santé. Nous utilisons, pour notre investigation empirique, l’approche ARDL (AutoRegressive Distributed Lags) de cointégration afin d’estimer les relations de long et de courts termes. Les résultats des estimations de longs et courts termes des quatre modèles montrent clairement que les dépenses publiques de santé, l’espérance vie et le taux brut de mortalité ont un impact positif et significatif sur le PIB réel, tandis que le taux de mortalité infantile n’est pas statiquement significatif. En outre, les estimations de long terme montrent aussi que l’éducation a un impact positif et significatif, par contre elle est non significative à court terme. Par ailleurs, nos estimations, de court et de long terme, montrent aussi que la formation brute du capital fixe et les recettes d’exportation des hydrocarbures ont un impact significatif sur le PIB réel.
H51|The Decommissioning of the Middle Class|": The euro crisis has threatened the balance of social structures, through the impoverishment of the middle class, in almost all countries of the Old Continent. This trend has not only posed a threat to social cohesion, but it also threats the very nature of the so-called Western-style Democracy. The reason for this is that there is a class that has always been a ""cushion"" that absorbs both the vibrations of competition and the confrontation of the social elite with the socially weak, offering the latter the ability to overcome their misery. In most capitalist economies, the middle class label is based on an economic definition that is largely based on a lifestyle that is based on a certain economic robustness and endurance. With the deepening of the crisis, however, the diversity of the middle class not only has it been jeopardized, but rather, it has gradually been replaced by a new demographic category called the prekariat. This new category consists of a group of people once in the middle class and currently marginalized. All of this leads to generalized uncertainty and totally unstable political attitudes, with intense mobility at the extremes. The rapid rise of right and left-wing populism is an aspect of the threatened subjugation of the middle class strata. The consequences for societies when their layered center is lost are obvious and significant."
H51|Investigating The Dynamic Effect of Healthcare Expenditure and Education Expenditure On Economic Growth in Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC)|The socio-economic development level of any country has been significantly attached to the state of healthcare and well-being of its people. Moreover, it is unequivocal that healthy people have substantial influences on economic advancement of a country because when they live longer there is tendency that they will be more productive. On the other hand, the standpoint of education on economic growth cannot be underscored as it serves as method of evolution and progression of personalities and an essential indicator of broad production of the national income. Nevertheless, this paper examines the dynamic effect of healthcare expenditure and education expenditure on economic growth using evidence from Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries. The study applied Pool Mean Group (PMG) method by using 1990 to 2015 data. The study reveals a robust long-run co-integrating relationship between healthcare expenditure, education expenditure, research and development and the economic growths of OIC countries. Besides, the short-run effects indicates that, healthcare expenditure per capita significantly impact economic growth of OIC countries, while the education expenditure and research and development (technology) were insignificantly impact economic growth of OIC countries in the short-run. Albeit, the findings of the study short-run specific-effects concluded that, there is existence of a co-integrating relationship between the healthcare, education, technology and economic growth in 36 out of the 56 OIC countries, while 20 other countries have no co-integrating relationship with the economic growths. However, the study suggests that healthcare and education are device to further attain economic growth and development in OIC countries if well managed and administered.
H51|What’s next for healthcare in Poland: diagnosis and prognosis|The health protection system is the object of constant pressures and difficulties in mitigating them, and even more so eliminating or at least reducing them. Changes are undertaken under the influence of a one-sided political assessment, the interests of various groups of participants or the protests of successive groups of medical staff. There is no professional and fully documented diagnosis of the system, made by independent experts, which could serve as the basis for a comprehensive health protection reform plan, rather than individual, incidental changes that disrupt the system’s already very fragile balance. A well thought-out reform, properly distributed over time, so that at no point does it cause negative health effects. A reform agreed among stakeholders and adopted with understanding of the need for changes, so that it is supported by society. A reform for which there will be funds, institutions and engaged professionals – leaders in health protection. A reform that won’t be criticized or changed when the government changes. Such a reform is waiting to be presented and debated. We begin this process by pointing out and presenting the system’s main problems.
H51|Experiences of public healthcare nurses working with menally ill patients in public health|Mental illness in South Africa has been ranked as the third greatest contributor to this country?s burden of disease with estimates of 1 in 6 individuals likely to suffer from some form of mental disorder (Stein, Williams, & Kessler, 2009).Due to the decentralisation of medical care from a predominantly hospital based medical care system to a community based medical care system in 2002, (Lund, Petersen, Kleinjes & Bhana, 2012) a large portion of the population primarily use community-based care services (Lehohla, 2011). South Africa has a shortage of human resources who are qualified to diagnose and counsel individuals who may have a mental illness (Lund, Petersen, Kleintjes & Bhana, 2012). The World Health Organisation (WHO) (2007), report states that there are only 9.3 medical human resources to every 100 000 people in South Africa. This implies that primary health care (PHC) workers, (particularly nurses, social workers, occupational therapists and doctors) who interact frequently with patients may be unduly burdened. Public health care nurses, specifically, are unofficially required to recognise mental illness and appropriately refer patients for assistance. These nurses may have had some basic training around mental illness but they may not be equipped to recognise, diagnose or treat mental illness resulting the patient being inadequately treated.In South Africa the biomedical approach to mental health care is consistent within psychiatric care, in that the manifestation of psychiatric symptoms are treated biomedically, in order to contain the neurobiological antecedents of the illness. However, this approach is arguably less conducive to psychosocial difficulties that result in needing mental healthcare (Petersen, Bhagwanjee, Parekh, 2000). The significance of this research is that it highlights issues of mental health and illness within the scope of public health care facilities and whether these facilities are able to provide adequate care for patients with mental illness. The Life Esidemeni crisis (2016), demonstrates the urgent need to shine a spotlight on mental health service provision in South Africa, both in research and society.In light of the above factors, the aim of this research is to better understand what public healthcare staff, not trained in psychiatry or psychology, understand about mental illness, and explore their personal experiences of treating patients who may be experiencing a mental illness or a mental health crisis. This study is an Interpretive Phenomenological (IP) study focusing on the unique perspectives and experiences of primary health care (PHC) workers.
H51|Social Media As A Market Communication Tool In Healthcare|Healthcare performance is strongly dependent on the health system and its efficiency. This paper discusses social media as a tool for higher effectiveness of communication among the key healthcare stakeholders ? patients and physicians ? in the period of digital society. Based on the findings of previous research and case study analysis on Slovenian healthcare context, the paper provides a framework of key motives, advantages, risks, personal attributes and contextual factors that influence the use of health-related social media. Together with the proposed key supportive mechanisms the framework is developed into a holistic conceptual model of market communication in healthcare via social media.
H51|Spending the night?. Provider incentives, capacity constraints and patient outcomes|Healthcare providers’ response to payment incentives may have consequences for both fiscal spending and patient health. This paper studies the effects of a change in the payment scheme for hospitals in Norway. In 2010, payments for patients discharged on the day of admission were substantially decreased, while payments for stays lasting longer than one day were increased. This gave hospitals incentives to shift patients from one-day stays to two-day stays, or to decrease the admission of one-day stays. I study hospital responses by exploiting the variable size of price changes across diagnoses in a difference-in-differences framework. I find no evidence that hospitals respond to price changes, and capacity constraints do not appear to explain this finding. Results imply that the current payment policy yields little scope for policymakers to affect the healthcare spending and treatment choices.
H51|Regional variation in healthcare utilization and mortality|Geographic variation in healthcare utilization has raised concerns of possible inefficiencies in healthcare supply, as differences are often not reflected in health outcomes. Using comprehensive Norwegian microdata, we exploit cross-region migration to analyze regional variation in healthcare utilization. Our results indicate that hospital region factors account for half of the total variation, while the rest reflect variation in patient demand. We find no statistically significant association between the estimated hospital region effects and overall mortality rates. However, we document a negative association with relative utilization-intensive causes of death such as cancer, suggesting high-supply regions may achieve modestly improved health outcomes.
H51|Take-Up, Drop-Out, and Spending in ACA Marketplaces|The Affordable Care Act (ACA) established health insurance marketplaces where consumers can buy individual coverage. Leveraging novel credit card and bank account micro-data, we identify new enrollees in the California marketplace and measure their health spending and premium payments. Following enrollment, we observe dramatic spikes in individuals' health care consumption. We also document widespread attrition, with more than half of all new enrollees dropping coverage before the end of the plan year. Enrollees who drop out re-time health spending to the months of insurance coverage. This drop-out behavior generates a new type of adverse selection: insurers face high costs relative to the premiums collected when they enroll strategic consumers. We show that the pattern of attrition undermines market stability and can drive insurers to exit, even absent differences in enrollees' underlying health risks. Further, using data on plan price increases, we show that insurers largely shift the costs of attrition to non-drop-out enrollees, whose inertia generates low price sensitivity. Our results suggest that campaigns to improve use of social insurance may be more efficient when they jointly target take-up and attrition.
H51|Impact of type 2 diabetes on health expenditure: estimation based on individual administrative data|Abstract Only limited data are available in France on the incidence and health expenditure of type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study, based on national health insurance administrative database, is to describe the expenditure reimbursed to patients newly treated for type 2 diabetes and the proportion of expenditure attributable to diabetes. The study is conducted over a 6-year period from 2008, the year of incidence of treated diabetes, to 2014. Type 2 diabetic patients aged 45 years and older are identified on the basis of their drug consumption. To estimate expenditure attributable to diabetes, a matched control group is selected among more than 13 million beneficiaries over 44 years old not taking antidiabetic treatment. The expenditure attributable to diabetes is estimated by two methods: simple comparison of reimbursed health expenditure between both groups, and a difference-in-differences method including control variables. The cohort of incident type 2 diabetic patients comprises 170,013 patients in 2008. Mean global reimbursed expenditure is €4700 per patient in 2008 and €5500 in 2015. Expenditure attributable to diabetes, estimated by direct comparison with controls, is €1500 in the first year. We, thus, observe a decrease in the following year due to decreased hospitalisations, and then expenditure increase by an average of 7% per year to reach €1900 in the eighth year after the initiation of treatment.
H51|An Apple a Day? Adult Food Stamp Eligibility and Health Care Utilization Among Immigrants|In this study, we document the effect of Food Stamp access on adult health care utilization. While Food Stamps is one of the largest safety net programs in the U.S. today, the universal nature of the program across geographic areas and over time limits the potential for quasi-experimental analysis. To circumvent this, we use variation in documented immigrants' eligibility for Food Stamps across states and over time due to welfare reform in 1996. Our estimates indicate that access to Food Stamps reduced the likelihood of an adult visiting a physician more than twice in one year, but had no significant effect on the likelihood of having any physician visits. This result does not appear to be due to changes in physical or mental health, or due to individuals with common chronic health conditions, leaving open the possibility that changes in nutrition or resources may reduce the need for physician visits. Additionally, we find that for single women, Food Stamps increased the affordability of specialty health care, which may have further reduced the need for physician visits. These findings have important implications for cost-benefit analyses of the Food Stamp program, as reductions in health care utilization due to Food Stamps may offset some of the program's impact on the overall government budget due to the existence of government-provided health insurance programs such as Medicaid.
H51|Gone with the Windfall - Germany‘s Second LTC Strengthening Act and its Intergenerational Implications|Due to the debate about the generosity of LTC insurance benefits the German government decided to increase benefits and widen the circle of LTC beneficiaries with the Second LTC Strengthening Act. In this paper, we evaluate the long-term implications of this recent reform for the German LTC insurance scheme. Using the framework of generational accounting we show that the reform has led to a widening of the short-term gap between revenues and expenditure and that the LTC insurance is not sustainably financed, neither pre- nor post-reform. By the early 2020s there will be fiscal pressure for further reforms. From an intergenerational perspective, the reform can be seen as a windfall to current beneficiaries increasing the intergenerational redistribution through the pay-as-you-go system.
H51|The growing American health penalty: International trends in the employment of older workers with poor health|Many countries have reduced the generosity of disability benefits while making them more activating – yet few studies have examined how employment rates have subsequently changed. We present estimates of how the employment rates of older workers with poor health in 13 high-income countries changed between 2004-7 and 2012-15 using HRS/SHARE/ELSA data. We find that those in poor health in the USA have experienced a unique deterioration: they have not only seen a widening gap to the employment rates of those with good health, but their employment rates fell per se. We find only for Sweden (and possibly England) signs that the health employment gap shrank. We then examine possible explanations for the development in the USA: we find no evidence it links to labour market trends, but possible links to the USA’s lack of disability benefit reform – which should be considered alongside the wider challenges of our findings for policymakers.

H51|Assessing Public Expenditure Efficiency at Indian States|In recent times, the issue of public expenditure efficiency has drawn the attention of both policymakers and researchers globally. Even in India, with the increased demands for Outcome-based Budgeting, the assessment of public expenditure efficiency becomes much more crucial. Towards this direction, by using outlays-outcome framework, the pa-per attempts to measure the efficiency of government expenditures on Social Sector, es-pecially health and education, among the Indian States using various DEA approaches. Further, the paper also attempts to understand what drives the public expenditure effi-ciency among the States. For this, it looks at the role of economic growth as well as quality of governance. The results of input-oriented and output-oriented DEA approach finds a large variation in the efficiency of public spending as well as scope for resource saving among Indian States. The results suggest that States are spending their resources more efficiently on education than on health and overall social sector spending. Further, it also finds that both quality of governance and economic growth affects the efficiency of edu-cation, health, and social sector with governance to have larger effect compared to growth. Overall, the study suggests that focus on good governance could yield better out-comes from public spending.

H51|Estimating the Associations between SNAP and Food Insecurity, Obesity, and Food Purchases with Imperfect Administrative Measures of Participation|Administrative data are considered the “gold standard” when measuring program participation, but little evidence exists on their potential problems or implications for econometric estimates. We explore these issues using the FoodAPS, a unique data set containing two different administrative measures of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation and a survey‐based measure. We document substantial ambiguity in the two administrative measures and show that they disagree with each other almost as often as they disagree with self‐reported participation. Estimated participation and misreporting rates can be meaningfully sensitive to choices made to resolve this ambiguity and disagreement. We explore sensitivity in regression estimates of the associations between SNAP and food insecurity, obesity, and the healthy eating index. The signs are unchanged across the three measures, and the estimates are mostly not statistically different from each other. However, there are some meaningful differences in the magnitudes and levels of statistical significance of the estimates.
H51|Disease Control and Inequality Reduction: Evidence from a Tuberculosis Testing and Vaccination Campaign|This paper examines the economic impact of a tuberculosis control program launched in Norway in 1948. In the 1940s, Norway had one of the highest tuberculosis infection rates in Europe, affecting about 85 percent of the inhabitants. To lower the disease burden, the Norwegian government launched a large-scale tuberculosis testing and vaccination campaign that substantially reduced tuberculosis infection rates among children. We find that cohorts in school during and after the campaign in municipalities with high tuberculosis prevalence gained more in terms of education, earnings, longevity, and height following this public health intervention. Furthermore, the gains from the disease control program are not limited to the initially treated cohorts but also affect their children. The results also suggest that individuals from a low socioeconomic background benefited more from the intervention and we present new evidence that a narrowing of the gap in childhood health can lead to a reduction in socioeconomic inequalities in adulthood.
H51|Is Results-Based Aid More Effective than Conventional Aid?: Evidence from the Health Sector in El Salvador|Results-based aid (RBA) models link funds to outcomes, rather than paying for inputs. Despite their theoretical appeal and recent adoption by donors and multilateral development banks, there is limited empirical evidence supporting this form of aid for national governments. We estimate the effects of a RBA model using a natural experiment in El Salvador, where the same community health intervention was implemented in 98 municipalities using one of three financing models. The Salud Mesoamerica Initiative funded fourteen municipalities with a RBA model that partially conditions funds on the attainment of externally measured maternal and child health targets. Fifty-four municipalities funded inputs using conventional aid and thirty had national funds. Using a difference-in-difference approach and national health systems data we find that preventive health services increased by 19.8% in conventional aid municipalities and by 42% in RBA municipalities compared to national funds, suggesting that the results-based conditionality roughly doubled aid effectiveness. Effects are driven by increases in maternal and child preventive services incentivized by the RBA model. Rather than diverting resources from other populations, we find that the expansion of health services under RBA also benefited men and the elderly, not explicitly incentivized by the results model. While data on final health outcomes are not available, our results on proxy measures point to potential improvements in population health. The effects appear to have been driven by a more rapid expansion of health infrastructure and qualified personnel by motivated national authorities.
H51|Hit where it hurts – healthcare access and intimate partner violence|We exploit a change in the public healthcare entitlement of undocumented migrants in Spain to investigate the causal link between withdrawal of healthcare and changes in help-seeking behaviour of women experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). We contribute to the new literature modelling domestic violence by taking a novel look at the role of human capital in decisions to seek help when in violent relationships. We use a difference-in-differences (DiD) methodology to compare the number of foreign applicants for protection orders before and after the reform using Spanish applicants as the counterfactual. The impact of the reform was immediate; foreign applicants decreased by 16% after the health policy reform was introduced and this drop amounts to 19% in areas with stronger enforcement of the reform. We perform several robustness checks including addressing potential bias from migration changes after the reform. Our findings are important for current policy discussions on granting/limiting access to public programs for the undocumented population. We provide evidence that restricted access to the healthcare system can have unintended negative consequences for the most vulnerable groups of the population with potentially important spill-over effects to the next generation.
H51|The dark side of fiscal federalism:evidence from hospital care in Italy|We use 2009-14 data from patients hospital discharges to assess the effects of fiscal federalism on the quality of care provided to regional and extraregional patients in Lombardy. Empirical results suggest that even after controlling for hospital fixed effects, patients demographic and health characteristics, extraregional patients wait less compared to regional ones, stay longer in hospital and are associated with higher reimbursement costs. However, private and public hospitals with higher proportion of extraregional patients show a lower mortality and lower reimbursement costs. This result suggest that competition works because of the spillovers effects that the market for extraregional patients produces.
H51|Does the framing of patient cost-sharing incentives matter? The effects of deductibles vs. no-claim refunds|In light of increasing health care expenditures, patient cost-sharing schemes have emerged as one of the main policy tools to reduce medical spending. We show that the effect of patient cost-sharing schemes on health care expenditures is not only determined by the economic incentives they provide, but also by the way these economic incentives are framed. Patients react to changes in economic incentives almost twice as strongly under a deductible policy than under a no-claims refund policy. Our preferred explanation is that individuals are loss-averse and respond differently to both schemes because they perceive deductible payments as a loss and no-claim refunds as a gain.
H51|Growing Together: Assessing Equity and Effciency in an Early-Life Health Program in Chile| We estimate the impact of participation in Chile Crece Contigo (ChCC), ChileÂ’s flagship earlylife health and social welfare program, on neonatal health outcomes. We use administrative birth data matched to social benefits usage, and the staggered program roll-out, to identify the impact of participation. We find that this targeted social program had significant effects on birth weight (approximately 10 grams) and other early life human capital measures. These benefits are largest among the most socially vulnerable groups, however shift outcomes toward the middle of the distribution of health at birth. We show that program is efficient when compared to other successful neonatal health programs around the world, and find some evidence to suggest that maternal nutrition components and increased links to the social safety net are important mechanisms of action.
H51|The effect of health insurance reform: Evidence from China|This paper estimates the impact of a health insurance reform on health outcomes in urban China. Using the China Health and Nutrition Survey11This research uses data from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). We should thank the National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Carolina Population Centre, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the NIH (R01-HD30880, DK056350, and R01-HD38700) and the Fogarty International Centre, NIH for financial support for the CHNS data collection and analysis files from 1989 to 2006 and both parties plus the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health for support for CHNS 2009 and future surveys. we find that this reform increases the rate of health insurance coverage significantly among workers in Non-State Owned Enterprises. The double difference (DD) estimations show that the reform also leads to better health outcomes: workers are less likely to get sick and more likely to use preventive care. Using an instrumental variable (IV) approach to look at the causal effect of health insurance, we find those with health insurance use more preventive care but do not report significantly better health outcomes, an increase in health care utilisation, or an increase in out-of-pocket medical expenditure.
H51|The Effect of a Ban on Gender-Based Pricing on Risk Selection in the German Health Insurance Market|Starting from December 2012, insurers in the European Union were prohibited from charging gender-discriminatory prices. We examine the effect of this unisex mandate on risk segmentation in the German health insurance market. While gender used to be a pricing factor in Germany's private health insurance (PHI) sector, it was never used as a pricing factor in the social health insurance (SHI) sector. The unisex mandate makes PHI relatively more attractive for women and less attractive for men. Based on data from the SOEP we analyze how the unisex mandate affects the difference between women and men in switching rates between SHI and PHI. We find that the unisex mandate increases the probability of switching from SHI to PHI for women relative to men. This effect is strongest for self-employed individuals and mini-jobbers. On the other hand, the unisex mandate had no effect on the gender difference in switching rates from PHI to SHI. Because women have on average higher health care expenditures than men, our results imply a reduction of advantageous selection into PHI. Our results demonstrate that regulatory measures such as the unisex mandate can reduce risk selection between public and private health insurance sectors.
H51|Retirement and healthcare utilization|Pension systems and their reforms are often discussed in the context of financial viability. These debates grow in intensity with the aging of the population in industrialized countries. However, an increase in retirement age may create unintended side effects for retirees' health or healthcare costs. This paper empirically analyzes the effect of (early) retirement on individual inpatient and outpatient healthcare expenditure in Austria. We use comprehensive labor market and retirement data from the Austrian Social Security Database combined with detailed information about individual inpatient and outpatient healthcare service utilization for the province of Upper Austria. To account for the endogeneity in retirement decisions, we exploit exogenous variation in the early retirement age induced by two Austrian pension reforms in 2000 and 2003. We find significant negative effects of retirement on healthcare expenditure. For both sexes, retirement decreases subsequent expenditure for outpatient medical attendance and hospitalization. Analyses of disaggregated components of healthcare expenditure confirm a positive health effect caused by physical and emotional relief after retirement. Apart from direct health effects, the results also reveal behavioral changes in the utilization of healthcare services. These changes in health behavior seem in particular relevant for blue collar workers.
H51|Effect of measles outbreak on vaccination uptake|This paper explores the effects of a measles outbreak on vaccination uptake in Austria, using administrative data with individual-level information on childhood vaccinations. I define a treatment group of children affected by the outbreak, and compare them with a control group of earlier-born children who are unaffected. Twelve months after the outbreak, the vaccination rate of the treatment group is 2.5 (first dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine) and 4 (second dose) percentage points higher than the corresponding rates of the control group. The results do not indicate that families at increased risk respond more strongly, suggesting that the outbreak changed the perceived value of vaccinations across the whole population. Findings also reveal heterogeneity in the response of families based on the parents’ level of education, indicating that parents with higher education levels absorb new information more rapidly.
H51|The Effects of Social Health Insurance Expansion and Increased Choice on Perinatal Health and Health Care Use: Lessons from the Uruguayan Health Care Reform| In 2007 the Uruguayan government launched a reform aimed at expanding social health insurance to family-members of formal workers and to retirees. The policy increased insurance generosity -relative to the safety net alternative- and increased competition by allowing new beneficiaries to choose care from a set of private providers. Exploiting the phased-in implementation and the geographic variation in the intensity of the reform, we find that the expansion of social health insurance had a negligible effect on perinatal health and health care among adolescent mothers and their newborns. Our results do not support prior research showing health care quality improvements in settings with increased choice. We hypothesize that health care rationing by private providers due to rising wages, a smaller primary care infrastructure of private providers in low-income neighborhoods, and cultural and financial barriers may have accounted for the lack of positive effects.
H51|Modelling Time-Varying Income Elasticities of Health Care Expenditure for the OECD|Income elasticity dynamics of health expenditure is considered for the OECD and the Eurozone over the period 1995-2014. This paper studies a novel non-linear cointegration model with fixed effects, controlling for cross-section dependence and unobserved heterogeneity. Most importantly, its coefficients can vary over time and its variables can be non-stationary. The resulting asymptotic theory is fundamentally different with a faster rate of convergence to similar kernel smoothing methodologies. A fully modified kernel regression method is also proposed to reduce the asymptotic bias. Results show a steep increase in the income elasticity for the OECD and a small increase for the Eurozone.
H51|Targeting with In-Kind Transfers: Evidence from Medicaid Home Care|Making a transfer in kind reduces its value to recipients but can improve targeting. We develop an approach to quantifying this trade-off and apply it to home care. Using randomized experiments by Medicaid, we find that in-kind provision significantly reduces the value of the transfer to recipients while targeting a small fraction of the eligible population that is sicker and has fewer informal caregivers than the average eligible. Under a wide range of assumptions within a standard model, the targeting benefit exceeds the distortion cost. This highlights an important cost of recent reforms toward more flexible benefits.
H51|Inter-brand Competition in the Convenience Store Industry, Store Accessibility and Healthcare Utilization|We investigate the impact of access to convenience stores and competition between convenience store chains on medical care use and expenditures in Taiwan; the country with the highest density of convenience stores in the world. Our study makes use of insurance claims from 0.85 million individuals enrolled in Taiwan’s national health insurance program from 2002-2012 and administrative data on convenience store chain sales. While we find that both greater store accessibility and higher levels of inter-brand competition reduce the use and cost of outpatient medical services and prescription drugs, healthcare utilization is more responsive to changes in competition. Since convenience stores in Taiwan are typically the healthier option for ready-to-eat food, we postulate that the decline in medical care utilization is driven by a reduction in convenience store prices and increase in service quality relative to other food outlets. This is supported by findings from survey data indicating that convenience store competition is associated with greater consumption of more healthy foods, lower consumption of less healthy foods, and decreases in obesity rates. While the effects we find are precisely estimated, they are small in magnitude, with the increase in convenience store competition experienced by Taiwan over a 10-year period reducing medical expenditures on outpatient services and on prescription drugs by around one half of one percent.

H51|Does When You Die Depend on Where You Live? Evidence from Hurricane Katrina|We follow Medicare cohorts over time and space to estimate Hurricane Katrina's long-run mortality effects on elderly and disabled victims initially living in New Orleans. Inclusive of the initial shock, the hurricane improved survival eight years past the storm by 1.74 percentage points. Migration to lower-mortality regions explains most of this survival increase. Migrants to low- versus high-mortality regions look similar at baseline, but migrants’ subsequent mortality is 0.83-0.90 percentage points lower for each percentage-point reduction in local mortality, quantifying causal effects of place on mortality among this population. By contrast, migrants’ mortality is unrelated to local Medicare spending.
H51|The Human Side of Austerity: Health Spending and Outcomes During the Greek Crisis|The Greek crisis was the most severe in postwar Europe; its budget cuts were the deepest. Among the components of the budget, health spending was hit particularly hard, declining by more than one third in just five years. This paper has two goals: establish the facts about health inputs, outputs and outcomes during the Greek crisis, and explore the connection between budget cuts and health outcomes. Health spending and inputs were very high in Greece before the crisis: in several dimensions, even after the budget cuts were implemented health spending and inputs were still at or near the top of the European countries; in other cases they merely went back to the European average. Nevertheless, budget cuts so deep and so sudden are unlikely to merely cut into inefficiencies and overcapacities. I highlight several areas in which a comparative quantitative analysis suggests that budget cuts might have had an appreciable effects on the health of the population.
H51|Supplemental Security Income and Child Outcomes: Evidence from Birth Weight Eligibility Cutoffs|Low birth weight infants born to mothers with low educational attainment have a double hurdle to overcome in the production of human capital. We examine whether income transfers in the form of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments for children with disabilities can help close the gap in outcomes due to this initial health and environmental disadvantage. We exploit a discontinuity in SSI eligibility at 1200 grams and use a regression discontinuity approach to produce causal estimates of the effects of SSI eligibility. We find that eligibility increases disability benefit participation, improves child outcomes and parenting behaviors, and shifts maternal labor supply from full to part time.
H51|Long-Term Care Hospitals: A Case Study in Waste|There is substantial waste in U.S. healthcare, but little consensus on how to identify or combat it. We identify one specific source of waste: long-term care hospitals (LTCHs). These post-acute care facilities began as a regulatory carve-out for a few dozen specialty hospitals, but have expanded into an industry with over 400 hospitals and $5.4 billion in annual Medicare spending in 2014. We use the entry of LTCHs into local hospital markets and an event study design to estimate LTCHs’ impact. We find that most LTCH patients would have counterfactually received care at Skilled Nursing Facilities – post-acute care facilities that provide medically similar care to LTCHs but are paid significantly less – and that substitution to LTCHs leaves patients unaffected or worse off on all dimensions we can objectively measure. Our results imply that Medicare could save about $4.6 billion per year – with no harm to patients – by not allowing for discharge to LTCHs.
H51|Medicare Payment to Skilled Nursing Facilities: The Consequences of the Three-Day Rule|Medicare does not pay for a skilled nursing facility (SNF) unless a fee-for-service patient has stayed in the hospital for at least three days. Discharges after the three-day cutoff consistently result in more transfers to SNFs. Using the three-day rule as an instrument, we find that SNF discharges decrease hospital readmission for patients with comorbidities. However, for knee and hip replacement patients, we find significant increases in readmission. This perverse effect is more severe when local SNFs have lower quality. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the three-day rule may have generated extra Medicare payments to SNFs by $100-447 million per year.
H51|A Test of Supply-side Explanations of Geographic Variation in Health Care Use|Evidence of regional variation in health care utilization has been well-documented over the past 40 years. Yet uncertainty persists about whether this variation is primarily the result of supply-side or demand-side forces, and the difference matters for both theory and policy. In this article, we provide new evidence as to the cause of geographic variation in health care utilization. We do so by examining changes in health care use by the near-elderly as they transition from being uninsured into Medicare. Results provide support for a causal supply-side explanation of regional variation. Estimates indicate that gaining Medicare coverage in above-median spending regions increases the probability of at least one hospital visit by 36% and the probability of having more than five doctor visits by 25% relative to similar individuals in below-median spending regions.
H51|Mortality Risk, Insurance, and the Value of Life|We develop a new framework for valuing health and longevity improvements that departs from conventional but unrealistic assumptions of full annuitization and deterministic health. Our framework can value the prevention of mortality and of illness, and it can quantify the effects of retirement policies on the value of life. We apply the framework to life-cycle data and generate new insights absent from the conventional approach. First, treatment is up to five times more valuable than prevention, even when both extend life equally. This asymmetry helps explain low observed investment in preventive care. Second, severe illness can significantly increase the value of statistical life, helping to reconcile theory with empirical findings that consumers value life-extension more in bleaker health states. Third, retirement annuities boost aggregate demand for life-extension. We calculate that Social Security adds $10.6 trillion (11 percent) to the value of post-1940 longevity gains and would add $127 billion to the value of a one percent decline in future mortality.
H51|The Effects of Medicaid Expansion on Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from Border Counties|This paper provides new empirical evidence on the employment and earning effects of the recent Medicaid expansion. Unlike most existing studies that use a conventional state and year fixed effects approach, our main identification strategy is based on the comparison of employment and wages in contiguous county-pairs in neighboring states (i.e. border counties) with different Medicaid expansion status. Using the 2008-2016 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, we estimate a set of distributed lag models in order to examine the dynamic effects of Medicaid expansion. Results from our preferred specification suggest a small but statistically significant decrease in employment of 1.3 percent one year after the Medicaid expansion. This disemployment effect is transitory and appears to primarily occur in low-wage sectors. In particular, employment returns to pre-expansion levels within two years. We also do not find any statistically significant effect of the Medicaid expansion on wages at any point.
H51|The Impact of Insurance Expansions on the Already Insured: The Affordable Care Act and Medicare|Some states that have not adopted the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions have stated concerns that the expansions may impair access to care and utilization for those who are already insured. We investigate such negative spillovers using a large panel of Medicare beneficiaries. Across many subgroups and outcomes, we find no evidence that the expansions reduced utilization among Medicare beneficiaries, and can rule out all but very small changes in utilization or spending. These results suggest that the expansions in Medicaid did not impair access to care or utilization for the Medicare population.
H51|Patient vs. Provider Incentives in Long-Term Care|How do patient and provider incentives affect mode and cost of long-term care? Our analysis of 1 million nursing home stays yields three main insights. First, Medicaid-covered residents prolong their stays instead of transitioning to community-based care due to limited cost-sharing. Second, nursing homes shorten Medicaid stays when capacity binds to admit more profitable out-of-pocket payers. Third, providers react more elastically to financial incentives than patients, so moving to episode-based provider reimbursement is more effective in shortening Medicaid stays than increasing resident cost-sharing. Moreover, we do not find evidence for health improvements due to longer stays for marginal Medicaid beneficiaries.
H51|Two Hundred Years of Health and Medical Care: The Importance of Medical Care for Life Expectancy Gains|Using two hundred years of national and Massachusetts data on medical care and health, we examine how central medical care is to life expectancy gains. While common theories about medical care cost growth stress growing demand, our analysis highlights the importance of supply side factors, including the major public investments in research, workforce training and hospital construction that fueled a surge in spending over the 1955-1975 span. There is a stronger case that personal medicine affected health in the second half of the twentieth century than in the preceding 150 years. Finally, we consider whether medical care productivity decreases over time, and find that spending increased faster than life expectancy, although the ratio stabilized in the past two decades.
H51|The Effect of Economic Conditions on the Disability Insurance Program: Evidence from the Great Recession|We examine the effect of cyclical job displacement during the Great Recession on the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program. Exploiting variation in the severity and timing of the recession across states, we estimate the effect of unemployment on SSDI applications and awards. We find the Great Recession induced nearly one million SSDI applications that otherwise would not have been filed, of which 41.8 percent were awarded benefits, resulting in over 400,000 new beneficiaries who made up 8.9 percent of all SSDI entrants between 2008-2012. More than one-half of the recession-induced awards were made on appeal. The induced applicants had less severe impairments than the average applicant. Only 9 percent had the most severe, automatically-qualifying impairments, 33 percent had functional impairments and no transferable skills, and the rest were denied for having insufficiently severe impairments and/or transferable skills. Our estimates imply the Great Recession increased claims processing costs by $2.960 billion during 2008-2012, and SSDI benefit obligations by $55.730 billion in present value, or $97.365 billion including both SSDI and Medicare benefits.
H51|An Analysis of the Presidentâ€™s 2019 Budget|The cumulative deficit under the Presidentâ€™s policies would total $9.5 trillion over the 2019â€“2028 period, $2.9 trillion less than in CBO's baseline. Over that period, the deficit would range from 3.2 percent to 4.5 percent of GDP, averaging 3.7 percent. As a result, federal debt held by the public would increase from 78 percent of GDP this year to 86 percent in 2028.
H51|The 2018 Long-Term Budget Outlook|In CBOâ€™s projections, federal budget deficits grow substantially over the next several years in relation to the size of the economy, stabilize for a few years, and then grow again over the rest of the 30-year period. If current laws generally remained unchanged, the growing deficits would raise federal debt held by the public from 78 percent of gross domestic product this year to nearly 100 percent by the end of the next decade and 152 percent by 2048.
H51|Possible Higher Spending Paths for Veterans' Benefits|The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers a variety of programs for veterans and their families. Measured in 2018 dollars, VA spent $180 billion on those benefits in 2017, nearly triple what it spent in 2000 after removing the effects of inflation. To help policymakers assess the risks associated with higher costs, this report presents projections of VAâ€™s spending through 2028 under three scenarios, a modified version of CBOâ€™s baseline and two alternative scenarios involving more rapid spending growth.
H51|Sustainable Reimbursements: Towards a Unified Framework for Pricing Drugs with Significant Uncertainties|Recent political events have thrust the bulk negotiation of drug prices by Medicare and Medicaid back into the spotlight. Yet, even if politically feasible, there is no clear framework for negotiating prices of new drugs with uncertain target populations—for example, due to imprecise estimates or off-label use—or uncertain clinical effects—for example, due to heterogeneous patient response. We create such a framework using two-price programs developed in the economics of procurement literature. This framework delivers new payment strategies, and unifying them with theoretical advances in pharmaceutical reimbursement like capitation and value-based pricing. Two-price programs substantially reduce uncertainty for both payers and pharmaceutical companies, while still creating financial incentives for those companies that innovate and create value for patients.
H51|Patient vs. Provider Incentives in Long Term Care|How do patient and provider incentives affect mode and cost of long-term care? Our analysis of 1 million nursing home stays yields three main insights. First, Medicaid-covered residents prolong their stays instead of transitioning to community-based care due to limited cost-sharing. Second, nursing homes shorten Medicaid stays when capacity binds to admit more profitable out-of-pocket payers. Third, providers react more elastically to financial incentives than patients, so moving to episode-based provider reimbursement is more effective in shortening Medicaid stays than increasing resident cost-sharing. Moreover, we do not find evidence for health improvements due to longer stays for marginal Medicaid beneficiaries.
H51|The determinants of health care expenditure growth|Understanding the drivers of growth in health care expenditure is crucial for forecasting future health care requirements and to ameliorate inefficient expenditure. This paper considers the detailed breakdown of hospital inpatient expenditures across the period 2007/08 to 2014/15. Decomposition techniques are used to unpick the observed rise in expenditure into a component due to a change in the distribution of characteristics, for example, greater prevalence of morbidity, and a component due to structural changes in the impact of such characteristics on expenditures (coefficient effects, for example, due to technological change). This is undertaken at the mean using standard decomposition techniques, but also across the full distribution of expenditures to gain an understanding of where in the distribution growth and its determinants are most relevant. Decomposition at the mean indicates a larger role for a structural change in characteristics rather than a change in coefficients. A key driver is an increased prevalence of comorbidities. When considering the full distribution we observe a decrease in expenditure at the bottom of the distribution (bottom two quintiles) but increasing expenditure thereafter. The largest increases are observed at the top of the expenditure distribution. Where changes in structural characteristics dominate changes in coefficients in explaining the rise in expenditure. Increases in comorbidities (and the average number of first diagnoses) across the two periods, together with increases in non-elective long stay episodes and non-elective bed days are important drivers of expenditure increases.
H51|Precios máximos de venta en el mercado de medicamentos colombiano: una evaluación de impacto|Este artículo evalúa el impacto de una regulación por precios techo aplicados en el sector farmacéutico colombiano entre 2011 y 2014. Por medio de un modelo de triples diferencias y la utilización de datos panel, se exploran tres fuentes de variación: i) la existencia de 18 grupos de medicamentos según el sistema de clasificación de fármacos de la OMS Anatomica. Therapeutic Chemical (ATC), ii) la existencia medicamentos regulados (tratamiento) y y no-regulados (control) dentro de cada uno de los 18 ATC y iii) la comparación antes y después de la regulación. Se incluyen efectos fijos de tiempo y se utilizan errores tipo cluster. Se encuentra que la regulación por precios techos solo logró reducir los precios en 3 de los 18 grupos estudiados y aumentó para 10 de ellos. Se confirma entonces que el efecto punto focal de los precios techos puede desvirtuar este tipo de regulación. En el caso estudiado, la regulación por precios techos ha contribuido en aumentar los gastos en medicamentos de 30% sobre los 18 grupos ATC consideradas.
H51|Clusters Of International Eq-5d Health-States Valuations|PURPOSE: Countries without EQ-5D general-population surveys might use valuations from another country with similar health valuations. This study aimed to identify whether there are groups of countries with similar health-state valuations. METHODS: A cluster analysis was performed for the 242 states of the EQ-5D valuations for 23 studies in 18 countries, excluding the perfect-health state. Clusters were identified by means of the Ward algorithm with the Euclidean measure and hierarchical clustering. RESULTS: 5 clusters were identified. Valuations are sensitive to the preference elicitation methodology. Some countries in the same cluster have cultural similarities but a particular cluster included otherwise dissimilar countries and methodologies. Using the states associated to diabetes and breast cancer, the choice of cluster is shown to be relevant for cost-utility analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Health-state valuations tend to be clustered in a few groups of countries. The clusters found might be useful for performing cost-utility analysis in countries without such valuations.
H51|Causes of regional variation in Dutch healthcare expenditures: evidence from movers|We assess the relative importance of demand and supply factors as determinants of regional variation in healthcare expenditures in the Netherlands. Our empirical approach follows individuals who migrate between regions. We use individual data on annual healthcare expenditures for the entire Dutch population between the years 2006 and 2013. Regional variation in healthcare expenditures is mostly driven by demand factors, with an estimated share of around 70%. Both demographics and other unobserved demand factors, e.g. patient preferences, are important components of the demand share. The relative importance of different causes varies with the groups of regions being compared.
H51|Does the Framing of Patient Cost-Sharing Incentives Matter? The Effects of Deductibles vs. No-Claim Refunds|In light of increasing health care expenditures, patient cost-sharing schemes have emerged as one of the main policy tools to reduce medical spending. We show that the effect of patient cost-sharing schemes on health care expenditures is not only determined by the economic incentives they provide, but also by the way these economic incentives are framed. Patients react to changes in economic incentives almost twice as strongly under a deductible policy than under a no-claims refund policy. Our preferred explanation is that individuals are loss-averse and respond differently to both schemes because they perceive deductible payments as a loss and no-claim refunds as a gain.
H51|The human side of austerity: health spending and outcomes during the Greek crisis|The Greek crisis was the most severe in postwar Europe; its budget cuts were the deepest. Among the components of the budget, health spending was hit particularly hard, declining by more than one third in just five years. This paper has two goals: establish the facts about health inputs, outputs and outcomes during the Greek crisis, and explore the connection between budget cuts and health outcomes. Health spending and inputs were very high in Greece before the crisis: in several dimensions, even after the budget cuts were implemented health spending and inputs were still at or near the top of the European countries; in other cases they merely went back to the European average. Nevertheless, budget cuts so deep and so sudden are unlikely to merely cut into inefficiencies and overcapacities. I highlight several areas in which a comparative quantitative analysis suggests that budget cuts might have had an appreciable effects on the health of the population.
H51|Electoral cycle bias in the media coverage of corruption news|We investigate the existence of an ‘electoral cycle bias’ in the timing of media coverage of news with high political salience. In particular, we analyze how the electoral cycles at the regional level influence the coverage of news about corruption scandals in the Italian Regional Health Systems by two important national newspapers having opposite ideology, La Repubblica (left-wing oriented) and Il Giornale (right-wing oriented). Our findings show that Il Giornalesignificantly increases the number of articles about corruption scandals involving left-wing politicians since eight weeks before the elections, while it reduces the number of those about episodes of corruption without any political connection. On the contrary, La Repubblica increases the number of articles about episodes involving right-wing politicians only between four to eight weeks before the elections and it decreases those about no political episodes just the week right before them.
H51|Growing Together: Assessing Equity and Efficiency in an Early-Life Health Program in Chile|We study the mechanism of action of an early-life social safety net program, and quantify its impact on child health outcomes at birth. We consider both the equity and efficiency implications of program impacts, and provide a metric to compare various such programs around the world. In particular, we estimate the impact of participation in Chile Crece Contigo (ChCC), Chile's flagship early-life health and social welfare program, using administrative birth data matched to social benefits usage. We find that this targeted social program had significant effects on birth weight (approximately 10 grams) and other early life human capital measures. These benefits are largest among the most socially vulnerable groups, however shift outcomes toward the middle of the distribution of health at birth. We show that the program is efficient when compared to other successful neonatal health programs around the world, and find some evidence to suggest that maternal nutrition components and increased links to the social safety net are important mechanisms of action.
H51|The Effect of a Ban on Gender-Based Pricing on Risk Selection in the German Health Insurance Market|Starting from December 2012, insurers in the European Union were prohibited from charging gender-discriminatory prices. We examine the effect of this unisex mandate on risk segmentation in the German health insurance market. While gender used to be a pricing factor in Germany’s private health insurance (PHI) sector, it was never used as a pricing factor in the social health insurance (SHI) sector. The unisex mandate makes PHI relatively more attractive for women and less attractive for men. Based on data from the SOEP we analyze how the unisex mandate affects the difference between women and men in switching rates between SHI and PHI. We find that the unisex mandate increases the probability of switching from SHI to PHI for women relative to men. This effect is strongest for self-employed individuals and mini-jobbers. On the other hand, the unisex mandate had no effect on the gender difference in switching rates from PHI to SHI. Because women have on average higher health care expenditures than men, our results imply a reduction of advantageous selection into PHI. Our results demonstrate that regulatory measures such as the unisex mandate can reduce risk selection between public and private health insurance sectors.
H51|The stimulative effect of an unconditional block grant on the decentralized provision of care|Understanding the impact of central government grants on decentralized healthcare provision is of crucial importance for the design of grant systems, yet empirical evidence on the prevalence of flypaper effects in this domain is rare. We study the decentralization of home care in the Netherlands and exploit the gradual introduction of formula-based equalization to identify the effect of exogenous changes in an unconditional block grant on local expenditure and utilization. A one euro increase in central government grants raises local expenditure by twenty to fifty cents. Adjustments occur through the number of hours as well as through substitution between basic and more advanced types of assistance. These findings suggest that conditioning of grants is not required for the central government to retain a moderate degree of control over the decentralized provision of care.
H51|Hospital Choice in the NHS|We study hospital choice in the publicly funded National Health Service in England, using a two sample strategy to identify a structural model of demand for elective procedures. In the NHS patients are allowed to opt out from the market of free-of-charge public hospitals and choose a private provider; we find that the outside option has an important effect on competition, patient choice and elasticities compared with traditional models ignoring the private sector. Considering endogeneity of waiting-time, proper measures of quality and the existence of private sector, we find substantially different policy conclusions compared to existing hospital demand models.
H51|Illicit drugs and the decline of the middle class|Empirical evidence for the U.S. suggests that the consumption of intoxicants increases in association with the socio-economic deprivation of the middle-class. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we set up a task-based labor market model with endogenous mental health status and a health care system. The decline of tasks that were historically performed by the middle class and the associated decline in relative wages and socio-economic status increases the share of mentally ill middle class workers. Mentally ill workers can mitigate their hardships by the intake of illicit drugs or by consuming health goods. We argue that explaining the drug epidemic of the U.S. middle class requires an interaction of socio-economic decline and falling opioid prices. One factor in isolation is typically insufficient. Our analysis also points to a central role of the health care system. In our model, extending mental health care could motivate the mentally ill to abstain from illicit drug consumption.
H51|Do higher hospital reimbursement prices improve quality of care?|Does higher medical spending improve quality of care? We estimate the effect of changes in regulated reimbursement prices for hospitals on multiple dimensions of hospital quality, including mortality outcomes, surgical complications, process quality, and patient satisfaction. We exploit an exogenous variation in reimbursement prices between the years 2006 and 2010 based on a reform of hospital financing in Germany. We find that changes in reimbursement prices do not affect quality of care. This effect is precisely estimated, and we can rule out effect sizes that are large relative to the overall variation in quality indicators across hospitals.
H51|Retirement and healthcare utilization|Pension systems and reforms thereof are often discussed in the context of financial viability. In industrialized countries, these debates grow in intensity with the aging of the population; however, an increase in retirement age may create unintended side effects with regards to retiree health or healthcare costs. This study empirically analyzes the effect of (early) retirement on individual inpatient and outpatient healthcare expenditure in Austria. We use comprehensive labor market and retirement data from the Austrian Social Security Database, together with detailed information about individual inpatient and outpatient healthcare service utilization in the province of Upper Austria. To account for endogeneity in retirement decisions, we exploit exogenous variation in the early retirement age as induced by two Austrian pension reforms (i.e., those in 2000 and 2003). We find there to be significant negative effects of retirement on healthcare expenditure. For both genders, retirement reduces subsequent expenditure for outpatient medical attendance and hospitalization. Analyses of disaggregated components of healthcare expenditure confirm a positive health effect caused by physical and emotional relief following retirement. Apart from direct health effects, the results also reveal behavioral changes in the utilization of healthcare services. These changes in health behavior seem particularly relevant among blue-collar workers.
H51|Inequity in healthcare use among older people after 2008: The case of southern European countries|Despite the sizeable cuts in public healthcare spending, which were part of the austerity measures recently undertaken in Southern European countries, little attention has been devoted to monitoring its distributional consequences in terms of healthcare use. This study aims at measuring socioeconomic inequities in primary and secondary healthcare use experienced some time after the crisis onset in Italy, Spain and Portugal. The analysis, based on data drawn from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), focuses on older people, who generally face significantly higher healthcare needs, and whose health appeared to have worsened in the aftermath of the crisis. The Horizontal Inequity indexes reveal remarkable socioeconomic inequities in older people’s access to secondary healthcare in all three countries. In Portugal, the one country facing most severe healthcare budget cuts and where user charges apply also to GP visits, even access to primary care exhibits a significant pro-rich concentration. If reducing inequities in older people’s access to healthcare remains a policy objective, austerity measures maybe pulling the Olive belt countries further away from achieving it.
H51|The health benefits of a targeted cash transfer: The UK Winter Fuel Payment|Each year, the UK records 25,000 or more excess winter deaths, primarily among the elderly. A key policy response is the “Winter Fuel Payment” (WFP), a labelled but unconditional cash transfer to households with a member above the female state pension age. The WFP has been shown to raise fuel spending among eligible households. We examine the causal effect of the WFP on health outcomes, including self‐reports of chest infection, measured hypertension, and biomarkers of infection and inflammation. We find a robust, 6 percentage point reduction in the incidence of high levels of serum fibrinogen. Reductions in other disease markers point to health benefits, but the estimated effects are less robust.
H51|The Good Outcomes of Bad News. A Randomized Field Experiment on Formatting Breast Cancer Screening Invitations|We ran a population-level randomized field experiment to ascertain whether a costless manipulation of the informational content (restricted or enhanced information) and the framing (gain or loss framing) of the invitation letter to the national breast cancer screening program affects the take-up rate. Our experiment involved more than 6,000 women aged 50-69 targeted by the screening program of the Province of Messina in Sicily, randomly assigned to receive different invitation letter formats. Using administrative data from the Local Health Authority archives, we show that giving enhanced loss-framed information about the risks of not having a mammography increases take-up rate by about 25 percent with respect to all other treatments (no information; restricted gain-framed information; restricted loss-framed information; enhanced gain-framed information). Results are stronger for subjects living farther away from the screening site. For them, the manipulation may indicate higher perceived risks of negative outcomes that makes it worthwhile to participate in the screening program, in spite of longer travel time.
H51|Maternal education and childhood immunization in Turkey|We study the causal effect of maternal education on childhood immunization rates. We use the Compulsory Education Law of 1997, and the differentiation in its implementation across regions, as instruments for schooling of young mothers in Turkey. The Compulsory Education Law increased the compulsory years of schooling of those born after 1986 from 5 to 8 years. We find that education of mothers increases the probability of completing the full course of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus and Hepatitis B vaccinations for their children. The results are robust to variations in regression specification and including various individual and community variables.
H51|Ambulatory care at the end of a billing period|The ambulatory physician payment system in the German Social Health Insurance (SHI) offers incentives to reduce practice activity at the end of a billing period. Most services within a period are reimbursed at full cost only up to a certain threshold. Furthermore, capitated payments make follow-up treatments within a billing period less profitable. Using claims data from Germany's largest sickness fund with about nine million members, we find a decrease of all services limited by a threshold at the end of a billing period and an immediate increase at the beginning of the following period. For services that are not limited, we do not find an effect. An increase of ambulatory emergencies at the end of a billing period suggests a negative welfare effect for patients.
H51|The Economic Burden of Chronic Diseases: Estimates and Projections for China, Japan, and South Korea|We propose a novel framework to analyse the macroeconomic impact of noncommunicable diseases. We incorporate measures of disease prevalence into a human capital augmented production function, which enables us to determine the economic costs of chronic health conditions in terms of foregone gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike previously adopted frameworks, this approach allows us to account for i) variations in human capital for workers in different age groups, ii) mortality and morbidity effects of non-communicable diseases, and iii) the treatment costs of diseases. We apply our methodology to China, Japan, and South Korea, and estimate the economic burden of chronic conditions in five domains (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases, diabetes, and mental health conditions). Overall, total losses associated with these non-communicable diseases over the period 2010-2030 are $16 trillion for China (measured in real USD with the base year 2010), $5.7 trillion for Japan, and $1.5 trillion for South Korea. Our results also highlight the limits of cost-effectiveness analysis by identifying some intervention strategies to reduce disease prevalence in China that are cost beneficial and therefore a rational use of resources, though they are not cost-effective as judged by conventional thresholds.
H51|Causes of regional variation in healthcare utilization in Germany|Healthcare utilization varies widely between regions. Yet, the causes of regional variation are still not well understood, and they can also differ between countries and institutional settings. We exploit patient migration to examine which share of regional variation in ambulatory care use in Germany can be attributed to demand factors and to supply factors, respectively. Based on administrative claim-level data we find that regional variation can be overwhelmingly explained by patient characteristics. Our results contrast with previous results for other countries, and they suggest that institutional rules in Germany successfully constrain supply-side variation in ambulatory care use between German regions.
H51|Introducing risk adjustment and free health plan choice in employer-based health insurance: Evidence from Germany|To equalize differences in health plan premiums due to differences in risk pools, the German legislature introduced a simple Risk Adjustment Scheme (RAS) based on age, gender and disability status in 1994. In addition, effective 1996, consumers gained the freedom to choose among hundreds of existing health plans, across employers and state-borders. This paper (a) estimates RAS pass-through rates on premiums, financial reserves, and expenditures and assesses the overall RAS impact on market price dispersion. Moreover, it (b) characterizes health plan switchers and investigates their annual and cumulative switching rates over time. Our main findings are based on representative enrollee panel data linked to administrative RAS and health plan data. We show that sickness funds with bad risk pools and high pre-RAS premiums lowered their total premiums by 42 cents per additional euro allocated by the RAS. Consequently, post-RAS, health plan prices converged but not fully. Because switchers are more likely to be white collar, young and healthy, the new consumer choice resulted in more risk segregation and the amount of money redistributed by the RAS increased over time.
H51|Plan responses to diagnosis-based payment: Evidence from Germany’s morbidity-based risk adjustment|Many competitive health insurance markets adjust payments to participating health plans according to their enrollees’ risk − including based on diagnostic information. We investigate responses of German health plans to the introduction of morbidity-based risk adjustment in the Statutory Health Insurance in 2009, which triggers payments based on “validated” diagnoses by providers. Using the regulator’s data from office-based physicians, we estimate a difference-in-difference analysis of the change in the share and number of validated diagnoses for ICD codes that are inside or outside the risk adjustment but are otherwise similar. We find a differential increase in the share of validated diagnoses of 2.6 and 3.6 percentage points (3–4%) between 2008 and 2013. This increase appears to originate from both a shift from not-validated toward validated diagnoses and an increase in the number of such diagnoses. Overall, our results indicate that plans were successful in influencing physicians’ coding practices in a way that could lead to higher payments.
H51|The Effect of Public Sector Development Expenditures and Investment on Economic Growth: Evidence from Pakistan|It is an established fact that there is strong association between investment and economic growth of a country but no such direct consensus had been developed on the type of investment. i.e. what are the different sectors in which investment has led to long term impact and did contributed to the growth. The current study in this regard will focus on investigating the relationship of Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Private Investment with the growth. The study will use data from 1980-81 to 2015-16 in this regard and employ Johansen cointegration to investigate the long run relationship. It is found that with foreign direct investment, health expenditure and transport and communication expenditure has negative relationship in the long run. Where as private investment, education expenditure and expenditure on housing has positive relationship with growth. Based on these findings recommendations were totally investment centric with primary focus on reduction in taxes and other barriers to bring in more investment in long run. Beside taxation, recommendations were made on administrative balance both in tax system and public sectors which were made part of provincial domain after 18th amendment.
H51|Closing the Gap: The Impact of the Medicaid Primary Care Rate Increase on Access and Health|The difficulties that Medicaid beneficiaries face accessing medical care are often attributed to the program’s low reimbursement rates relative to other payers. There is little evidence, however, as to the actual effects of Medicaid payment rates for providers on access and health outcomes for beneficiaries. In this paper, we exploit time-series variation in Medicaid reimbursement rates primarily driven by the Medicaid fee bump—a provision of the Affordable Care Act mandating that states raise Medicaid payments to match Medicare rates for primary care visits for 2013 and 2014—to quantify the impact of physician payment on access to treatment. As Medicaid rates are set by states and vary considerably in generosity, the policy had large and heterogeneous impacts across states. We find that increasing Medicaid payments to primary care doctors is associated with improvements in access, better self-reported health, and fewer school days missed among beneficiaries.
H51|Macroeconomic effects of Medicare|This paper develops an overlapping generations model to study the macroeconomic effects of an unexpected elimination of Medicare. We find that a large share of the elderly respond by substituting Medicaid for Medicare. Consequently, the government saves only 46 cents for every dollar cut in Medicare spending. We argue that a comparison of steady states is insufficient to evaluate the welfare effects of the reform. In particular, we find lower ex-ante welfare gains from eliminating Medicare when we account for the costs of transition. Lastly, we find that a majority of the current population benefits from the reform but that aggregate welfare, measured as the dollar value of the sum of wealth equivalent variations, is higher with Medicare.
H51|Local Competition and Physicians’ Pricing Decisions: New Evidence from France|More than 40% of French specialist practitioners are able to balance bill their patients. We examine the determinants of their choice to switch or not to an optional system of self-limitation of fees in exchange for subsidies, and the role in particular of local competition. We use a logit model with data on 5568 gynecologists, ophthalmologists and pediatricians, in years 2012 and 2016. We find that their decision is guided primarily by their characteristics such as their initial price or type of practice, and the share of patients that they can balance bill. The local competitive environment does not have a significant impact on the pricing decisions of private physicians. Therefore, governments that want to limit balance billing need to apply a mandatory ceiling rather than introducing an optional system.
H51|The Impact of Joint Commission International Healthcare Accreditation on Infection Control Performance: A Study in Dubai Hospital|"""Objective – The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Vision 2021 aims to achieve a world-class healthcare system and the national agenda has set multiple Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to accomplish accreditation by all healthcare facilities in the country by 2021. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation on Infection Control (IC) KPIs in Dubai Hospital (DH). Methodology/Technique – A longitudinal case study covering 2007 to 2013 was conducted to examine this impact based on secondary data of the KPIs during this period and semi-structured interviews with senior health officials. Findings – The study reveals that the healthcare accreditation acts as a catalyst for implementing and monitoring changes but it also underscores some challenges. It proposes recommendations such as improving surveillance systems, ensuring proper resources allocation, and undertaking further research.

H51|Modeling the Effect of Healthcare Expenditure and Education Expenditure on Labour Productivity: A Study on OIC Countries|"""Objective – The possibility of healthcare expenditure and education expenditure are becoming a thought-provoking issue for numerous governments globally, in spite of the fact that healthcare is unique and vital rudiments of well-being. On the other hand, education is the strength and spinal column of ground-breaking thoughts. Nevertheless, with an ageing population and ballooning protracted health difficulties, the preservation of the quality of life demands improved healthcare and education expenditure on the part of government. However, this study scrutinizes the effect of healthcare expenditure and education expenditure on labour productivity using Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries as a case study. Methodology/Technique – The research utilized pooled-panel data method with data from 1990 to 2015. Findings – The result of the findings shows that there is the statistical significant relationship between healthcare expenditure, education expenditure and labour productivity in OIC countries. Novelty – Research suggests that healthcare and education is a mechanism to stimulate the productivity of labour in OIC countries."""
H51|Is American Health Care Uniquely Inefficient? Evidence from Prescription Drugs|"Alan Garber and Jonathan Skinner (2008) famously conjectured that the US health care system was ""uniquely inefficient"" relative to other countries. We test this idea using cross-country data on prescription drug sales newly linked with an arguably objective measure of relative therapeutic benefits, or drug quality. Specifically, we investigate how higher and lower quality drugs diffuse in the US relative to Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and the UK. Our tabulations suggest that lower quality drugs diffuse more in the US relative to high quality drugs compared to each of our four comparison countries--consistent with Garber and Skinner's conjecture."
H51|Private Health Investments under Competing Risks: Evidence from Malaria Control in Senegal|This study exploits the introduction of high subsidies for anti-malaria products in Senegal in 2009 to investigate if malaria prevents parents to invest in child health. Building upon the seminal paper of Dowetal. (1999), we develop a simple model of health investments under competing mortality risks, in which people allocate expenses to equalize lifetime across all causes of death. We predict that private health investments to fight malaria as well as other diseases should increase in response to anti-malaria public interventions. To test this prediction, we use original panel data from a Senegalese household survey combined with geographical information on malaria prevalence. Our strategy is to compare the evolution of child health expenditures before and after anti-malaria interventions, between malarious and non-malarious regions of Senegal. We find that health expenditures in malarious regions catch up with non-malarious regions, at the extensive and intensive margins, and both in level and in composition. The same result holds for parental health-seeking behaviour in case of other diseases like diarrhea. We provide evidence that these patterns cannot be explained by differential trends in total income or access to health care or child morbidity between malarious and non-malarious regions. Our results suggest that behavioural responses to anti-malaria campaigns magnify their impact on all-cause mortality for children.
H51|Paying Patients for Prenatal Care: The Effect of a Small Cash Transfer on Stillbirths and Survival|We study the effects of conditional cash transfers to pregnant women on stillbirths and child survival in Bolivia. Payments are conditional on compliance with medically recommended prenatal care and skilled birth attendance. At a value equivalent to just 1% of monthly household consumption, the payments are the smallest amongst national cash transfer programs in Latin America. Using multiple data sources and empirical methods, we show that the intervention reduced the average rate of stillbirths by 9.5% to 22.3%, and increased the survival rates of birth cohorts exposed to the program by 3.5% to 16.8%. The causal pathways of these effects are consistent with evidence of increased utilization of recommended health care services, including early initiation of prenatal care (17%), at least four prenatal visits (16%), and skilled birth attendance (15%). Given the modest transfer amounts and considerable effects on health care utilization, we posit that final health outcomes are likely driven by the health care conditionality, rather than an income effect. The intervention is highly cost-effective, at $184.54 per DALY averted, making the program’s pay-per-compliance design a promising policy alternative.
H51|Who Receives Medicaid in Old Age? Rules and Reality|Medicaid is a government program that provides health insurance to the old who are sick and have little assets and income compared to their medical needs. Thus, it explicitly tests for income, assets, and health or medical needs to determine eligibility. We ask how these rules map into the reality of Medicaid recipiency and what observable characteristics are important to determine who ends up on Medicaid. The data show that both singles and couples with high retirement income can end up on Medicaid at very advanced ages. We find that, conditioning on a large number of observable characteristics, including those that directly relate to Medicaid eligibility criteria, single women are more likely to end up on Medicaid. So are non-whites, but, surprisingly, their higher recipiency is concentrated above the lower income percentiles. We also find that low-income people with a high school diploma or higher are much less likely to end up on Medicaid than their more educated counterparts. All of these effects are large and depend on retirement income in a very non-linear way.
H51|Does More Female Labor Supply Really Save a Graying Japan?|This paper examines the impact of stimulated female labor supply on the Japanese economy as well as the government fiscal imbalance within a numerical dynamic general equilibrium model with multiple overlapping generations, particularly by paying attention to females' time costs of child rearing and elderly care in a graying Japan. Several numerical results indicate that even complete elimination of females' time costs of child rearing and elderly care stimulates the total GDP only by 1 percent. If complete elimination of time costs occurs in accordance with no gender gap in wage profiles, then the total GDP expands by 4 percent. The results also suggest importance of government policies not only to stimulate female labor force participation but also to improve human capital accumulation of females to reduce a gender gap in wage profiles.
H51|The future prospect of the long-term care insurance in Japan|This paper explores the impact of population aging on the Japanese public long-term care insurance (LTCI) within a numerical dynamic general equilibrium model with multiple overlapping generations. The impact of three policy options, such as an increase in co-payments, an earlier starting age of contribution, and more distribution of the cost to the public sector, is also examined. The numerical results show that in the next about forty years the burdens on the first (age 65 and over) and second (age 40 to 64) groups become more than 1.7 times and more than 2.7 times as much, respectively. A relatively more increase in the burdens on the second group cannot be avoidable, even if adjustment of the cost distribution between both groups is made every three years in the future in accordance with the schedule by the MHLW. Furthermore, in order to reduce future burdens in the LTCI, an increase in co-payments is most preferable, rather than an earlier starting age of contribution in the longer duration with lower annual burdens, or a shift of the cost to the public sector with a very high consumption tax.
H51|The Dynamics of Disability and Benefit Receipt in Britain|This paper exploits rarely-used longitudinal data to examine the impacts of disability onset on benefit receipt in Britain over the period 2004–2012. Differences in the timing of onset are exploited for identification in a framework that combines propensity score matching with difference-in-differences estimation. Disability onset increases receipt of disability insurance, a wider measure of sickness and disability benefits, and receipt of non-sickness benefits by six, eight and six percentage points respectively in the first year. These effects do not vary significantly by individual characteristics, but are larger for more severe disability onset, for those who did not previously report a long-term health condition, and for those who experienced disability onset under the less restrictive pre-2009 disability benefit regime. Contrary to the perception of disability benefits being an absorbing state, disability exit has an almost symmetrical impact on receipt of disability insurance and on wider sickness benefits in the first year.
H51|A panel data analysis of hospital variations in length of stay for hip replacements: Private versus public|Inequality between private and public patients in Australia has been an ongoing concern due to its two tiered insurance system. This paper investigates the variations in hospital length of stay for hip replacements using Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset from 2003/2004 to 2014/2015, employing a Bayesian hierarchical random coefficient model with trend allowing for structural break. We find systematic differences in the length of stay between public and private hospitals, after observable patient complexity is controlled. This suggests shorter stay in public hospitals due to pressure from Activity-based funding scheme, and longer stay in private system due to potential moral hazard. Our counterfactual analysis shows that public patients stay 1.4 days shorter than private in 2014, which leads to the 'quicker but sicker' concern that is commonly voiced by the public. We also identify widespread variations among individual hospitals. Sources for such variation warrant closer investigation by policy makers.
H51|Healthcare Spending and Utilization in Public and Private Medicare|"We compare healthcare spending in public and private Medicare using newly available claims data from Medicare Advantage (MA) insurers. MA insurer revenues are 30 percent higher than their healthcare spending. Healthcare spending is 25 percent lower for MA enrollees than for enrollees in traditional Medicare (TM) in the same county with the same risk score. Spending differences between MA and TM are similar across sub-populations of enrollees and sub-categories of care, with similar reductions for ""high value"" and ""low value"" care. Spending differences primarily reflect differences in healthcare utilization; spending per encounter and hospital payments per admission are very similar in MA and TM. Geographic variation in MA spending is about 20 percent higher than in TM, but geographic variation in hospital prices is about 20 percent lower. We present evidence consistent with MA plans encouraging substitution to less expensive care, such as primary rather than specialist care, and outpatient rather than inpatient surgery, and with employing various types of utilization management. Some of the overall spending differences between MA and TM may be driven by selection on unobservables, and we report a range of estimates of this selection effect using mortality outcomes to proxy for selection."
H51|Can At-Scale Drug Provision Improve the Health of the Targeted in Sub-Saharan Africa?|The single largest item in the US foreign aid health budget is antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Many supply- and demand-side factors in sub-Saharan Africa could cause smaller than expected epidemiological effects of this at-scale drug provision. We provide what appears to be the first quasi-experimental evidence on the effect of at-scale drug provision in a poor country, using the phased rollout of ART in Zambia, a setting where approximately one in six adults are HIV positive. Combining anthropometric data from national household surveys and a spatially based triple-difference specification, we find that local ART introduction increased the weight of high HIV likelihood adult women. This finding from a clinically difficult setting suggests that the generalized challenges of scalability of ART for adult health in sub-Saharan Africa are surmountable.
H51|The economic burden of chronic diseases: Estimates and projections for China, Japan, and South Korea|We propose a novel framework to analyse the macroeconomic impact of noncommunicable diseases. We incorporate measures of disease prevalence into a human capital augmented production function, which enables us to determine the economic costs of chronic health conditions in terms of foregone gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike previously adopted frameworks, this approach allows us to account for i) variations in human capital for workers in different age groups, ii) mortality and morbidity effects of non-communicable diseases, and iii) the treatment costs of diseases. We apply our methodology to China, Japan, and South Korea, and estimate the economic burden of chronic conditions in five domains (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases, diabetes, and mental health conditions). Overall, total losses associated with these non-communicable diseases over the period 2010-2030 are $16 trillion for China (measured in real USD with the base year 2010), $5.7 trillion for Japan, and $1.5 trillion for South Korea. Our results also highlight the limits of cost-effectiveness analysis by identifying some intervention strategies to reduce disease prevalence in China that are cost beneficial and therefore a rational use of resources, though they are not cost-effective as judged by conventional thresholds.
H51|The Effects of the Affordable Care Act on Health Insurance Coverage and Labor Market Outcomes|The Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes several provisions designed to expand health insurance coverage that also alter the tie between employment and health insurance. In this paper, we exploit variation across geographic areas in the potential impact of the ACA to estimate its effect on health insurance and labor market outcomes in its first four years. Our findings indicate that approximately 70 percent of the increase in health insurance coverage since 2013 is due to the ACA. We also find that these increases in health insurance coverage did not result in statistically significant changes in labor market outcomes.
H51|Subsidizing Health Insurance for Low-Income Adults: Evidence from Massachusetts|How much are low-income individuals willing to pay for health insurance, and what are the implications for insurance markets? Using administrative data from Massachusetts’ subsidized insurance exchange, we exploit discontinuities in the subsidy schedule to estimate willingness to pay and costs of insurance among low-income adults. As subsidies decline, insurance take-up falls rapidly, dropping about 25% for each $40 increase in monthly enrollee premiums. Marginal enrollees tend to be lower-cost, consistent with adverse selection into insurance. But across the entire distribution we can observe – approximately the bottom 70% of the willingness to pay distribution – enrollee willingness to pay is always less than half of own expected costs. As a result, we estimate that take-up will be highly incomplete even with generous subsidies: if enrollee premiums were 25% of insurers’ average costs, at most half of potential enrollees would buy insurance; even premiums subsidized to 10% of average costs would still leave at least 20% uninsured. We suggest an important role for uncompensated care for the uninsured in explaining these findings and explore normative implications.
H51|What Does (Formal) Health Insurance Do, and for Whom?|Health insurance confers benefits to the previously uninsured, including improvements in health, reductions in out-of-pocket spending, and reduced medical debt. However, because the nominally uninsured pay only a small share of their medical expenses, health insurance also provides substantial transfers to nonrecipient parties who would otherwise bear the costs of providing uncompensated care to the uninsured. The prevalence of uncompensated care helps explain the limited take-up of heavily subsidized public health insurance and the evidence that many recipients value formal health insurance at substantially less than the cost to insurers of providing that coverage. The distributional implications of public subsidies for health insurance depend critically on the ultimate economic incidence of the transfers that they deliver to providers of uncompensated care.
H51|Politics and Health Care Spending in the United States|This paper explores a link between politics and health care spending in the US. To win votes for the 2004 Medicare Modernization Act, legislative leaders raised Medicare payment rates for hospitals in an effort to entice the members of Congress representing those hospitals to vote for the law. Members of Congress representing hospitals that received a payment increase were more likely to vote for the law. Following their payment increase, hospitals treated more patients and increased their spending. There was also an increase in local hiring. Politicians representing hospitals that were awarded a payment increase subsequently received more campaign contributions.
H51|Means Testing Federal Health Entitlement Benefits|Recent federal legislation has linked the price paid for health insurance benefits to current income. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, individuals and families with income as high as 400% of the federal poverty level are eligible for premium tax credits that limit their health insurance premiums to under 10% of their income. Under the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, higher-income beneficiaries face income-related premiums over three times the standard premium for Part B coverage. For workers at or near retirement age, means testing based on current income provides an incentive for early retirement, dissaving, and income manipulation, raising concerns about the efficiency of such means testing. Further, current income is subject to short-term fluctuations, making it a noisy predictor of ability to pay. Using the Health and Retirement Study and linked Social Security earnings histories, this paper introduces a measure of lifetime income that compares favorably to current income as a basis for means testing. It offers less short-term variation in premiums while improving incentives for preretirement work and saving.

H51|Medicaid and Financial Health|This paper investigates the effects of the Medicaid expansion provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on households' financial health. Our findings indicate that, in addition to reducing the incidence of unpaid medical bills, the reform provided substantial indirect financial benefits to households. Using a nationally representative panel of 5 million credit records, we find that the expansion reduced unpaid medical bills sent to collection by $3.4 billion in its first two years, prevented new delinquencies, and improved credit scores. Using data on credit offers and pricing, we document that improvements in households' financial health led to better terms for available credit valued at $520 million per year. We calculate that the financial benefits of Medicaid double when considering these indirect benefits in addition to the direct reduction in out-of-pocket expenditures.
H51|Service-level Selection: Strategic Risk Selection in Medicare Advantage in Response to Risk Adjustment|The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has phased in the Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC) risk adjustment model during 2004-2006 to more accurately estimate capitated payments to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans to reflect each beneficiary’s health status. However, it is debatable whether the CMS-HCC model has led to strategic evolutions of risk selection. We examine the competing claims and analyze the risk selection behavior of MA plans in response to the CMS-HCC model. We find that the CMS-HCC model reduced the phenomenon that MA plans avoid high-cost beneficiaries in traditional Medicare plans, whereas it led to increased disenrollment of high-cost beneficiaries, conditional on illness severity, from MA plans. We explain this phenomenon in relation to service-level selection. First, we show that MA plans have incentives to effectuate risk selection via service-level selection, by lowering coverage levels for services that are more likely to be used by beneficiaries who could be unprofitable under the CMS-HCC model. Then, we empirically test our theoretical prediction that compared to the pre-implementation period (2001-2003), MA plans have raised copayments disproportionately more for services needed by unprofitable beneficiaries than for other services in the post-implementation period (2007-2009). This induced unprofitable beneficiaries to voluntarily dis-enroll from their MA plans. Further evidence supporting this selection mechanism is that those dissatisfied with out-of-pocket costs were more likely to dis-enroll from MA plans. We estimate that such strategic behavior led MA plans to save $5.2 billion by transferring the costs to the federal government.
H51|Estimating Public Spending on Health by Levels of Care for National Health Accounts: An Illustration of Use of Data on Withdrawals by Drawing and Disbursing Officers (DDOs) in India|This paper illustrates the use of information on withdrawals by Drawing and Disbursing Officers (DDOs) for improving estimates of public spending for National Health Accounts (NHAs) in India. Using information from two selected States (Karnataka and Rajasthan), the study highlights the advantages of combining DDO-level information with budgetary data for two purposes (i) mapping public spending to different provider classes of the international System of Health Accounts 2011 (SHA 2011) and (ii) mapping public spending to different types of healthcare providers in India. The benefits of using DDO-level information are found to be higher while mapping expenditure to healthcare providers in India than mapping to international categories of the SHA 2011. In particular, while mapping public spending to different types of healthcare providers in India, the improvement in precision of estimates brought about by DDO-level information was found to be significant in the two States.
H51|The Effect of Intergovernmental Transfers on Public Services in India|India has witnessed impressive growth performance since the market based re-forms were introduced in 1991. However, its regional spread has been uneven. Consid-ering the fact that over 63 per cent of the population lives in economically lagging states and they have over 67 per cent of children in the age group 0-14 demographic dividends can be realised only when a system of intergovernmental transfers is designed to offset their fiscal disabilities. The present paper analyses the design and implementation of gen-eral and specific purpose transfers in India. While the general purpose transfers are given to enable the States to provide comparable levels of services at comparable tax rates. However, given the large differences in the revenue capacities of the states with the rich-est large state having five times the per capita income of the lowest, it is politically infea-sible to offset the differences in revenue capacities completely. Therefore, the specific purpose which are meant to ensure minimum standards of meritorious services with high degree of externalities are extremely important. However, the analysis shows that there are too many specific purpose transfers, they are poorly targeted and inclusion of multiple objectives in each of the specific purpose transfers makes the compliance by the States difficult. The objective of inclusive development requires that the transfer system should be reformed.
H51|How much do OECD countries spend on prevention?|OECD countries face the multiple challenges of rapidly ageing societies with the associated rise in chronic diseases and the ever-present threat from new or evolving communicable diseases. This is within the context of seeking better value for money from the health sector. While a growing body of evidence shows that many health promotion and disease prevention measures can improve health outcomes at relatively low cost, less has been documented – in an internationally comparable way – on how much countries actually invest in such activities and the drivers of prevention spending over the years. This is particularly pertinent in the context of fiscal sustainability and tight public budgets. Using newly available data from across OECD countries, this study examines the differences in spending on prevention both at an aggregate and detailed level. This analysis brings a fresh perspective and raises questions as to the optimal resource allocations within the sector. Time series data is also scrutinised in conjunction with collated policy and public health developments from a number of countries to try to identify some of the drivers behind the observed prevention spending trends. In doing so, directions for further improvement in the underlying data as well as policy implications are discussed.
H51|Future trends in health care expenditure: A modelling framework for cross-country forecasts|Across the OECD, healthcare spending has typically outpaced economic growth in recent decades. While such spending has improved health outcomes, there are concerns about the financial sustainability of this upward trend, particularly as healthcare systems are predominantly funded from public resources in most OECD countries. To better explore this financial sustainability challenge, many countries and international institutions have developed forecasting models to project growth in future healthcare expenditure.Despite methodological differences between forecasting approaches, a common set of healthcare spending drivers can be identified. Demographic factors, rising incomes, technological progress, productivity in the healthcare sector compared to the general economy (Baumol’s cost disease) and associated healthcare policies have all been shown to be key determinants of healthcare spending.
H51|The economics of patient safety: Strengthening a value-based approach to reducing patient harm at national level|About one in ten patients are harmed during health care. This paper estimates the health, financial and economic costs of this harm. Results indicate that patient harm exerts a considerable global health burden. The financial cost on health systems is also considerable and if the flow-on economic consequences such as lost productivity and income are included the costs of harm run into trillions of dollars annually. Because many of the incidents that cause harm can be prevented, these failures represent a considerable waste of healthcare resources, and the cost of failure dwarfs the investment required to implement effective prevention. The paper then examines how patient harm can be minimised effectively and efficiently. This is informed by a snapshot survey of a panel of eminent academic and policy experts in patient safety. System- and organisational-level initiatives were seen as vital to provide a foundation for the more local interventions targeting specific types of harm. The overarching requirement was a culture conducive to safety.

H51|Old-age Frailty Patterns and Implications for Long-term Care Programmes|Abstract This paper examines patterns in old-age frailty within a multistate model that characterises the stochastic process of biological ageing. Using aggregate population-level U.S. mortality data, we study differences in frailty by gender and cohort. Our results show that, on average, women tend to be frailer than men at older ages with the male–female divergence growing considerably past age 80. We also find that average frailty levels have fluctuated over time with a distinct peak-and-trough pattern. These cohort trends in frailty and the subsequent dynamic forecasts of frailty among newer cohorts closely mirror how late-life disability has evolved among older Americans in recent decades, underscoring the important connection between frailty conditions and disability among older adults. The implications of these findings on spending for long-term care programmes within the broader health insurance system are discussed.
H51|The savings from the 2016-2020 Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines in Ireland: which counterfactual?|The Minister for Health claims savings of €600 million due to the 2016-2020 framework agreement (the Agreement) with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association. But relative to what? No agreement. That seems implausible since such State/industry agreements have been in operation continuously since 1969. Furthermore the State has powers to set medicine prices under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013? Agreed, but what would be a more appropriate counterfactual? The status quo: replicating the 2012-2015 agreement and extending its length for one year. That seems a sensible credible alternative. But what would the savings be if the status quo is the counterfactual? €290 million. Wow, less than half the Minister’s estimate. But won’t that make the Health Service Executive (HSE)’s task in deciding which new high cost medicines to fund much harder? Yes. Perhaps the HSE should set out guidance as to when a new medicine will be funded, with, for example, an upper cost-effectiveness limit. But surely the methodology and assumptions underlying the Minister’s claimed savings are published, as part of a transparent, open evidenced based policy? Afraid not. Why? Good question. This paper attempts, albeit partially, to fill the void in the analytics.
H51|Application of the Multiregional Health Account for Germany - A financial equalization scheme to cope with lagging investments in German hospitals|Lagging investments in German hospitals have become a serious challenge in recent decades. The responsibility for investment financing lies with the German federal states, the “Bundeslaender”, due to the dualistic financing framework applying for German hospitals. Yet, hospital investments experience a field of tension between the availability of financial resources and necessary investments. A possible solution could be a financial equalization scheme for the health economy incorporating an earmarked fund for hospital investments. The rationale for such a system is that health economies of federal states do not represent single closed systems, but depend on interregional trade flows to supply patient treatment. The respective calculations in this paper are based on our recently compiled Multiregional Health Account for Germany. The model represents a satellite account of the health economy based on national accounts. Consequently, we are able to calculate spillover effects from patient treatment in federal states by conducting input-output analysis. Based on the results, we derive a sketch of a financial equalization scheme in order to ensure needs-based hospital infrastructure in German federal states.
H51|Transferencias como Canal de Ventaja Electoral: El Caso de Chile<BR>[Discretionary Government Transfers to Catch Votes: The Case of Chile]|Discretionary transfers from the Chilean central government have grown significantly as a percentage of Chilean municipalities’ total financing. This paper investigates whether discretionary transfers act as a channel that gives electoral advantage to the incumbent political coalition that runs a municipality. We develop a simple theoretical model which predicts that the central government transfers more resources to the communes managed by mayors of its own political coalition, particularly in which the mayor won by a narrow margin. Then, in order to test the main results of the theoretical model, a Discontinuous Regression Design is applied using data from the 2004, 2008 and 2012 election periods. The results show that for the subset of communes with narrow voting margins, the central government transfers about an additional 250 million Chilean pesos to the communes that are administered by mayors of its own political coalition. Moreover, observing only the communes with the largest number of inhabitants there is a difference of 730 million Chilean pesos. Disaggregating by type of transfers we show that political discretion would be given only in some types of transfers. This is an important result because allows identifying the channels to be researched in the future and open questions about the influence of institutional and/ or strategic factors. Finally, disaggregating by election period, the results are always consistent with 2008 and 2012 election periods, supporting the fact that this discretionary mechanism has become important over time.
H51|L’évolution des dépenses de santé au Maroc : une analyse des déterminants démographiques et macro-économiques<BR>[The Evolution of the Health Expenditures in Morocco: A Demographics and Macroeconomics Determinants Analysis]|Morocco’s healthcare expenditures regime growth has been in decline since 2010. The average annual growth rate went from 7.9% over the period of 1996 to 2009 to 4.4% in the recent years. The objective of this paper is to identify the demographic and macroeconomic determinants that shape healthcare expenditures behavior in Morocco, and to evaluate their respective contributions to the shift observed in the trajectory of healthcare expenditures growth. On the one hand, results show that the combined demographic factors of population growth and demographic transition account for a 14% growth rate decline in healthcare expenditures. On the other hand, the evaluation of macroeconomic determinants based on econometric modeling, shows that the income elasticity of healthcare expenditures is less than a unit ranging from 0.5 to 0.8. It also yields a positive price semi-elasticity with an estimated value of 0.02, and a 0.01 (-0.01) sensitivity coefficient to the variation of the weight of public (versus private) funding in total healthcare expenditures. Therefore, as of 2010 the contributing factors to the slowing down in healthcare expenditures growth can be presented as follows: 45% is due to declining healthcare relative prices, 20 % is due to a shrinking share of public funding, and 11% is due to a decelerating economic growth. The estimated models’ residual contains the remainder (10%) shares of contributions.
H51|The “Double Expansion of Morbidity” Hypothesis: Evidence from Italy|The last few decades have been characterized by an increase in the number of years lived in bad health, lending support to the “Expansion of Morbidity” hypothesis. In this paper we propose the “Double Expansion of Morbidity” (DEM) hypothesis, arguing that not only life expectancy gains have been transformed into years lived in “bad health”, but also, due to an earlier onset of chronic diseases, the number of years spent in “good health” is actually reduced. Limited to the Italian case, we present and discuss a set of empirical evidence confirming the DEM hypothesis. In particular, we find that from 2004 to 2014 the average number of years spent with chronic conditions in Italy increased by 7.2 years 2.3 years of which are due to an increase in life expectancy and 4.9 years due to a reduction in the age of onset of chronic conditions. Compared with 2004, in 2014, this phenomenon generated extra public health expenditure of nearly 6.3 billion euros. We discuss the policy implications of these findings.
H51|Has South Africaâ€™s Investment in Public Health Care Improved Health Outcomes?|South Africaâ€™s total expenditure on health equates to almost 9% of its gross domestic product, which is above the average of other countries classified as middle-income countries. Notwithstanding this investment, indicators of health outcomes remain relatively lower when compared to the same countries. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of public health expenditure in improving health outcomes in South Africa. Panel estimations techniques were used using data for the countryâ€™s nine provinces over the period 2005 to 2014. Results have shown that, on average, an increase in public health expenditure per capita leads to improvement in the under-five mortality rate. With regards to life expectancy at birth, public health expenditure was found to be statistically not significant. Control variables such as real GDP per capita, female literacy rate, immunisation coverage ratio, access to formal housing and HIV/Aids prevalence were also found to be important determinants of health outcomes in the country. The key policy implications of these findings are that government should continue to prioritise greater resource allocation to public health spending, including towards improving access to formal housing, immunisation coverage, women education and increase targeted interventions on HIV/Aids
H51|Policy makers, the international community and the population in the prevention and treatment of diseases: case study on HIV/AIDS|"Abstract A four-period game is developed between a policy maker, the international community, and the population. This research supplements, through implementing strategic interaction, earlier research analyzing ""one player at a time"". The first two players distribute funds between preventing and treating diseases. The population reacts by degree of risky behavior which may cause no disease, disease contraction, recovery, sickness/death. More funds to prevention implies less disease contraction but higher death rate given disease contraction. The cost effectiveness of treatment relative to prevention, country specific conditions, and how the international community converts funds compared with the policy maker in a country, are illustrated. We determine which factors impact funding, e.g. large probabilities of disease contraction, and death given contraction, and if the recovery utility and utility of remaining sick or dying are far below the no disease utility. We also delineate how the policy maker and international community may free ride on each other’s contributions. The model is tested against empirical data for 43 African countries. The results show consistency between the theoretical model and empirical estimates. The paper argues for the need to create commitment mechanisms to ensure that free riding by both countries and the international community is avoided."
H51|Private Health Investments under Competing Risks: Evidence from Malaria Control in Senegal|This study exploits the introduction of high subsidies for anti-malaria products in Senegal in 2009 to investigate if malaria prevents parents to invest in child health. Building upon the seminal paper of Dow et al. (1999), we develop a simple model of health investments under competing mortality risks, in which people allocate expenses to equalize lifetime across all causes of death. We predict that private health investments to fight malaria as well as other diseases should increase in response to anti-malaria public interventions. To test this prediction, we use original panel data from a Senegalese household survey combined with geographical information on malaria prevalence. Our strategy is to compare the evolution of child health expenditures before and after anti-malaria interventions, between malarious and non-malarious regions of Senegal. We find that health expenditures in malarious regions catch up with non-malarious regions, at the extensive and intensive margins, and both in level and in composition. The same result holds for parental health-seeking behavior in case of other diseases like diarrhea. We provide evidence that these patterns cannot be explained by differential trends in total income or access to healthcare or child morbidity between malarious and non-malarious regions. Our results suggest that behavioral responses to anti-malaria campaigns magnify their impact on all-cause mortality for children.
H51|The Impact of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid Expansion on Medicaid Spending by Health Care Service Category|The 2014 Medicaid expansion revised Medicaid eligibility provisions to allow for low-income, non-elderly adults to be eligible for Medicaid in those states which opt for this change. During the first three fiscal years after the expansion, there were more than 11.9 million newly eligible Medicaid enrollees nationwide. I investigate the impact the 2014 Medicaid expansion had on Medicaid spending by the government. I use data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on all Medicaid expenditures over an 18 year period, including three years post-expansion. I apply a difference-in-differences design to exploit the variation among states electing to participate in the expansion and the health care services they offer. These data allow me to study the fiscal impact of the expansion on all possible health care services. I find that the expansion increased total Medicaid spending by 14 percent in participating states, but this masks the substantive heterogeneity in Medicaid spending across the 21 health care service categories. Most notably, dental and rural health clinic services increased by 201 and 99 percent, respectively. My results show that the expansion is having a disproportionately significant effect on Medicaid spending for clinic services in rural areas compared to metropolitan areas. Overall, the service categories experiencing a significant increase after the expansion suggest that the new adult group is seeking more routine or preventive care compared to the traditional Medicaid population. The increase in routine and preventive care has the potential to result in better health outcomes and fewer medical emergencies in the future, ultimately lowering Medicaid spending by the state and federal government over the long term.
H51|In the Shadow of a Giant: Medicare’s Influence on Private Physician Payments|We analyze Medicare’s influence on private insurers’ payments for physicians’ services. Using a large administrative change in reimbursements for surgical versus medical care, we find that private prices follow Medicare’s lead. A $1.00 increase in Medicare’s fees increases corresponding private prices by $1.16. A second set of Medicare fee changes, which generates area-specific payment shocks, has a similar effect on private reimbursements. Medicare’s influence is strongest in areas with concentrated insurers and competitive physician markets, consistent with insurer-doctor bargaining. By echoing Medicare’s pricing changes, these payment spillovers amplify Medicare’s impact on specialty choice and other welfare-relevant aspects of physician practices.
H51|Les politiques du médicament dans un contexte d’austérité en France et au Royaume-Uni : quel impact sur le modèle de production des big pharma ?|Les politiques d’austérité menées en France comme Royaume-Uni ont entraîné une rationalisation renforcée des dépenses de santé associée à une introduction accrue de mécanismes marchands. Prenant en France, la forme d’une modification de la structure de financement de l’Assurance maladie obligatoire (AMO), une réduction des dépenses publiques autour d’un panier de soins dont les contours tendent à se réduire et d’un transfert d’une partie des dépenses vers l’Assurance maladie complémentaire (AMC). Au Royaume-Uni, les politiques d’austérité se sont traduites par une sous dotation récurrente du système de soins qui recourt de façon croissante à des offreurs de soins privés. Dans ce contexte, les deux pays ont aussi mis en œuvre des réformes ayant pour objectif de maîtriser les dépenses de médicaments. Celles-ci ont consisté à durcir les règles de fixation des prix des médicaments en particulier des médicaments innovants et à modifier les taux de prise en charge du médicament (baisse des taux de prise en charge, développement des génériques, déremboursements). Ces politiques ont contribué à la transformation du modèle d’innovation et de production des médicaments. Longtemps basé sur le développement de médicaments blockbusters, ce modèle est devenu de façon transitoire un modèle de production de médicaments génériques avant de privilégier la médecine personnalisée : les médicaments custombusters.
H51|Österreichs Staatsausgabenstrukturen im europäischen Vergleich|This publication is available in German language only. For a brief English summary see further below. Diese Studie liefert eine detaillierte Analyse der Staatsausgabenstrukturen Österreichs im europäischen Vergleich anhand der COFOG-Daten („Classification of the Functions of Government“) von Eurostat. Der Fokus der Untersuchung liegt zum einen auf einer Einordnung der Staatsausgabenstrukturen Österreichs gegenüber anderen Eurozonenländern; dabei werden strukturelle Ähnlichkeiten und Unterschiede herausgearbeitet. Zum anderen werden neben den Vorzügen auch die Grenzen der von Eurostat bereitgestellten COFOG-Daten für Ländervergleiche analysiert. Eine detaillierte Effizienz- bzw. Effektivitätsanalyse einzelner staatlicher Ausgabenbereiche würde den Untersuchungsrahmen dieser Studie sprengen. Folgestudien, die sich eingehender mit europäischen Ländervergleichen zu den Staatsausgabenstrukturen beschäftigen, müssen vor allem jene Aspekte berücksichtigen, die im Hinblick auf die Kontextualisierung der Ausgabenstrukturen relevant sind. Durch die Möglichkeit des Ländervergleichs liefern die COFOG-Daten wertvolle Anhaltspunkte hinsichtlich struktureller Unterschiede und Ähnlichkeiten von Staatsausgaben. Hinsichtlich einer sinnvollen Verwendung der Daten ist jedoch zu beachten, dass simple quantitative Benchmark-Vergleiche von Staatsausgabenstrukturen, wie sie regelmäßig in anderen Studien vorgenommen werden, potentiell irreführend sind. Aussagen nach dem Muster „Die Quote der Sozialausgaben in Relation zur Wirtschaftsleistung ist in Land A niedriger (höher) als in den Ländern B und C, deshalb ist das Sozialsystem in Land A ausgabeneffizienter (weniger ausgabeneffizient) als in den Ländern B und C“ sind in der Regel wenig bis gar nicht aussagekräftig, wenn sie nicht in einen breiteren Kontext gestellt werden. Dies liegt insbesondere an drei Problemfeldern. Erstens sollten bei einem Vergleich mehrerer Länder öffentliche und private Ausgaben nach Möglichkeit zusammen betrachtet werden. Denn Unterschiede in der Systemgestaltung hinsichtlich privater und öffentlicher Ausgabenkomponenten schlagen sich auch in der Struktur der Staatsausgaben nieder. Zweitens müssen vergangene und zu erwartende gesellschaftshistorische und wirtschaftliche Entwicklungen in eine Analyse der staatlichen Ausgabenstrukturen einfließen, wenn diese kontextadäquat sein soll. Drittens bestehen zum einen bei der Zuordnung von Ausgaben auf Privat- und Staatssektor und zum anderen bei der Zuordnung staatlicher Ausgaben auf verschiedene Ausgabenbereiche im Detail Probleme Die Organisation staatlicher Leistungen kann dazu führen, dass Ausgabenunterschiede im Ländervergleich bei näherer Betrachtung mehr auf statistische als auf inhaltliche Differenzen zurückzuführen sind. Diese drei Problempunkte bedeuten nicht, dass Ländervergleiche der Ausgabenstrukturen generell nichts brächten; aber sie verweisen darauf, dass institutionelle Gegebenheiten, wirtschaftliche und gesellschaftliche Entwicklung sowie statistische Besonderheiten berücksichtigt werden müssen, wenn die Analyse mehrerer Länder nicht in die Irre führen soll. Diese Studie veranschaulicht die genannten drei Problempunkte hinsichtlich des Mehrländervergleichs von staatlichen Ausgabenstrukturen anhand von drei Eurozonenländern Österreich, Belgien und Deutschland. Dieser Ländervergleich erscheint zielführend, weil alle drei Länder ein vergleichbares Entwicklungs- und Wohlstandsniveau sowie relevante Ähnlichkeiten in Bezug auf institutionelle Charakteristika und ökonomische Verflochtenheit aufweisen. Der Schwerpunkt liegt insbesondere auf der Analyse der Bildungs-, Gesundheits- und Sozialausgaben, weil diesen drei Bereichen sowohl aufgrund ihres quantitativen Budgetanteils als auch in politischen Debatten besondere Relevanz zukommt. Die staatlichen Bildungs-, Gesundheits- und Sozialausgaben machen in Österreich zusammengenommen 67,1% der gesamten Staatsausgaben aus, was sich im Vergleich mit den anderen EU-Ländern als typisch für einen entwickelten Sozialstaat erweist. Sowohl in der EU‑28 als auch im Euroraum entfielen im Jahr 2015 rund zwei Drittel aller Staatsausgaben auf diese Bereiche. Während die skandinavischen Wohlfahrtsstaaten und Eurozonen-Kernländer wie Deutschland, Österreich und Frankreich von diesem Durchschnitt nach oben abweichen, sind die staatlichen Ausgabenquoten für Bildung, Gesundheit und soziale Sicherung insbesondere in den im Zuge jüngster EU-Erweiterungsrunden hinzugekommenen Ländern wie Bulgarien und Rumänien relativ gering. Aber auch südeuropäische Länder weisen in der Regel unterdurchschnittliche Ausgabenanteile in den Bereichen Bildung, Gesundheit und soziale Sicherung auf. Seit dem Ausbruch der Finanz- und Wirtschaftskrise ist innerhalb der Eurozone ein verstärktes Auseinanderdriften in den Staatsausgaben zwischen Kernländern wie Deutschland, Österreich und Belgien und den südlichen Peripherieländern zu verzeichnen; insbesondere in Griechenland, aber auch in Portugal, Spanien und Italien sind aufgrund der Budgetkonsolidierungspolitik die realen Bildungs-, Gesundheits- und Sozialausgaben mit wenigen Ausnahmen zwischen 2008 und 2015 markant gesunken. Innerhalb der EU-Staaten zeigt sich, dass eine höhere Staatsausgabenquote mit geringeren privaten Konsumausgaben in Relation zu den Gesamtausgaben im Zusammenhang steht Je höher die staatliche Ausgabenquote im jeweiligen EU-Land ist, desto geringer fällt der Anteil der privaten Konsumausgaben an den gesamten Ausgaben aus (und umgekehrt). Dieses Ergebnis deutet darauf hin, dass staatliche Ausgaben eine Entlastung für private Haushalte darstellen können. Zudem zeigt sich, dass europäische Länder, die sich durch volkswirtschaftlichen Erfolg und hohe Produktivität auszeichnen (dazu zählt auch Österreich), in der Regel einen ausgebauten Sozialstaat mit einer relativ hohen Staatsausgabenquote aufweisen. Der österreichische Sozialstaat bringt mit seiner Staatsausgabenquote im europäischen Vergleich ein ausgeprägtes Umverteilungspotential mit sich, weil die Umverteilung der Markteinkommen großteils ausgabenseitig (und nicht über Steuern) vollzogen wird. English Summary Austria’s government expenditure structures in European comparison This study analyses Austria’s government expenditure structures in a European comparison by using Eurostat’s COFOG data (‘Classification of the Functions of Government’). On the one hand, the analysis focuses on putting government expenditure structures into comparative perspective with other eurozone countries. On the other hand, restricting the analysis to emphasising the advantages of multi-country analysis proves insufficient, since there are important limits to using Eurostat’s COFOG data for quantitative benchmark comparisons. A detailed efficiency or effectiveness analysis was beyond the scope of this study. Consecutive analyses dealing with multi-country comparisons should put special weight on those factors that are crucial for contextualising similarities and differences in government expenditure structures. By allowing for government expenditures to be compared across countries, the COFOG data provide valuable reference points regarding structural differences and similarities of government expenditures. However, if the data are to be used appropriately, one should not stop at simple quantitative benchmark comparisons as regularly undertaken in other studies. Statements such as ‘The ratio of social expenditures to GDP in country A is lower (higher) than in countries B and C; hence, the social system in country A is more efficient (less efficient) than in countries B and C’ are usually not very informative and potentially misleading if they are not put into proper context. Three points are especially relevant. First, public and private expenditures should be integrated into a proper analysis, because differences in the design of private and public expenditure components have a marked impact on expenditure structures. Second, both the past and projected future of relevant developments in the economy and society and their effect on expenditures should be considered if the analysis is to be context-adequate. Third, the attribution of expenditures to the private and public sector is fraught with difficulties. The organisation of government services can lead to expenditure differences across countries, which, after taking a closer look, turn out to be more due to differences in statistics rather than substance. Those three problem areas do not imply that country comparisons should not be undertaken at all; but they suggest that institutional conditions, developments in the economy and society as well as statistical peculiarities need be to accounted for in order to avoid that the COFOG data analysis ends up being misleading. This study illustrates the three problems mentioned in terms of quantitative multi-country comparisons by analysing three euro-area countries Austria, Belgium and Germany. Comparing those three countries makes sense because they have important similarities in terms of their level of economic development and prosperity, their institutional characteristics and production structures. The focus is on analysing expenditures on education, health and social protection, as those three areas make up the largest part of the overall budget and prove particularly important for policy discussions. In Austria, public expenditures on education, health and social protection amount to 67.1% of total government expenditures, which proves to be typical of advanced welfare states in the EU. Both in the EU-28 and in the euro area, about two thirds of government expenditures are spent on those three areas. While the Scandinavian welfare states and euro-area core countries such as Germany, Austria and Belgium are above the average, new EU Member States such as Bulgaria and Romania but also older Member States in the southern periphery allocate a smaller part of overall government expenditures to education, health and social protection. For the period after the financial crisis, the analysis indicates a further drifting apart in government expenditure structures, as periphery countries – which already had lower government expenditure ratios to GDP on education, health and social protection – have fallen further behind vis-à-vis core countries such as Germany, Austria and Belgium. In Greece, but to a smaller extent also in Portugal, Spain and Italy, fiscal consolidation policies have led to a marked decline in real government expenditures on education, health and social protection.
H51|Detecting Potential Overbilling in Medicare Reimbursement via Hours Worked|We propose a novel and easy-to-implement approach to detect potential overbilling based on the hours worked implied by the service codes which physicians submit to Medicare. Using the Medicare Part B Fee-for-Service (FFS) Physician Utilization and Payment Data in 2012 and 2013 released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, we construct estimates for physicians' hours spent on Medicare beneficiaries. We find that about 2,300 physicians, representing about 3 percent of those with 20 or more hours of Medicare Part B FFS services, have billed Medicare over 100 hours per week. We consider these implausibly long hours.
H51|Expertise versus Bias in Evaluation: Evidence from the NIH|Evaluators with expertise in a particular field may have an informational advantage in separating good projects from bad. At the same time, they may also have personal preferences that impact their objectivity. This paper examines these issues in the context of peer review at the US National Institutes of Health. I show that evaluators are both better informed and more biased about the quality of projects in their own area. On net, the benefits of expertise weakly dominate the costs of bias. As such, policies designed to limit bias by seeking impartial evaluators may reduce the quality of funding decisions.
H51|Technological Change and Risk Adjustment: Benefit Design Incentives in Medicare Part D|Subsidized health insurance markets use diagnosis-based risk adjustment to induce insurers to offer an equitable benefit to individuals of varying expected cost. I demonstrate that technological change after risk adjustment calibration--new drug entry and the onset of generic competition--made certain diagnoses profitable or unprofitable in Medicare Part D. I then exploit variation in diagnoses' profitability driven by technological change to show insurers designed more favorable benefits for drugs that treat profitable diagnoses as compared to unprofitable diagnoses. In the presence of technological change, risk adjustment may not fully neutralize insurers' incentives to select through benefit designs.
H51|Can Catastrophic Long-Term Care Insurance Policies Increase Private Insurance Coverage and Reduce Medicaid Expenditure?|Using an inter-temporal optimization model of long-term care insurance purchase decisions, we evaluate catastrophic long-term care insurance policies that cover the tail risk of long-term care costs at affordable premiums. Under our baseline model, we show theoretically that introducing catastrophic policies will induce 11 percent of middle-income men and 3 percent of middle-income women to initiate private insurance coverage. As a result, Medicaid costs will be reduced by 0.20 percent and 0.19 percent for men and women, respectively.
H51|The 2017 Long-Term Budget Outlook|CBOâ€™s projections show a substantial imbalance looming in the federal budget over the next 30 years, with spending outpacing revenues by steadily increasing amounts. As a result, if current laws generally remained unchanged, federal debt would reach an unprecedented share of GDP, intensifying pressures on the federal budget, dampening economic growth, limiting the nationâ€™s ability to respond to unforeseen events, and increasing the likelihood of a fiscal crisis.
H51|An Analysis of the Presidentâ€™s 2018 Budget|Under the Presidentâ€™s proposals, federal budget deficits would shrink relative to the size of the economy over the coming decade, ranging between 2.6 percent and 3.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) over that period. The cumulative federal deficit would be nearly one-third smaller than in CBOâ€™s baseline projections, but debt held by the public would end up slightly higher, as a percentage of GDP, than the ratio anticipated for the end of this year.
H51|Approaches to Changing Military Health Care|The Department of Defense (DoD) spends about $50 billion annually to provide health care to more than 9 million beneficiaries through a program known as TRICARE. CBO examined several illustrative approaches that might reduce DoDâ€™s rising health care costs, improve the quality of care provided at its facilities, or strengthen how well the departmentâ€™s medical establishment prepares for wartime missions. The report also describes the estimated budgetary effects of two specific options for making changes to TRICARE.
H51|Issues and Challenges in Measuring and Improving the Quality of Health Care: Working Paper 2017-10|Various stakeholders have made significant efforts to measure and improve health care quality, spurred by landmark reports issued over a decade ago that highlighted serious deficiencies. Most payers now require providers of care to report on aspects of quality as a way to measure their performance and hold them accountable for it. The most common types of initiatives to measure and improve health care quality are public reporting programs and pay-for-performance programs. Under public reporting programs, providersâ€™ performance on quality measures is publicly disseminated to
H51|Politics, Hospital Behavior, and Health Care Spending|This paper examines the link between legislative politics, hospital behavior, and health care spending. When trying to pass sweeping legislation, congressional leaders can attract votes by adding targeted provisions that steer money toward the districts of reluctant legislators. This targeted spending provides tangible local benefits that legislators can highlight when fundraising or running for reelection. We study a provision - Section 508 – that was added to the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (MMA). Section 508 created a pathway for hospitals to apply to get their Medicare payment rates increased. We find that hospitals represented by members of the House of Representatives who voted ‘Yea’ on the MMA were significantly more likely to receive a 508 waiver than hospitals represented by members who voted ‘Nay.’ Following the payment increase generated by the 508 program, recipient hospitals treated more patients, increased payroll, hired nurses, added new technology, raised CEO pay, and ultimately increased their spending by over $100 million annually. Section 508 recipient hospitals formed the Section 508 Hospital Coalition, which spent millions of dollars lobbying Congress to extend the program. After the vote on the MMA and before the vote to reauthorize the 508 program, members of Congress with a 508 hospital in their district received a 22% increase in total campaign contributions and a 65% increase in contributions from individuals working in the health care industry in the members’ home states. Our work demonstrates a pathway through which the link between politics and Medicare policy can dramatically affect US health spending.
H51|The political economy of diagnosis-related groups|A well-established political economic literature has shown as multi-level governance affects the inefficiency of public expenditures. Yet, this expectation has not been empirically tested on health expenditures. We provide a political economy interpretation of the variation in the prices of 6 obstetric DRGs using Italy as a case study. Italy offers a unique institutional setting since its 21 regional governments can decide whether to adopt the national DRG system or to adjust/waive it. We investigate whether the composition and characteristics of regional governments do matter for the average DRG level and, if so, why. To address both questions, we first use a panel fixed effects model exploiting the results of 66 elections between 2000 and 2013 (i.e., 294 obs) to estimate the link between DRGs and the composition and characteristics of regional governments. Second, we investigate these results exploiting the implementation of a budget constraint policy through a difference-in-differences framework. The incidence of physicians in the regional government explains the variation of DRGs with low technological intensity, such as normal newborn, but not of those with high technological intensity, as severely premature newborn. We also observe a decrease in the average levels of DRGs after the budget constraint implementation, but the magnitude of this decrease depends primarily on the presence of physicians among politicians and the political alignment between the regional and the national government. To understand which kind of role the relevance of the political components plays (i.e., waste vs. better defined DRGs), we check whether any of the considered political economy variables have a positive impact on the quality of regional obstetric systems finding no effect. These results are a first evidence that a system of standardized prices, such as the DRGs, is not immune to political pressures.
H51|Does Maternal Education Affect Childhood Immunization Rates? Evidence from Turkey|We study the causal effect of maternal education on childhood immunization rates. We use the Compulsory Education Law (CEL) of 1997, and the differentiation in its implementation across regions, as instruments for schooling of young mothers in Turkey. The CEL increased the compulsory years of schooling of those born after 1986 from 5 to 8 years. We find that education of mothers increases the probability of completing the full course of DPT and Hepatitis B vaccinations for their children. Furthermore, education increases the age of first marriage and birth, changes women`s and their spouse’s labour market status, and significantly affects women`s attitude towards spousal violence against women and gender discrimination in a manner that empowers women.
H51|Does hospital competition improve efficiency? The effect of the patient choice reform in England|We use the 2006 relaxation of constraints on patient choice of hospital in the English NHS to investigate the effect of hospital competition on dimensions of efficiency including indicators of resource management (admissions per bed, bed occupancy rate, proportion of day cases, and cancelled elective operations) and costs (reference cost index for overall and elective activity, cleaning services costs, laundry and linen costs). We employ a quasi differences‐in‐differences approach and estimate seemingly unrelated regressions and unconditional quantile regressions with data on hospital trusts from 2002/2003 to 2010/2011. Our findings suggest that increased competition had mixed effects on efficiency. An additional equivalent rival increased admissions per bed by 1.1%, admissions per doctor by 0.9% and the proportion of day cases by 0.38 percentage points, but it also increased the number of cancelled elective operations by 2.5%.
