D16|Sharing Economy in Macroeconomics: Collaborative Consumption and Durable Goods|This paper studies the implications of the sharing or collaborative economy on the rest of the economy. During the last decade, the so-called collaborative economy has experienced an intensive process of expansion, mainly in certain tourism and transport services, by renting household durables stock excess capacity. Technological progress and the development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have removed barriers to market access and information constraints, which provides households with a marketplace to rent goods and services produced by using household capital. In this paper we propose a general equilibrium theoretical framework within which to study the collaborative economy sector, together with both the market production and household production sectors. Our model considers that production within the collaborative economy falls between market production and domestic production, and combines some features of both environments, but di¤ers in others. We found that a positive neutral technological shock to market production has a positive impact on the accumulation of durable goods, consistent with the data. By contrast, a positive productivity shock to the sharing economy sector reduces durables investment and increases business capital investment. Finally, an investment-speci?c technological shock to durables has a positive e¤ect on household capital but a negative one on business capital.
D16|Understanding the Sharing Economy|The sharing economy appears to have been growing rapidly. This paper contributes to the debate about its definition and measurement through an analysis of interviews conducted with UK platforms identifying themselves as part of the sharing economy. We conclude there are common features that enable a sufficiently clear definitional boundary, namely peer-to-peer digital matching and greater utilisation of under-used assets or skills. We find that the larger sharing economy platforms reduce costs and entry barriers for smaller platforms, contributing to a rich ecosystem. This implies a useful definition should include business-to-business peer-matching transactions, as well as business-to-consumer transactions. In addition to their economic impacts â€“ transactions that would not otherwise occur, lower consumer prices and additional choice, the scope to earn additional income in a flexible manner, and the greater use of assets with spare capacity â€“ all the interviewees expressed overt non-financial motivations, such as positive environmental impact, contributing to the community, and building trust. We argue this common intrinsic motivation means measurement of the sharing economy for some purposes should also include those platforms which enable free rather than monetary exchanges.
D16|Diffusion of Shared Goods in Consumer Coalitions. An Agent-Based Model|This paper focuses on the process of coalition formation conditioning the common decision to adopt a shared good, which cannot be afforded by an average single consumer and whose use cannot be exhausted by any single consumer. An agent based model is developed to study the interplay between these two processes: coalition formation and diffusion of shared goods. Coalition formation is modelled in an evolutionary game theoretic setting, while adoption uses elements from both the Bass and the threshold models. Coalitions formation sets the conditions for adoption, while diffusion influences the consequent formation of coalitions. Results show that both coalitions and diffusion are subject to network effects and have an impact on the information flow though the population of consumers. Large coalitions are preferred over small ones since individual cost is lower, although it increases if higher quantities are purchased collectively. The paper concludes by connecting the model conceptualisation to the on-going discussion of diffusion of sustainable goods, discussing related policy implications.
D16|How Should Benefits and Costs Be Discounted in an Intergenerational Context?|Should governments, in discounting the future benefits and costs of public projects, use a discount rate that declines over time? The argument for a declining discount rate is a simple one: if the discount rates that will be applied in the future are persistent, and if the analyst can assign probabilities to these discount rates, this will result in a declining schedule of certainty-equivalent discount rates. A growing empirical literature estimates models of long-term interest rates and uses them to forecast the declining discount rate schedule. I briefly review this literature, focusing on models for the United States. This literature has, however, been criticized for a lack of connection to the theory of project evaluation. In cost-benefit analysis, the net benefits of a project in year t (in consumption units) are to be discounted to the present at the rate at which society would trade consumption in year t for consumption in the present. With simplifying assumptions, this leads to the Ramsey discounting formula. The Ramsey formula results in a declining certainty-equivalent discount rate if the rate of growth in consumption is uncertain and if shocks to consumption are correlated over time. Using the extended Ramsey formula to estimate a numerical schedule of certainty-equivalent discount rates is, however, challenging.
D16|Income-related health inequality in Portugal|The Portuguese health care system is based on principles of equity and efficiency. Despite that, it appears that equality has not been fully realized owing to differences in access [Dixon and Massialos (2000)] or self-assessed health [Van Doorslaer and Koolman (2004)]. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the degree of income-related inequality in self-reported health in Portugal using different database and methods than those used by Van Doorslaer and Koolman (2004). This study applies the methods developed by Wagstaff and Van Doorslaer (1994) to measure the degree of income-related inequality in self-reported health by means of concentration indices. The results show that significant inequalities in self-reported ill-health exist and favour groups with higher income. Nonetheless, when compared with a similar study [Van Doorslaer et al. (1997)], the estimates for income related inequality suggest that Portugal in 1998/1999 ranks in the middle of the European countries. The most important contributors to health inequality are income, activity status and education. Regional differences, by contrast, do not exert any systematic influence. Reductions in pro-rich health inequality can be achieved by reducing the effect of income on health or reducing income inequality, or both.
