L79|Sukuk: a potential for stability and development in the GCC|This paper explores the significance of Islamic Sukuk instruments for stability in the GCC. As a result of the financial crisis of 2007-2008, interest in financial stability has increased. Islamic scholars suggest that Islamic financial institutions and products have the potential to contribute in achieving a more stable economic environment. This paper analyses Sukuk, an Islamic financial instrument with both bond and equity traits; and how it can contribute to achieving a more sound and resilient economic environment in the GCC. Findings suggest that Sukuk do have the potential to effectively contribute to the GCC’s economic stability; as long as they adhere to the pure Islamic financial principles and avoid trying to be comparable to conventional bonds. Currently, however there appears a heavy reliance on shorter term issuances, along with the majority of issuances in the USD, a heavy reliance on real estate as both a means of financing an underlying collateral in Islamic securitization; elements which could be destabilising especially during destress. The originality of this paper lies in its empirical contribution, as it, for the first, time sets out systematically the characteristics of Sukuk issuance in the GCC region with respect to Sukuk maturity, issuance currency and sectoral distribution. It also assesses the various Sukuk structures and the underlying risks involved; as well as the impact of collateral in Islamic securitization.

L79|The Rise, Expansion, and Decline of the Italian Wool-Based Textile Industries, 1100-1730: a study in international competition, transaction costs, and comparative advantage|This (revised) study seeks to examine the rise, expansion, and ultimate decline of the Italian wool-based textile industries over a period of six centuries (from ca. 1100 to ca. 1730). An international trade model combining transaction costs and comparative advantage is employed to explain the changing fortunes of the Italian cloth industries over these six centuries, in competition with their major northern rivals, in the Low Countries and England, who fought for market dominance both within Europe and abroad, in the Islamic world, in particular the MamlÅ«k and then Ottoman domains in the Levant (eastern Mediterranean). The transaction costs model is used to explain in particular which branches of this textile industry fared better and which fared worse during the Commercial Revolution era (ca. 1100-ca.1320), the so-called Great Depression era (ca. 1320-ca. 1460), the ensuing economic recovery and Price Revolution era (ca. 1460-ca. 1620), the General Crisis of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries (ca. 1620-ca.1740), to the eve of the Industrial Revolution era. One of the major errors in the literature is the failure to distinguish between the two main branches of the wool-based cloth industries, the technology of their industrial production, their relative prices, and markets, and the impact of transaction costs in international trade. For much of this era, the leading branch was the luxury-oriented woollens industry (Old Draperies), based on very fine, short-stapled English and then Spanish merino wools, producing fulled, heavy-weight, and generally high priced cloths. In the earlier and later periods, the other branch prevailed (New Draperies): the lighter-weight (unfulled), generally coarser and cheaper fabrics that were either full worsteds (cheap, coarse, long-stapled wools) or serges (hybrids with worsted warps and woollen wefts). The transition from a predominance of the lighter, worsted-style fabrics to the heavy-weight woollens, throughout western Europe, took place from the 1290s, with a rapid rise in transaction costs that were the direct and indirect result of a spreading stain of international warfare, especially injurious to overland trade routes, combined with a drastic fall in population, that engulfed most of Europe and the Mediterranean basin until the 1460s. That rise in transportation and transaction costs (determined by market scale economies) set a cost-price floor below which international trade in cheaper textiles became unprofitable: so much so that most West European wool-based industries re-oriented their production towards luxury markets, with far higher prices sustained by price-making monopolistic competition better able to withstand the rise of such costs, an impossible solution for those marketing cheap textiles as price-takers in Mediterranean markets. Such problems were less severe for the Italian industries, whose markets were chiefly in the Mediterranean; and thus the transition to luxury production was far less complete than in the north. The comparative advantage model is based on the price that woollen-cloth producers in both the Low Countries and Italy had to pay in that luxury re-orientation: a total dependence on the finest English wools as the prime component of luxury quality. From the late 1330s, English monarchs took advantage of that dependence by imposing exorbitant taxes on wool-exports, with even higher taxes imposed on Italian merchants, ultimately depriving them of almost all such wools by the early fifteenth century. At the same time, English clothiers were able to weave luxury-quality cloths from the very same wools, but free of any such taxes, giving them an almost insuperable cost advantage over all foreign woollen manufacturers. But England's comparative advantage in its wool supply, though finally giving them mastery of northern markets for luxury woollens, was undermined, during the later fifteenth, early sixteenth century, by the development of fine but much cheaper merino wools in Spain, which Italians could acquire with lower transport costs. The other change undermining the supremacy of English and other woollens industry was the sharp fall in transaction costs by the late fifteenth, early sixteenth centuries: with the decline in warfare, the recovery and growth of population, and with technological advances in both ocean and land transport, especially the latter with a major transition in long-distance trade from maritime to overland continental routes. Along with that decline in costs came a revival and expansion of the lighter, cheaper textile industries, though chiefly in the Low Countries and England, more so than in Italy, despite the continued predominance of Mediterranean markets. For woollens, the Italian industries, especially the Venetian, gained the comparative advantage in wools: with much cheaper access to (now more expensive) Spanish merinos. But in the Mediterranean and especially Ottoman markets the English finally gained supremacy over both the Florentine and Venetian woollens industries, by the later seventeenth century, from a new comparative advantage, in capital formation: from superior business organization (the new joint stock companies) and naval power (large, heavily gunned, swift carracks). The so-called General Crisis era of the later seventeenth century had again favoured maritime routes, and thus sea-power, over land routes. At the same time the Tudor-Stuart enclosure movements, in transforming English sheep -- from small sheep with fine short-stapled to larger (meatier) sheep with coarser, long-stapled fleeces, gave England's worsted-style New Draperies a comparative advantage in wool supplies over all its continental rivals, including the Italian; and by the 1730s, both branches of the Italian wool-based textile industries had succumbed to foreign competition, and become moribund.

L79|Los conflictos por el agua en el País Valenciano durante la etapa feudal: el ejemplo de los molinos|In places like the Valencian Region, where the climate is arid, the flow rate of the rivers is irregular, and irrigation is essential if agrarian returns are to increase, the way water was distributed among irrigators often gave rise to clashes between them. This paper begins with an analysis of the mechanisms that were used in the irrigated areas of Valencia, during the feudal era, to prevent these kinds of conflicts from getting out of hand. It then focuses on the disputes that arose between farmers and millers. Contrary to what is usually claimed, there is no decisive evidence to show that the millers were a permanent cause of such troubles, which only reached a dangerous level of intensity in certain places at certain times

L79|Fish stock endogeneity in a harvest function: ‘El Niño’ effects on the Chilean jack mackerel fishery|There are several examples of pelagic fisheries that have experiencedfishing collapse when facing downward abundance cycles. Improvingunderstanding about pelagic catch’s stock dependence can help avoid newcases of fishing collapse. This paper analyses the possible endogeneity ofthe fish stock variable in a pelagic fishery harvest function. The harvestfunction is estimated using panel data and ‘El Niño’ episodes as instrumentalvariable for the Chilean jack mackerel biomass. This strategy producesconsistent estimates of the fish biomass coefficient. The paper makes two contributions. First, it corrects for endogeneity of the fish stock variable,an issue often underestimated in empirical fishery economics. Secondly,it shows that ‘El Niño’ episodes have negative effects on the Chilean jackmackerel biomass.
L79|Production Efficiency and Diversification in Mexican Coffee-Producing Districts| Coffee production system is analyzed for 24 municipios (districts) in Veracruz, Mexico, from 1997 to 2002. A stochastic frontier approach is used to estimate an input distance function and to evaluate production efficiency. Results show the production process to be stable over time despite global price fluctuations. Production of staple crop (corn) with either coffee or other cash crops results in increased efficiency as a result of the economies of complementarity, while production of coffee with other cash crops leads to lower efficiency. Factors contributing to higher efficiency included higher population density, road availability, and higher altitude, typically associated with production of higher-quality coffee.

L79|La industria del cemento en Colombia|Este documento analiza el comportamiento de la industria del cemento en Colombia en las últimas décadas. En particular, estudia la relación que existe entre el precio y las cantidades producidas de cemento durante el período 1980 - 2006, así como los determinantes del comportamiento de estas variables durante el período 1994 - 2006. Los resultados muestran que, como consecuencia de la crisis económica de finales de siglo pasado, la relación de largo plazo entre precios y cantidades tuvo un fuerte desequilibrio, que se ha corregido parcialmente en los años recientes. Además, se encuentra evidencia de una conducta estratégica en la fijación del precio, de acuerdo al comportamiento de la demanda. Abstract This paper analyses the functioning of Colombia´s cement industry in the last decades. In particular, it explores the dynamic relation among real cement prices and output for period 1980 - 2006, and studies their determinants using data for the period 1994 - 2006. The evidence suggests that the severe recession of the late 1990s caused a disequilibrium in the long term relationship between prices and quantities, which has been partially corrected. In addition, results indicate a strategic behavior in price determination, depending on demand conditions.
L79|The Rise, Expansion, and Decline of the Italian Cloth Industries, 1100 - 1730: a study in conjoncture, transaction costs, and comparative advantage|This study of the Italian wool-based textile industries (woollens, worsteds, and serges) seeks to examine its rise, expansion, and ultimate decline, over a period of five centuries (from ca. 1200 to ca. 1730) in the context of both international competition and economic conjoncture, in the context of the major macro-economic and demographic changes that the European economy experienced during these five centuries. The story commences during the so-called 'Commercial Revolution' era of the thirteenth-century when the Franco-Flemish cloth industries of north-west European dominated the international markets in a very wide range of these textiles, even in the Mediterranean basin. From the 1290s, and then into the better know period of the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453) the European economy suffered from the ravages of ever more widespread and debilitating warfare, throughout the Mediterranean basin and western Europe, and then from various factors, including plagues, that led to serious depopulation. The consequences led to a severe rise in transportation and transaction costs that gravely undermined the profitability of long-distance trade in cheaper textiles. That, in turn forced most textile manufacturers dependent on long-distance trade, and especially those who had operated as price-takers, to re-orient their export-based production to far higher priced, indeed luxury textiles, which could better sustain the burden of rising transactions costs, especially in acting as 'price-makers' engaged in monopolistic competition. That industrial-commercial transformation can be seen in the textile industries of northern France, the Low Countries, and England; but also those in Catalonia and above all in Italy: principally Tuscany and Lombardy. In so far as warfare and rising transaction costs limited the importation of even luxury textiles from north-west Europe, the Italian cloth industries thereby gained a far larger share of Mediterranean markets. This study focuses in particular on the ensuring history of the Florentine woollen cloth industry in the later Middle Ages. One price that all of these luxury-oriented cloth industries had to pay was steeply rising tax burdens on exported English wools; for the prime determinant of luxury quality in these textiles was the use of the finer grade English wools, the best in the world, until the development (through breeding and management) of Spanish merino wools, which finally succeeded in rivalling and then surpassing the English by the later sixteenth century. By the sixteenth century, with a reduction in European warfare and with renewed population growth, substantial economic growth, and significant innovations in transportation, transactions costs fell, and fell enough to make long-distance trade in cheaper textiles once more profitable; and that is reflected in product changes in the Florentine textile industry, which increasingly used Spanish merino wools in place of the English. But the most important events in the history of the Italian textile industries was the sudden rise of the Venetian cloth industry from the early to mid-sixteenth century, reaching a peak in the early seventeenth century, and then experiencing an equally rapid decline, in the famous of English textile competition, by the agency of the new Levant Company, which gained major advantages over the Italians in the large Ottoman Empire. The study concludes by examining the nature of those English advantages, which lay far more in the commercial (and transportation sphere) than in the industrial sphere, in terms of both traditional heavy weight woollens (made from Spanish wools) and the lighter, coarser, and cheaper fabrics of the English New Draperies (benefiting from a transformation in English wool production, from the Tudor-Stuart Enclosures). In sum: a study of comparative advantage in five centuries of international trade, in wool-based textiles, in terms of transaction costs, inputs (wools), and commercial organization.
L79|A General Equilibrium Model of the World Wool Market|This paper presents the theoretical and numerical structure of WOOLGEM – a general equilibrium model of the world wool market which treats raw wool, wool textiles and wool garments as heterogeneous commodities. The model divides the world wool market into nine geographical regions and production in each region amongst eight major industrial sectors, seven of which represent different production stages for wool and one representing the nonwool economy. The wool industrial sectors cover the full spectrum of activities from the production of greasy wool to wool garments. We use WOOLGEM to quantify the effects on Australian wool producers’ welfare of industry levies used to fund research and development at different stages of the wool chain.

Auch aus den Berechnungen der aktuellen Zuschussbedarfsrelation zum Schülernebenansatz ergibt sich Reformbedarf. Auf Grund der Neujustierungen der Hauptansatzstaffeln, der Schülergewichte und der Vervielfältiger wird es zwar gegenüber dem Status quo zu gewissen Verwerfungen bei den Zuweisungen an die einzelnen Kommunen kommen, eine veränderte Bedarfssituation macht dies allerdings auch notwendig.
L79|La pesca y sus fluctuaciones en el puerto de A Coruña, 1914-1960|This article aims to analyse the evolution of the fishing activity in the port of A Coruña during a period of transition between the traditional fishing model of the late nineteenth century, and the capitalist model of the second half of the twentieth century, tracing the main stages and the factors that determined the fishing captures. In order to do this, I have mainly used the reports of the port authority, as well as the data collected by the so-called contribución de utilidades de la riqueza mobiliaria, which has led to calculate the results of the most outstanding town fishing entrepreneurs. We have observed that A Coruña became one of the most important national fishing ports, though the evolution of the local fleet and the fishing captures was distorted by frequent and accentuated fluctuations, which affected both this activity and the Iinked urban economic sectors.
L79|The Mid-1990s EITC Expansion: Aggregate Labor Supply Effects and Economic Incidence|A key attraction of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is that it encourages work. But EITC-induced increases in labor supply may drive wages down, permitting employers of low-skill labor to capture some of the intended transfer and negatively impacting workers in the same labor markets who are ineligible for the credit. I exploit variation in tax treatment across family types and skill levels to identify the effect of a large EITC expansion in the mid 1990s on the female labor market, using a semiparametric reweighting strategy to decompose changes in the wage distribution into changes in skill-specific prices and quantities. The EITC expansion induced many low- and mid-skill single mothers to enter the labor force. Contemporaneous technical change led to increases in wages, but these were smaller than they would have been with a stable EITC. Ceteris paribus, low-skill single mothers keep only 70 cents of every dollar they receive through the EITC. Employers of low-skill labor capture 72 cents, 30 cents from single mothers plus 43 cents from ineligible (childless) workers whose after-tax incomes fall when the EITC is expanded. The net transfer to workers is less than a third of the amount spent on the program.
L79|Auction Price Anomalies: Evidence from Wool Auctions in Australia| Using detailed Australian wool auction data we test for further evidence of pricing anomalies at sequential auctions. We find that an anomaly frequently exists and order is frequently endogenously determined. Moreover, prices increase through some sales and decrease through others. We examine whether it is possible to explain the variation in the anomaly across sales and conclude that there is no systematic relationship between the direction of the price anomaly and the characteristics of the wool or the auction. We do, however, find evidence that an anomaly is more likely in longer sales. Copyright © 2004 Economic Society of Australia..
L79|Causas, intereses y desarrollo histórico de la acción colectiva empresarial en el ámbito agrario: el caso del cooperativismo en el sector oleícola|The objective of this paper is explore the roots of the co-operative movement in the food oil sector from a historical perspective through a bibliographical review of the diverse studies carried out at the regional and provincial levels in Spain. It explores the causes of co-operatives’ creation and the profile of the farmers who benefited from the experience. It ascertains the level of business development in the organisational, human and technological spheres, analysing the conditioning factors limiting co-operative action to the stockpiling and production areas, with little penetration in cooperation at the second level of bottling and refining. An empirical study is made of evolution in one of the Spanish provinces where the incidence of this type of co-operative is significant.
L79|Changing rules for regulation of Icelandic fisheries|From the 1950s to the mid-seventies, Iceland’s efforts in international diplomacy were largely devoted to convincing other nations that Icelanders should control and utilise the resources of the waters within 12, then 50 and finally 200 nautical miles around the island. During the last quarter of the twentieth century, Icelandic politicians have devoted considerable time and effort to the debate on how to organise the utilisation of these resources and in what way the revenues from this harvest should be distributed. This paper gives a short account of the development of regulatory reforms in four types of Icelandic fisheries. None of these reformatory processes can be said to be a replica of any of the other processes. It seems apparent on the face of things that each reformatory process is unique and distinct from the others, except in its final outcome, the rule of the ITQs. However, this conclusion may be too short sighted. From the earliest history of regulatory reforms, it is evident that the ITQ system which eventually came into being was not the intended outcome. There is a common pattern for all the fisheries, however. First of all, serious attempts to reform management practices start when the fishery has collapsed or is close to collapse. Secondly, the first thing that stakeholders do is close the club that has access to the given fishery. Thirdly, a variety of rules are implemented to allocate participation rights when the club of participants has been closed. Fourthly, prior to the invention of the ITQ system, prices were used to manage fisheries in Iceland. It may be that management of fisheries by ITQs rather than through some form of taxes or fees has historical rather than logical roots.
L79|Fixed wage or share: Contingent contract renewal and skipper motivation|Fishermen around the world are usually remunerated by shares. Iceland is no exception in that respect. The fixed wage systems,that have been tried out, have been short- lived and their utilization limited. The fundamental question asked in this paper is: Why do almost all vessel owners use the same remuneration principles? The answer offered is that the circumstances under which fishing is conducted play a vital role here. Surveillance of the conduct of employees is almost impossible. Hence, vessel owners must develop some system for motivating workers and to discourage shirking. It is shown that sharing is better than alternative forms of remuneration in that respect. The production unit is a small platform that is not easily abandoned during a trip. The product ofr a given trip is well- defined. All of these factors help to explain the prevalence of sharing in fisheries.
L79|Power production and the price of electricity: An analysis of a phaseout of Swedish nuclear power|In this paper the effects of a phaseout of Swedish nuclear power combined with different CO2 emission goals, are studied. The vital relationship between the national electricity market and the regional markets for heating is modeled in detail in a dynamic partial equilibrium environment. It is shown that phasing out nuclear power while restricting future CO2 emissions to the 1990 level implies a significant increase in electricity prices and a substantial loss in welfare.
L79|Causality and Efficiency in the Coffee Futures Market|Tests for causality and rationality in the coffee futures market were carried out using data from the New York Market. Tests of causality indicated that futures prices strongly influence variations in spot price eight weeks or more to maturity. However, beginning seven weeks to maturity there seems to be a strong causal relationship going from futures to spot and from spot to futures. Risk constancy or neutrality, equality of risk premium and spot price, and efficiency were rejected for the period 18, 51, and 33 weeks or more to maturity. However, simultaneity of risk neutrality and efficiency was accepted for contracts with 55-77 weeks to maturity. The general conclusion from this study is that coffee futures market can be used as an indicator of spot market prices for contracts with 55-77 weeks to maturity. While benefits can be obtained through short term adjustment of available stock and making use of quality storage facilities, planning longer term planting and marketing decisions (e.g., ≥ 77 weeks) on the basis of futures market price can result in misallocation of resources and welfare loss.
