P52|Wirtschaftspolitik-Fehlorientierung des Westens nach 1989: Bankenkrise, Globalisierungs-Ordnungsdefizit und Desintegrationsdruck|Der Zerfall der sozialistischen Wirtschaftssysteme vollzog sich Ende der 1980er Jahre in den Ländern Osteuropas und der Sowjetunion, wobei osteuropäische EU-Länder einen ökonomischen Aufholprozess begonnen haben. 1991 hat aber der Westen teilweise keine vernünftigen Konsequenzen aus der beginnenden Systemtransformation gezogen und eine Phase geringer politischer Selbstdisziplin bei manchen westlichen Regierungen bzw. eine Expansion des Populismus - erklärbar unter Bezug auf Harry-Johnson-Ansätze und Identity Economics - begonnen. Die Transatlantische Bankenkrise ergab sich aus überzogener Bankenderegulierung in den USA und UK, die faktisch auch die Länder der Eurozone zur Bankenderegulierung brachte und sich absehbar wiederholen könnte; auch als Folge des BREXIT. Bei der Digitalisierung fehlt ein Ordnungsrahmen. Dessen Fehlen hat zu einer Art digitalem Sozialismus geführt – mit negativen Konsequenzen für Effizienz in der Marktwirtschaft und für die Demokratie. Mit dem Populismus in UK, dem strukturellen US-Populismus – inklusive Anti-Multilateralismus - und dem Anti-Liberalismus in Teilen der EU(27) steht der Westen vor einer Abstiegs- und die EU vor einer politischen Spannungsphase; eine sinnvolle Reformagenda wäre eine Stabilisierungschance für die EU, wird aber teilweise blockiert, während zugleich verfrühte Vergemeinschaftung, etwa bei Einlagensicherung, droht. Der US-Sachverständigenrat unter Trump sieht die USA wohlfahrtsmäßig vor Nordeuropa, was eine Fehlsicht ist.

P52|Extreme Temperature and Extreme Violence across Age and Gender: Evidence from Russia|We examine the relationship between extreme temperatures and violent mortality across Russian regions, with implications for the social costs of climate change. We assess the unequal impact of temperature shocks across gender and age groups by exploring a dataset on temperature and violence in Russia, between the years 1989 and 2015. Hot days lead to an increase in both female and male victims, one hot day resulting in the loss of 1,579 person-years of life for men, and 642 for women. However, the likelihood of victimization during weekends rises noticeably for women, with women between 25 and 59 more victimized on weekends. Our results suggest that female victimization on hot days would be mitigated by increases in regional income and job opportunities, and on cold days, by decreasing the consumption of spirits.

They were constructed using a statistical analysis of the drivers of well-being specific to these population groups. These indicators are complementary to the indicator Well-being here and now that measures the average development in well-being in Belgium.
P52|The Political Economy of a Northern Ireland Border Poll|Given the increased prominence of a border poll in Ireland, particularly following the outcome of the Brexit referendum, this paper provides an initial assessment of some of the issues that are likely to become central in any debate on this issue. We examine the relative income and growth position of Northern Ireland within a UK and Irish regional framework over time. We further compare, and contrast, in detail aspects of the structure of both economies on the island of Ireland in the areas of educational attainment, trade orientation and the role of FDI. The paper goes on to analyse other relevant issues, such as the relative strength and weaknesses of the healthcare systems and the factors determining the potential economic cost of Irish unification. The objective of the research is to initiate an evidence-based approach to the question of a border poll and to provide an initial indication of the breadth of detail and analysis required for any debate to proceed in a meaningful manner.
P52|Social Policy in Mexico and Argentina|This paper is a comparison between two programs implemented to combat poverty in Latin America: Prospera (Prosper) in Mexico and AsignaciÃ³n Universal por Hijo (Universal Assignment for Child) in Argentina. The first section offers a review of the emergence of the welfare state, examining economic and urban development in both countries and the underlying trends of social policy instruments. The analysis is based on the political nature of social problems and the actions undertaken to confront them. The paper offers a theoretical perspective, often questioning the very foundation of the social policy that serves as the main framework for the social programs, in order to present the policies' scope, successes, and disadvantages with reference to social equity and the well-being of their participants.
P52|Moving Into the Slow Lane|Growth in much of CESEE will remain healthy by post-crisis standards, but has passed its peak. We expect most economies to slow from here, reflecting weaker external demand and domestic capacity constraints. Global trade tensions, structural weakness in the eurozone and Brexit all pose downside risks to our forecasts.
P52|Osteuropa trotzt dem globalen Gegenwind|This publication is available in German language only. For a brief English summary see further below. Die Konjunktur in den mittel-, ost- und südosteuropäischen Ländern (MOSOEL) kühlt sich zwar ab, aber viel weniger als noch im Frühjahr erwartet Die Prognosen für heuer wurden für die Mehrheit der Länder nach oben revidiert. Vor allem in der EU-MOE-Region hat sich das Wachstum vom Abschwung im Euro-Raum recht deutlich abgekoppelt. In einigen Ländern mehren sich sogar die Anzeichen einer Überhitzung, die allerdings nur in Rumänien Anlass zur Sorge gibt. Die Westbalkanländer profitieren von steigenden FDI-Zuflüssen, mehrere GUS-Länder von der expansiven Fiskalpolitik. In Russland dagegen hat der restriktive fiskalpolitische Kurs die Wirtschaft an den Rand einer Rezession gebracht. Die Wirtschaftskrise in der Türkei erwies sich zwar tiefer als früher erwartet, dürfte aber spätestens 2020 überwunden sein. Insbesondere die Visegrád-Staaten gehören zu Österreichs wichtigsten Wirtschaftspartnern. Ihnen waren im Jahr 2018 mehr als 10% des österreichischen Güterhandels, 20% der Einkommen aus Direktinvestitionen sowie 40% der Auslandsforderungen österreichischer Banken zuzurechnen. Gleichzeitig sind sie auch EU-Mitglieder mit brisanten politischen und wirtschaftlichen Herausforderungen, von welchen auch Österreich nicht unberührt bleiben wird. English Summary Eastern Europe standing firm in face of global headwinds The economy in the Central, East and Southeast European countries (CESEE) is cooling down, but much less than expected in the spring the forecasts for this year have been revised upwards for the majority of countries. Particularly in the EU-CEE region, growth has decoupled quite clearly from the downturn in the euro area. In several countries there are even signs of overheating, although only in Romania this is a cause for concern. The Western Balkans are benefiting from rising FDI inflows, while several CIS countries from expansionary fiscal policy. In Russia, on the other hand, the restrictive fiscal policy has brought the economy to the brink of recession. Although the economic crisis in Turkey proved to be deeper than previously expected, it should be overcome by 2020 at the latest. The Visegrád countries, in particular, prove very important for the Austrian economy. In 2018, they accounted for more than 10% of Austrian goods trade, 20% of income generated by Austrian investment abroad, as well as 40% of foreign claims of Austrian banks. At the same time, they are among the EU Member States facing increasing political and economic challenges, by which Austria will not be unaffected.

P52|Strong Growth Amid Increased Negative Risks|The outlook for growth in CESEE remains generally positive, but downside risks have increased significantly since our last forecast. The main areas of concern are the developing US-China trade war and the potential for a renewed outbreak of the eurozone crisis.
P52|Riding the Global Growth Wave|Aggregate real GDP growth in CESEE is at its strongest level for six years, and in 2017 all economies in the region expanded for the first time in a decade. External conditions are highly supportive of growth in CESEE. All the big engines of the global economy – the US, China and the eurozone – are expanding strongly together for the first time since 2010. The coordinated global upswing has further to run, and we expect CESEE economies to continue to benefit in the coming years. EU-CEE and Turkey will grow strongly during our forecast period, while activity in the Western Balkans will pick up from recent years. The CIS and Ukraine will remain the regional laggards, but will continue to recover slowly. We do not think that any economy in the region is ‘overheating’, although there are growing risks in Romania and Turkey. We expect inflation to remain very subdued in most of CESEE during the forecast period. In parts of CESEE, large-scale Ukrainian migration is helping to relieve labour market tightness. Wage increases in most of CESEE have been strong, but are concentrated largely in the manufacturing sector, and have been more than offset by rising labour productivity and non-price competitiveness. External competitiveness is not in danger. Across the region, investment will rise faster than headline real GDP growth in 2018-2020, driven by low interest rates, high capacity utilisation, stronger confidence, EU funds and still low base effects. Most countries have seen their export/GDP shares rise in the past decade, which increases their ability to take advantage of the current upswing. Many are moving up the value chain. Banking sectors in CESEE are generally on a much stronger footing than a few years ago. However, the old pre-crisis, highly leveraged model reliant on foreign inflows is mostly a thing of the past, meaning that credit growth will be relatively low by historical standards in the coming years. Downside risks to regional growth emanating from local and global factors are significant. In particular, we are worried about a trade war, the exit of major central banks from extraordinarily loose monetary policy, pockets of high corporate and government leverage, east/west EU splits, the undermining of institutional independence in some countries, geopolitical tensions, the Ukraine crisis, and potential spill-overs from a renewed outbreak of volatility in the eurozone, or a Chinese debt crisis. Convergence with Western European income levels will proceed in the long term. However, there is a risk that specialisation in parts of the supply chain where little value is created will condemn the region to a permanent ‘semi-periphery trap’.
P52|MOSOE: Konjunkturzenit überschritten|This publication is available in German language only. For a brief English summary see further below. MOSOE Konjunkturzenit überschritten Die jüngsten Statistiken deuten auf ein weiterhin robustes BIP-Wachstum in den meisten Ländern Mittel‑, Ost- und Südosteuropas (MOSOEL) hin. Der konjunkturelle Höhepunkt scheint allerdings bereits überschritten zu sein. Einerseits lässt die Dynamik der privaten Konsumnachfrage leicht nach, andererseits dämpft die Konjunkturabkühlung im Euro-Raum die Exportentwicklung vieler MOSOEL. Die Investitionen steigen weiterhin kräftig an, getrieben in erster Linie von EU-Transfers in der EU-MOE-Region und von ausländischen Direktinvestitionen im Westbalkan. Ein deutlicher Wachstumseinbruch ist heuer nur in Rumänien und der Türkei zu erwarten – Ländern, deren Wirtschaft sich bislang in einem Zustand der „Überhitzung“ befand. Vor dem Hintergrund der österreichischen EU-Ratspräsidentschaft und divergierender Handelspolitiken der weltgrößten Volkswirtschaften werden auch die immer engeren wirtschaftlichen Verflechtungen Österreichs mit den MOSOEL analysiert. Insbesondere die Visegrád-Staaten gewinnen für den österreichischen Güterhandel, Tourismus und auch als Investitionsstandorte an Gewicht. Österreich präsentiert sich als Top-10-Exportdestination für sieben der MOSOEL, für acht zählt es zu den zehn wichtigsten Ländern für Importe, und für siebzehn Länder rangiert Österreich unter den Top-10-Investoren. Ausgewählte Indikatoren zu den österreichischen Wirtschaftsbeziehungen mit den MOSOEL können kostenlos über interaktive Visualisierungen erkundet werden. English Summary CESEE Growth has passed its peak The latest statistics point to ongoing robust GDP growth in most countries of Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE). However, the growth peak seems to have already been passed. On the one hand, private consumer demand is weakening slightly; on the other hand, the economic slowdown in the eurozone is dampening the export performance of many CESEE countries. Investment continues to grow strongly, driven primarily by EU transfers in the EU-CEE and by foreign direct investment in the Western Balkans. A significant slump in growth this year can only be expected in Romania and Turkey, countries whose economies have been ‘overheating’. In the context of the Austrian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and diverging trade policies of the two largest economies in the world, we analyse the deepening economic relations between Austria and the CESEE countries. The Visegrád states in particular are gaining weight for Austrian trade in goods, tourism and as FDI destinations. From the perspective of CESEE, Austria represents a top 10 export destination for seven countries, a top 10 source country for imports for eight countries and a top 10 investor for even seventeen countries in the region.

P52|Just peanuts? Trump's protective tariffs and their impact on Africa|"The international discussion of Trump's dispute over import tariffs for steel, aluminum and even cars is so far focused on the big global players. However, African countries in particular could suffer too from the planned punitive tariffs, analogous to the famous African proverb, ""When elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers"". Egypt and South Africa for example, the potentially most affected countries in Africa, face massive job losses and earning opportunities, with all the consequences that this entails for their already fragile economy and their population in dire poverty."
P52|Aristotle vs. Plato: The distributive origins of the Cold War|Competing definitions of justice in Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Politics indicate the existence of two distinct economic systems with different normative priorities. The three-class society of the Platonic economy (guardians, auxiliaries, producers) gives rise to guardians who by virtue are expected to enforce output targets on producers directly or through auxiliaries. The three-class society of the Aristotelian economy (rich, middle, poor) facilitates the emergence of different ruling coalitions and compensates efficiency losses of vertical production processes with political gains derived from representative governance. In the Aristotelian economy, the middle class is better off than in the Platonic economy (auxiliaries), because a just society (polity) is achieved under its rule. I argue that the equilibrium solutions of the Platonic and Aristotelian systems provide the normative foundations for the distinction between plan and market.
P52|Structural change, catching up and falling behind in the BRICS: A comparative analysis based on trade pattern and Thirlwall’s Law|The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) have become more than an acronym as their governments have been engaging in international and political negotiations as if they were a regional economic group. The main goal of this paper is to compare the structural change of the BRICS using econometric evidence based on estimates of Thirlwall’s law for the period 1995-2013. Thirlwall’s equations have become powerful indicators to evaluate whether a country is in a catching-up or falling-behind long-term path. Our basic assumption is that the way in which each country engages in international trade and global capital flows affects, positively or negatively, structural change and the catching up trajectory. Though our results cannot confirm Russia’s long-term growth trajectory, they do confirm that China and India have shown a rapid catching up path, while Brazil and South Africa have entered into a falling behind path over the period analyzed.
P52|Unexpected Corporate Outcomes from Hedge Find Activism in Japan|Hedge fund activism has been identified in the USA as a driver of enduring corporate governance change and market perception. We investigate this claim in an empirical study to see whether activism produced similar results in Japan in four representative areas: management effectiveness, managerial decisions, labour management, and market perception. Experience from the USA would predict positive changes at Japanese target companies in these four areas. However, analysis of financial data shows that no enduring changes were apparent in the first three areas, and that market perception was consistently unfavourable. Our findings demonstrate that the same pressures need not produce the same results in different markets. Moreover, while the effects of the global financial crisis should not be ignored, we conclude that the country-level differences in corporate governance identified in the varieties of capitalism literature are robust, at least in the short term.
P52|Current Account Balance in Emerging Asia|The current account balance is an important indicator which reveals information on a country’s economic situation such as investments, capital flows, and indebtedness. The main purpose of this study is to examine the current account balance conditions in emerging Asian countries. In this respect, the long-run and causality relationship between current account balance, economic growth, government expenditure, real interest rates, and foreign direct investment was examined. The panel data analysis was applied using the data dated 1986 to 2015. Our results revealed a causal effect from economic growth and government expenditure to current account balance mainly dependent on saving tendency.
P52|Are Rushed Privatizations Substandard? Analyzing Firm-Level Privatization under Fiscal Pressure|In this paper we provide the first analysis of whether rushed privatizations, usually carried out under fiscal duress, increase or decrease firms' efficiency, scale of operation (size) and employment. Using a large panel of firm-level data from Poland over 1995-2015, we show that rushed privatization has negative efficiency, scale and employment effects relative to non-rush privatization. The negative effect of rushed privatization on the scale of operations and employment is even stronger than its negative effect on efficiency. Our results suggest that when policy makers resort to rushed privatization, they ought to weigh these negative effects against other expected effects (e.g. on fiscal revenue).
P52|How did Regional Economic Structures in the EU Change during the Economic Crisis?|10 years on, many countries and regions in the EU still bear the scars of the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Countries and regions have recovered at different rates and undergone different structural changes. While the asymmetric impact of the crisis across regions and sectors has had a short-term impact on concentration and specialisation patterns; long-term forces, such as global economic and supply chain integration, continue to shape the economic landscape of European regions. In our empirical analysis, we describe the development of regional economic structures in terms of sectoral employment and production (gross value added) during the crisis. We focus on the location pattern of sectors (concentration), i.e. in which regions economic activities in a sector tend to be located, and the specialisation of regions, i.e. which sectors are particularly important in a region. Our analysis shows that the impact of the crisis on overall specialisation patterns appears rather limited, although some regions have been more affected than others. In addition, the general trend of sectoral location patterns in the EU becoming more similar over time has continued, albeit at a slower pace since 2009, especially in Central and East European Countries. In terms of sectors, employment and production concentration in the construction and manufacturing sectors, which displayed clustering before the crisis, have been dispersing since 2009. The data also show that regions with large employment losses during the crisis were mainly specialised in agriculture, low-tech manufacturing, construction and less-skilled services such as trade, accommodation/restaurants and transport. This suggests that local economic structures may have played a role in the economic resilience of regions during the crisis.
P52|A regression discontinuity evaluation of reducing early retirement eligibility in Poland|The reform introduced in Poland in 2009 substantially and abruptly reduced the number of workers eligible for early retirement. This paper evaluates the causal effects of this reform on labor force participation and exit to retirement. We use rich rotating panel from the Polish Labor Force Survey and exploit the discontinuity imposed by this reform. We find a statistically significant, but economically small discontinuity at the timing of the reform. The placebo test shows no similar effects in earlier or later quarters, but in a vast majority of specifications the discontinuity is not larger for the treated individuals, i.e. those whose occupation lost eligibility. We interpret these results as follows: the changes in the eligibility criteria were not instrumental in fostering the participation rates among the affected cohort, i.e. the immediate contribution to increased labor force participation of these cohorts is not economically large.
P52|Online and physical appropriation: evidence from a vignette experiment on copyright infringement|"This study employs a vignette experiment to inquire, which features of online ""piracy"" make it ethically discernible from a traditional theft. This question is pertinent since the social norm concerning traditional theft is starkly different from the evidence on ethical evaluation of online ""piracy"". We specifically distinguish between contextual features of theft, such as for example the physical loss of an item, breach of protection, availability of alternatives, emotional proximity to the victim of theft, etc. We find that some of these dimensions have more weight in ethical judgment, but there are no clear differences between online and traditional theft which could explain discrepancy in the frequency of commitment."

It was built from a statistical analysis of the determinants of well-being in Belgium. It has the advantage of being transparent, divisible and easy to communicate. The analysis shows that the well-being of Belgians generally decreased between 2005 and 2016. This decrease is mainly due to a deterioration in the health of Belgians.
P52|Four years in the club - from external to internal Europeanization in Croatia|Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013 after a long and meandrous road. On the one hand, the preparation for the negotiations was long already, on the other hand, the negotiation process itself also went slowly. Croatia was hit by the crisis severely, which also means that the accession process went parallel with an acute crisis management. The question arises whether the two processes had strengthened or rather hampered each other. So what impact of the membership can be identified in Croatia? Could the membership enhance the recovery from the long-lasting recession? Has the EU any role in this story? Almost four years has passed since the entrance conditions were replaced by a new set of internal rules: Croatia faces internal Europeanization pressure. What has changed in Croatia’s Europeanization pattern when it turned from internal to external?

P52|Bank Efficiency Differences Across Central and Eastern Europe|The study evaluates bank efficiency in the EU member states of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). Relying on a comprehensive dataset covering the post-crisis period from 2010 to 2016, country-specific average profit and cost efficiencies are calculated. Compared with similar pre-crisis studies, the results highlight the reshuffling effects of the financial crisis. Hungary, for instance, that was consistently found to have a comparatively efficient banking system, now performs well below average. Contrasting the results of traditional performance indicators with SFA supports the mechanism put forward by the Quiet Life Hypothesis. The positive relationship of market share and return on assets (or equity) indicates that higher market power enables banks to realize higher profits. SFA, on the other hand, suggests a negative association implying that banks do not tend to fully exploit this potential.
P52|Development of Education and Health Services in Asia and the Role of the State|This paper analyses the dramatic spread of education and healthcare in Asia and also the large variations in that spread across and within countries over fifty years. Apart from differences in initial conditions and income levels, the nature of the State has also been an important determinant of these variations. This is because social development has typically been led by the State. But in most countries, public resource constraints and the growing dependence on private provision and private spending have generated a pattern of nested disparities in the access to education and healthcare between rich and poor regions, between rural and urban areas within regions, and between rich and poor households within these areas. However, as the better-off regions, areas, and households approach the upper limits of achievable education and health standards, a process of convergence is also underway as those left behind begin to catch up.
P52|Collective bargaining through the magnifying glass: A comparison between the Netherlands and Portugal|Since the global financial crisis, sector-level bargaining has come under renewed scrutiny. While in Southern Europe, the crisis raised concerns about the role of collective bargaining as an obstacle to labour market adjustment, in Northern Europe it was perceived more favourably and, according to some, may even have helped to weather the fallout of the crisis more easily. This paper seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of sector-level bargaining systems and their role for labour market performance. We compare two countries with seemingly similar collective bargaining systems, the Netherlands and Portugal, and document a number of features that may affect labour market outcomes, including: i) the scope for flexibility at the firm or worker level within sector-level agreements; ii) the emphasis on representativeness as a criterion for extensions; iii) the effectiveness of coordination across bargaining units; and iv) pro-active government policies to enhance trust and cooperation between the social partners.
P52|Southeast Asia in the global economy: a selective analytical survey|This paper selectively surveys Southeast Asian economic development over the past half-century and anticipates some of the region’s challenges if it is to progress to the ranks of developed countries. In the long sweep of development, three key features stand out. First, the region’s “initial conditions” in the early post-independence period appeared to be quite unfavorable. The literature at this time reflected the resulting pessimism. But, second, several countries belong to the very small group to have achieved historically unprecedented growth since the 1960s. The drivers of rapid growth remain contested. But the common feature has been a strong commitment to reasonably broad-based economic growth. Moreover, third, the propensity for growth in the region has spread as countries have progressively joined the regional and global mainstream. Policy regimes that favored outward orientation and prudent macroeconomic management have generally resulted in faster growth. The accurate forecasting of crises and growth decelerations has proven to be elusive, reinforcing the view that an eclectic, historical, and multi-disciplinary framework is necessary to understand the region’s long-term development dynamics.

P52|What Defines National Interest for India and Pakistan: Economy, Politics or Religion?|Recent political history of India suggests that religion has become a dominant force in country’s politics. Here lies the irony the world has put a deaf year to by still accepting India as being secular democracy instead of a country dominated by Hindu identity. This Hindu identity defines India’s security agenda as well as its relationship with the world. Country like US is comfortable with India under every President irrespective of being a Republican or a Democrat.
P52|Institutional development in Transition Economies - The role of institutional experience|We examine the institutional development of a set of transition economies since the dissolution of the USSR, with a particular focus on the effect of natural resource dependency, EU accession and institutional experience. In a cross-sectional analysis these factors show a significant association with the different dimensions of institutional quality. To provide a more comprehensive picture of the development and to control for confounding factors, a Hausman-Taylor estimator on panel data is applied. This analysis confirms the positive relationship between institutional experience and institutional development; moreover, it also confirms the positive effects of the EU accession process on institutional development. Finally, resource dependency, although highly significant in the cross-section, has no significant relationship with average institutional quality in the panel. However, the panel results suggest that resource dependency has a negative effect on the quality of political institutions, while it has no significant association with administrative or legal institutions. Overall, the analysis highlights the persistent nature of institutions and indicates that experience of having independent institutions can affect the pace and path of institutional development.

However, smaller African countries in particular suffer too from the planned punitive tariffs, similar to the famous African proverb, ""When elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers"". After years of talk on partnership for economic development (AGOA, Cotonou Agreement, EPAs, etc) Trump’s tariffs mean a severe blow to participatory foreign trade and sustainable industrialization in Africa. Egypt and South Africa for example, the potentially most affected African countries, face massive job losses and earning opportunities, with all the consequences that this entails for their already fragile economy and the population in dire poverty. Trump’s intervention thus joins the continued power politics of former colonial powers vis à vis Africa. Nevertheless, despite these asymmetric power relations, unfair trade relations and the desolate state of African infant industries are not necessarily due to externalities but often home-made.

P52|A summary of a survey on proposed African monetary unions|This review summarises a survey of about 70 empirical studies on proposed African monetary unions published during the past fifteen years. Four main strands are outlined in four tables. They include the: (i) West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ), (ii) East African Monetary Union (EAMU), (iii) Southern African Monetary Union (SAMU) and (iv) African Monetary Union (AMU). A number of concerns are apparent from the feasibility and/or desirability of potential monetary unions. They are variations in: empirical strategies, selection of variables, considered periodicities and sampled countries. The Hegelian dialectics are used to establish selective expansion as the predominant mode of monetary integration. Some studies make the case for strong institutions and pegs as alternatives to currency unions. The employment of cluster analysis, distinguishing shocks from responses in the examination of business cycle synchronisation and the disaggregation of panels into sub-samples provide more subtle policy implications.
P52|The Arab Spring was predictable in 2007: Empirics of Proof|We model core demands for better governance (political, economic and institutional), more employment and less consumer price inflation using a methodological innovation on the complete elimination of cross-country differences in signals susceptible of sparking social revolts. The empirical evidence based on 14 MENA countries show that the Arab Spring was predictable in 2007 to occur between January 2011 and April 2012. While the findings predict the wave of cross-country revolutions with almost mathematical precision, caveats and cautions are discussed for the scholar to understand the expositional dimensions of the empirics.

P52|Population Aging of Reunified Korea (in Korean)|This study introduces various scenarios of changes in fertility rates and life expectancy of North Korea after Korean reunification, and compares the development of population aging by scenario based on demographic projections calculated by the cohort component method. These scenarios are set up in consideration of the demographic changes in Germany, observed after its Reunification: the fertility rate of East Germany dropped by half right after unification; and its life expectancy converged to the level of West Germany. Therefore, the fertility shock and the convergence of life expectancy are reflected in the scenarios of North Korean population after unification. Besides, this study assumes a scenario where the fertility rate of the North could increase due to an improvement in child-care environment and public health, considering the distinct features of the inter-Korean unification. The main finding of this study is as follows. The population integration of the two Koreas may alleviate the burden of population aging of South Korea. This positive impact, however, may be gradually reduced if the North's fertility rate sharply drops and life expectancy converges to the level of the South. Yet, the level of population aging may be continuously reduced in case the fertility rate of the North raises even though its life expectancy converges to the level of the South.
P52|La evolución de la desigualdad en Latinoamérica en el siglo XXI: patrones, determinantes y causas|En este artículo mostramos la evolución de la desigualdad en la región latinoamericana en el siglo XXI, analizando separadamente ingreso y riqueza para los principales países. Consideramos las determinantes de los cambios en los índices de desigualdad y las posibles causas, analizando el potencial papel de los gobiernos de izquierda. Mostramos como la evolución favorable del contexto internacional y el equilibrio político en la región sean la explicación más consistente de los patrones observados. ****** In this article we show the evolution of inequality in the latin-american region in the XXI century, considering separately income and wealth, for the largest economies. We analyze the drivers of the changes in inequality measures and the possible causes, considering the potential role of the leftist governments. We show how the evolution of the international context and the political equilibrium are consistent with the observed patterns.
P52|Collective Bargaining Through the Magnifying Glass; A Comparison Between the Netherlands and Portugal|Since the global financial crisis, sector-level bargaining has come under renewed scrutiny. While in Southern Europe, the crisis raised concerns about the role of collective bargaining as an obstacle to labor market adjustment, in Northern Europe it was perceived more favourably and, according to some, may even have helped to weather the fallout of the crisis more easily. This paper seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of sector-level bargaining systems and their role for labor market performance. We compare two countries with seemingly similar collective bargaining systems, the Netherlands and Portugal, and document a number of features that may affect labor market outcomes, including i) the scope for flexibility at the firm or worker level within sector-level agreements; ii) the emphasis on representativeness as a criterion for extensions; iii) the effectiveness of coordination across bargaining units; and iv) pro-active government policies to enhance trust and cooperation between the social partners.
P52|Workers or mothers? Czech welfare and gender role preferences in transition|Two decades after the fall of state socialism, the Czech Republic records the widest employment gap between women with and without pre-school children among OECD countries: 41 pp. Several substantial parental leave reforms took place during the first stage of the transition (1995) and after the EU accession (2008). The responses by the targeted population, i.e. take-up rates and duration of work interruptions, do not fully mimic predictable effects drawn by financial incentives. Why is that? Using the European Values Study and the Generations and Gender Programme panel data, I show that quite counter-intuitively, in the context of post-socialist public policy adjustments, preference for long leaves does not stem from lower preference for welfare state institutions, but from a purely intra-household value change in favour of higher task specialization between men and women. Indeed, unlike most European countries and even other post-communist countries, we observe a significant turn towards specialized couple preferences - among both women and men, both parents and non-parents, and both the higher and lower educated.
P52|The Effect of Financial Crisis and Macroeconomic Factors on Foreign Direct Investment in Developing Countries|Developing countries needs Foreign direct investment (FDI) to be at par with the progress of developed countries. The dearth of study on the effects of financial crisis on FDI justifies the objective which is to examine the potential effect of financial crisis inclusive of macroeconomic factors as control variables on FDI in dataset 23 developing countries for the period 1993-2013. This study includes descriptive analysis, correlation test, stationary test and regression analysis. The random effects (RE) generalized least square estimator is used in the regression to examine the potential effect of financial crisis and macroeconomic factors on the inflow of FDI. Foremost, the US financial crisis has a positive significance to the inflow of FDI which validates Krugman’s theory on fire-sale FDI. However, country specific economic recession, lending rates and natural resources discourage inflow of FDI. Nonetheless, trade openness, domestic currency, money supply and domestic fixed investment encourage FDI in developing countries.
P52|What drives bank performance in transitions economies? The impact of reforms and regulations|This paper investigates the effects of financial regulations and structural reforms on the cost efficiency of the banking industries of 10 Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries for the period 2004–2009. Cost efficiency scores are estimated using stochastic frontier analysis, whilst panel regressions examine the impact of regulation and liberalisation on bank performance using the EBRD transitional reform indicator and the Fraser economic freedom index. By considering both indexes we are able to account for the effects of progress towards more sound banking practices as well as the impact of the credit market, labor market and business sector regulatory regimes on bank efficiency. Our empirical analysis shows that structural reforms on labor and business markets exert a positive impact on bank performance. In line with the public interest view, we find the effect of credit regulation banking on cost efficiency is positive. We also find that better capitalized banks are more cost efficient.
P52|Working Paper 04-17 - Qu’est-ce qui compte pour les Belges ? Analyse des déterminants du bien-être individuel en Belgique<BR>[Working Paper 04-17 - Wat telt voor de Belgen? Analyse van de determinanten van het individuele welzijn in België]|This Working Paper analyses the determinants of individual well-being in Belgium, using data from the EU-SILC survey. The analysis shows that on average health, both mental and physical, is the key determinant of well-being for Belgians. Enjoying sufficient income to access what is regarded as the prevailing standard of living in Belgium, having a job and being surrounded by loved ones also have a significant and positive impact on well-being. Besides these results for “average” Belgians, the analysis of different sub-groups highlights that these determinants are not of equal importance to all Belgians. These results contribute to the FPB's work on the search for indicators complementary to GDP.
P52|Mesure de la performance des banques dans une zone d'ancrage monétaire: cas de la France et des pays de l'UMOA|Our study aims at measuring banking system efficiency for France and WAMU, by isolating environmental specificities to each region. Our results show that the two banking systems have quite close efficiency scores about 80%. As their french counterparts, WAMU banks are efficient; however this assertion is true in regarding the environment in which they evolve. Indeed, those banks transform collected deposits in short term loans or loans to big foreign corporations, that they are sure to recover lent amounts. This situation has the following effect: a significant part of entreprises (smal and medium ones) are under funded. The comparison of the two banking systems lead us to suggest that monetary and financial authorities implement reforms. Those reforms inspired by french ones and adapted to the WAMU specificity and environement, would help the banking system of the zone to effectively play its financial intermediary role.
P52|New developmentalist experiments in Brazil and Egypt - a comparative study|The paper investigates the state-led development experiments in Brazil and Egypt, and highlights their merits and shortcomings in the light of most recent difficulties in both countries. Using institutional and political economy approach we compare the new Brazilian development-oriented approach to its Egyptian counterpart, and also look at their results, while trying to explain the main differences between the two cases. The way how Brazil has achieved pro-poor and inclusive growth since the Millennium offers some useful lessons, but in the light of most recent events it also provides a cautionary tale for other emerging and developing countries. At the same time the lack of pro-poor stance and neglect of inclusivity helps to explain political (and economic) turmoil of recent years in Egypt. More recently both countries have turned towards a more market- (business-) oriented approach, however with different background. After 2014 the Sisi government in Egypt seemed to turn back the time and strengthened its commitment to the state-led developmentalist approach while relying mainly on old Nasserist practices and institutional ties. This Sisinomics might have been however short-lived, as the new IMF agreement (November 2016) and its prescriptions signal a new economic policy turn. In Brazil after the rather implicit neoliberal turn during the hasty economic policy (mis-)management of the Rousseff government, in 2016 the new Temer government has much more explicitly committed itself to market-oriented reforms, and with this to the aim of significantly cutting back the role of state in economy.
P52|FDI promotion of the Visegrád countries in the era of global value chains|Investments (FDI) have become more connected to the global value chains (GVCs) in the past decated. As known, the Visegrád countries intensively participate in GVCs and have collected considerable stock of FDI. The purpose of the paper is to analyse how governmental investment promotion policies of these countries reacted to these phenomena. Investment can be promoted in a wide sense – creating stabile business environment – and in a narrow sense (grants, tax allowances, etc). Narrow sense FDI incentives serve in most cases large multinationals. The Visegrád countries have applied several type of state incentives on a large scale. Based on official data and press information we provide insight into the narrow sense FDI promotion steps, from grants to special industrial zones. Using international surveys and indices we show that several factors that favourable for FDI in a wide sense, have deteriorated recently. Legal stability has been shaken, corruption increased and education indices declined. The shortage of qualified labour force became acute. Visegrád countries continue competing for large investments, therefore costly, tailored grants for foreign firms (narrow tools) will be more and more important. However, this cannot endlessly compensate for worsening business climate (wide tools).
P52|Sometimes Your Best Just Ain't Good Enough: The Worldwide Evidence on Well-Being Efficiency|Despite the burgeoning happiness economics literature, scholars have largely ignored explorations of how individuals or countries translate given resources into well-being. Using a balanced panel on 91 countries from Gallup Analytics between 2009–2014 and borrowing insights from production theory, we investigate whether nations in our sample efficiently convert their current resources (i.e. income, education and health) into subjective well-being. Our results imply that well-being efficiency gains are possible worldwide. We find that unemployment and involuntary part-time employment are associated with lower efficiency, while good institutions as proxied by the rule of law, as well as social support and freedom perceptions improve it. Within-country investigations for Bulgaria – an upper-middle-income country that often lurks at the bottom of the international well-being rankings – demonstrate that efficiency is lower among the unemployed, divorced/separated, widowed, the old, large households and those with children, while living in a city, freedom, generosity and social support improve efficiency. This paper provides the first evidence from an international panel concerning the issue of whether higher well-being levels are possible with current resources and raises policy-relevant questions about the appropriate instruments to improve well-being efficiency.
P52|Does religiosity explain economic outcomes?|Most religions in transition economies were marginalized by their former communist regimes. Today, some of these countries are experiencing a revival of religiosity, while others are prone to secularization. Religious norms affect individual decision making with respect to human capital investment, economic reforms, marital stability, employment, and other contexts. This implies that the interests of both religious and non-religious communities may differ and must be taken into account when designing and implementing economic policies, which is a challenge for policymakers.
P52|Determinants of Foreign Versus Domestic Real Estate Investment: Property Level Evidence from Listed Real Estate Investment Firms|Abstract We examine the determinants of foreign real estate investment relative to the domestic case using the portfolios of a large sample of publicly traded real estate investment companies; where foreign investment is defined as the property owner headquarters being located in a different country than a given asset. The cross-sectional results provide strong evidence that real estate firms are more likely to take a smaller stake in larger assets when investing abroad. The penchant for large assets holds when controlling for economic activity, real estate investment opportunities, depth and sophistication of the capital markets, investor protection and the legal framework, administrative burdens and regulatory limitations, and the socio-cultural and political environment at both the property nation and headquarter nation levels. In general, foreign ownership is less likely with industrial, office, retail, and self-storage properties. Capital market development is consistently negatively related to foreign investment.
P52|Why are American Parents More Altruistic Than Japanese Parents?|This paper aims at examining what are causing differences in altruistic bequest motive between Japanese and American parents. The evidence shows that the Americans are more altruistic than Japanese, and there is a significant difference between these two countries when all the other socio-economic variables controlled. Gender, household income, age and faith in religion have a significant impact on respondents'bequest motive. The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition shows that more than 95% of the difference is explained by the differences in coefficients instead of the endowment effect.
P52|"The ""Magic Square"" of Economic Policy measured by a Macroeconomic Performance Index"|"The ""Magic Square of Economic Policy"" highlights four main goals of economic policy: growth, full employment, price stability, and balanced trade. A Macroeconomic Performance Index can be used to assign relative weights to the dierent goals within the Magic Square, giving a single index number per year per country. The legitimacy of the simplest weighting scheme that assigns equal weight to all four goals is discussed. The macroeconomic performance of eleven euro zone area countries is evaluated over time and across countries."
P52|Employment, Education and the State|The 2016 India Employment Report demolishes the myths of both `demographic dividend' and `jobless growth' in the India growth story. But it recognises that the growth of decent, productive employment is too slow even to absorb the annual increment of new workers in the workforce, let alone eliminate the huge backlog of open unemployment and low productivity underemployment. This paper argues that this challenge is a man-made problem, the consequence of a range of dysfunctional policies that have a strong anti-employment bias. Moreover, a long standing elitist bias in education policy has pre-empted the provision of quality basic education without which the bulk of the workforce cannot be suitably skilled for decent, productive employment. The paper suggests that these dysfunctional policies are attributable to a fractionalized polity and India's soft state, which stands in sharp contrast to the hard states seen in the dramatically successful East Asian model of guided capitalism.
P52|Natural Resources, Oil and Economic Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa|This paper takes a critical look at the natural resource curse in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and it highlights the role of institutionalised authority. The paper first provides a comprehensive literature review of natural resource curse, Dutch disease and the role of oil resources in resource curse. This is follow by the description of the relevant economic factors in sub-Saharan Africa, which is taken as prime example of the region with both important oil and other natural resources and with serious economic growth problems.
P52|Modelling Natural Resources, Oil and Economic Growth in Africa|Using panel data from 1980 to 2010 on 34 sub-Saharan African countries, this paper examines whether institutionalised authority, which is a proxy for state authority, can change the negative relationship between natural resources and economic growth. The key finding is that, institutionalised authority can alter the negative relationship that exists between natural resources and economic growth. We also model the relationship between the oil revenue (fuel exports) and economic growth, and how institutionalised authority can alter this relationship as well.
P52|The impact of state-controlled banks on the Russian banking sector|This paper examines the structure, governance, and balance sheets of state-controlled banks in Russia, which accounted for over 55 percent of the total assets in the country’s banking system in early 2011. The author offers a credible estimate of the size of the country’s state banking sector by including banks that are indirectly owned by public organizations. Contrary to some predictions based on the theoretical literature on economic transition, he explains the relatively high profitability and efficiency of Russian state-controlled banks by pointing to their competitive position in such functions as acquisition and disposal of assets on behalf of the government. Also suggested in the paper is a different way of looking at market concentration in Russia (by consolidating the market shares of core state-controlled banks), which produces a picture of a more concentrated market than officially reported. Lastly, one of the author’s interesting conclusions is that China provides a better benchmark than the formerly centrally planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe by which to assess the viability of state ownership of banks in Russia and to evaluate the country’s banking sector.
P52|The evolution of inequality in Latin America in the 21st century: Patterns, drivers and causal hypotheses|In this article, we show the evolution of inequality for the largest economies of the Latin American region in the 21st century, with separate consideration of income and wealth. We analyse the drivers of the changes in inequality and possible underlying causes, including the role of the new wave of leftist governments.
P52|A summary of a survey on proposed African monetary unions|This review summarises a survey of about 70 empirical studies on proposed African monetary unions published during the past fifteen years. Four main strands are outlined in four tables. They include the: (i) West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ), (ii) East African Monetary Union (EAMU), (iii) Southern African Monetary Union (SAMU) and (iv) African Monetary Union (AMU). A number of concerns are apparent from the feasibility and/or desirability of potential monetary unions. They are variations in: empirical strategies, selection of variables, considered periodicities and sampled countries. The Hegelian dialectics are used to establish selective expansion as the predominant mode of monetary integration. Some studies make the case for strong institutions and pegs as alternatives to currency unions. The employment of cluster analysis, distinguishing shocks from responses in the examination of business cycle synchronisation and the disaggregation of panels into sub-samples provide more subtle policy implications.
P52|The African origins of Euro-American development: Pins on an empirical roadmap|Despite their obvious ideological bends, economic studies of the interactions between Africa and “developed” Europe and America (Euro-America) have been decidedly lopsided. Existing studies conceive the effects of the interactions to be unidirectional, with Africa always on the receiving end in both good and bad ways. The conception is incorrect; it lacks the appreciation that the effects are interactive, mutual, dynamic, and simultaneous. Thus, I argue that contrary to the extant literature, the development of Euro-America has origins in Africa through the mechanism of mercantile, slave, and free trade. For example, the growth of colonial Britain depended on foreign trade with the Americas – exports of manufactured goods and imports of raw materials. In turn, American raw materials were produced by African slave labor. When slavery ended African raw materials began to flow to Euro-America in greater amounts than before, replacing slave labor. The result was a smooth transition from a slave-labor-based economy to a modern economy in Euro-America, and a stunted economy in Africa. The objective of this paper is to sketch how one might go about illustrating such effects in a simple quantitative way. In other words, it puts some pins to suggest a roadmap for empirical studies. To do so, first I review very briefly the history of African and Euro-American interactions. Second, I attempt to establish the channels of interactions. Third, I construct a simple model for measuring Africa’s effects on Euro-American development as a system of three seemingly unrelated equations, which can be estimated individually and/or simultaneously. Fourth, I indicate the challenges and methods for generating the data required to implement the model empirically. While this version of the paper is unaccompanied by its empirical counterpart, it is nonetheless clear that at least some of the origins of Euro-American development are African.
P52|Структурные Или Институциональные Сдвиги? Попытка Измерения На Примере Банковского Сектора<BR>[Structural change, institutional change and their measurement: The case of banking]|The paper attempts measuring institutional change, taking the case of the Russian banking industry in 1991-2016. I put forward a set of metrics featuring the actors and the relevance of banking for the economy. At the first stage, the communist-era credit system falls apart, and so do coordination mechanisms between monetary and real sectors of the economy. After the 1998 crisis, evolution goes in the direction of greater government involvement in banks and centralized allocation of financial resources. Structural change has not yet led to a fully different modus operandi of the banking industry. The contribution of this paper is that it tackles the interplay between structural and institutional change in a particular economic sector.
P52|Crime, Transition, and Growth|This paper analyses whether the effect of crime on growth depends on the structural changes caused by transition. The result of the simple model suggests that when the structure of economy changes, the cost of economically motivated crime will also change; thus, affecting the impact of crime on economic performance. Using data for some of the republics of the former Soviet Union, we find support for this conjecture.
P52|Almost equi-marginal principle based composite index of globalization: China, India and Pakistan|The present study proposes an alternative method to construct an index of globalization which is based on the principle of almost equi-marginal contributions (AEMC) or Shapley values of the constituent variables to the overall index rather than the correlation coefficients among the constituent variables and the overall index (the KOF index based on the principal component scores). This has been done by minimization of the Euclidean norm of the Shapley values of the constituent variables. As an exercise, secondary time series data (1970-2013) on the measures of globalization in three different dimensions (economic, social and political) of three economies (China, India and Pakistan) have been used. A comparison of the AEMC index with the KOF index reveals that while the former is more inclusive, the latter is more elitist in matters of inclusion of the weakly correlated constituent variables in the overall (composite) index. As a consequence, the AEMC index is more sensitive than the KOF index of globalization. Both indices capture the trends in globalization in the countries under study and are highly correlated between themselves. Thus, AEMC is an alternative or perhaps a better method to construct composite indices.
P52|Globalization under hysteresis: A study of Eastern Bloc Countries, China and India|This study is concerned with a great socio-economic experiment in history that replaced the naturally evolved market economy with the humanly designed command economy to achieve a socialist triumph over capitalism, experienced a setback and ultimately returned to the market economy for managing the material aspects of the society. Efforts to open the subject economies in the aftermath of the said experiment are on the contemporary agenda worldwide. Yet, the past pulls the present causing hysteresis that thwarts the momentum of globalization. Using KOF and AEMC indices of globalization (based on KOF data 1991-2014), the paper concludes that most of the countries to the south of Russian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan) have performed rather poorly in globalization efforts. On the other hand, the countries in the north-western side of the Russian Federation (except Moldova) have on the whole performed better. In comparison, China has performed fairly while India lags behind. In spite of all proclamations, unless the political will to globalization is there, globalization cannot progress much further. However, such a political will has not been strong in India. India has remained protectionist of vested interests of politicians, industrialists, business houses and perhaps the intelligentsia, a coalition of the dominant proprietary classes that benefit from the status quo or stagnancy of the Indian economy and society. Globalization in India is under a strong spell of hysteresis on account of the pre-1991 pseudo-socialistic nostalgia as well as age-old internal contradictions.
P52|Governance over Economics: Making Globalisation Good for the Poor|The paper employs different definitions of inequality/ equality and investigates how globalisation is associated with these welfare measures. The nations’ proximity to post modernism development culture through international cooperation may enable countries to strengthen their social, economic, legal and political institutions. We find that adopting well developed institutional governance practices as matter of greater integration with modern 21st century governance culture creates thriving middle classes in developing countries enabling a downward pressure on inequality of incomes and wages. In contrast, integration of goods and services with world markets puts upward pressure on the wages of skilled in contrast with the unskilled causing industrial wage inequalities in both developed and developing countries. The paper recommends in line with the recent literature on pre mature de industrialisation phenomenon that countries may protect their local industries to provide jobs to locals and thus enable the gains of trade to be more equally distributed among the populations. This can be done by choosing the second best option towards global integration and that is to promote regionalism within geographical clusters.
P52|On the guidelines of good planning : The case of the Arab region|The paper uses a structured database of national planning that ESCWA is compiling to identify the well-known and lesser-known features of development planning in the Arab region. The paper first explores international best practices and reflects on country-specific context to develop a typology of good planning criteria for the Arab region. Based on this typology, the paper offers preliminary stylized facts about planning and compares individual planning initiatives across the region. Above all, the findings indicate the region is suffering with the following difficulties: (1) a lack of structure among individual planning documents, (2) a weak relation to international frameworks, (3) the paucity of specific measurable indicators that would help to effectively monitor achievements, (4) many countries did not publish any planning documents targeting the long-term and medium-term development of their whole economy at all or (5) did not make them readily available on-line, which points towards insufficient transparency and impaired participation. Finally, the paper envisions a way forward for integrative planning in the Arab region while linking it to the 2030 Agenda.
P52|Islamic Finance at Crossroads|After more than 40 years of practice, the Islamic finance industry is riddled with products that have a camouflage of Islamic form, but lack Shari'ah validity of purpose. The increasing tendency to mimic conventional finance, had the industry converging to its conventional counterpart. It is therefore seriously threatened with increasing cynicism and popular decline in interest. The paper looks into the essence of Reba prohibition from an economic perspective, using a concise classification of transactions, and how popular monetary theory looks on a positive rate of interest with disfavor. It evaluates Shari'ah scholars approach to the validation of contracts as well as the attitude of monetary authorities towards the Shari'ah content of Islamic finance transactions. It reviews the macroeconomic advantages of Islamic finance within an Islamic macroeconomic environment. Then it tries to explain why managers of Islamic banking and finance institutions, IBFI, mimic conventional products despite such advantages. The paper surveys the literature that measures the extent of conversion as well as provides an alternative explanation. The study finds that IBFI violate the true paradigm of Islamic finance, because its advantages are all external and impossible to internalize. It lists several pieces of empirical evidence on increasing convergence. The paper concludes by drawing a plan composed of regulatory actions, research agenda as well as a series of dialogues with stakeholders.
P52|CESEE Back on Track to Convergence|GDP forecasts for 2017 have been revised upwards for all Central and East European EU Member States (EU-CEE). Farther east, especially in Russia, but also in the Western Balkans, the post-crisis recovery has been much weaker. Private consumption is the main growth driver, underpinned by rising wages and household incomes. Nonetheless, CESEE labour cost competitiveness is not yet endangered. Gradually, along with expanding private consumption, investments have also gained strength and have increasingly emerged as a driver of growth. Trade balances have improved, and many EU-CEE countries (as well as Russia) also report current account surpluses. Growth is thus becoming broader based, more robust, and probably also more sustainable. Improvements in labour markets are spectacular, with rising employment levels mirrored by declining unemployment. Simultaneously, emerging labour shortages are acting as a potential constraint on future growth. In terms of current GDP growth prospects, the CESEE region is split into three sub-regions the EU-CEE, with average annual growth close to 4% in the forecasting period; the Western Balkans, with GDP growing by around 3% per year; and finally, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Ukraine, where growth will be around 2% annually in the medium term. The EU-CEE region is thus catching up again with Western Europe, and the process of economic convergence has resumed at a greater pace than previously expected. This catching-up process will continue probably for the rest of the decade. Importantly, economic convergence is not expected to resume in Russia, where the lack of structural change, lasting investment climate deficiencies and geopolitical conflicts impose a burden on growth. Meagre growth in Russia adversely affects the growth prospects of her CIS partners. But there are several other CESEE countries where recent political developments are not very conducive to growth and European integration in the medium term. However, for the moment, economic growth seems to be unaffected by domestic political instability. Globally, economic resilience persists, regardless of the elevated geopolitical risks. The Forecast Report also includes three special topics (on income convergence with Western Europe, on euro accession and on higher yields on hard currency sovereign debt in CESEE). The key findings of these reports are Convergence in terms of per capita GDP levels in CESEE is a long-term process; by 2050, most of the region will only have bridged half the current gap with the EU-28 level; during the next decade, no country in the region will catch up with average EU-28 wealth levels, and advanced EU-CEE countries like Poland and Hungary will not even reach the 80% mark. Despite sustained criticism since its inception, the euro may yet survive and attract new members in the EU-CEE; it is in the interests of Croatia and Bulgaria to join, and is potentially advantageous for Hungary and Poland; the case is less clear cut for the Czech Republic and Romania, although in neither case would accession be harmful. Many CESEE sovereigns are not in a markedly better shape to deal with a sharp rise in debt yields than they were 10 years ago, and in some cases they are in a worse position; for countries with heavy debt loads and little apparent prospect of achieving high and sustained growth, bond markets could panic, leading to funding difficulties; Ukraine stands out as particularly vulnerable from a sovereign risk perspective, while we conclude that Belarus and many countries in the Western Balkans are also in a weak position.
P52|Cautious Upturn in CESEE: Haunted by the Spectre of Uncertainty|Summary Growth in the CESEE economies will strengthen gradually, surpassing on average 3% by 2019. This growth will be driven by consumption and increasing investment, amid a largely supportive international economic environment. Despite a rise in ULCs, competitiveness will not be endangered. Although the size of labour forces in CESEE is stagnating, data indicate an improvement in educational levels of workers. Meanwhile the tightness of labour markets will propel wage growth. The CESEE region as a whole is back on a convergence track, with an average positive growth differential of 1.2 pp vis-à-vis the euro area over the forecast horizon. Downside risks are significant, mostly stemming from political factors. The CESEE countries and Europe more broadly, together with the rest of the world, will be haunted by the spectre of political uncertainty; it is only to be hoped that, once fully roused, the ‘animal spirits’ of economic agents will shrug off the gloom. For the economies of CESEE, the international economic environment appears generally positive. In 2017-2018, GDP growth in the euro area is expected to hover around 1.7%. The international financial markets have stabilised and the current economic mood is improving. Because of the global recovery, the US Fed is expected to increase interest rates further in 2017, while oil prices are likely to rise. In the EU, disbursements from the payments cycle of the European Structural and Investment Funds are only just beginning, indicating higher co-financed investments in the EU‑CEE countries from this year onwards. Over recent quarters, GDP growth throughout almost the entire CESEE region has stabilised in positive territory. The only exception is Belarus, where growth is still in negative territory (albeit less so than was the case in 2015). The country is going through a painful adjustment process triggered by accumulated macroeconomic imbalances and its excessive dependence on Russia. Current wiiw CESEE GDP growth forecasts for 2017-2019 point to growth of around 3% for most of the region, with a slightly upward trend. The EU-CEE sub-region and the Western Balkan economies in particular should manage to attain average GDP growth rates of up to 3% and in some countries, such as Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Albania and Kosovo, the levels may be even higher. In Turkey, where growth slowed down markedly in 2016 to below 2% (down from around 6% in prior years) on account of the domestic political turmoil and deterioration in foreign relations, we also expect growth to be closer to 3% by the end of the forecast horizon. The CIS-3 economies will record increasing GDP growth rates, rising from more than 1% in 2017 to over 2% in 2019, given the higher oil prices. Over the same forecast period, economic growth in Ukraine is projected to accelerate gradually to 3% by 2018-2019 – barring all-out warfare in Donbas and abortion of the IMF programme. Private consumption and increasing investment will continue to be the main growth drivers over the forecast horizon. After the investment slump in 2016 attributable to the switch from the previous to the current EU (co-) financing period, investment in the EU-CEE economies will recover in the years ahead. Meanwhile the mood among consumers is improving and, due to changing spending patterns in the EU-CEE sub-region, this trend should prove durable. Tightening labour markets are conducive to major wage increases. Despite the general rise in unit labour costs, competitiveness does not seem to be endangered. Most of the latest industrial production figures for the CESEE countries are encouraging; they point to an ongoing improvement in industry structure and, in several cases, to re-industrialisation. Longer-term FDI trends hold particular promise for the Western Balkans. In Romania and Slovakia the prospects for future FDI increases are also quite good, especially in the automotive sector. Although the size of the labour force in CESEE countries is more or less stagnating, a marked improvement in education levels is evident, as a younger and better educated generation enters the work force. This hints at a potential general increase in labour quality across the region’s economies. Nevertheless, heightened uncertainties following the UK referendum on Brexit in June 2016 and the US presidential elections in November have cast a cloud over the improved economic conditions noted above. A number of worrying scenarios are quite conceivable that could ultimately make our forecasts appear upbeat and overoptimistic. Thanks to US President Donald Trump, a rise in global protectionism is possible, which would harm industry in the region. Mr Trump has also questioned post-war European security arrangements, thus causing consternation in some EU-CEE countries. Meanwhile, the growing irritation with the EU-CEE sub-region among some older EU Member States and the fallout from Brexit could possibly pose a threat to west-east fiscal transfers and the free movement of labour in their current forms. In the Western Balkans, any confrontational interventions by Russia and uncertainties as to developments in Turkey could prove quite disruptive, were the influence of the EU and USA in the region to decline. Increasing uncertainties in the CIS and Ukraine are mostly related to future commodity price developments (most importantly oil prices) and heightened geopolitical tensions. Three special sections of the forecast report shed more light on the issue of heightened uncertainties in the EU-CEE, the Western Balkans and the CIS+UA regions.
P52|Wirtschaftliche Konvergenz trotz politischer Unsicherheit|Zusammenfassung Wirtschaftliche Konvergenz trotz politischer Unsicherheit Das internationale Umfeld für die Wirtschaft der mittel-, ost- und südosteuropäischen Länder (MOSOEL) präsentiert sich als Kontrast zwischen wirtschaftlichem Aufschwung einerseits sowie politischer Unsicherheit und geopolitischen Spannungen andererseits. Kurzfristig setzen sich die positiven Effekte der wirtschaftlichen Erholung im Euroraum und der damit verbundenen Exporte, sowie des relativ niedrigen Ölpreises gegen mögliche negative Effekte politischer Turbulenzen durch. Gegenüber der wiiw-Frühjahrsprognose wurden die Wachstumsprognosen für die MOSOEL größtenteils nach oben auf 2,4% für das laufende Jahr und 2,6% für das Jahr 2018 korrigiert. English Summary Economic convergence despite political uncertainty The international environment for the economies in Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) is characterised by a contrast between economic upswing, on the one hand, and political uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, on the other hand. In the short term, positive effects of the economic recovery in the euro area and related exports, as well as of the relatively low oil price are prevailing over potential negative effects of political turmoil. Compared with the wiiw Spring Forecast, growth projections for the CESEE region were for the most part revised upwards, to 2.4% and 2.6% for the years 2017 and 2018, respectively.
P52|From Fiscal Austerity towards Growth-Enhancing Fiscal Policy in Ukraine|The study analyses the dynamics and the structure of Ukraine’s public finances. It assesses the medium-term impact of fiscal austerity 2014-2016, examines fiscal sustainability and estimates further fiscal adjustment efforts. It evaluates the economic and social implications of current fiscal policies especially on education, health and other social indicators. It examines the benefits and costs of the medium-term budget for 2017‑2019 with an emphasis on evolving challenges and puts forward policy recommendations aimed at a successful implementation of growth-enhancing economic reforms.
P52|The Evolution of Inequality in Latin America in the 21st Century: What are the patterns, drivers and causes?|The paper analyses the evolution of inequality for the largest economies of the Latin American region in the 21st century, with separate consideration of income and wealth. The drivers of changes in inequality and possible underlying causes are examined, including the role of the new wave of leftist governments. The evidence reveals that income inequality decreased, though wealth inequality displayed a much less homogeneous pattern. Statistically, the decrease in inequality is associated with labour market changes, and especially with State redistribution through subsidies. Wealth inequality is mainly correlated with the change in the share of financial wealth. A possible causal interpretation is that the symbolic victories of the new left may have inflated social pressures, mostly in the presence of rents generated by the commodity boom.
P52|Occupational mobility in Europe: Extent, determinants and consequences|We examine occupational mobility and its link to wage mobility across a large number of EU countries using worker-level micro data. In doing so, we document the extent, the individual-level determinants and the consequences of occupational mobility in terms of wage outcomes and structural change across the EU. In addition, we identify potential explanations for the observed cross-country variation. Our results show that on average, 3% of European workers change their occupation per year, and that the extent of occupational mobility differs strongly by country. Individual characteristics play an important role for person-specific occupational mobility, but have little explanatory power for differences between countries. Occupational mobility is strongly associated with earnings mobility, and occupation movers are more likely than job movers to experience a downward rather than an upward earnings transition; by contrast, changing occupation voluntarily is more often followed by an upward wage transition. As opposed to composition effects, labour-market institutions, especially employment protection legislation, seem to play an important role for explaining crosscountry differences in occupational mobility.
P52|Billionaire Wealth, Firm Performance and Financial Crisis: An Empirical Analysis for India|Employing data for 2001â€“2012, the article analyzes the factors impacting the wealth of Indian billionaires and the performance and innovative activity of firms which these billionaires represent. The analysis indicates that billionaires in rent-thick sectors have higher wealth levels, on average. As well, the evidence also supports lower wealth for self-made and entrepreneurial billionaires. The findings also reveal that self-interested actions by billionaires tend to raise agency costs, which, in turn, dampens profitability and firm value. Finally, there is evidence which suggests a tendency on the part of billionaires to block innovative activity. JEL Classification: D31, N35, P52
P52|Revolution empirics: predicting the Arab Spring|Abstract The paper examines whether the Arab Spring phenomenon was predictable by complete elimination in the dispersion of core demands for better governance, more jobs, and stable consumer prices. A methodological innovation of the generalized methods of moments is employed to assess the feasibility and timing of the revolution. The empirical evidence reveals that from a projection date of 2007, the Arab Spring was foreseeable between 2011 and 2012. The paper contributes at the same time to the empirics of predicting revolutions and the scarce literature on modeling the future of socioeconomic events. Caveats and cautions are discussed.
P52|Fiscal Decentralization, Economic Freedom, and Political and Civil Liberties in the Americas|This paper analyzes the impact of fiscal decentralization on economic freedom and political and civil liberties in the Americas. Regarding the latter and with the full sample of countries, the findings suggest that decentralization initially worsens but eventually improves political and civil liberties, underlining the importance of fiscal decentralization as a driver for achieving basic liberties. When Canada and the US are excluded, the evidence shows that decentralization may eventually be a detriment for political and civil liberties. With respect to the impact of fiscal decentralization on economic freedom, decentralization first hinders but eventually increases freedom when all countries are included, emphasizing the point that a decentralization regime takes time to develop and function properly. When Canada and the US are excluded, decentralization initially increases but ultimately hampers freedom, demonstrating that if the decentralization regime does not address important matters like fiscal discipline, wealth inequality, and political accountability, economic freedom - like political and civil liberties - will also deteriorate.
P52|Russia: A New Imperialist Power?|This paper argues the importance of using modern methodology of Marxist analysis for the study of imperialism and the so-called “empires”. This methodology allows to show the mechanisms of economic, political, ideological, and so on manipulating the “periphery” from the “center” capital and the states. On this methodological basis it is proved that capitals and state machines of semi-periphery countries in general and Russia in particular are mostly objects of imperialist subjugation and manipulation and only in some rare cases these countries and their capitals are able to be subjects of the imperialist policy. The analysis of the contradictions in the relations of the Russian Federation, Ukraine and the West is given. It is provided the system of political, economic and geo-political arguments proving that Russia as a rule does not act as a subject of the imperialist policy, and only in some cases (generally relying on the Soviet legacy) Russia is able to withstand the “rules of the game”, given by the imperialist powers. It is argued that these some cases when Russia withstands the “rules of the game” is the main reason for the imperialist powers’ diatribes against “Russian imperialism”.
P52|Labour Shortages Driving Economic Growth?|Summary In most of the countries from Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE), the current virtuous circle of rising consumption and incomes is expected to continue at least in the near term, accompanied by solid GDP growth to the tune of some 3% p.a. Ongoing labour-market improvements and rising wages will continue to be the main growth driver throughout the region; they will be complemented by a recovery in fixed investments as new EU funds become available. The economies of Russia, other CIS countries (except Belarus) and the Ukraine are expected to bottom out, as the negative shocks of the past two years have already been largely absorbed. Turkey is heading for a ‘soft landing’. These are the main findings of the newly released medium-term macroeconomic forecast by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw). Despite the sluggish external environment, economic growth remains fairly strong in the majority of CESEE countries; the economic dynamics in almost half of those countries have intensified over the current year compared to 2015. Growth in the EU Member States from Central and Eastern Europe (EU-CEE) has declined only modestly over the current year, mostly on account of temporary investment weaknesses. It remains 1.5 pp higher on average than in the euro area. In Turkey, economic dynamics were also very solid up until mid-2016, albeit accompanied by signs of ‘overheating’, while the CIS countries are experiencing a ‘bottoming out’. The main driver of growth throughout the CESEE region continues to be private consumption, underpinned by sharply rising wages and incomes as well as decreasing unemployment. The tightening of labour markets and the rising labour shortages are partly a consequence of sizeable outward migration over the past years, which has had a cumulative negative effect on labour supply. A number of countries have also introduced higher minimum wages, sometimes as part of a more general fiscal relaxation package. Inflationary pressures in most CESEE countries – with the exception of the CIS countries and Turkey – are almost non-existent, as solid wage growth has been largely offset by marked gains in labour productivity and a profit squeeze. The expansion of fixed investments, which were an important pillar of GDP growth in 2015, has largely run out of steam this year. In the EU-CEE region, the main reason for this lies in a temporary drop in EU transfers that, in previous years, used to be an important source of investments. EU funds disbursed under the previous 2007-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) were absorbed in 2015 at the latest, whereas attracting new funds under the recently adopted 2014-2020 MFF will take time. At the same time, disregarding the ‘EU transfers effect’, the underlying dynamics of investments remain strong. The export dynamics in many CESEE countries have been better than those of imports, resulting in a positive contribution of net exports to GDP growth. In most EU-CEE countries and Serbia, this is largely a reflection of their ever-strengthening export base and further gains in competitiveness. However, in the CIS countries it is entirely due to the weakness of domestic demand which is still depressed following strong currency depreciations over the past two years. Credit expansion in the CESEE region remains rather modest no country, with the possible exception of Slovakia, is currently experiencing a credit boom. Other factors tend to be more important determinants of the demand for loans than interest rates, which in many CESEE countries are rather low. Going forward, this reduces the risk of ‘boom-and-bust’ developments that have characterised the trajectories of a number of CESEE countries in the run-up to and during the global financial crisis. Domestic demand in many CESEE economies is supported by fiscal policy relaxation, particularly in Romania and Ukraine. One reason for this may have been a decline in government borrowing costs. Furthermore, the general disenchantment with the practical results of ‘expansionary austerity’ pursued in the past has played a role as well. At the same time, in most Western Balkan countries and in the CIS, the fiscal stance tends to be either neutral or restrictive – and in the case of the CIS countries it is essentially pro-cyclical. The impact of the forthcoming Brexit on CESEE economies should be contained by those countries’ relatively low trade exposure to the UK economy. In the EU-CEE region, some 1.6% of GDP is accounted for by final demand from the UK, and that share is even lower in other CESEE countries. At the same time, from 2019 onwards the EU-CEE region potentially faces the prospects of much lower (by up to 20%) EU transfers once the UK – the second largest net contributor country to the EU budget after Germany – leaves the bloc. The migration flows from the EU-CEE region to the UK could fall by nearly half compared to the past two years even without any changes to the migration regime, as the UK will become less of a magnet for migrants.
P52|Growth Stabilises: Investment a Major Driver, Except in Countries Plagued by Recession|GDP growth in the EU Member States of Central and Eastern Europe (EU-CEE), the Western Balkans (WB) and Turkey will remain stable or even increase. The trend growth path will be around 3%. EU-CEE countries will thus continue to catch up to the EU average, however at low speed. Russia and Ukraine, on the other hand, will show a considerably worse performance growth will return in 2017 at the earliest. These are the main results of the newly released medium-term macroeconomic forecast by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw). In 2015, the EU-CEE group registered the highest rate of economic growth since the outbreak of the financial crisis, 3.4% (see Table 1). In 2016-2017 the group will experience some modest growth deceleration on account of the recent consumption boom subsiding and a temporary decline in EU transfers. As for 2018, the EU-CEE countries will pick up some speed driven by an inflow of new investments and transfers. Uncertainties concerning the global economy do not allow us to predict average growth of more than 3% over the medium term. Countries in the Western Balkans also improved their performance in 2015 and will maintain positive growth rates in 2016 and beyond. However unimpressive it may be, compared to their need for catching-up, the average growth rate in the WB countries (excluding Serbia) will not lag behind that in the EU-CEE countries. Turkey will maintain a fragile stability despite relatively high inflation and a high current account deficit, while coping with increasing challenges emerging, for instance, from the war in Syria, the refugee crisis and the loss of export and tourism revenue owing to the Russian trade sanctions. Russia and Belarus will face yet another year of recession in 2016. Russia will continue to suffer from low oil prices, high inflation, currency depreciation, sanctions and fiscal austerity. As usual, structural change and institutional reforms will be slow and half-hearted, incapable of offsetting the losses. Ukraine’s economic growth, after the dramatic fall over the past years, will stabilise as the economy will by and large have completed the adjustment process that was triggered by the country decoupling from Russia and the occupied territories. The Russian annexation of the Crimea and the conflict in East-Ukraine look set to last. Export markets lost will not be regained even in the medium term, nor should one expect the volume of exports to the EU to make up for the shortfall quickly. The divergence of economic performance between the EU-CEE and the WB plus Turkey on the one hand and the CIS-3 (Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan) and Ukraine on the other hand will continue in 2016 and beyond. The difference between the two large country groups, however, will not take on more pronounced dimensions as the recent collapse of the major commodity prices may turn into stagnation. The leading role attributed to household demand in driving economic growth in the EU-CEE and WB countries will be matched by investments. A medium-term investment revival is expected in most of the CESEE countries in both the public and private sectors. FDI has already shown some signs of emerging from stagnation in the EU-CEE and WB countries. Credit conditions for private borrowers have improved. Moreover, gross fixed capital formation is responding to the transfer of EU funds that are bound to decline in 2016, but will recover later, once access to EU transfers provided under the 2014-2020 financing framework picks up. As fiscal consolidation and more rapid economic growth have been achieved, fiscal space has widened in several countries, thus granting governments more room in which to implement and support investments. Even highly indebted countries have managed to adopt a less restrictive fiscal stance. The CIS-3 and Ukraine are outliers in this respect as well; they have started cutting back on expenditures so as to reduce their fiscal deficits. Exports may increase if external demand recovers, but imports may grow even more rapidly as consumption and investment expand in the EU-CEE and WB economies. Thus, net exports will not be a strong driver of economic growth. Foreign investors’ income may rise overall, while remittances and labour income from abroad will remain important sources of current account revenues. Special sections of the Forecast shed light on other topical issues low oil prices are mainly supply-driven; the Juncker Initiative will not take the place of EU transfers; outmigration and demography are leading to labour shortages in EU-CEE countries; the recent inflow of refugees may, in the medium term, put pressure on existing migrant workers in Austria.
P52|Bescheidener Aufschwung im Osten – Bremsklotz EU-Fiskalregeln|Zusammenfassung Bescheidener Aufschwung im Osten – Bremsklotz EU-Fiskalregeln Für die mittel-, ost-und südosteuropäischen Länder (MOSOEL) ist das internationale Umfeld insbesondere von der trägen Erholung des Euro-Raumes gekennzeichnet. Die rigiden EU-Fiskalregeln sind der größte Bremsklotz für einen nachhaltigen wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung in Europa. Mittelfristig erwarten wir für die MOSOEL ein BIP-Trendwachstum von bis zu 3%. Dabei ist der Haushaltskonsum vor allem in den mittel- und osteuropäischen EU-Mitgliedstaaten wachstumsbestimmend. In den Ländern des Westbalkans können auch Investitionen und Nettoexporte als wichtige Wachstumstreiber identifiziert werden. In der Gemeinschaft Unabhängiger Staaten und der Ukraine scheint die Talsohle erreicht worden zu sein. Nach einer Phase der Stagnation kann auch dort ein leichtes Wachstum erwartet werden. Österreich sollte ein Profiteur von der Erholung in den MOSOEL sein, da es sich um wichtige Handelspartner handelt. Für die österreichische Wettbewerbsfähigkeit stellen die MOSOEL aber nur eine geringe Gefahr dar. Längerfristig steigen dort die Löhne stärker als die Produktivität. Die Folgen des BREXIT stellen ein großes Risiko für ganz Europa dar. English Summary Modest recovery in the East – EU fiscal rules act as obstacle to growth The international environment for Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) is affected by the weak recovery in the euro area. The rigid EU fiscal rules are an important obstacle to sustainable economic revival in Europe. Over the medium term, we expect a GDP trend growth rate of up to 3% for CESEE. Especially for the EU members of Central and Eastern Europe, household consumption will be an important component of economic growth. In the countries of the Western Balkans also investment and net exports will be important growth drivers. In the Commonwealth of Independent States and in Ukraine the economic downturn has bottomed out. After a period of stagnation, slow growth can be expected also there. Austria should gain from the recovery in CESEE, given that the region is home to important Austrian trading partners. These pose, however, only little danger for Austrian competitiveness. There, over the longer term wages will be rising faster than productivity. The BREXIT implications pose a substantial risk for all of Europe.
P52|The Belarus Economy: The Challenges of Stalled Reforms|Twenty-five years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Belarus stands out as a special case in transition blending, on the one hand, signs of relative prosperity, socially oriented policies and sprouts of entrepreneurships and, on the other hand, remnants of the communist past. The core of the Belarusian economic model throughout most of this period was a combination of external rents and soft budget constraints on the state-owned part of the economy backed by a strong system of administrative control. In periods of favourable external conditions this mix provided for relatively high rates of economic growth and allowed the authorities to maintain a ‘social contract’ with the population targeting close to full employment. But this model also led to the persistent accumulation of a quasi-fiscal deficit which time and again came to the surface, and its subsequent monetisation provoked macroeconomic and currency turmoil. At present, Belarus’ economic model has run up against its limits and policy changes seem inevitable.
P52|Why East Germany did not become a new Mezzogiorno|Economic integration is generally thought to favour convergence in the economic performance of previously separated regions; but this is far from universally true, as the experience of the members of the Eurozone testifies. The paper considers the two sharply contrasting cases of East and West German convergence following reunification and the enduring poverty of the Italian Mezzogiorno since Italian unification a century and a half ago. In both countries, political integration delivers much higher consumption in the lagging relative to the leading region than of per capita GDP. Consumption convergence can be supported by transfers but ‘production’ convergence ultimately requires catch-up in the production of tradeables. The paper demonstrates the radically different performance of the tradeable sector in the two cases, and suggests that this may be the result of differences in labour market flexibility, in investment performance and in the social norms required for the production of complex manufacturing.
P52|The financial systems in Russia and Turkey: recent developments and challenges|Following the severe financial crises of the 1990s and early 2000s, substantial efforts have been undertaken in Russia and Turkey to diversify and deepen the financial systems. However, despite unquestionable improvements, financial deepening in Russia and Turkey has taken place at a slower pace than in other major emerging economies. Our paper highlights that this is in part a consequence of a highly volatile economic environment and deep-seated institutional and structural bottlenecks. Though authorities in both countries have committed to sounder economic policies and have implemented important structural reforms to improve the institutional environment and overcome structural weaknesses, over time reform fatigue has gradually taken hold. As a consequence significant gaps and weaknesses in the institutional and business environments still characterize, to a different degree, Russia and Turkey. These factors have not only slowed the development of the financial system as a whole, but have also contributed to the build-up of key vulnerabilities, which have come to the fore more recently in the context of a less supportive external environment.
P52|Radicalism Versus Gradualism: An Analytical Survey Of The Transition Strategy Debate|Academic debate on a transition strategy for former socialist economies continues even a quarter century after the collapse of the communism in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. In this paper, through an analytical survey of 137 preceding studies, we present an overall picture of the debate and examine the relationship between the debate attitudes and the literature attributes in related studies. We found that the radicalists maintain a consistent debate attitude from the viewpoints of time speed and policy sequence of economic transition, while the debate attitude of the gradualists is more diversified. We also found that there is another group of researchers that stays within the framework of the radicalism-versus-gradualism debate while at the same time keeping at arm's length from both the radicalists and the gradualists. In addition, our cross tabulation analysis and regression estimation of qualitative selection models provide interesting findings on the relationship between the debate attitudes and the literature attributes.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P52|Wage Inequality and Wage Mobility in Europe|Using data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), this paper investigates wage inequality and wage mobility in Europe. Decomposing inequality into within and between group inequality, we analyse to what extent wage inequality and mobility can be explained by observable characteristics. Furthermore, we investigate which individual and household characteristics determine transitions within the wage distribution. Finally, we examine the importance of institutions for wage inequality, wage mobility, and wage transitions. We find that overall, mobility reduces wage inequality. While a large part of wage inequality is due to unobservable characteristics, the equalizing effect of mobility mainly occurs within groups. Furthermore, both personal and household characteristics play an important role for wage transitions. Finally, our findings reveal large cross-country differences across Europe, which are partly linked to the institutional set-up of the national labour markets.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P52|Does trust contribute to stock market development?|In view of the increasing contributions of social capital in financial development, we examine the relevance of social capital in stock market development by applying Bayesian model averaging on 37 variables across 60 countries from 2000 to 2006. The results demonstrate that trust is a robust and positive determinant of stock market depth and liquidity, and that trust is the most relevant component of social capital in market development. Macroeconomic instability in the form of inflationary changes has a dampening effect on trust in the trading of stock. Further, social capital and its components, particularly trust, are more relevant to stock market development in countries with weak rule of law, non-Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (non-OECD) and Organization of Islamic Co-operation (OIC) countries that are generally characterized by lower formal institutional quality. Our results seek to reinforce the relevance of social capital in complementing the much needed reform of stock markets globally.
P52|The Great Recession and social preferences: Evidence from Ukraine|We use detailed survey data to document stark differences between West and East Ukraine when it comes to household attitudes toward market-based economies and democratic institutions. Along both of these dimensions, Eastern Ukrainians are decidedly less supportive of liberal systems. We also find that economic attitudes changed in response to the global financial crisis. West Ukrainian households who were affected more extensively by the crisis were more disappointed with the market and private ownership, while in Eastern Ukraine economic attitudes became less pro-market across the board. Our evidence suggests that attitudes and values are determined by both deep-rooted factors and more transient macroeconomic shocks.
P52|Interdependence between core and peripheries of the European economy: secular stagnation and growth in the Western Balkans|European countries are economically dependent upon each other. This paper therefore embeds the analysis of the Western Balkan countries within a wider perspective of the European economy as a whole. It combines a simple core-periphery model with an under-consumption model to provide an explanation of the emergence of secular stagnation, the dependency relationships between the core and peripheries of the European economy, and the spillover effects of Eurozone crisis to the Western Balkans. Due to tendencies to under-consumption, the core countries have been vulnerable to secular stagnation. In order to overcome this tendency within the Eurozone they are dependent on export revenues from the peripheries to sustain their economic growth. This has led to high trade and current account deficits during the boom and placed the peripheries in a highly vulnerable position during the recession period. Financialisation of the European economy has emerged as a response to the tendency towards secular stagnation, as the provision of consumer credit stimulated demand and temporarily overcame under consumption tendencies. The paper argues that continuing austerity, as a method to create internal devaluation, is unlikely to succeed as a means to extricate the periphery countries from the crisis. Given the dependencies of the European economies upon one another, a possibly better way out of the current period of low growth and stagnation would be a coordinated fiscal expansion to stimulate domestic and Europe-wide demand.
P52|The Social Market Economy as a Feasible Policy Option for Latin Countries|The growth model of the German economy draws its guiding theoretical principles from the soziale Marktwirtschaft (SMW) and the seminal work of the German economist Alfred Müller-Armack. The first part of this paper discusses the precise characteristics of German neoliberal theories and the SMW in particular. The second part explores the policy history of Argentina and Italy and the exportability of the SMW to such Latin countries. The relation between countries’ economic structure and the reforms needed to achieve such an economic order is analysed.
P52|FESSUD Finance and Well-being Survey; Report|The FESSUD Finance and Well-being Survey is part of the EU FP7 FESSUD project – Financialisation, Economy, Society and Sustainable Development. Taking the household as the main unit of analysis, the survey inquired about household sociodemographic characteristics, household income, household debt, household possessions of financial assets, perceived impact of household financial engagements, welfare provision, and perceived impact of the financial crisis and subjective well-being. It consisted of telephone interviews carried out in November and December 2014 with nationally random samples of households in five countries - Germany, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the UK - selected to be representative of different types of financial system and welfare regime in the EU. For each household, the questionnaire was applied to the individual within the household who declared he or she knew about and was coresponsible for making decisions about the finances of the household. The sample size in the countries ranged from 1300 for Portugal and 1501 for Poland and Sweden, with a total sample of 7009. The survey results indicate that financialisation amplifies extant inequality. In all the countries, household debt and financial assets are concentrated in higher-income households and tend to be a means through which this socioeconomic stratum strengthens its relative advantage. Countries with lower levels of socioeconomic development that have followed such unequal financialisation paths, such as Portugal and Poland, have become more exposed to financial and economic crises, with more detrimental and widespread effects on individual and household well-being.
P52|An analysis of the determinants of the impact of the Great Recession on the Eurozone countries|Although the financial and economic crisis that erupted in 2008 in the European countries can be considered as a common shock, however its impact on the European economies, in general, and the euro countries, in particular, has been very different. The objective of the paper is to analyze whether these differences are due to the existence and size of the macroeconomic imbalances registered before the crisis or, on the contrary, these differences are explained by intrinsic elements of each country. The paper shows that the impacts of the crisis are closely related with intrinsic features of each country or group of countries, and not only with the expected effects of a common shock to the European Union or the Eurozone member states.
P52|The impact of the Great Recession on the European Union countries|Although the Great Recession has been a global phenomenon affecting most developed (and emerging) economies, in the case of the European Union (EU), there are significant differences among EU individual countries and among EU groups of countries, like euro and non-euro countries regarding the depth and duration of the crisis. The paper analyses the effects of the economic and financial crisis on a set of seventeen economic and financial variables, comparing the economic performance of the EU economies before and after the onset of the crisis. The analysis confirms the hypotheses, first, of the existence of significant differences on the performance during the crisis of the EU economies, and, second, that the EU economies most affected by the crisis have been the euro countries, mainly those that join the euro after 1999. In this sense, and focusing on the Eurozone, the paper shows a rising divergence in the macroeconomic performance of euro countries, a divergence process that has been amplified during the Great Recession.
P52|Finance and Sustainability Synthesis Report of WP7|This paper investigates the relationship between finance and environmental sustainability. The first part summarises a few crucial methodological and foundational issues underlying meaning and implications of financialisation, sustainability and their mutual relation. The second part focuses on a particularly significant case study: the unsustainability of the existing energy system based on carbon fuels focusing on the urgency of a rapid transition to a low carbon economy. The third part explores which role financial instruments may play to facilitate the transition towards a low carbon economy. In particular, it investigates the implications for sustainability of the growing trade of energy derivatives. The forth part examines the consequences of the disembedment of money from the socioecological flows of matter and energy. The fifth part investigates the relations between financialisation of built environments and urban sustainability. The final part of the paper draws the main policy implications from the preceding analysis in the light of the growing problems affecting environmental policy in a financialised economy. The main policy conclusion is that, notwithstanding the growing conflict between the ongoing process of financialisation and sustainability, finance has to play a crucial role to implement a process of convergence towards a sustainable path of development.
P52|О некоторых свойствах наблюдаемого экономического роста в Китае (On Some Features of the Observed Economic Growth in China)|Экономический рост современного Китая впечатляет многих. Эта страна предлагается в качестве модели для подражания экономистами с совершенно противоположными взглядами: от либертарианских до этатистских. Авторы попытались показать, что: - китайский экономический рост менее устойчив, чем кажется; - власти страны, особенно в последние годы, совершают действия, подрывающие стабильность роста; Феномен быстрого экономического роста с огромным притоком иностранных инвестиций и бурным ростом экспортоориентированного сектора. Ключевую роль для Китая сыграло прекращение массовых репрессий при легализации бизнеса, создании индивидуальных неформальных гарантий для отечественных и иностранных предпринимателей. То есть предприниматель не лишался свободы и имущества только из-за воли властей, которая была не ограничена законом или какой-либо внутренней или внешней силой. Изменение политической ситуации вместе с накопленным запасом финансовой прочности создали соблазн усилить контроль над экономикой путем отказа от гарантий сначала для отечественного бизнеса, а затем и для иностранного. Именно это и происходит сейчас: когда начались аресты не только предпринимателей – граждан Китая, но и предпринимателей-нерезидентов. In this article authors focused on factors of Chinese economic miracle. Majority of economists are deeply impressed by high rate of China's economic growth. They are going to search for explanations of the coming new successes of this country. The missed point of these assessments is lack of attention to the new trend of poor formalized China institutions' development. Clearly observable in the modern Peoples Republic of China deterioration of entrepreneur's personal immunity informal guaranties means broken guaranties for private property. The government failure to defend (at least not make a threat) to private property could cause negative influence on China's economic growth in very Long Run.
P52|Political Loyalty Vs Economic Performance: Evidence from Machine Politics in Russia’S Regions|Electoral authoritarian regimes often rely on patron-client relationships and political machines to win elections. While a growing literature has focused on the reasons why authoritarian regimes might want to hold elections, the economic consequences associated with the need to win elections have been less intensely studied. In this paper, we argue that while holding elections might offer authoritarian regimes a range of informational and other advantages in the short and medium run, the long-term economic costs can be significant and potentially destabilizing. This effect is especially strong in transition economies, where outdated and inefficient economic structures might be kept alive for political reasons. The theory is tested with an original dataset of gubernatorial appointments from a leading electoral authoritarian regime, the Russian Federation. We find that by incentivizing regional governors to use their political machines to win elections for the regime, the Kremlin effectively punishes those governors that are successfully developing their regional economies, with the effect being especially strong in regions where a high percentage of the population lives in Soviet-era single company towns.
P52|Asia's 'Little Divergence' in the 20th Century: Evidence from PPP-based direct estimates of GDP per capita, 1913-1969|This paper uses expenditure-based PPPs to create direct estimates of GDP per capita for 12 Asian countries in comparable prices for six benchmark years during 1913-1969. The paper finds that levels of real GDP per capita were in several countries comparable to those in Japan in 1913. GDP per capita of Japan and other Asian countries diverged during and after World War I. The paper questions whether Asia's 'little divergence' between Japan and other Asian countries dates back to the late-18th century. It draws attention to the different resource endowments of Japan, China and India compared to other Asian countries, and their implications for the development trajectories of Asian countries. The paper also demonstrates that using historical PPP estimates yields estimates of GDP per capita that diverge from those based on retropolations of the single 1990 PPP-converted benchmark year. It concludes that historical estimates of PPPs are needed to confirm analyses of comparative economic performance based on GDP per capita data.
P52|The Divergent Postcommunist Paths to Democracy and Economic Freedom|This paper presents evidence from 29 postcommunist countries that the economic transition has been more successful than the political transformation in the quarter century since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The adoption of strong parliamentarian systems has countered the adverse effects of religious and imperial history on economic evolution. As a result, the divergence in democracy and political rights is 4 to 5 times larger than the divergence in the path toward economic freedom and ease of doing business. Democracy is not harder to predict than economic freedom—history and ethnicity predict it well. But recent authoritarian regressions in Hungary and Poland, countries with successful economic reforms and strong parliamentarian systems, present a new challenge to researchers.
P52|Post-crisis foreign trade trends and policies on the periphery of the European Union - comparison of the Iberian, Baltic and Central European region|The year of the great trade collapse in the world was 2009. The international crisis caused a shrinkage of domestic demand and general credit crunch. As a consequence, the growth-enhancing role of exports came into focus in most countries. Exports gained momentum from 2010 but with certain changes in structure and direction. Trade within global value chains has become more pronounced and non-EU markets were targeted by several firms. In certain countries it became a deliberate state policy to turn towards non-EU areas. On the one hand, our paper will describe government foreign trade strategies and institutional framework of the Iberian, Baltic and Central European countries, detecting possible similarities. On the other hand we will analyse the actual foreign trade data in the recent years; what are the main export products and services. Apart from desk research, our methodology consists of detailed trade data analysis from the Eurostat Comext database and service trade database. Based on these we can get a picture on the structure and direction of exports of the peripheric economies and this can be compared to the aims of the given states. Our preliminary hypothesis is that there is a gap between the reality and the intentions of the states. The size of this gap varies and is influenced by certain factors like the different involvement of multinational companies in the foreign trade or the different economic structure of these countries.
P52|Encouraging women’s labor force participation in transition countries|Increasing women’s labor force participation is important to sustainable economic development, especially in economies with highly educated women and an aging population. Women’s participation varies across transition countries, driven by such economic and social factors as traditional views of gender roles and limited government support for caregivers. Still, in all countries there is clear scope for policies aimed at increasing women’s participation. In particular, in countries where women’s educational attainment is already high, policies to support a better work−life balance and female entrepreneurship look particularly promising.
P52|Estimating the return to schooling using the Mincer equation|The Mincer equation—arguably the most widely used in empirical work—can be used to explain a host of economic, and even non-economic, phenomena. One such application involves explaining (and estimating) employment earnings as a function of schooling and labor market experience. The Mincer equation provides estimates of the average monetary returns of one additional year of education. This information is important for policymakers who must decide on education spending, prioritization of schooling levels, and education financing programs such as student loans.
P52|Economic prospect on carbon emissions in Commonwealth of Independent States|Abstract This paper measures the ecological performance and reference carbon taxes of 12 Commonwealth of Independent States between 1993 and 2008. I adapted an ecologist’s model into widely used non-parametric directional distance functions approach. On average, countries perform fairly well: eco-efficiency is around 87 %. Enhancing energy consumption would lead to further reductions in CO2 emissions. I find that there was a relative decoupling of GDP from emissions growth. The estimated shadow price of carbon (mean of US$74.37/tCO2) is reasonable and falls into a range proposed by climate scientists. The richer countries had lower shadow prices with smaller range compared to less affluent ones. Overall, given decoupling, the introduction of revenue-neutral carbon tax could have certain merits.
P52|Poland’s Poverty from the US Perspective|Abstract The major objective of this study is to provide a tangible metric that can be used to assess the state of Polish poverty. To do so, we compare certain characteristics of poverty in Poland and United States, with a focus on different societal groups affected by poverty in each country. Based on official, mostly income-based statistics measuring poverty in the United States and Poland, we find that a higher percentage of the overall population in the United States is poor than in Poland and, relative to median country-specific incomes, that poverty is deeper. Examining selected societal groups that typically experience a high incidence of poverty, we find more American children, elderly, and disabled are poor than in Poland. In conclusion, the breadth of poverty is wider in the United States than in Poland and, perhaps more importantly, poverty in America may also, in some important ways, be more intractable.
P52|Social Obstacles to Technology, Technological Change, and the Economic Growth of African Countries: Some Anecdotal Evidence from Economic History|This paper comments on a number of social obstacles to the economic growth and technological change of African economies from the perspective of economic history. Economic history is full of evidence about what held African economies back for years. Some obstacles are of domestic origin such as excessive consumption and luxury masqueraded as public investment. Other obstacles were imposed from outside such as the destruction and weakening of traditional African religions and religious leadership as well as other wide ranging institutions. The combined effects can be summed up in one word: de-institutionalization. De-institutionalization devalued local knowledge (technology) thereby reducing performance. It is not possible to turn the clock back, but current policy is better-off bringing these obstacles into discussion as they stand a good chance of lowering the socalled “Africa dummy” variable common to growth regressions. Future research would also benefit if it sought to adjust conventional economic theory to allow space for the special features of African economies. Market theory is misleading in treating private use rights as antithetical to private ownership rights. For example, the suggestion that land tenure in Africa is anti-growth is inconsistent with the spectacular growth China has experienced even without private property rights.
P52|"""Economics of the constants"" and long cycles of energy prices dynamics"|This paper shows the cyclical evolution of energy prices and energy costs share with cycles lasting 25—30 years. Energy costs constants, i.e. stable over long time energy costs to income ratio, are the center of ‘economic gravitation’. Cycles and energy affordability thresholds are found in all major final energy use sectors manifesting the ‘minus one’ phenomenon, which shows that cycle-long energy intensity changes as much as real energy prices. Energy affordability thresholds and asymmetric price elasticities are important factors determining the existence of the turning points towards the center of ‘economic gravitation’ in the cyclic evolution of energy costs shares. The cyclical nature of energy price dynamics has been manifesting for five centuries and experienced multiple technological transitions and changes in the energy mix.
P52|Analysis of Financial Intermediation in Romania|The aim of this paper is to analyze the degree of financial intermediation in Romania. At the same time it comprises an analysis of the three indicators which show the degree of financial intermediation in Romania: credits/GDP; deposits/GDP; bank assets/GDP for the period 20042015. We want to study the relation between the three indicators that define financial intermediation with the help of the correlation coefficient.
P52|Fiscal Incentives in Federations: Russia and the US Compared|I compare fiscal incentives in Russia and the US according to the conventional measures employed in the relevant literature. Although Russia is more fiscally centralized as measured by shares of budget expenditures and revenues, measures of fiscal incentives at the margin are largely similar in the US and Russia both at the regional and municipal levels. These results are contrary to the estimates obtained for Russia in the earlier literature. It appears that fiscal federalism reforms undertaken in Russia throughout the 2000s improved fiscal incentives of subnational governments. However, these results should be treated with great caution as fiscal incentive measures employed in this paper and in the literature at large are far from perfect. This might provide an explanation for the result that intraregional fiscal incentives do not have a significant effect on economic growth.
P52|The Hungarian Economic Policy Model After 2010|The aim of this paper is to understand and provide reasoning for the strategic changes in Hungarian economic policy after 2010. High levels of foreign indebtedness and internal imbalances have necessitated the strategic changes in economic policy in Hungary after 2010. Due to the strategic changes results have been reached as follows. Decreasing internal imbalances: employment rate increased by 9 precentage points, tax burden of SMEs decreased by 9.1 percentage points; wage ratio increased due to income redistribution from sectoral taxes to wage tax allowances; as a result net wages and minimum wage increased in real terms by 10% and 14% between 2010–2015. Decreasing external imbalances: NFL decreased by 40% of GDP between 2010–2015; foreign currency denominated state debt declined from 49% to 30% of GDP; state-owned shareholding increased by an estimated 5% of GDP between 2010 and 2014 mostly in utilities, critical infrastructure and oligopolistic and monopolistic sectors. Following the diagnosis of this paper, the measures after 2010 constitute a coherent economic policy strategy. The paper argues that current challenges of the Hungarian economy are deeply rooted in the past decisions and that the economic policy model after 2010 aims to address these challenges.
P52|Finland and Its Northern Peers in the Great Recession|Abstract The report focuses on the relative macroeconomic performance since the global financial crisis of six Northern European countries with a special emphasis on Finland. While fiscal and monetary policies have definitely impacted on macroeconomic outcomes in the six countries examined, as a whole they do not appear to be the key driving forces of the differences observed between the countries. The initial vulnerabilities, the nature of shocks and the resilience of the economies appear more important in explaining the differences. In particular, the weakness of growth in Finland can best be explained by a series of exceptional negative shocks in combination with a too weak capacity of the economy to improve its cost competitiveness in the absence of exchange rate flexibility.
P52|A Literature Survey On Proposed African Monetary Unions|This study provides a survey of recent advances in the literature on proposed African monetary unions. The survey comprises about 60 empirical papers published during the past fifteen years. Four main strands are discussed individually and collectively, notably, the proposed: West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ), East African Monetary Union (EAMU), Southern African Monetary Union (SAMU) and African Monetary Union (AMU). We observe a number of issues with establishing the feasibility and/or desirability of potential monetary unions, inter alia, variations in: choice of variables, empirical strategies, sampled countries and considered periodicities. We address this ambiguity by reviewing studies with scenarios that are consistent with Hegelian dialectics and establish selective expansion as the predominant mode of monetary integration. Some proponents make cases for strong pegs and institutions as viable alternatives to currency unions. Using cluster analysis, disaggregating panels into sub-samples and distinguishing shocks from responses in the examination of business cycle synchronisation provide more subtle policy implications. We caution that for inquiries using the same theoretical underpinnings, variables and methods just by modifying the scope/context and periodicity may only contribute to increasing the number of conflicting findings. Authors should place more emphasis on new perspectives and approaches based on caveats of, and lessons from the European Monetary Union (EMU) and CFA zones.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P52|Introduction|This introductory chapter presents the book concept and tries to draw the red line which connects its various parts. It does so by means of a presentation of the main content of each chapter of the book, which is located in the relevant literature in order to allow the reader to better appreciate the main novelties.
P52|Worker Turnover Across Italian Regions|This chapter provides prima facie evidence of the geographical distribution of worker turnover within Italian regions as measured based on the longitudinal files of the labour force survey (LFS) for the period 2004–2010. It explains the stylized facts emerging from this enquiry with an interpretation based on the industrial change literature. Industrial turbulence, rather than labour market flexibility, is driving labour turnover within regions, as the correlation with the Lilien (positive) and the Herfindahl (negative) indices, respectively, shows. In other words, industrial change causes greater job destruction and flows into and out of unemployment, while, as also Alfred Marshall noted, the availability of more specialised districts could partly offset the diseconomies of specialisation in terms of greater exposure to external shocks, when the unit of analysis is sufficiently large, as it is in our case (NUTS1 and NUTS2). We also find that, at an individual level, the regional gap in turnover rates is due to regional differences in the gender, age and education attainment of the workforce, as well as the share of temporary work contracts and the size of firms.
P52|Jingle Bells and Struggling GIPS: Comparing the Baltic and the Southern Eurozone’s Crisis Experience Using the Varieties of Capitalism Framework|This article compares the experience of the Baltic countries and the eurozone’s southern members, the GIPS (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain), in terms of the run-up to the Great Recession and the eurozone crisis, responses during the downturn, and the subsequent recovery (or lack thereof). It discusses numerous apparent similarities in terms of the build-up of macroeconomic vulnerabilities and the content of anti-crisis strategies pursued as well as the substantially different results of these policies. This article applies the VoC (Varieties of Capitalism) approach. To this end, it presents theoretical expectations regarding different varieties’ vulnerability to macroeconomic imbalances, preferences regarding anti-crisis policy as well as the likely outcome of the internal devaluation strategy. The article finds the VoC approach largely useful, although it is more helpful in accounting for the nature of reaction to the crisis and the outcomes of anti-crisis policy, while less so in explaining the initial accumulation of vulnerabilities.
P52|Gospodarki Danii, Finlandii i Szwecji a globalny kryzys finansowy / The Global Financial Crisis in Denmark, Finland and Sweden|This paper explores the Nordic states (Denmark, Finland and Sweden) during the global crisis in the period 2007−2012. The Nordic states have a high rate of socio-economic growth and competitive advantage but Denmark, Finland and Sweden still experienced the global crisis. However, the global financial crisis followed different paths in these countries. As a result, the economic effects of the crisis in Denmark, Sweden and Finland were better, compared to other advanced economies of European Union. The aim of this paper is to present a comparative study of the reaction of the Nordic states to the financial crisis and the economic crisis.
P52|The Growth Contribution of Colonial Indian Railways in Comparative Perspective|It is widely recognized that railways were one of the most important drivers of economic growth in the 19th and 20th century, but it is less recognized that railways had a different impact across countries. In this paper, we first estimate the growth impact of Indian railways, one of the largest networks in the world circa 1900. Then, we show railways made a smaller contribution to income per-capita growth in India compared to the most dynamic Latin American economies between 1860 and 1912. The smaller contribution in India is related to four factors: (1) the smaller size of railway freight revenues in the Indian economy, (2) the higher elasticity of demand for freight services, (3) lower wages, and (4) higher fares. Our results suggest large disruptive technologies such as railways and other communication technologies can generate huge resources savings, but may not have large growth impacts.
P52|Bank Ownership And Cost Efficiency In Russia, Revisited|This paper adds to the literature on banking in transition with regard to the comparative efficiency of public, private and foreign banks. We perform stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) of Russian bank-level quarterly data from 2005 to 2013. The method of computation of comparative cost efficiency is amended to control for the effect of the revaluations of foreign currency items in bank balance sheets. All public banks are split into the core and other state-controlled banks. We employ the generalized method of moments to estimate a set of distance functions measuring the observed differences in the SFA scores of banks and bank clusters, depending on the heterogeneity in risk preference and asset structure. These distance functions explain the changes in bank efficiency rankings. Our results on comparative bank efficiency are qualitatively different from those in mainstream papers. The efficiency scores of Russian banks are higher and less volatile, and spreads between the scores of different bank types are narrower than hitherto believed. Foreign banks appear as the least cost-efficient type of market participants, while the core state banks are, on average, nearly as efficient as domestic private banks. We suggest that foreign banks are capable of being more cost efficient than others if they increase loans-to-assets ratios above the sample median level. Core state banks, conversely, lead in terms of cost efficiency if their loans-to-assets ratio falls below the sample median level. Our approach is potentially applicable to the analysis of bank efficiency in other dollarized emerging markets
P52|Reserve requirements and the bank lending channel in China|This paper examines how reserve requirements influence the transmission of monetary policy through the bank lending channel in China while also taking into account the role of bank ownership. The implementation of Chinese monetary policy is characterized by the reliance on the reserve requirements as a regular policy tool with frequent adjustments. Using a large dataset of 170 Chinese banks for the period 2004–2013, we analyze the reaction of loan supply to changes in reserve requirements. We find no evidence of the bank lending channel through the use of reserve requirements. We observe, nonetheless, that changes in reserve requirements influence loan growth of banks. The same findings hold true for other monetary policy instruments. Further, we show that the bank ownership format influences transmission of monetary policy.
P52|Demographic Structural Change in North Korea and Its Implications (in Korean)|The demographic structure of North Korea is one of the most important variables that could influence economic growth or unification cost in the processes of transition and integration with South Korea. This paper examines changes in the demographic structure of North Korea based on the World Population Prospects of the UN: it compares demographic structures between an integrated Korea and the reunified Germany, as well as those between North Korea, China and Vietnam. Based on these comparisons, we could draw some important implications for demographic issues during the transition of North Korea and after reunification. In China and Vietnam, the first demographic dividend effect caused by a sharp decline in the dependency ratio has been pronounced in the process of economic growth since the reform and opening-up. However, North Korea, which had already completed its demographic transition before the 1990s, is unlikely to enjoy the demographic dividend effect in the future even if it attempts to embark on reform and opening-up. Meanwhile, the population integration between North Korea, whose the youth population ratio and total fertility rate (TFR) are higher, and South Korea can delay entering into an aged society by 4 years. It is also expected to make the share of the working-age population increase by up to 4.3%p by 2065, compared to that of South Korea. However, the speed of population aging of an integrated Korea is expected to be faster than that of the reunified germany.
P52|Do Natural Disasters Hurt Tax Resource Mobilization?|According to several reports, natural disasters and climate change will intensify and dampen development if appropriate measures are not implemented. Our paper contributes to this literature and analyzes the impact of natural disasters on domestic resource mobilization in developing countries. Using propensity score matching estimators over the period of 1980-2012 for 120 developing countries, our results conclude that government revenues decrease in the aftermath of natural disasters. Moreover natural disasters that occur in border countries have a negative impact on government revenues of neighbor countries. However, the adverse effects of natural disasters are dampened in countries with high level of resilience capacity and stronger governance.
P52|Cost efficiency of the banking industry and unilateral euroisation: A stochastic frontier approach in Serbia and Montenegro|This paper aims at investigating the differences in cost efficiency of the banking industry in Serbia and Montenegro over the period 2005–2012. These two countries operated under a common monetary regime until 1999 and followed two different monetary regimes thereafter: unilateral euroisation in Montenegro and monetary independence in Serbia. A stochastic frontier approach incorporating bank-specific and country-related variables is used to analyze cost efficiency in the banking sectors of Serbia and Montenegro. The analysis shows that a bank operating at given conditions in terms of ownership, market and other specific characteristics presents significantly higher cost efficiency if it operates in Montenegro rather than in Serbia. We argue that this result may relate to the choice of unilateral euroisation made by Montenegro. It is also shown that foreign-owned banks, higher capitalized banks and banks with lower non-performing loans operate at higher cost efficiency.
P52|Wage determination and distribution in urban China and Vietnam: A comparative analysis|Wages are higher in China than in Vietnam. Using data from the Chinese Household Income Project 2002 and the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey 2002, this paper aims to understand the sources of the wage differences between the two countries. The decomposition results show that for men (women), differences in returns to observed wage determinants contribute more to the inter-country wage gap for most of the wage distribution (the part of the distribution beyond the 20th quantile). Differences in returns to industry are especially important contributor to the wage structure effect for males. For females, differences in the returns to education and experience are the important contributors to the wage structure effect at the middle of the wage distribution. At the low end of the female wage distribution, differences in the distribution of education and experience are the main factors. Despite the lower wages, the relatively lower skilled workforce and the less competitive industry, as a result of the less extensive ownership and trade reforms and slower pace of change in education policy, may erode Vietnam’s attractiveness.
P52|Anatomy of the â€œEconomic Miracleâ€|The authors analyze evolutionary-institutional patterns and factors of economic growth and development on the example of a number of countries which have demonstrated the â€œeconomic miracleâ€ . Their research method is a structure of socio-economic genotype which aims at maximizing the economic system outcomes. It is concluded that the â€œeconomic miracleâ€ appears when the economic policy and development strategy of a country coincide with the succession (logic) of a cyclic structure of genotype as a driving force of economic evolution.
P52|Implications of the Transformation of the State-Owned Banking System into System of Foreign-Owned Banks in New Member States for Macroeconomic and Financial Stability|All studied CEECs represent heterogeneous entities with different starting positions in their transition to market economies as well as chosen paths that have constrained or enabled the emergence of macro-economic and financial fragility, associated with the dominance of foreign-owned banks in the transition economies of CEE region. The implications of foreign ownership for macro-economic stability have to be presented and interpreted with caution. When drawing conclusions on the effects of different ownership structure, one has to bear in mind that in the case of CEECs, specific historical context needs to be acknowledged, as several problems and obstacles in achieving the macroeconomic stability with the state-ownership in the banking sector were related to the transition process from socialist production regime to the introduction of market economy institutions. In the 2000s, on the other hand, the activities of foreignowned banks took place in the context of increasing global liquidity and asset prices’ boom that was taking place in the Western world. Hence, ownership as such has not mattered so much for the macro-economic stability in the CEECs, but rather internal developments, that is, transition to market economy with associated challenges in the 1990s that rendered these economies unstable, and external factors, such as international capital flows in the 2000s that incurred imbalances through the activities of the banking sector.
P52|Democracy and Football|In this paper we explore to what extent political regimes affect the competitive balance in domestic football (soccer) leagues. Relying on data from around 50 European countries and over 2,000 domestic leagues, we show that the percentage of league competitions won by the most successful club in the country is substantially lower in democracies than in non-democracies. Democratic transitions and higher levels of democracy trigger pressures to increase the competitive balance in football leagues in two ways. First, the link between non-democracies and specific teams breaks when a country experiences a transition to democracy. Second, the economic liberalization that takes place in transitions to democracy disperses resources and generates competition among descending and ascending teams. Finally, the competitive balance of domestic leagues has not been greatly affected by the Bosman transfer ruling, a sectorial liberalization shock on football labor markets.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P52|Development at the Border: Policies and National Integration in Côte D'Ivoire and Its Neighbors|By applying regression discontinuity designs to a set of household surveys from the 1980–90s, we examine whether Côte d'Ivoire's aggregate wealth was translated at the borders of neighboring countries. At the border of Ghana and at the end of the 1980s, large discontinuities are detected for consumption, child stunting, and access to electricity and safe water. Border discontinuities in consumption can be explained by differences in cash crop policies (cocoa and coffee). When these policies converged in the 1990s, the only differences that persisted were those in rural facilities. In the North, cash crop (cotton) income again made a difference for consumption and nutrition (the case of Mali). On the one hand, large differences in welfare can hold at the borders dividing African countries despite their assumed porosity. On the other hand, border discontinuities seem to reflect the impact of reversible public policies rather than intangible institutional traits.
P52|Do Natural Disasters Hurt Tax Resource Mobilization?|According to several reports, natural disasters and climate change will intensify and dampen development if appropriate measures are not implemented.

Using propensity score matching estimators over the period of 1980-2012 for 120 developing countries, our results conclude that government revenues decrease in the aftermath of natural disasters.

However, the adverse effects of natural disasters are dampened in countries with high level of resilience capacity and stronger governance.
P52|Bank ownership and cost efficiency in Russia, revisited|This paper considers the comparative efficiency of public, private, and foreign banks in Rus-sia, a transition economy with several unusual features. We perform stochastic frontier anal-ysis (SFA) of Russian bank-level quarterly data over the period 2005–2013. The method of computation of comparative cost efficiency is amended to control for the effect of revalua-tion of foreign currency items in bank balance sheets. Public banks are split into core and other state-controlled banks. Employing the generalized method of moments, we estimate a set of distance functions that measure the observed differences in SFA scores of banks and bank clusters (heterogeneity in risk preference and asset structure) to explain changes in bank efficiency rankings. Our results for comparative Russian bank efficiency show higher efficiency scores, less volatility, and narrower spreads between the scores of different bank types than in previous studies. Foreign banks appear to be the least cost-efficient market participants, while core state banks on average are nearly as efficient as private domestic banks. We suggest that foreign banks gain cost-efficiency when they increase their loans-to-assets ratios above the sample median level. Core state banks, conversely, lead in terms of cost efficiency when their loans-to-assets ratio falls below the sample median level. The presented approach is potentially applicable to analysis of bank efficiency in other dollarized emerging markets.
P52|25 Years of the Transition Strategy Debate: Radicalism versus Gradualism|In this paper, we trace the academic debate on the transition strategies that former socialist countries have adopted and implemented in evolving towards a market-oriented economy through a comprehensive review of the preceding literature. The debate has developed as an argument between two conflicting reform philosophies, namely, radicalism and gradualism. Despite that a quarter century that has passed since the fall of the Berlin Wall, we found that academic discussion regarding these two reform alternatives has continued, and there is no sign of convergence. We also found a close relationship between the debate attitudes and the literature attributes, such as authorship, research contents and publication media.
P52|Inequality and welfare: Is Europe special?|We review the literature about inequality and welfare with a particular focus on whether Europe has a special sensitivity to these matters or specific outcomes. We argue that both statements are likely to be true which raises the possibility of a causal link. Europe has relatively good results in terms of inequality and welfare in comparison with other continents and more specifically America, because these issues matter for European people. Still, research needs to be fostered in at least 5 areas that are detailed at the end of this review. A specific attention is devoted to the contribution of other social sciences and natural sciences (cognitive science) to the development of our knowledge for these fields.
P52|The Inheritance of Educational Inequality among Young People in Developing Countries|This letter provides new evidence on the extent of the inheritance of educational inequality in the eight developing countries (Azerbaijan, China, Egypt, Iran, Kosovo, Mongolia, Nepal, Syria) where the ILO carried out the first wave of School-to-Work Transition survey. We observe different patterns of correlation between the level of intergenerational mobility, the educational upgrade and the role of parents' in sons' and daughters' education.
P52|Foreign Direct Investment In North Korea And The Effect Of Special Economic Zones: Learning From Transition Economies|This study analyzes critical factors that foreign investors would consider before investing in North Korea by empirically analyzing key FDI determinants in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (i.e., transition economies) and juxtaposing these results against North Korea¡¯s main investment hurdles and pull factors in order to suggest a way forward. For the empirical study, a fixed effect model is employed based on the panel data of all the transition economies through their entire transition periods. The analysis suggests that the special economic zones in the Visegrad countries could provide a relevant benchmark for North Korea.
P52|The Reconfiguration Of The Contemporary World Economic Order. Determining The Position Of The European Union Within The Hierarchy Of Power Centres|The hereby study offers an ensemble image upon the effects of the contemporary economic order and reconfiguration of the European Union. In this light, we wish to stress the main tendencies of the current world conjunction, the economic, politic and geostrategic opportunities and challenges, as well as the factors that contributed to the affirmation of the European Union on the global economic scene. In order to determine the position that European Union occupies in the hierarchy of the power centres, we analysed the main indexes of economic growth, the impact of politics and reforms upon the integration process, the effect of the global crises upon the European structure and the existent discrepancies between different regions of the European Union. The main conclusion drawn from this study is that, by aspiring to the status of a superpower and trying to affirm itself as an economic and politic individuality, able to sustain its own visions and protects its own interests, the European Union should aim to become a political global force. However, it is hard to achieve that since the European Union lacks an internal cohesion and the required capabilities in order to develop a global policy.
P52|Niche Tourism Markets – Means Of Enhancing Sustainable Economic Development In Eu’S Eastern Periphery|Within Europe, processes of economic convergence and divergence operate at various geographical scales, resulting in a very uneven geographical landscape. As mentioned in the international literature, the European economic space is characterized by a core-periphery structure. From this point of view, tourism has important significance since it is a noteworthy activity in the European Union and contributes to employment, income generation, overall development and economic rejuvenation of rural, peripheral or underdeveloped areas. There has been a shift in the nature of tourism demand driven by changes in consumption patterns, namely an increasing emphasis on more personalized or on specialized forms of tourist packages. This aspect required smaller and more flexible provision that created niche markets capable of providing peripheral areas the opportunity to capitalize on their comparative advantages associated with their natural environments, cultural heritage, and the role of local food in reinforcing personal identity and authenticity. The purpose of this study is to analyze EU’s Eastern periphery (Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia) niche tourism markets potential and identify a few guiding principles that may lead to sustainable economic development.
P52|Outward Foreign Direct Investment from BRIC countries: Comparing strategies of Brazilian, Russian, Indian and Chinese multinational companies|An overall comparative study of outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) from BRIC countries and strategies conducted by multinational companies (MNCs) based in the BRICs is elaborated on with a same methodology for Brazil, Russia, India and China. The comparison pertains to the historical emergence of firmsâ€™ internationalisation, their booming expansion in the 2000s then their muddling through the current crisis, the specificities of OFDI from each home country, OFDI geographical distribution and industrial structure, econometric testing of the respective determinants of Brazilian, Russian, Indian and Chinese OFDI, and the role of home countriesâ€™ governments vis-Ã -vis home-based MNCs. Beyond some common characteristics, BRICsâ€™ MNCs exhibit a number of major country-specific features.
P52|Accumulation, Development, and Exploitation in Different Colonial and Post-Colonial Contexts: Taiwan, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1900-80|The Belgian Congo (Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), the Netherlands Indies (Indonesia), and Taiwan/Formosa (now the Republic of China) experienced policies during the 19th and early 20th century which could be termed exploitative or extractive, although some policies in these colonies could also be termed developmental. All three colonies had a troubled passage to independence, and the immediate post-independence era was marked by considerable political and economic turmoil. But the growth performance of the three former colonies has been very different. Taiwan has seen very rapid growth sustained over decades; Indonesiaâ€™s economic growth since 1970 has been quite robust; the Congo has seen a growth collapse which is extraordinary even by African standards. The paper suggests some explanations for this divergence in terms of policies pursued by the Japanese, Dutch and Belgian colonial regimes, and by postindependence governments in these countries.
P52|Comparative Analysis of the Housing and Utility Services Affordability for the Population of the Russian Federation and Foreign Countries|The affordability of housing and utility services for the population of Russian Federation and foreign countries is analyzed in the article. The authors have developed the method which gives the opportunity to bring the housing and utility costs of the population of Russian Federation and foreign countries to comparable conditions. The main result is providing reliable distribution of the costs of the housing and utility services in European countries, where Russian Federation has one of the lowest positions. So, existing substantiation of freezing tariffs for housing and utility services is ungrounded. There is a socio-economic opportunity to raise tariffs for increasing investment attractiveness of the sector. There is also a need for redistribution of the population spending between housing and utility services in favor of the former.
P52|"The Historic ""March"" of the Bulgarian Economy in the Space of the Liberal and the State Capitalism"|"The research uses as methodology the cluster analysis of the types of capitalism made in a project funded by the SRA of UNWE ""The clusters of capitalism (typology and dynamics of the capitalist economies)"" defended and published as a monograph. The historic ""march"" of the Bulgarian economy in the space of the liberal and the state capitalism for the period from 1925 to 2005 is studied. Economic, demographic, infrastructure and social indicators of the Bulgarian economy are examined. The comparative analysis of the socio-economic development of Bulgaria and Greece is made."
P52|Quaternary sector and extended sectoral structure of the economy in the selected European countries|This article deals with definition and establishing of extended sectoral structure of the economy in selected EU countries in years 2003 - 2012. Extended sectoral structure is based on traditional sectoral structure enhanced by fourth, quaternary sector which includes all economic activities touching all areas of intellectual activities and operations. Extended sectoral structure reflects changes and impetuses in the economy and society such as formation of knowledge economy, rising importance of innovation, technology and information and their impact on increase of production potential, competitiveness and economic growth.
P52|Internal And External Determinants Of Commercial Banks Profitability: Empirical Evidence From Bulgaria And Romania|Our study focuses on commercial banks which are operating in Bulgaria and Romania, two countries whose banking sectors have registered major structural changes in the transition to a market economy and which are showing some similarities. Similar to other EU countries, the financial system from Bulgaria and Romania is dominated by the banking sector, which holds the largest share of total assets. Thus, we can say that health, strength and performance of the banking sector are of major importance for the sustainable economic development of states, but also for efficient transmission of monetary policy decisions on the real economy. The paper aims to identify the key factors that affect bank profitability and to evaluate empirically their contribution to a sample of 29 commercial banks in Bulgaria and Romania, for the period 2003-2012. Our research is based on data from the Bureau Van Dijk database, the World Bank and the European Central Bank and uses panel data estimation techniques. The dependent variable used in our study is the bank profitability, which is measured by two representative indicators the Return on Average Assets (ROAA) and Return on Average Equity (ROAE). Regarding the independent variables, our analysis includes capital adequacy, the loan loss reserve rate, cost to income ratio, the ratio of liquid assets to total assets, the interest expenses to deposits ratio, the non-interest income over total gross revenues, bank size, the GDP per capita growth, inflation rate, domestic bank credit to private sector and banking industry concentration. The results of our empirical study shows that among the variables considered, the loan loss reserve rate, the ratio of cost to income, GDP per capita growth and domestic bank credit to the private sector, have a significant impact on bank profitability, results in line with our expectations, but also with the results of other empirical studies.
P52|Resolving Insolvency Management: Competitiveness Of National Business Environments1|The problem of insolvency and over-indebtedness has long been present in most of the world economies. Number of insolvent businesses, as well as the value of unsettled obligations has been steadily rising in the past decade. On the other hand legal business environment framework is considered to have an important facilitating/limiting role in treating the problems, arising from the situations of insolvency and over-indebtedness of businesses. The insolvency legislation and monitoring as an essential part of such framework belongs to the most dynamic fields of contemporary research interest. The goal of this paper is to detect the most reformative national economies of the European Union in business insolvency management dealing with speediness and cost management of the resolution process. Th at should reveal the features of a business environment as a platform for finding better indebtedness management possibilities. The methodology entails using World Bank data on efficiency in resolving insolvency across all EU national economies in the period of 12 years. Scoring system is developed and applied to the data.As a result, the countries are ranked according to the intensity of their reformative efforts in the field of insolvency management in the researched period. The features of the highest ranking countries will be analyzed, as the best practices of facilitating role of such frameworks.
P52|How the Distribution System and the Granting of Drug Discounts, is an Influencing Factor for a Pharmaceutical Units’ Financial Performance|The study aims to analyze how the economic and financial indicators of pharmaceutical entities are influenced by the discounts granted by distributors of pharmaceuticals. The work is based on the analysis of economic and financial performance indicators accomplished by a community pharmacy in Prahova. Thus, the analyzed discounts, granted by distributors of drugs related to pharmaceutical entities, registered separate values for each distributor and product groups and their share in turnover.
P52|The Political Economy Of Staying Outside The Eurozone: Poland And Sweden Compared|This paper deals with the issue of political constraints put on economic policies that derive from the distribution of power in democratic societies. Poland and Sweden are both euro-outsiders that are obliged to adopt the euro, but recent developments within the Eurozone and related to the 2008+ crisis engendered widespread reluctance among the public to give up national currencies. Within a short time, the general support for the euro turned strongly negative, making it a grave challenge for politicians to pursue the adoption of the common currency. On this background, we reflect on the alleged correspondence between these two countries that would allow to follow similar policies toward euro introduction. We point to the idiosyncrasy of the Swedish case that makes it virtually impossible to emulate its policies by a country like Poland with very different long-term goals and starting conditions. By doing so, we highlight the context of policymaking that seems crucial to a successful art of political economy.
P52|European growth models and working class restructuring before the crisis|This paper builds on post-Keynesian macroeconomics, the Regulation Approach and a Neo-Gramscian International Political Economy approach to class analysis and offers an empirical analysis of European growth models and working class restructuring in Europe between 2000 and 2008. We will distinguish between the ‘East’, the ‘North’, and the ‘South’ and structure our analysis around industrial upgrading, financialisation and working class coherence. We find an export-driven growth model in the North, which came with wage suppression and outsourcing to the East. In the East the growth model can be characterised as dependent upgrading, which allowed for high real wage growth despite declining working class coherence. The South experienced a debt-driven growth model with a real estate bubble and high inflation rates resulting in large current account deficits. Our analysis shows that class restructuring forms an integral part in the economic process that resulted in European imbalances and the Euro crisis.
P52|Impact of Wage Policy on Economic Growth in Transitive Countries and New Interpretation of the Phillips Curve|This paper considers the problem why minimal and average earnings differ dramatically in rich and new EU countries, as well as in Ukraine. Such phenomenon is usually explained by the difference among levels of labour productivity but the modern globalization processes have been doing the technology of production in many emerging economies very similar, especially in cases of the transnational companies’ influences. The practice of the Post-Socialist transitive countries also has been demonstrating such problem. While in the beginning of the reforms they were at more or less equal economic levels, very soon they were becoming a very differ by labour cost, and it led to significant differentiation of GDP per capita. For the short-term period it is difficult to explain this phenomenon by the cardinal changes in the physical labour productivity of existing productions, but it can be done taking into account the difference in the wages policy, and the innovation changing of technological structure of production. Mentioned problems have been analysed using the Phillips curve approach. The analysis shows the transitive countries which had undertaken considerable gradual increasing of labour cost and simultaneously stimulating of the innovation activities then later they have got a high dynamics of real GDP per capita.
P52|Vietnam's responses to provincial economic disparities through central-provincial government financial relations|The paper examines key changes in central-provincial government financial arrangements and their effects on provincial economic disparities in Vietnam over the period 2000-2008. We find that after 2004, transfers from the central to provincial governments conformed much more closely to objective and pre-determined criteria than before. Econometric estimations indicate that in the post-2004 sub-period, poorer provinces obtained more-than-proportionate assistance from the central government, and the favourable treatment was statistically significant. Responses from interviews and statistical data suggest that transfers from the central government played an important role in reducing poverty and provincial output disparities after 2004. The difficulties experienced by the central government in securing adequate resources to finance such transfers, the over-reliance of some provinces on the transfers, and related policy implications are also discussed in the paper.
P52|Disparities and Growth within APEC Countries, 1990~2011|This paper examines output disparities between the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation countries during the period 1990~2011. The results show that inter-country levels of output per capita diverged over the study period but there was a clear break in the trend around 1998. Applying the time-varying individual common factor model, we found that all countries could be grouped into three convergence clubs. Focusing on the time path of each country’s output level relative to that of a reference economy such as the United States of America and allowing for possible structural breaks, we found that more countries converged towards the USA during the sub-period 1999~2011. The findings also suggest that the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation could have played some role in diminishing the output inequality between its member countries after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation reached its current extent in 1998. Likewise, the paper suggests a need to reduce the wide income gap among the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation countries to promote their economic integration.

P52|Croissance, inégalités et pauvreté au sein des pays émergents : le cas des BRICS|Les cinq pays qui forment les BRICS (Brésil, Russie, Inde, Chine et Afrique du Sud) se singularisent, dans les années 2000, à la fois par une forte croissance économique – liée au processus de transformation économique et plus précisément d’ouverture commerciale et financière – ainsi que par une diminution de la pauvreté. Mais malgré ces évolutions communes, nous relevons une diversité des chemins concernant la dynamique croissance-inégalités au sein de ce groupe. Pour tous les pays à l’exception du Brésil, la croissance s’est accompagnée d’une hausse des inégalités de revenus. De surcroît, cette montée des inégalités s’est produite dans des situations variées et selon des mécanismes très différents. Nous pouvons observer que l’évolution des inégalités de revenus est influencée par une multitude de facteurs – le cadre économique global dans lequel un pays conduit son intégration dans l’économie mondiale peut, en effet, emprunter différentes voies. En fonction du sentier emprunté, les évolutions des inégalités peuvent s’opposer et apparaissent largement dépendantes des politiques nationales de transformation et des politiques sociales adoptées. Les effets liés à la mondialisation ne peuvent donc pas expliquer à eux seuls la montée ou la diminution des inégalités. Après avoir décrit, dans une perspective d’étude comparative, la dynamique croissance-inégalités-pauvreté propre à chaque pays au sein des BRICS, cette étude analysera l’évolution des différentes trajectoires nationales empruntées. Elle proposera également des facteurs explicatifs du changement des inégalités pour chaque pays.
P52|Trade Credit, Bank Credit and Crisis: Some Empirical Evidence for India?|Employing data on an extended sample of manufacturing firms during 1993â€“2012, the article studies the inter-linkage between trade credit and bank credit and how it evolved during the crisis. Accordingly, we first discuss the relevance of a trade-credit channel in India and subsequently, explore the interplay between these two financing forms. The analysis provides some evidence in favour of a trade-credit channel in India. More importantly, the findings indicate that bank credit and trade credit are complementary, although there was a differential impact on accounts payable (demand) and accounts receivables (supply) during the crisis.

P52|Vet: A Strategic Approach For Economic, Organisational And Personal Development In Eu Countries|Vocational Education and Training (VET) is a continuous long-term process of economic, organisational and personal development. It envisions the construction of dynamic skills to improve performance, productivity and organisational, personal and social development. This article focuses on generating skills. It frames training as a process of work-linked training and as a primary source for generating skills whilst seeking to boost creativity. It sheds light upon the discussion pertaining to learning transfer as a necessary condition to structure performance and competitiveness. It highlights the Learning Transfer System Inventory (LTSI), because it allows to measure the effectiveness of training and it identifies the organisations' weaknesses. The data used were collected from the Eurostat Database.
P52|Designing the Structure in similar Cultures: A comparative study between Japan and Jordan|As considerable research has examined cultural influences on organizations exploring if cultural similarities between nations might lead businesses to matched structures arise an important issue. Hence, this study aims to examine the structure of Jordanian and Japanese companies on subjective cultural and the objective structural characteristics. The cultural characteristics of Jordan and Japan were established on their power distance and uncertainty avoidance orientations, and the structural characteristics were established on the locus of decision making and the degree of structuring of activities. The sample comprised of twelve companies each from Jordan and Japan matched in size, dependence and operation technology. Data of the Jordanian companies were collected through structured interviews and data of Japanese companies were derived from Azumi and McMillan?s study (1975) that used the same instrument of measurement. The analysis revealed that on the cultural dimensions a ?full bureaucracy? is a preferred structure in Jordan and Japan because it fits the desired ?pyramid form? in the minds of Jordanian and Japanese managers, but on the structural dimensions, results revealed that companies in Jordan and Japan are designed in a ?personnel bureaucracy? form of structure. The results have implications for further research in cross-cultural comparative management.
P52|An international comparison of productivity change in the textile and clothing industry: a bootstrapped Malmquist index approach|Firms in the textile and clothing industry operate in competitive international markets characterized by the liberalized trade after the removal of multi-fiber agreement quotas in 2005, and have to address rapid changes in consumer preferences and production technology. Hence, improving competitiveness is crucial for firm survival. Competitiveness of the sector often depends on its firms meeting their production potential. This paper analyzes productivity changes in the textile and clothing industry worldwide during the period 1995–2004. A bootstrapped Malmquist approach is used to identify the respective contributions of technical change, technical efficiency change, and scale efficiency change. Moreover, differences in productivity changes across different groups of firms are statistically assessed. Our results show a relatively small overall productivity increase for both textile and clothing firms due to positive technical change, despite declines in technical and scale efficiency. Furthermore, our results indicate that productivity and its components differ for textile firms and clothing firms, for firms in countries that benefited and did not benefit from the quotas’ elimination, and for firms in different regions.

P52|Firm boundaries in Transition countries. The influence of technological and institutional links|Using BEEPS cross-section data for one of the worldÃ•s largest developing economy, transition countries, this paper aims at identifying the impact of technology intensity and contracting institutions on firmsÃ• organizational forms, in particular vertical integration. Using the theoretical predictions about organizational choices drawn from the incomplete contracting models, we test the impacts of technological and institutional determinants. The results show that technological and institutional forces are oppositely directed. The improvement of contracting institutions weakens the propensity for vertical integration while the influence of technological complexity tends to increase it. Moreover, technological intensive countries and industries show the prevalence of vertically integrated organizational modes, a result enhanced by poorly functioning contracting institutions. Different impacts are also found for European and Non European transition countries. When these results are examined in light of the increasing exposure to trade, they show that this has reinforced rather that weakened the historical tendency towards vertical integration.
P52|Effective research and innovation (R&I) policy in the EU-28: A causal and configurational analysis of political governance determinants|Effective research and innovation (R&I) policy depends on the extent to which ideas, interests and institutional mechanisms for policy making work together rather than work against each other. In a political governance model for effective R&I policy in the EU-28, the separate influence of inter-ministerial coordination, regulatory impact assessment extended to sustainability checks, parliamentary committee surveillance, media attention and societal consultation is investigated. Interaction effects are investigated in a set-theoretic analysis for the econometrically best-fit model. Our results show that the societal consultation, policy-informed opposition and sector-informed informal policy coordination are necessary but not sufficient to bring about effectiveness to R&I policy. Their influence on effectiveness of R&I policy depends on the combination with either media attention or Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) extended to sustainability checks. We reached these results with the help of ordered logit estimations and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analyses using 2011-2013 (SGI) data of Bertelsmann Stiftung and Lexis Nexis Academic.
P52|Mixed Prospects: Consumption Leads Fragile Recovery in the CESEE Core – CIS Stumbles|Summary The economic outlook in the countries of Central East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) will improve in 2015–2017 with the forecast average economic growth rate close to 3% – some 1.5 pp. higher than the expected euro area average growth. Only the CIS countries and Ukraine will be an exception to this trend. Household consumption, aided by labour market improvements and low inflation, will be the main driver of growth. These are the main results of the newly released medium-term macroeconomic forecast by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw), revising slightly upwards the growth projections relative to the Spring 2015 forecast. Sub-regional growth trends vary greatly. At one end of the spectrum, the Central European countries are expected to continue their robust recovery with growth rates in the order of 2-4% per annum over the forecast horizon (2015–2017). At the other end, the prospects facing the CIS countries are particularly poor unless global commodity prices recover, both Russia and Belarus already tumbling into a deep recession (expected growth in 2015 -3.7% and -3.8%, respectively), while Kazakhstan is following suit with a deceleration in growth (1.5% in 2015). Whereas economic activity in the Baltic countries suffered this year on account of their exposure to Russia, they appear to be resilient and recovery is still on track with growth in the medium term expected to be in the range of 1.5-3%. Overall, Southeast Europe displays improving, but irregular growth tendencies, in many cases accompanied by macroeconomic imbalances and deep structural problems. Serbia and Croatia, the worst performers in the group, will enjoy hardly any growth at all in 2015 (0.1% and 0.7%, respectively), while growth in other countries will be in the order of 2-4%. The situation in Ukraine remains particularly fragile and serious downside risks persist, although there are signs that the recession, much deeper than originally anticipated (with output projected to drop by -11.5% this year), might be bottoming out. Net exports are providing only a limited, if at all positive, contribution to growth, while household consumption, supported by labour market improvements and low inflation due to weak commodity prices, is coming to the fore as the main engine of growth across most of the CESEE region; consumption is expected to remain among the key drivers in the medium term as well. At the same time, private investment remains the much-needed missing link in the mechanism essential to rekindling sustainable output growth in the CESEE region, and public investment may prove to be an important complementary factor. In this regard, the EU structural and investment funds under the 2014–2020 Multiannual Financial Framework will be instrumental as a source of co-funding. Inflation remains very weak across the CESEE region, hovering at near-zero levels on account of low commodity prices, with the exception of the CIS countries, Turkey and Ukraine, whose inflation spiked owing to exchange rate pass-through effects that followed sharp currency depreciations in 2014–2015, as well as country-specific factors, such as the food embargo in Russia and the rise in utility tariffs in Ukraine. The external environment is only moderately supportive. As the multi-speed recovery of the world economy continues in 2015, driven primarily by advanced economies and accompanied by poor performance in large emerging market economies, manifold external risks also arise that could jeopardise the recovery of the CESEE region, including geopolitical tensions associated with the situation in Ukraine and the Middle East, a slowdown in major emerging markets, normalisation of monetary policy in the USA and low commodity prices (a negative shock for the CIS group). Special sections of the forecast report focus on some of the potential risks that have attracted much attention since the beginning of the year, including the refugee crisis in Europe, recession and import-substitution policy in Russia, the Volkswagen scandal, the economic slowdown in China and the implications of the Greek crisis. With the exception of the CIS countries and Ukraine, however, the CESEE countries appear to be rather resilient to date.
P52|A Time of Moderate Expectations|Growth in the CESEE region will follow the unimpressive pattern displayed by the euro area. The longer-term convergence of income levels in the CESEE countries can no longer be expected to be as rapid as was assumed a decade or so ago. Growth in the period 2015-2017 is not going to deviate substantially from the pace recorded in 2014. For the new EU Member States growth is expected to remain slightly below 3% in the years to come. This implies an average growth differential of about 1.5 percentage points as compared to the euro area – about half of what it was before the global financial crisis. On the other hand, most of the countries in the region are also expected to evade the dangers of runaway inflation, fiscal deficits or excessive foreign borrowing that often plagued them in the past. These are the main results of the newly released medium-term growth forecast for the region by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw). Depressed aggregate domestic demand has been the major factor behind anaemic growth. This is evidenced by disinflation (or even mildly deflationary tendencies) across much of the region, as well as the persistence of fairly high unemployment. There is some evidence of a ‘race to the bottom’ in terms of wage setting. While wage moderation strengthens profitability and external competitiveness, it also weakens disposable household incomes and thus slows down growth in domestic demand. Apparently, there is a trade-off between improvements in the trade balance and more rapid growth in domestic demand. Overall, GDP growth is being held ‘on a short leash’. Growth in public investment may be supporting economic growth, especially in those new EU Member States (NMS) that have access to EU funds. However, a proper rebound in private-sector investment is still lacking. Weak private-sector investment cannot be attributed to a ‘profit squeeze’ in the corporate sector. On the contrary, the corporate sector has been doing very well, at least in those NMS for which relevant data are available. The corporate sector as a whole still tends to lend rather than borrow. The means available to the corporate sector appear to be plentiful at present – but the sector still prefers to lick its wounds inflicted by former excessive borrowing or extend loans (primarily to the public sector) rather than to invest productively. Loans are stagnant even in those instances where interest rates are relatively low. With a few exceptions (largely on the region’s periphery) the stocks of loans to the non-financial corporate sector increased marginally at best in 2014. This may reflect firms’ pessimistic assessment of future growth in demand, increased ‘liquidity preference’ or the relative abundance of the means at their disposal. Non-performing loans are linked to a high share of borrowing in foreign currencies. The recent strengthening of the Swiss franc will bear some negative consequences for those firms and households that borrowed heavily in that currency in the past. New evidence supports the claim that the countries with floating exchange rates fare better in the medium to long term. They tend to avoid irreversible currency overvaluation, whereas the countries with fixed exchange rates do not quite avert it. It is argued, however, that despite the rigidity of the exchange rates, overvaluation can be avoided – at least in the medium term. All the CESEE countries are running up fiscal deficits. Current account deficits are still depressed. Net national lending in the NMS tends to be positive. This is a consequence of current savings in the private sector in the NMS generally running ahead of gross fixed capital formation in that sector. On average, output growth across the NMS will become more uniform in 2015 – albeit not any faster. Average growth will remain at 2.7% in 2015. Some acceleration in marginal growth is to be expected in the biennium 2016-2017. Unemployment in the NMS will recede only gradually. Low inflation will prevail in 2015, but it will gradually return to more normal levels in 2016. Under sustained – albeit rather anaemic – growth, the current account balances will deteriorate (although they will still remain comparatively low). Growth is hardly accelerating in the (current and potential) EU candidate countries either. Output in those countries is not expected to grow faster than in the NMS. Turkey, Macedonia and Kosovo may fare slightly better than the rest of the group, with growth rates of above 3% in 2015. However, with the exception of Turkey, those countries seem to have put high inflation behind them. Nonetheless, their unemployment figures continue to be dismal (less so only in Turkey). They will also run high (or even very high) current account deficits. Most of the successor states to the Soviet Union will perform rather badly in 2015. Ukraine’s output will continue its free fall as many of the country’s industrial centres have become battlefields. A drop of 5% in economic growth is expected for 2015. The decline in world market prices for energy carriers will negatively affect both Kazakhstan and Russia, with real output in the latter country dropping sharply by almost 4% in 2015. A similar fate will befall Belarus a country that relies heavily on exports to Russia and Ukraine. However, assuming a peaceful resolution to the Ukrainian conflict in 2015, it is expected that all the successor states will resume moderate growth in 2016 or 2017.
P52|Aufwind im Westen Mittel-, Ost- und Südosteuropas: Wichtige Wachstumsimpulse für Österreich|Zusammenfassung Aufwind im Westen der MOSOEL In den mittel-, ost- und südosteuropäischen Ländern (MOSOEL) klafft der Ausblick für das Wirtschaftswachstum auch weiterhin auseinander für die meisten der neuen EU-Mitgliedstaaten (NMS) wird eine langsame Beschleunigung des BIP-Wachstums beginnend mit diesem Jahr erwartet. Für 2015 soll das Wachstum durchschnittlich auf 3% ansteigen, um 0,2 Prozentpunkte mehr als im Vorjahr. Die Erholung erfolgt um ein Jahr früher als erwartet. Wesentlicher Faktor ist die bessere Entwicklung in der Eurozone. Auch am Westbalkan wird eine (wenn auch weniger dynamische) Verbesserung der Wachstumsaussichten für die gesamte Prognoseperiode 2015-2017 erwartet. Die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung 2015 in Weißrussland, Kasachstan, Russland und der Ukraine wird düster ausfallen und zum Teil noch schlechter sein als bisher erwartet. Für diese Länder sind die mittelfristigen Wirtschaftsaussichten auch mit substantiellen Risiken behaftet. Insgesamt sollte aber das verstärkte Wachstum in den MOSOEL für die österreichische Wirtschaft als Nachfrageimpuls dienen. Insbesondere die NMS sind für Österreich von zunehmender Bedeutung. English Summary Western CESEE countries in the ascendant The outlook for GDP growth in the Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) region remains divergent we expect a gradual acceleration of GDP growth for most of the EU’s new Member States (NMS) starting this year. For 2015 growth is expected to increase to 3% on average, by 0.2 pp more as compared to last year. The recovery comes a year earlier than expected mainly based on favourable developments in the euro area. In the Western Balkans growth prospects will also improve over the whole forecast period 2015-2017, though slightly less dynamically. Growth performance in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine in 2015, however, will be dismal and partly worse than expected; the medium-term outlook for these countries is also fairly uncertain with considerable downside risks. Overall though, we should expect stronger CESEE growth to act as a demand stimulus for the Austrian economy. The NMS in particular are of increasing importance for Austria.
P52|China and Russia: Institutional Coherence between the Banking Systems|We use statistical data from 2000 to 2013 to compare the macro-level structure and the core institutions of the banking systems in China and Russia. Our main hypothesis is that, differences in the absolute size and socio-cultural features notwithstanding, these two systems are typologically similar. We consider the institutional structure, the market structure and concentration, the industrial policy of the government, and the banksâ€™ involvement in the financing of the non-financial economy. We find both similarities and differences, however in dynamics the trend towards convergence prevails. In both countries, we see a hierarchical multi-tier banking system headed by a few core state-controlled banks. These combine commercial activities with the activity of a development institution. Regardless of the nominal form of bank ownership, the government exerts influence on the lending decisions and market behavior of banks. We argue that the case of banking in China and Russia provides empirical proof to the macrosociological theory of institutional matrices. We refer in particular to the needed proportion between the dominant and complementary institutions. Whereas China has been carefully seeking a sustainable balance, Russia in the 1990s grossly overshot with liberalization and now reverts to the underlying long-term trend. China has currently become Russia's donor for institutional innovations in the credit system design.
P52|Modele funkcjonowania i nadzoru państwa nad przedsiębiorstwami państwowymi|Przedsiębiorstwa państwowe są i prawdopodobnie nadal pozostaną istotnym elementem współczesnych systemów gospodarczych, szczególnie w krajach postsocjalistycznych oraz rozwijających się. Analiza istniejących w różnych krajach zasad funkcjonowania sektora przedsiębiorstw państwowych, jak i zasad realizowania przez państwo funkcji właścicielskiej, wskazuje na ich wielkie zróżnicowanie. Celem artykułu jest próba modelowego ujęcia tego zróżnicowania. Analizy modelowej dokonano z jednej strony według kryteriów genezy (źródła, pochodzenia) przedsiębiorstw państwowych oraz zadań formułowanych wobec nich przez państwowego właściciela, z reguły związanych z pełnionymi przez nie funkcjami pozaekonomicznymi. Z tej perspektywy wyróżniono sześć modeli własności państwowej w współczesnej gospodarce: model anglosaski, europejski (kontynentalny), postsocjalistyczny, chiński, rosyjski oraz model gospodarek wschodzących. Z drugiej strony analiza została przeprowadzona według kryterium zasad i narzędzi realizowania przez państwo funkcji właścicielskich. W tym ujęciu opisano model zdecentralizowany, dualny oraz scentralizowany nadzoru właścicielskiego. Dodatkowo rozważono podział modeli nadzoru według wielkości udziałów państwa we własności przedsiębiorstw, a także sposoby sprawowania przez państwo faktycznej kontroli korporacyjnej przy posiadaniu udziałów mniejszościowych. W końcowej części artykułu zostały sformułowane wnioski i rekomendacje odnoszące się do gospodarki polskiej. Dotyczą one określenia pożądanego kształtu (zakresu, wielkości) domeny państwowej w gospodarce, a także opracowania właściwego, skutecznego systemu nadzoru właścicielskiego państwa, który – naszym zdaniem – powinien opierać się na najlepszych doświadczeniach światowych.

P52|Explaining money demand in China during the transition from a centrally planned to a market-based monetary system| Fundamental changes in institutions during the transition from a centrally planned to a market economy present a formidable challenge to monetary policy decision makers. For the case of China, we examine the institutional changes in the monetary system during the process of transition and develop money demand functions that reflect these institutional changes. We consider seasonal unit roots and estimate long-run, equilibrium money demand functions, explicitly taking into consideration the changes in the institutional characteristics of China's financial system. Using a newly compiled dataset that covers an unprecedentedly long period, 1984-2010, with quarterly frequency, we are able to draw conclusions on the transitions in households', firms' and aggregate money demand, on the role of the credit plan and interest rates, on the mechanisms of macroeconomic control during economic transition, and on theoretical questions in the development and money literature.
P52|Pareto efficiency in the jungle|Abstract We revisit the jungle economy of Piccione and Rubinstein (Econ J 117(July):883–896, 2007) in which the allocation of resources is driven by coercion. In this economy the unique equilibrium satisfies lexicographic maximization. We show that relaxing the assumptions on consumption sets and preferences slightly, allocations other than lexicographic maximizers can be jungle equilibria. We attribute this result to single unilateral taking where a stronger agent takes goods from only one weaker agent. Once multiple unilateral takings are introduced, we show that jungle equilibria coincide with lexicographic maximization under weak assumptions. However, we also present examples of equilibria that are Pareto inefficient, where voluntary gift giving by stronger agents is needed to achieve Pareto efficiency and even voluntary trade has a role in the jungle.
P52|The More Divergent, the Better? Lessons on Trilemma Policies and Crises for Asia|This paper investigates the potential impacts of the degree of divergence in open macroeconomic policies in the context of the trilemma hypothesis. Using an index that measures the extent of policy divergence among the three trilemma policy choices—monetary independence, exchange rate stability, and financial openness—we find that emerging market economies have adopted trilemma policy combinations with the smallest degree of policy divergence in the last 15 years. We then investigate whether and to what extent the degree of open macro policy convergence affects the probability of a crisis and find that a developing or emerging market economy with a higher degree of policy divergence is more likely to experience a currency or debt crisis. We also compare the development of trilemma policies around the crisis period for the groups of Latin American crisis countries in the 1980s and the Asian crisis countries in the 1990s. We find that Latin American crisis countries tended to close their capital accounts in the aftermath of a crisis, while that is not the case for the Asian crisis countries. The Asian crisis countries tended to reduce the degree of policy divergence in the aftermath of the crisis, which possibly meant they decided to adopt open macro policies that made their economies less prone to a crisis. © 2013 Asian Development Bank and Asian Development Bank Institute.
P52|Lessons for China from Financial Liberalization in Scandinavia| This report identifies a set of policy lessons for China today drawn from the experience of financial deregulation, financial crisis, and recovery in Scandinavia during the period 1985–2000. Although there are considerable differences between the huge Chinese economy and the small Nordic countries, there are enough similarities to make lesson-drawing a worthwhile exercise. Based on the Scandinavian experience and the added complexity of China's status as a transition economy, financial reforms should strike a proper balance between being gradual (to avoid costly mistakes) and substantive (to secure efficiency gains in the longer term) with due consideration being given to initial conditions concerning regulation, taxes, and exchange rate arrangements. A well-managed process of financial deregulation requires that policymakers and market participants fully understand the linkages between financial reforms and the rest of the economy. In addition, the supervisory and management systems in the financial sector should move in step with the liberalization process. © 2014 The Earth Institute at Columbia University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
P52|Implementing a Voluntary Wage Policy: Lessons from the Irish and Spanish Wages Policies before the Crisis|Despite the relevance given by the Post-Keynesian thought to wage and incomes policies, little attention has been paid to the institutional elements that would favour the unionsâ€™ acceptance of a voluntary moderation of wage claims. Recent wage policies have been implemented in European countries, like Ireland and Spain, which do not fulfil the requirements assumed by corporatist analysis for a successful implementation of wage policies. The success of wage policies in Ireland and Spain, in terms of economic performance and the length of current wage policies, offers a valuable insight on how wages policies can be implemented as a key piece of macroeconomic policy: It also helps our understanding of the institutional framework that favours the implementation of voluntary wages policies.
P52|Measuring the Causal Effect of Privatization on Firm Performance|Despite an apparent consensus in the literature that privatization leads to increased productivity and profitability of firms, the problem of endogeneity bias is profound and has been emphasized in a number of meta-analyses. We propose a new method to address the endogeneity bias and apply it to a universe of Polish medium and large firms over 1995-2009. Unlike some previous studies we find that improvement in firm performance is a rare phenomenon, which suggests that the endogeneity bias could have been indeed large.
P52|Can We Really Explain Worker Flows in Transition Economies?|This paper employs a new rich source of data on worker reallocation in transition economies and provides a decomposition of the aggregate changes into those attributable to sectoral reallocation, those attributable to transition per se and those attributable to demographics. Aghion and Blanchard (1994) provide a theoretical framework that allows to conceptualize a reallocation from an (implicitly inefficient) public sector to a (more efficient) private sector, which is extremely useful in the analyses of economic transition. However, transition processes are not isolated from global trends such as a shift from industry to services, which is more explicitly tackled in the sectoral reallocation models of Caballero and Hammour (1996, 2001). Finally, there are also demographic processes, which exhibit in labor market exits by people with outdated or no longer necessary skills and in labor market entries by people with possibly better matched competences. The aggregate changes in transition economies are a combination of these three mechanisms. We thus test the validity of Aghion and Blanchard (1994) as well as Caballero and Hammour (1996, 2001) in the context of 26 transition economies over the period 1989-2006. We find that demographics and education can accommodate a fair share of shift from public to private and from manufacturing to services - as opposed to the actual worker flows between jobs. Whether or not this results in reduced employment at the end of the transition process stems not from the wage setting mechanism (such as collective bargaining, indexation, etc.) but rather seems to be related to the policies able to keep older cohorts in employment.
P52|On Thin Ice: CESEE Core Resilient in the Face of EU Stagnation and the Ukraine Crisis|Summary Despite near stagnation in the euro area and the negative impact of the Ukraine crisis, in most of the NMS economies and some of the Western Balkan countries growth prospects are viewed as positive. While the NMS economies will preserve their positive growth differential vis-à-vis the EU-28, Russia and Ukraine are facing a deterioration of their economic performance. External factors have had a major impact on growth performance in the CESEE region. Financial transfers from the EU have lent essential support to economic growth in the European Union’s new Member States (NMS). Investment and operational costs funded via those transfers have become an integral and increasingly important part of aggregate demand in the NMS economies. 2013 and 2014 have been among the strongest years in terms of transfers in the framework of the EU cohesion policy. Their impact is comparable to that of fiscal stimuli, albeit better inasmuch as they do not give rise to new debt. A possible disadvantage compared to classic fiscal stimuli is that transfers have no steerable relation to business cycles. In the eastern part of the CESEE region, the Ukraine conflict has had a pronounced negative impact on economic growth. 25 years after the fall of the Iron Curtain, the current crisis in relations between Russia and the West is evolving into a dangerous geopolitical conflict. In Ukraine, the main victim of the conflict, the economy may decline by 8% over the current year. In Russia, the costs of the conflict are estimated to be to the tune of about 1% of GDP, primarily on account of increased investment risks and the financial sanctions. The impact on the individual EU countries differs according to their exposure to the Russian market. The Baltic States and some other NMS will be those most affected on account of their trade channels with estimated losses in the order of up to 0.4% of GDP. The global financial crisis has shattered the rapid expansion of financial intermediation in nearly all of the countries in the region; recovery of crediting activities is still fragmentary and weak. High levels of non-performing loans are a major concern throughout much of the region. There seems to be a justified concern over the region having entered a period of ‘creditless recovery’ which threatens to be much slower than a recovery with strong credit growth. The outlook for GDP growth in the CESEE region is again fairly diversified. Compared to 2013, the growth performance is expected to improve in twelve and deteriorate in nine of the twenty-one countries in the region in 2014. The general medium-term trend for the NMS as a whole is seen to be positive in most of these countries, we expect a gradual acceleration of GDP growth; exceptions are Hungary and Slovenia where a deceleration is forecast, and Poland where the relatively high GDP growth rate will remain practically unchanged. For the current year, the assumption is that the NMS will grow by 1.8 percentage points higher than expansion in the euro area and 1.3 pp above the EU-28 average. In 2015, the gap in favour of NMS growth performance will become somewhat narrower 1.5 pp relative to the euro area and 1.1 pp to the EU-28 average. For some of the countries in the Western Balkans, growth prospects will only improve over the period 2015-2016, closely related to the damage caused by the floods this summer. Turkey will continue to register remarkable economic growth. Growth performance in Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine will worsen in the current year compared to 2013; the medium-term outlook in Russia and Ukraine is, depending on the evolution of the political crisis, fairly uncertain with considerable downward risks. As for our forecasts for 2015 and 2016, a further weakening of performance in the euro area poses a downward risk, while a longer lasting drop in oil prices will represent an upward risk, except for energy exporters Russia and Kazakhstan.
P52|Investment to the Rescue|The Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw) expects GDP in Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) to pick up speed and grow on average by 2-3% over the forecast period 2014-2016 a major driving force rooted in an upward reversal of public and private investment. The question remains, however, whether investment-led growth in the CESEE countries is merely a statistical base effect of a few replacement investments or an indication of a profound paradigmatic shift. Increasing evidence suggests the latter for a number of reasons. During the ongoing economic crisis, public investment was severely reduced. However, in times of extreme uncertainty, the private sector is hesitant to invest. Hence, the public sector has to take the lead. It seems that the time for action has now come. This holds especially true for the New Member States, where towards the end of the previous year additional efforts were made to raise the absorption rate of the funds allocated within the context of the EU multiannual financial framework for 2007-2013 that was about to come to a close. Over the remaining disbursement period of the biennium 2014-2015 substantially higher amounts of EU-funded investment are to be expected. Given that, in practically all cases, national co-financing is also required, CESEE public capital investment will increase, with private investors likely following in its slipstream. Apart from a number of transport infrastructure projects, a host of thermal power plant projects are in the pipeline, as are several major investments in the construction and expansion of nuclear power plants across the region. Apart from public and semi-public infrastructure investment initiatives that have the potential to spur subsequent private investment, improving growth prospects in the euro area, the CESEE economies’ main trading partner, are likely to encourage export industries in the region to modernise and increase their capital stock. This should help avert a lapse into a deflationary spiral and foster a shift towards better equilibrium with lower unemployment rates over the medium term. However, substantial downward risks include possible effects from the current Russia-Ukraine conflict; in particular the interruption of energy supplies, potential trade embargoes or additional interest rate risk premia. All this could adversely affect investment-led growth in CESEE.

P52|The Effect Of The Chinese International Trade On The Brazilian Trade Balance|According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, 2012), after China officially joined the World Trade Organization, at the end of 2001, its share on world's exports increased from 4.34%, in 2001, to 10.50%, in 2011. At the same period, China's share on world's imports increased almost 150% - from 3.84% to 9.53%. The increase in international trade happened at the same time China's industrial sector changed the composition of its Gross Value of Production (GVP) towards products that use more scale and differentiated technologies, while natural resources and labor intensive products lost their share in total GVP (Diegues; Angeli, 2011). Most of researches in the field agree that China's economic growth is related somehow to its fast industrialization process on the last two decades, as a consequence of the transition process towards a more market oriented economy. In addition to that, it is also agreed that the exchange rate depreciation has played a major whole while setting up China as one of the most important players in the international market. Trade relations between Brazil and China have intensified in recent decades while caused changes in the list of imported and exported products of the country. In this context, the present study aimed to analyze the evolution of imports and exports of Brazil ? China between 2000 and 2011. Two different forms of sectorial analysis were analyzed which allowed the identification of the most significant exported sectors. The sectorial analysis was performed following two criteria: (i) technological intensity and (ii) types of technology. The study used import and export data between Brazil and China provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade. It was found that the trade between Brazil and China has become more intense in the most recent years mainly because the Brazilian exports have been more focused on commodities and natural resource-based products. Chinese exports to Brazil, on the other hand, are more concentrated in products of high and medium-high-technology, based mainly on differentiated technology and scale, but with a wider range of products compared to the Brazilian exports. We conclude that a regressive specialization of Brazilian exports to China has been happening probably as a result of both the direct and indirect trade effects between the countries.

P52|Cross-border labour mobility: are East-West and East-East cross-border labour flows differ?|The aim of this paper is to outline differences in the socio-demographic and employment characteristics of Estonian people who have worked in a neighbouring country ? Finland, Sweden, Latvia or Russia. The empirical part of this paper relies on data from CV Keskus ? an online employment portal bringing together jobseekers and vacant job posts. The results of our analysis show that different destination regions ? the wealthier countries of Finland and Sweden (referred to as East-West mobility) and Latvia and Russia (referred to as East-East mobility) have attracted workers with different personal and job-related characteristics. Ethnicity and higher education are important determinants in explaining differences between East-West and East-East labour flows. Non-Estonians and people with a higher education have been less likely to work in Finland or Sweden (East-West mobility).
P52|Determinants of Bank Profitability in Turkey: An Empirical Analysis on Types of Banking from 2002 to 2012|In this study, we investigate the determinants of banking profitability related to their financial statements. A profitable banking sector is better able effect to stability of the financial system. The profitability of a financial institution is affected by a lot of factors. These factors include elements internal to each financial institution and several important external forces shaping earnings performance. In this study we analyses effects from financial statements to their profitability of each types of banks. With this current emphasis on financial statements are very important to both managing future and making new decision to guide. In Turkey, during from 2002 to 2012 period, bankâ€™s profitability approaches has been changed to new phenomenon. Because of regulative decisions and competitive market has to change profitability of banking sectors. It is therefore important to understand the determinants of banking sector profitability in Turkey between all types of banks. This is essentially important in the light of the above notable changes that have occurred in the operating environment of banks in Turkey. An overview of previous studies indicates various ways that profitability was examined. Some studies were country specific and few of them considered panel of countries reviewing the determinants of profitability. In this study we examines types of banks as follows: 3 banks in state-owned banks, 12 banks in Private banks, 6 banks in foreign banks which has a branches in Turkey. In total 21 banks and 3 types analyses with cross-sectional panel data method during the from 2002 to 2012 period. In this study, we obtained data from Income Statements and Balance Sheets. As a result of panel data regression are statistically significant which Interest Income / Total Income and Consumer Loan / Total Loan are highly important to estimate ROE than estimating ROA.

P52|Modernising Russia's cattle and dairy sectors under WTO conditions: Insights from East Germany| How to revitalise the cattle and dairy sectors under the WTO commitments has emerged as a major policy challenge for the Russian government. This article raises the question whether livestock recovery in East Germany does provide any insights that could be of value to current policy makers in Russia. Similar to Russia, livestock numbers plummeted in the first years after the end of central planning. Unlike in Russia, milk output per cow increased spectacularly and almost doubled in a period of 20 years. It is argued that reforms of the institutional environment of agriculture were at least as important for this outcome as the generous availability of funding. Incentives set by financial aid were sometimes unintended, inconsistent, and led to misallocations that were costly to correct later on. More recent capital subsidies were inefficient in reaching any of the manifold goals they were hoped to achieve. While the Russian government may face little difficulty in dressing up its investment subsidies to make them look like green box compatible, the structural elements of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy are regarded as a poor guide for policy reform.
P52|Pyramidal Management of Risk Control- Case Study in Agro-food Enterprises in Iasi County, Romania| In agro-food enterprises from Romania, management of risk control is seen as a dynamic process that, in order to work involves a cycle that incorporates risk identification, assessment, administering and verification. Risk management is closely related to the performance management, so that it has been set establishing key indicators of the performance. The pyramid of risk management provides to the managers a model of effective approach of risk and the ability to manage them, thus increasing consolidation capacity of added value. Risk management is necessary because all agro-food enterprises face uncertainty and the management team must determine the acceptable level of risk The paper presents a case study on the pyramidal management of risk control for two major agro-food enterprises from Iasi County. The authors have established as main goals in this paper identifying the objectives of the audit, assessment and measuring risk according to the probability of impact occurrence and the period of events consequences, prioritizing risks, risks analyzing and reporting.

P52|Theories About the Commencement of Agriculture in Prehistoric Societies: A Critical Evaluation|The commencement of agriculture in the Holocene era is usually seen as heralding the beginning of a chain of events that eventually resulted in the Industrial Revolution and in modern economic development. The purpose of this paper is to outline and critically review theories about why and how agriculture first began. It also classifies these theories according to whether they are based on agriculture's development as a response to food deprivation, to a food surplus, or neither of these factors. Because agriculture began independently in several different geographical centres, it seems unlikely that the switch of early societies from hunting and gathering to agriculture was the result of the same cause in all of these locations. Moreover, the paper provides some new suggestions as to why hunters and gatherers were motivated to commence or increase their dependence on agriculture in some locations. Views about the role of natural resources and institutions in the development of agriculture are also discussed.
P52|Post-Socialist transition in a 25-year perspective|A recent international conference, entitled Transition in Perspective offered an opportunity for the author to take stock of the achievements of the post-socialist economies since the regime change in 1989/90. The analysis was carried out in two dimensions, in the political and the economic one. Regarding the first one, the record is largely positive: many countries have regained their independence, although in some cases the price was high and the fundamentals of democracy are still missing. In civil wars and inter-ethnic fights far too many people were killed and/or displaced. Since about 2000, many countries fell in the hand of autocratic leaders. In terms of catching-up with the income levels of the advanced economies, less than half of the countries were truly successful. The people have good reasons to be disappointed.
P52|Stabilizing Southeastern Europe, Financial Legacies And European Lessons From The First World War|This paper pays brief attention,although more than the recent flood of 1914 centenary books, to economic causes of the First World War before turning to it fateful economic consequences for Southeastern Europe. The Austrian lack of economic leverage over Serbia is cited as a reason for its resort to the military option. At the war’s end, the option of the victorious powers to provide significant economic relief to the region where the conflict had begun was not taken. After tracking the brief, limited assistance provided, the paper reviews to the massive economic problems confronting four of the five of independent states, neglecting Albania as a special case, that could now be called Southeastern Europe. First Greece and then Bulgaria faced forced inflow of refugees. Romania and the Yugoslav Kingdom faced the economic integration of large new, formerly Austro-Hungarian lands. All of them were left not only with war deaths and destruction but also with large war debts, or in Bulgaria’s case, reparations. The paper concentrates on the primary Western response to these four economies, an effort led by the Bank of England to replace immediate postwar inflation with the deflation needed to reestablish currencies with prewar convertibility to gold, now with Pound Sterling added to a gold reserve standard. Independent central banks, the major positive legacy of this initiative, were to lead the way. But the financial stability that all four economies did eventually achieve in the 1920s served only to reduce their war debts. Otherwise, maintaining the fixed and overvalued exchange rates restricted domestic credit, encouraged protective tariffs, and did not attract the foreign capital, especially new state loans, that this emphasis on a single, European financial framework had promised. A concluding section considers the lessons learned from a postwar period that promoted economic disintegration by the 1930s. Looking at the period since the end of the Cold War and then the wars of Yugoslavia’s dissolution, we see EU leadership in the reduction of trade barriers, the promotion of common fiscal practice and the prospect of genuine European integration as Western lessons learned. Within the region, independent central banks have helped the process. But the stabilization of currencies around the overvalued Euro has posed a familiar post- 1918 problem since the European downturn of 2008.
P52|Book Translations As Idea Flows: The Effects Of The Collapse Of Communism On The Diffusion Of Knowledge| We use book translations as a new measure of international idea flows and study the effects of Communism's collapse in Eastern Europe on these flows. Using novel data on 800,000 translations and difference-in-differences approaches, we show that while translations between Communist languages decreased by two thirds with the collapse, Western-to-Communist translations increased by a factor of 4 and quickly converged to Western levels. Convergence was more pronounced in the fields of applied and social sciences, and was more complete in Satellite and Baltic than in Soviet countries. We discuss how these patterns help us understand how repressive institutions and preferences towards Western European ideas shaped the international diffusion of knowledge.
P52|African Development: Beyond Income Convergence| In examining some big questions on African development, I provide evidence that the dynamics of some development indicators could support both endogenous and neoclassical growth theories in the convergence debate. This paper investigates convergence in real per capita gross domestic product and inequality-adjusted human development in 38 African countries, disaggregated into 10 homogenous panels based on regions (Sub-Saharan and North Africa), income levels (low, middle, lower middle and upper middle), legal origins (English common law and French civil law) and religious dominations (Christianity and Islam). The main finding is that the income component of the Human Development Index moves slower than others in the convergence process, and thus requires a more focused policy intervention. As a policy implication, looking beyond income convergence can provide a concrete agenda for development involving all aspects of economic, institutional and social life.
P52|Comparative Analysis On Competitiveness: Romania Vs. Bulgaria|The research developed in the present work is mainly aimed on comparative analysis of competitiveness in Romania and Bulgaria. We want to draw a warning, because the situation is even more worrying because, according to the latest official reports on global and regional competitiveness, Romania was exceeded by Bulgaria, which will have a negative impact on Romania's development in the medium and long term, unless urgent action is taken to redress situation. Although entry into the EU, competitiveness has become a national priority for both Romania and Bulgaria, this being transposed in national development programs and operational programs of the EU's competitiveness, the figures show that Romania had a very low absorption of European funds during 2007- 2013, two times less than Bulgaria absorbed. Target, set by the EU Strategy, is that by 2020, investment in research, development, innovation, made both government and the private sector, representing 2% or 1.5 % of GDP for Romania and Bulgaria. In these circumstances, Romania must develop macroeconomic policies to stimulate economic competitiveness, develop all regions, to attract foreign direct investment, external grants. Bulgaria has to face two major challenges: to accelerate the grow rate and to make it sustainable. Bulgaria has to ensure conditions for innovations and realization of human capital, including the development of the regions.
P52|How does external debt impact democratization? Evidence from developing countries|In this paper we empirically discuss whether or not external debt affects country’s governance. Indeed, indebted countries need some political governance reforms in order to send out a positive signal to international financial community and investors; and so improving business climate. However, external debt reduces their flexibility and ability to address associated costs to political governance. Our study focuses on the period 1985-2011 and spans 103 developing countries. To deal with endogeneity issue, we first lag external debt by one year and second propose two-step tobit estimator by instrumenting external debt-to-GDP ratio with real effective exchange rate. Even controlling for various conventional determinants of democratic transitions, we find that external debt constraints indebted countries to move up democracy scale but incite governments to improve investment profile and therefore improving business climate. Furthermore, Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs dampen the negative effect of debt on democratic transitions.

Jürgen Jerger, Universität Regensburg und Institut für Ost- und Südosteuropaforschung, Regensburg, zeigt, dass die Politik eines Landes für den wirtschaftlichen Aufstieg oder Niedergang die Weichen stellen kann und dass der Aufstieg eines Landes nicht mit dem Niedergang eines anderen Landes einhergehen muss.
P52|The Soundness Of The Financialsystems In Cee Countries|The financial system is vitally important for the real economy, contributing decisively to economic activities. The paper aims to examine the features of the financial system of Central and Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania), the major imbalances accumulated during the period preceding the onset of the current global economic crisis and the measures taken by monetary and financial authorities to ensure the continuity of European financial integration. Moreover, in this paper an empirical analysis was developed, investigating the major implications of the crisis on the financial soundness indicators perceived in the selected countries, in the period 2008-2013. The analysis conducted in this paper suggests that the financial system is characterized by a high sensitivity, being subjected to pressures from the international financial turmoil, observing the increasing tendency of current risks.

The aim of the paper is to outline differences in the socio-demographic and employment characteristics of Estonian people who have worked in a neighbouring country â€“ Finland and Sweden (East-West mobility) and Latvia or Russia (East-East mobility). The results of the study show that the possible consequences of cross-border labour mobility are twofold. Cross-border labour mobility can support economic development of both source and target country but also generate some threats of brain waste taking into account the sharp increase of lower-skilled jobs of people who are working in economically well-developed neighbouring countries.
P52|Borders That Divide: Education and Religion in Ghana and Togo Since Colonial Times|When European powers partitioned Africa, individuals of otherwise homogeneous communities were divided and found themselves randomly assigned to one coloniser. This provides for a natural experiment: applying a border discontinuity analysis to Ghana and Togo, we test what impact coloniser’s policies really made. Using a new data set of men recruited to the Ghana colonial army 1908-1955, we find literacy and religious beliefs to diverge between British and French mandated part of Togoland as early as in the 1920s. We attribute this to the different policies towards missionary schools. The British administration pursued a ”grant-in-aid” policy of missionary schools, whereas the French restricted missionary activities. The divergence is only visible in the Southern part. In the North, as well as at the border between Ghana and Burkina Faso (former French Upper Volta), educational and evangelization efforts were weak on both sides and hence, did not produce any marked differences. Using contemporary survey data we find that border effects originated at colonial times still persist today.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P52|Measuring institutional quality in ancient Athens|We use the Economic Freedom Index (Gwartney, Lawson and Norton 2008) to characterise the institutions of ancient Athens in the fourth century BCE. It has been shown that ancient Greece witness improved living conditions for an extended period of time. Athens in the classical period appears to fare particularly well. We find that economic freedom in ancient Athens is on level with the highest ranked modern economies such as contemporary Hong Kong and Singapore. With the exception of the position of women and slaves, Athens scores high in almost every dimension of economic freedom. Trade was highly important even by current standards. As studies of contemporary societies show institutional quality to be an important determinant of economic growth, this may be one factor in the relative material success of the Athenians.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P52|Are Americans and Indians more altruistic than the Japanese and Chinese? Evidence from a new international survey of bequest plans|This paper discusses three alternative assumptions concerning household preferences (altruism, self-interest, and a desire for dynasty building) and shows that these assumptions have very different implications for bequest motives and bequest division. After reviewing some of the literature on actual bequests, bequest motives, and bequest division, the paper presents data on the strength of bequest motives, stated bequest motives, and bequest division plans from a new international survey conducted in China, India, Japan, and the United States. It finds striking inter-country differences in bequest plans, with the bequest plans of Americans and Indians appearing to be much more consistent with altruistic preferences than those of the Japanese and Chinese and the bequest plans of the Japanese and Chinese appearing to be much more consistent with selfish preferences than those of Americans and Indians. These findings have important implications for the efficacy and desirability of stimulative fiscal policies, public pensions, and inheritance taxes.

P52|Bank valuation in new EU member countries|This paper studies the role of institutional reforms in affecting bank valuation in new European Union (EU) member countries. It takes advantage of the dynamic nature of institutional reforms in transition economies and explores the causal effects of those reforms on banks’ Tobin's Q over the period of 1997–2008. Using a difference-in-difference approach, the paper shows that Tobin's Q increases substantially after these countries reform their legal institutions and liberalize banking. However, it decreases after stock market reforms. After further examination of the interactive relationships between different reforms and bank valuation, it is observed that when the banking reform is well implemented, legal reform can have a stronger impact on banks’ Tobin's Q. On the other hand, banking reform and security market reform has a substitutive relationship. The analysis also suggests that foreign ownership, market power, and asset diversification significantly affect Tobin's Q. These results are robust even after simultaneously controlling for equity risk.
P52|Institutional development and bank stability: Evidence from transition countries|This paper takes advantage of the dynamic nature of institutional reforms in transition economies and explores the causal effects of those reforms on bank risk. Using a difference-in-difference approach, we show that banks’ financial stability increases substantially after these countries reform their legal institutions, liberalize banking, and restructure corporate governance. We also find that the effects of legal and governance reforms on bank risk may critically depend on the progress of banking reforms. A further examination of alternative risk measures reveals that the increases in financial stability among banks mainly come from the reduction of asset risk. Banks tend to have lower ROA volatility and fewer nonperforming loans after reforming the institutional environment. Finally, we split our sample into foreign and domestic banks and find that the enhancement of financial stability is more pronounced for domestic banks.
P52|Monetary and fiscal policy interactions: Evidence from emerging European economies|This paper examines the interactions between fiscal and monetary policy for some former transition, emerging European economies over the 1995Q1–2010Q4 period by using a Markov regime-switching model. We consider the monetary policy rule proposed by Taylor (1993) and the fiscal policy rule suggested by Davig and Leeper (2007) in accounting for monetary and fiscal policy interactions. Empirical results suggest that monetary and fiscal policy rules exhibit switching properties between active and passive regimes and all countries followed both active and passive monetary policies. As for fiscal policy, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, and Slovenia seem to have alternated between active and passive fiscal regimes while fiscal policies of Poland and the Slovak Republic can be characterized by a single fiscal regime. Although the policy mix and the interactions between monetary and fiscal policy point a diverse picture in our sample countries, the monetary policy seems to be passive in all countries after 2000. This finding is consistent with the constraints imposed by European Union enlargement on monetary policy.
P52|Colonial Origins of the Informal Economy on the Gazelle Peninsula|This paper is concerned with the accommodation to the market economy of Tolai people, indigenous to the Gazelle Peninsula in Papua New Guinea and regarded as one of the most prosperous and enterprising groups in the country. 'The market' was introduced to Tolai by German (and later, Australian) colonists from the late nineteenth century. Without pretension to novelty in the historical narrative it asserts the value of viewing these events through the lens of 'informal economy', as constructed by Keith Hart. The paper is a companion piece to another study, concerned with the economic history of Chinese immigrants to Rabaul (Conroy, forthcoming). Starting from the proposition that (unlike the Chinese) the Tolai had no tradition of 'trade as a self-sufficient profession', it considers how they adapted their livelihoods to the colonial economy. In German New Guinea, market economic activity was supposed to be conducted in conformity with the norms of a particular model of Weberian 'rational-legal' bureaucracy, introduced by the Reich. In turn, German bureaucratic norms were guided by an ideology of 'national-economic purpose', enunciated for the Wilhelmine state and its colonies. The paper argues that subsequent Australian administrators adopted the German bureaucratic framework, while employing it initially for somewhat different ends and eventually (after World War II) adapting it to the needs of a new ideology of 'economic development'. Across this long period Tolai engagement in the market economy proved to be 'informal', in the sense that it did not conform fully with prescribed bureaucratic norms. It displayed the hybridity found wherever Smithian trade (seen as activated by a natural human tendency to 'truck and barter') is confronted by Maussian exchange (seen as the product of socially regulated customs). The paper considers how tensions between German/Australian expectations of Tolai economic behaviour and the reality of that behaviour played out over the colonial period to 1975. At the end of that time, trade as 'a self-sufficient profession' appeared to be confined to some instances of petty specialized trade amid signs of more general emerging change in trading culture.
