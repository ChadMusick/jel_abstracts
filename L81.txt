L81|Explaining the Interplay Between Merchant Acceptance and Consumer Adoption in Two-Sided Markets for Payment Methods|Recent consumer and merchant surveys show a decrease in the use of cash at point-of-sale (POS). Increasingly, consumers and merchants have access to a growing array of payment innovations as substitutes for cash. The market for payments is two-sided, meaning that a method of payment can be used only if both consumers and merchants adopt/accept it. This paper develops a model to assess how innovations affect consumers’ adoption and merchants’ acceptance of various payment instruments, and their usage patterns at the POS. We model this interdependence in two stages. First, consumers and merchants decide on which methods of payment to adopt and accept, respectively. Second, consumers and merchants meet at the POS, and the consumer chooses their preferred method of payment given what the merchant accepts. Estimates from our model suggest that both sides of the market can benefit from accepting all means of payment. Further, our model predicts that merchants are much more sensitive to an increase in their payment costs than consumers. We use our model to predict what would happen under three scenarios. First, increasing merchants’ cost of using credit cards would significantly reduce merchant acceptance of this payment instrument in favour of debit. Second, the cost of using cash would have to increase substantially on both sides of the market for cash usage to fall below 1 percent of transaction volume. Finally, even if all consumers/merchants adopted/accepted all methods of payment, cash would fall but would remain at 20 percent of transaction volume. These findings suggest a completely cashless society is unlikely in the foreseeable future.
L81|Exchange Rates, Retailers, and Importing: Theory and Firm-Level Evidence|We develop a model with firm heterogeneity in importing and cross-border shopping among consumers. Exchange-rate appreciations lower the cost of imported goods, but also lead to more cross-border shopping; hence, the net impact on aggregate retail prices and sales is ambiguous. Using Canadian firm-level data from 2002 to 2012, we find empirical support for several predictions of the model. We then estimate the model-implied exchange-rate elasticities of aggregate retail prices and sales. Our benchmark results indicate a deflationary effect of appreciations on retail prices and a small positive effect on sales. From 2002 to 2012, the Canadian exchange rate appreciated by 57%, which, according to our model, led to a 6.5% reduction in the retail price index. We also find that the estimated elasticities of aggregate retail prices and sales grew over this period, driven by import growth from China. This suggests that the transmission of exchange-rate movements to prices has grown since the early 2000s, which has consequences for the role of Canada’s flexible exchange rate regime in supporting inflation stability.
L81|Amazon Effects in Canadian Online Retail Firm-Product-Level Data|I use firm-product-level data for Canadian online retailers to study how product scope (the average number of product categories per firm) evolved from 1999 to 2012. During this period, product scope dropped monotonically from 59 to 5 product categories. Using a theoretical model of multi-product firms, I show that this reduction can be rationalized by increased online competition. Consistent with the model, I find that the percentage of Canadian online retailers with revenues in a product category falls when Amazon.com expands its varieties in the category. Overall, Amazon.com’s expansion accounts for 37 percent of the observed reduction in product scope.
L81|Marketing Agencies and Collusive Bidding in Online Ad Auctions|The transition of the advertising market from traditional media to the internet has induced a proliferation of marketing agencies specialized in bidding in the auctions that are used to sell ad space on the web. We analyze how collusive bidding can emerge from bid delegation to a common marketing agency and how this can undermine the revenues and allocative efficiency of both the Generalized Second Price auction (GSP, used by Google and Microsoft-Bing and Yahoo!) and the VCG mechanism (used by Facebook). We find that, despite its well-known susceptibility to collusion, the VCG mechanism outperforms the GSP auction both in terms of revenues and efficiency.
L81|If You Think 9-Ending Prices Are Low,Think Again|9-ending prices are a dominant feature of many retail settings, which according to the existing literature, is because consumers perceive them as being relatively low. Are 9-ending prices really lower than comparable non 9-ending prices? Surprisingly, the empirical evidence on this question is scarce. We use 8 years of weekly scanner price data with over 98 million price observations to document four findings. First, at the category level, 9-ending prices are usually higher, on average, than non 9-ending prices. Second, at the product level, in most cases, 9-ending prices are, on average, higher than prices with other endings. Third, sale prices are more likely to be non-9 ending than the corresponding regular prices. Fourth, among sale prices, 9-ending prices are often lower, on average, than comparable non 9-ending prices. The first three findings imply that although consumers may associate 9-ending prices with low prices, the data indicates otherwise. The fourth finding offers a possible explanation for this misperception. Retailers may be using 9-ending prices to draw consumers’ attention to particularly large price cuts during sales, which perhaps conditions the shoppers to associate 9-ending prices with low prices.
L81|Pricing Better|Electronic shelf label (ESL) is an emerging price display technology around the world. While these new technologies require non-trivial investments by the retailer, they also promise significant operational efficiencies in the form of savings in material, labor and managerial costs. The presumed benefits of ESL, for example, tend to be focused around lower price adjustment costs (PAC), also known as menu costs. However, ESL not only can save PAC but may also enable the retailer to price “better,” generating greater value for the transacting parties. Thus, ESL’s strategic impact for retailers occurs between claiming these presumed efficiencies and realizing the value generating potential. Using transactions data from a longitudinal field experiment, we assess such impact of ESL by studying how it shapes retail pricing practices and outcomes. Our general finding is that ESL plays an enabling role to the retailer’s strategy – thereby enhancing the retailer’s sales and revenues. The price adjustment efficiencies of ESL allows retailers to do better waste management, price discovery, as well as leveraging value in information for consumers. However, ESL’s impact on prices is nuanced, based on the retail strategy (EDLP, HI-LO) being used. Papers quantifying emerging technologies’ impact on retail outcomes are sparse, even fewer investigating their role in pricing. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to explore and quantify how ESL interacts with retail strategy to affect retail pricing practices and retail outcomes.
L81|Local Search Markets and External Competition|Increased competition tends to benefit all buyers with increasing product variety and de- creasing prices. However, if local and external market channels compete for the same class of products, increased competition from the external market crowds out local variety. Under local monopoly, local buyer surplus co-moves with external buyer surplus. Under local free entry oligopoly, buyer surplus is U-shaped. If buyer surplus in the external market is low, local surplus is better provided by local oligopoly, but moves against external surplus; if it is high, local and external surplus co-move, and local surplus is better provided by local monopoly.
L81|Nutritional Inequality: The Role of Prices, Income, and Preferences|In the U.S., lower income households have a less healthy consumption basket than higher income ones. This paper studies the drivers of such nutrition inequality. I use longitudinal home-scanner data to estimate a demand system on food products, and measure the contribution of prices, disposable income and preferences to nutrition inequality. Disposable income and preferences have a predominant and quantitatively similar role in explaining consumption basket differences across income groups. Instead, prices have a limited effect. Further, I merge nutritional label information to assess, through a series of counterfactual exercises, the effect of income subsidies on nutrition quality. For example, I show that increasing the budget of a low-income household to the average level of the higher income households (a 45% increase in food expenditures) leads to an increase in protein consumption of approximately 5% and a decrease in sugar consumption of approximately 10%.
L81|Exchange Rate Shocks and Quality Adjustments|Do firms respond to cost shocks by reducing the quality of their products? Using microdata from a large Russian retailer that varies its offerings twice-yearly, we document that ruble devaluations are associated with a reduction in the observed material quality of products imported for resale, but that higher quality goods are also more profitable. We reconcile these facts using a simple multi-product sourcing model that features a demand system with expenditure switching, where more profitable products can be dropped more quickly after a cost shock. The estimated model shows that quality downgrading reduces average passthrough by 6% and has meaningful consequences for welfare.
L81|Market Power and Spatial Competition in Rural India|In this paper, I argue that market power of intermediaries plays an important role in contributing to low incomes of farmers in India. I study the role of spatial competition between intermediaries in determining the prices that farmers receive in India by focusing on a law that restricts farmers to selling their goods to intermediaries in their own state. I show that the discontinuities in market power generated by the law translate into discontinuities in prices. Increasing spatial competition by one standard deviation causes prices received by farmers to increase by 6.4%. To shed light on spatial and aggregate implications, I propose and estimate a quantitative spatial model of bargaining and trade. Using this structural model, I estimate that the removal of the interstate trade restriction in India would increase competition between intermediaries substantially, thereby increasing the prices farmers receive and their output. Estimates suggest that average farmer prices and output would increase by at least 11% and 7% respectively. The value of the national crop output would therefore increase by at least 18%.
L81|Retail Shocks and City Structure|This paper evaluates the consequences of opening out-of-town big-boxes on the commercial structure of cities. I use a discontinuity in a commercial regulation in Spain that restricts the entry of big-box stores in municipalities of less than 10,000 inhabitants for the period 2003 to 2011. I then use this discontinuity as an instrument for the big-box opening. The results show that three years after the big-box opening, around 15% of the grocery stores in the municipality have disappeared. However, some of the empty commercial premises are taken by other new small retailers in other sectors. As a result, the total number of retail stores in the municipality remains unchanged. These results show that a retail shock in the suburbs does not necessarily empty the city center but can also change only the composition of its commercial activity.
L81|Local Search Markets and External Competition|Increased competition tends to benefit all buyers with increasing product variety and decreasing prices. However, if local and external market channels compete for the same class of products, increased competition from the external market crowds out local variety. Under local monopoly, local buyer surplus co-moves with external buyer surplus. Under local free entry oligopoly, buyer surplus is U-shaped. If buyer surplus in the external market is low, local surplus is better provided by local oligopoly, but moves against external surplus; if it is high, local and external surplus co-move, and local surplus is better provided by local monopoly.
L81|Sales Taxation, Spatial Agglomeration, and the Internet|Technological innovations facilitating e-commerce have well-documented effects on consumer behavior and firm organization in the retail sector, but the effects of these new transaction technologies on fiscal systems remain unknown. By extending models of commodity tax competition to include urban spatial structure (agglomeration) and online commerce, one can analyze strategic tax-policy interactions among neighboring localities. Consumers buy different types of commodities, sold either by traditional or by online vendors. When the cost of online shopping falls, we show that equilibrium tax rates and revenues increase in small jurisdictions and decrease in large jurisdictions with retail shopping centers. Policy commentators warn that e-commerce erodes tax revenue - true enough for some localities - but, more accurately, changing transaction costs can generate entirely new commercial and fiscal equilibria that ultimately “redistribute” tax revenues from localities with concentrations of traditional vendors toward other, typically smaller, localities.
L81|From Mad Men to Maths Men: Concentration and Buyer Power in Online Advertising|This paper analyzes the impact of intermediaries' concentration on the allocation of revenues in online platforms. We study sponsored search - the sale of ad space on search engines through online auctions - documenting how advertisers increasingly bid through a handful of specialized intermediaries. This enhances automated bidding and data pooling, but lessens competition whenever the intermediary represents competing advertisers. Using data on nearly 40 million Google's keyword-auctions, we first apply machine learning algorithms to cluster keywords into thematic groups serving as relevant markets. Then, through an instrumental variable strategy, we quantify a negative and sizeable impact of intermediaries' concentration on platform's revenues.
L81|Currency Regimes and the Carry Trade|This study exploits a new long-run data set of daily bid and offered exchange rates in spot and forward markets from 1919 to the present to analyze carry returns in fixed and floating currency regimes. We first find that outsized carry returns occur exclusively in the floating regime, being zero in the fixed regime. Second, we show that fixed-to-floating regime shifts are associated with negative returns to a carry strategy implemented only on floating currencies, robust to the inclusion of volatility risks. These shifts are typically characterized by global flight-to-safety events that represent bad times for carry traders.
L81|Searching for significance among drug lords and death squads: the covert netherworld as invisible incubator for illicit commerce|In a search for appropriate theory, this essay inserts drug trafficking, the world’s largest illicit economic activity, within a wider analytical frame called the ‘covert netherworld.’ Through the convergence of three factors—covert operations, illicit commerce, and social milieu—such netherworlds can form at regional, national, and international levels, thereby transforming social margins of crime and illicit commerce into potent sources of political change. By deftly playing upon this netherworld’s politics and illicit commerce along the Burma-Thai borderlands, a regional ‘drug lord’ amassed sufficient local power to dominate the global heroin trade for over a decade and simultaneously sustain an ethnic revolt for nearly 15 years. In the Philippines, the illicit traffic in synthetic drugs developed a parallel power to influence the character of national politics, compromising three presidential administrations and shaping the moral economy of political life. For the past 40 years in Afghanistan, an illicit commodity, opium, has shaped the fate of military intervention by the world’s sole superpower, allowing it an initial success and later contributing to its ongoing failure. Through the sum of these cases, the essay concludes that the covert netherworld can serve as invisible incubator for a range of extralegal activities and has thereby attained sufficient autonomy to be treated as a significant factor in international politics.
L81|Presentation of the special issue: Apresentação à edição especial|The special issue of the Journal of Illicit Economies and Development presents various aspects of illicit markets in Brazil, their connections with legal activities and the institutional responses. It focuses on the characters, moral standards and operating rules of those economies, and explores the prevalence of non-state regulation, as well as the connection between illegal trade and economic development. This introductory article offers a brief introduction on Brazilian current debates and outlines key aspects of the papers comprising the special issue.
L81|Problem and power: informal commerce between repression and enterprisation|More often than not, the idea of ‘informal commerce’ is associated with precariousness, informality, illegality, and poor product quality. This is the common representation of this market historically and systematically built based on everyday conversation, official discourse, and the media, which also tends to reinforce the aspects of insecurity and disorder of the spaces and marginality of those involved to describe it. Based on interviews, media coverage, and ethnographical observation of business practices carried out by a group of traders, the objective of this paper is to analyze the transformations this market has gone through in recent years and reflect upon the reasons for, and the effect of, new regulatory strategies that were put in place. I shall discuss this transformation in light of the concept of enterprisation of informal commerce (i.e., the application of enterprise models to such business activities), which have been transforming spaces, regulations, and even workers’ conducts, perceptions, and expectations. I hereby argument that regulatory strategies have been set forth based on a double narrative that responds to both economical exploitation interests and the discourse against certain illegal activities, and that this resulted in a process of labor gentrification.

L81|#FavelaLivesMatter: youth from urban peripheries, political engagement and alternatives to the war on drugs|This article aims to share the experience of Movimentos (Movements), a collective of young activists from Brazilian favelas and peripheral neighborhoods whose goal is to discuss alternatives to the current drug policy from the peripheral youth’s standpoint. The population’s role in the formulation, application, and enforcement of public safety and drug policies is rudimentary, and the opportunities available to youngsters who live in Brazilian favelas and the outskirts are even smaller. The purpose of Movimentos is to have youngsters from the outskirts take center stage in the debate over public safety and drug policies, because they are the war on drugs greatest victims. The collective follows a hybrid organizational model that combines collective, horizontal governance with the institutional support of an academic research center. Not only does it seek to broaden youngsters’ agency around public safety and drug policies, but it also devises and experiments with methodologies to enable their active participation.
L81|Crime, power, and authoritarian capitalism: a dystopian realism experiment|The article contrasts the richness of academic production on illegal markets in Brazil to the obscurantist context of contemporary Brazilian politics. The text takes up the main topics of the Special Issue and faces a challenging question: considering the knowledge produced by the articles as a whole and the situation opened by the victory of the far- right in Brazil, what can we expect in the near future? Certainly, continuity, if not increase, of mass incarceration with class, racial and territorial bias, as well as strengthening of the most retrograde policies in criminal justice, with official legitimation of police lethality in peripheries and favelas, now consecrated as a State policy. On the one hand the modern edge of capitalism, the most insidiously averse to rights, exclusive and inseparable from crime; on the other, social barbarism.
L81|Illusions clouding decision-making: how the justice system fails to understand the illicit drug market|This paper reviews some of the main research on drug law enforcement in Brazil since the 2006 Drug Law came into force, noting a clear and constant pattern of police and judicial focus directed at retail drug trafficking, decisively impacting current incarceration rates. It then examines the lack of understanding of the actual functioning of illicit drug markets by the criminal justice system, leading to judicial decisions not only ineffective for its declared purposes, but also counterproductive in terms of controlling illicit economies.
L81|Sellin’ in the Rain: Adaptation to Weather and Climate in the Retail Sector|Using novel methodology and proprietary daily store-level sporting goods and apparel brand data, I find that, consistent with long-run adaptation to climate, sales sensitivity to weather declines with historical norms and variability of weather. Short-run adaptation to weather shocks is dominated by changes in what people buy and how they buy it, with little intertemporal substitution. Over four weeks, a one-standard deviation one-day weather shock shifts sales by about 10 percent. While switching between indoor and outdoor stores offsets a small portion of contemporaneous responses to weather, I find no evidence that ecommerce offsets any of the effects.
L81|Blockchain and Smart-contract: a pioneering Approach of inter-firms Relationships? The case of franchise networks|This paper is interested in the analysis of Blockchains and Smart-contracts applied to inter-firms relationships, in particular the franchise networks. After defining the Blockchain technology and the Smart-contract as a particular type of contract stored in blockchains, we question the theory of contracts and its conception(s) of transactions, information asymmetries, firm or inter-firm relations. To better understand the challenges of blockchain for franchise networks and identify opportunities for implementation in these networks, we present some relevant applications of this technology. We identify different ways where blockchain technology could improve the network management and therefore their performance: the supply-chain, the brand-name protection, security and transparency in the payment of fees and royalties, access to reliable information via an oracle.
L81|Multinationals, Intrafirm Trade, and Employment Volatility|This paper examines the theoretically ambiguous relationship between the volatility of employment growth and the foreign exposure of a firm. We use unique firm-level data for Japan for the period 1994-2012, which allow us to examine the differences between 1) multinational firms, trading firms, and nontrading firms; 2) manufacturing and wholesale and retail trade; and 3) intrafirm and interfirm trade. One of the major findings is that, in manufacturing, the effect of exports on the volatility of employment varies depending on the share of intrafirm exports to total sales. In contrast, in wholesale and retail trade, exports do not have significant effects on employment volatility. The results suggest that intrafirm trade transmits the effects of foreign demand and supply shocks differently between manufacturing and wholesale and retail trade.
L81|Hotel rankings of online travel agents, channel pricing, and consumer protection|We investigate whether online travel agents (OTAs) assign hotels worse positions in their search results if these set lower hotel prices at other OTAs or on their own websites. We formally characterize how an OTA can use such a strategy to reduce price differentiation across distribution channels. Our empirical analysis shows that the position of a hotel in the search results of OTAs is better when the prices charged by the hotel on other channels are higher. This is consistent with the hypothesis that OTAs alter their search results to discipline hotels for aggressive prices on competing channels, thereby reducing the search quality for consumers.

L81|Price Dispersion In Internet Sales: Data From An Online Marketplace Contradict Lab Experiments|This paper considers three hypotheses about the strategic origin of price dispersion in homogeneous product online sales. The rst two are the E-equilibrium and the quantal-response equilibrium (QRE) in a pure Bertrand setting involving the boundedly rational behavior of sellers. The third introduces the share of loyal consumers into the model of competition. These hypotheses were supported by estimations on experimental lab data. We test the hypotheses on a set of real prices for 30 models of household appliances collected from the largest Russian online marketplace Market.Yandex.ru. In contrast to the previously reported experimental data, we found very limited support for any of these explanations. QRE showed the best performance on the data. For most of the products it accurately predicts central tendency, i.e. the mean and the median. However, the shape of the observed price distributions is not explained well by any of the models. These results pose new challenges for theoretical explanations of observed Internet prices.
L81|Trade Intermediaries, the Choice of Export Mode, and the “Learning-By-Exporting” Hypothesis|Focusing on the role of an intermediary, we consider the choice of export mode (i.e., direct vs. indirect exports) by a manufacturer. We also examine the effect of “learning-by-exporting,” which implies that a manufacturer using an intermediary in a previous period is likely to export directly in a subsequent period.
L81|Do pump prices really follow Edgeworth cycles? Evidence from the German retail fuel market|Most of the literature on retail fuel markets find high-frequency and asymmetric price cycles. This is typically explained by the model of Edgeworth price cycles. A key element of this model is that prices fall to marginal costs during a cycle. It seems challenging to address this assumption empirically. However, I use a natural experiment in the German fuel market to analyze the effects of an external cost shock. I find strong evidence that prices do not fall to marginal costs. This is not in line with Edgeworth cycles and thus, should be taken into account when analyzing fuel markets.
L81|Competition Between Public and Private Maternity Care Providers in France: Evidence on Market Segmentation|The French market for hospital care is shared by public and private providers. In addition to covering a number of mandates usually not undertaken by the private sector such as training, research, and disease prevention, public hospitals are required to provide basic care across the French territory. To investigate the existence of market segmentation between public and private care providers, we focus on maternity care and first examine to what extent public and private maternity units substitute each other on an extensive margin, to then analyze how competition plays out on an intensive margin. Consistent with the public mandate, our findings indicate that, after a private unit closure, public maternity units are less likely to exit a low-populated area than a high-populated area. In addition, we find evidence of an asymmetric intensive margin substitution between private and public maternity units. Maternity users tend to substitute private units (non for-profit and for-profit) for public units more often than the reverse.

To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to explore and quantify how ESL interacts with retail strategy to affect retail pricing practices and retail outcomes.
L81|Lage und Trends im deutschen Onlinehandel|Dieser Report analysiert die Bedeutung und Entwicklung des Onlinehandels in Deutschland und identifiziert Zukunftstrends. E-Commerce hat in den vergangenen Jahren in Deutschland stark an Bedeutung gewonnen. Mittlerweile ist er für mehr als zehn Prozent des Einzelhandelsumsatzes verantwortlich. Dabei gibt es Unterschiede zwischen den Warengruppen. Vor allem der Lebensmittelhandel findet zum großen Teil noch offline statt. In der nahen Zukunft ist mit einer weiter steigenden Bedeutung des E-Commerce zu rechnen. Trotz starker Kannibalisierungseffekte wird es keine vollständige Ablösung des stationären Handels durch den Onlinehandel geben. Die zukünftige Entwicklung des Onlinehandels wird zu einem großen Teil durch die Logistik determiniert. Die Versandlogistik ist derzeit der Flaschenhals des Onlinehandels und kann diesen auch zukünftig erheblich ausbremsen. Für Händler kann es deshalb vorteilhaft sein, eigene Logistikstrukturen aufzubauen oder zumindest neue Logistikdienstleistungen zu prüfen. Dies gilt insbesondere, da die Versandlogistik zu einem hohen Grad die Kaufentscheidung im Onlinehandel determiniert und damit erfolgsentscheidend für Händler ist.
L81|Trends der Nahversorgung in ländlichen Räumen|Seit Jahrzehnten ist der Lebensmitteleinzelhandel von einem Strukturwandel hin zu weniger und größeren Geschäften gekennzeichnet. Gerade in kleineren Orten ländlicher Räume bestehen daher Probleme, die Versorgung mit Gütern des täglichen Bedarfs in fußläufiger Entfernung, das heißt die Nahversorgung, sicherzustellen. Um die bestehenden Herausforderungen hinreichend zu analysieren und Lösungen zu entwickeln, müssen die aktuellen Trends der Nahversorgung untersucht und mit Blick auf ihre potentiellen Wirkungen auf ländliche Räume eingeschätzt werden. Vor diesem Hintergrund wertet das vorliegende Working Paper aktuelle Studien und die wissenschaftliche Literatur mit besonderem Fokus auf den Lebensmitteleinzelhandel und den Onlinehandel aus. Im Ergebnis zeigt sich die Verfestigung seit langem anhaltender Trends sowie das Aufkeimen neuer Trends, deren Beständigkeit noch abzuwarten ist. Anhaltende Trends sind der sich intensivierende Wettbewerbsdruck, der in den letzten Jahren weniger über den Preis als über Auswahl und Qualität ausgeübt wird, die Marktkonzentration weniger großer Ketten im Lebensmitteleinzelhandel sowie der Ersatz kleinerer Märkte durch größere, um eine hinreichende Auswahl für die sich ausdifferenzierende Nachfrage bereitstellen zu können. Zudem wird das Einkaufen angesichts zunehmender Zeitknappheit eher als Last empfunden, was zu seltenerem Einkauf, mehr Kopplung von Einkäufen und Wegen sowie Rückgängen beim Marktanteil sehr großflächiger und daher unübersichtlicher Formate führt. Damit ist nach wie vor die Konzentration auf das Auto als Verkehrsmittel zumindest in ländlichen Räumen verbunden. Dabei steigt die Automobilität gerade auch bei den Senioren an und die Notwendigkeit einer fußläufigen Erreichbarkeit von Angeboten verringert sich dadurch. Eine neuere Entwicklung ist demgegenüber, dass die Zahl der Lebensmittelgeschäfte zwar noch schrumpft, dass dieser Rückgang aber im Vergleich zur zweiten Hälfte der 2000er Jahre deutlich an Intensität verloren hat. Des Weiteren weisen Verbraucherbefragungen darauf hin, dass sich die für Deutschland typische hohe Preissensibilität etwas reduziert hat und sich die Verbraucher zunehmend an der Warenqualität orientieren. In der Folge gleichen sich Supermärkte und Discounter hinsichtlich Warenangebot und Ladengestaltung zunehmend an, wodurch Potentiale für neue Formate, wie Online-Handel, mobile Versorger und Kleinflächenkonzepte, entstehen könnten. In Bezug auf den Online-Handel mit Lebensmitteln zeigt sich jedoch, dass die Lieferkosten gerade in ländlichen Räumen hoch, aber die Zahlungsbereitschaft der Verbraucher gering ist, sodass sich das starke Wachstum bisher auf die Verdichtungsräume konzentriert und das Potential des Online-Handels beschränkt sein dürfte. Auch neuere Modelle, in denen Bürger die Versorgung auf der letzten Meile im Zuge der sogenannten Mitmachlogistik übernehmen, dürfte vermutlich für bestimmte urbane Milieus interessant sein, insgesamt aber wie zumindest momentan der Online-Handel eher auf eine Nische im Lebensmitteleinzelhandel beschränkt bleiben, sodass keine schnelle Lösung von Nahversorgungsprobleme in ländlichen Räumen absehbar ist.
L81|Fördermöglichkeiten zur Sicherung der Nahversorgung in ländlichen Räumen|"Der vorliegende Bericht ist im Rahmen des Projektes ""Dynamik der Nahversorgung in ländlichen Räumen"" entstanden. Berichtsgegenstand ist die Förderung durch die öffentliche Hand im Bereich der Nahversorgung, die auf ganz unterschiedliche Weise unterstützt wird. Der Schwerpunkt liegt auf der Förderung im Rahmen des Europäischen Landwirtschaftsfonds für die Entwicklung des ländlichen Raums (ELER) mit den aktuell geltenden Richtlinien des Bundes und der Länder in der laufenden Förderperiode 2014 bis 2020. Daneben werden Landesinitiativen zur Verbesserung der Nahversorgung, weitere Förderinstrumente auf regionaler Ebene und aus Österreich vorgestellt, um bestehende Steuerungs- und Förderansätze zu identifizieren. Methodische Grundlagen für den Bericht sind Datenbank- und Literaturrecherchen sowie Dokumentenanalysen. Hinzu kommen Teilnahmen an Tagungen zur Nahversorgung und Rückfragen bei Akteuren, die sich mit Förderung beschäftigen. Im Vergleich zur vorhergehenden Förderperiode 2007 bis 2013 sind Beratung im Vorfeld, Situationsanalysen an geplanten Standorten (lokaler Bedarf), Nachweise zur Wirtschaftlichkeit und Einbindung der Bewohner bei der Konzeptentwicklung vermehrt zu Fördervoraussetzungen geworden. Außerdem werden Unterstützungsmöglichkeiten für mobile Angebote häufiger explizit als möglicher Fördergegenstand benannt. Fördergegenstand sind zumeist Investitionen in neue Gebäude und Sachwerte, aber auch Beratungs- bzw. Ingenieurleistungen, die mit der Vorhabenumsetzung verbunden sind (Förderschwerpunkt Grundversorgung). In manchen Ländern werden zudem Grundstückserwerb sowie Kauf, Einrichtung und Umbau von Gebäuden oder die Umnutzung von Gebäuden bezuschusst. In einigen Ländern existieren Beratungsangebote zur Unterstützung bestehender oder geplanter Nahversorgungseinrichtungen. Bei Finanzierungsengpässen können ggf. Angebote von Landesbanken und Bürgschaftsbanken in Anspruch genommen werden. Fördervarianten, die in der Form in Deutschland bisher nicht existieren, zeigen die Beispiele aus Österreich. Hier sind z. B. auch jährliche Betriebskostenschüsse für kleine Lebensmittelnahversorger (bis maximal 400 m2 Verkaufsfläche), Zuschüsse für Zustelldienste oder auch digitale Kommunikationsmaßnahmen zum Ausbau des Kundenkreises förderfähig."
L81|Assessing the Gains from E-Commerce|E-Commerce represents a rapidly growing share of consumer spending in the U.S. We use transactions-level data on credit and debit cards from Visa, Inc. between 2007 and 2017 to quantify the resulting consumer surplus. We estimate that E-Commerce spending reached 8% of consumption by 2017, yielding consumers the equivalent of a 1% permanent boost to their consumption, or over $1,000 per household. While some of the gains arose from saving travel costs of buying from local merchants, most of the gains stemmed from substituting to online merchants. Higher income cardholders gained more, as did consumers in more densely populated counties.
L81|An Empirical Analysis of Minimum Advertised Price Restrictions| Recent theory has examined the competitive effects of minimum advertised price (MAP) restrictions: manufacturer policies that can limit the ability of consumers to search for product prices. In this paper, we empirically study the effect of a major electronics manufacturer's MAP policy on the e-retail prices for its hardware products. Our approach leverages three types of data: contractual MAP values by product from 2011-2013; daily prices across its largest e-retailers; and the frequency of visits to each e-retailer from a representative household panel. We use a model of search with advertised prices to guide two types of findings. First, descriptive patterns of retailer prices are consistent with the market exhibiting consumer search costs, whereby it is costlier to search when price is below MAP than above MAP. Second, reduced form models imply that MAP diminishes the effect of increased retailer competition on decreased price dispersion, whereby prices are up to 6% more dispersed with MAP than without MAP. This is consistent with a model of inter-retailer price discrimination.
L81|Retail forecasting: research and practice|This paper first introduces the forecasting problems faced by large retailers, from the strategic to the operational, from the store to the competing channels of distribution as sales are aggregated over products to brands to categories and to the company overall. Aggregated forecasting that supports strategic decisions is discussed on three levels: the aggregate retail sales in a market, in a chain, and in a store. Product level forecasts usually relate to operational decisions where the hierarchy of sales data across time, product and the supply chain is examined. Various characteristics and the influential factors which affect product level retail sales are discussed. The data rich environment at lower product hierarchies makes data pooling an often appropriate strategy to improve forecasts, but success depends on the data characteristics and common factors influencing sales and potential demand. Marketing mix and promotions pose an important challenge, both to the researcher and the practicing forecaster. Online review information too adds further complexity so that forecasters potentially face a dimensionality problem of too many variables and too little data. The paper goes on to examine evidence on the alternative methods used to forecast product sales and their comparative forecasting accuracy. Many of the complex methods proposed have provided very little evidence to convince as to their value, which poses further research questions. In contrast, some ambitious econometric methods have been shown to outperform all the simpler alternatives including those used in practice. New product forecasting methods are examined separately where limited evidence is available as to how effective the various approaches are. The paper concludes with some evidence describing company forecasting practice, offering conclusions as to the research gaps but also the barriers to improved practice.
L81|Not All Price Endings Are Created Equal: Price Points and Asymmetric Price Rigidity|There is evidence that 9-ending prices are more common and more rigid than other prices. We use data from three sources: a laboratory experiment, a field study, and a large US supermarket chain, to study the cognitive underpinning and the ensuing asymmetry in rigidity associated with 9-ending prices. We find that consumers use 9-endings as a signal for low prices, and that this signal interferes with price information processing. Consequently, consumers are less likely to notice a bigger price when it ends with 9, or a price increase when the new price ends with 9, in comparison to a situation where the prices end with some other digit. We also find that retailers respond strategically to this consumer bias by setting 9-ending prices more often after price increases than after price decreases. 9-ending prices, therefore, usually increase only if the new prices are also 9ending. Consequently, there is an asymmetry in the rigidity of 9-ending prices: they are more rigid than non 9-ending prices upward but not downward.
L81|Antecedents and Effects of App-user Satisfaction: Empirical Evidence from Greece|The purpose of this research is to explore the antecedents and effects of mobile app satisfaction. A survey conducted using a “positivism” approach, in which 450 app users participated to answer the research instrument. Emotional Attachment and App design proved to be the most influential antecedents of app satisfaction, whereas Safety of personal data & user identification were important as well. However, app satisfaction has no effect on Intention to upgrade to premium service, showing that the basic revenue stream still derives from advertising and sponsorships. On the other hand, Word of Mouth communication is stimulated by app user satisfaction. This finding shows that satisfaction is the vehicle to spread the value of the app to other users cheaper and with more credibility. This research provides certain implications to digital marketing practitioners and academics in order to make decisions on building strong service brands using a mobile app as a distribution channel.
L81|Transaksi Jual Beli Online (E-Commerce) dalam Perspektif Hukum Islam|The more developed science and technology, the more developed methods used in the buying and selling process. E-commerce is a commercial transaction carried out between the seller and the buyer or with another party in the same agreement relationship to send a number of goods, services, or transfer of rights. This research is classified as Library Research, where data is collected by quoting in library research, literature searches are carried out rather than preparing a research framework or proposal to obtain similar research, deepening theoretical studies or sharpening methodologies. Based on the discussion of the results of the study, it can be concluded that online e-commerce is similar to the greeting contract, which is payment in advance and the item is received in the future.
L81|Firm Performance Under Infrastructure Constraints: Evodence from Sub-sahara African Firms|The poor business environment mainly poor infrastructure is found to has paramount importance in explaining Africa's disadvantage relative to other similar countries. To cope with this poor supply of electricity, firms adopt different mechanisms to reduce the resulting effects. The commonly adopted coping strategy is an investment in self-generation of electricity. This study examined the role of investing in self-generation in mitigating the outage loss and evaluated the outage loss differential between �firms that invested in self-generation and those that did not, using World Bank Enterprise Survey data collected from �firms operating in 13 Sub-Saharan African countries. The result obtained shows that, though self-generation has reduced the amount of outage loss for fi�rms that invested in self-generation, these firms continue to face higher unmitigated outage loss compared to firms without such investment. In spite of this, �firms that invested in self-generation would have incurred 36%-99% more than the current amount of outage loss if they do not engaged in self-generation. Similarly, �firms that did not invest in self-generation would have reduced their outage loss by 2% - 24% if they had engaged in self-generation. The study thus, recommended a di�fferential supply interruption to be followed by public authorities based on �firms' degree of vulnerability to power interruptions.
L81|An ASEAN Digital Single Market: Boosting the Aspiration for a Single Market in the Digital Era|Advancements in information and communications technologies have changed the way individuals, firms, and nations create and exchange value across borders. Value comes in the form of goods, services, information, and data, but may also include talent, capital, ideas, and even culture. Southeast Asia is a thriving digital economy with the prospect of becoming a US$200B economy by 2025. However, new forms of protectionist measures arise, which may impede the free flow of value within the region. An aspirational digital single market concept and the changing dynamics of digital trade are explored. A digital economic integration framework that is interoperable, inclusive, and agile is proposed to address both barriers to the creation of an ASEAN digital single market. Requisite conditions for policy solutions are identified, and an empowered digital transformation board with the task of leading the change agenda is proposed as a critical governance enabler across the region.
L81|Consumer Uptake of Internet Banking, Endogenous Market Structure and Regional Integration in Europe|"This paper examines how market structure influences the early introduction and consumer uptake of a digital service that is a convenient alternative to traditional service delivery. Digital provision also has ""extended geographic reach"" and ""lower sunk costs"" as compared with bricks-and-mortar service provision. We further examine how these affect market structure. Internet banking provides an important example that also allows us to separate regional integration and national concentration dimensions of market structure. We develop an econometric model of the effects of market structure on the introduction and consumer uptake of internet banking. We estimate using panel data for all EU Member States and find that both concentration and regionalisation bring these forward. Next, we examine how consumer uptake of the digital product then begins to impact on banking market structure. We find a substantial de-concentrating effect in large non-regionalised markets and indirect evidence of integration in previously regionalised markets. This is consistent with internet banking having enhanced competition in both integrated markets and, despite little change in national concentration, also in previously regionalised markets."
L81|When Prohibiting Platform Parity Agreements Harms Consumers|We consider a three-level supply chain where a monopolistic seller distributes its product both directly through its own distribution channel and indirectly through platforms accessed by intermediaries competing for final consumers. In this setting, we examine the welfare effects of platform parity agreements, namely contractual provisions according to which the seller cannot charge different prices for the same product distributed through different platforms. We find that these agreements mitigate the marginalization problem both in a wholesale and an agency model. However, only in the former model platform parity unambiguously increases consumer surplus; in the latter, it also increases the commissions paid by the monopolist to the platforms, whereby exacerbating the marginalization problem. On the net, platform parity benefits consumers in the agency model when competition between direct and indirect distribution is sufficiently intense. Interestingly, in both models consumers' preferences are always aligned with the platforms' but not with the seller's.
L81|If You Think 9-Ending Prices Are Low, Think Again|9-ending prices are a dominant feature of many retail settings, which according to the existing literature, is because consumers perceive them as being relatively low. Are 9-ending prices really lower than comparable non 9-ending prices? Surprisingly, the empirical evidence on this question is scarce. We use 8 years of weekly scanner price data with over 98 million price observations to document four findings. First, at the category level, 9-ending prices are usually higher, on average, than non 9-ending prices. Second, at the product level, in most cases, 9-ending prices are, on average, higher than prices with other endings. Third, sale prices are more likely to be non-9 ending than the corresponding regular prices. Fourth, among sale prices, 9-ending prices are often lower, on average, than comparable non 9-ending prices. The first three findings imply that although consumers may associate 9-ending prices with low prices, the data indicates otherwise. The fourth finding offers a possible explanation for this misperception. Retailers may be using 9-ending prices to draw consumers’ attention to particularly large price cuts during sales, which perhaps conditions the shoppers to associate 9-ending prices with low prices.
L81|Marketing Agencies and Collusive Bidding in Online Ad Auctions|The transition of the advertising market from traditional media to the internet has induced a proliferation of marketing agencies specialized in bidding in the auctions that are used to sell ad space on the web. We analyze how collusive bidding can emerge from bid delegation to a common marketing agency and how this can undermine the revenues and allocative efficiency of both the Generalized Second Price auction (GSP, used by Google and Microsoft-Bing and Yahoo!) and the of VCG mechanism (used by Facebook). We find that, despite its well-known susceptibility to collusion, the VCG mechanism outperforms the GSP auction both in terms of revenues and efficiency.
L81|Convergencia de precios en el largo plazo en Uruguay. Evidencia empírica para 4 bienes|En el presente documento se estudia si durante el período comprendido entre enero de 2008 y mayo de 2017 se produjo en Uruguay un proceso de convergencia de precios a nivel de establecimientos de venta. Se utiliza un panel de datos conformado por precios diarios de 4 bienes fijados por 386 supermercados, con cobertura nacional. Los bienes fueron seleccionados buscando representar categorías de productos para las cuales los hogares suelen realizar compras en un supermercado con alta frecuencia. El análisis de convergencia se realiza a partir del estudio de la evolución de la dispersión de precios en el tiempo. Se encuentra que esta se redujo en el período solamente 0,88 % a nivel de todo el país, por lo que no parece suciente como para concluir que los precios hayan convergido. Este resultado era esperable debido a que las posibles fuentes de diferenciales de precios no registraron cambios signicativos durante el período. Por lo tanto, la reducción en la dispersión de precios estimada no parece suficiente como para afirmar que la Ley de un Solo Precio en su versión absoluta se cumple en el largo plazo en el país. Como parte del análisis de robustez, se realizan estimaciones para diversas desagregaciones territoriales, así como para diferentes momentos de ingreso de los establecimientos a la muestra y para distintos niveles inflacionarios. El resultado encontrado es robusto para diferentes desagregaciones territoriales.
L81|Pasaje de costos a precios: evidencia microeconómica para comercios minoristas en Uruguay|En el presente trabajo se estima el pasaje de costos a precios en comercios minoristas pequeños y medianos para arroz, pulpa de tomate y harina en Uruguay, utilizando un modelo estructural. Se estima un sistema de demanda por productos diferenciados utilizando un modelo logit de coeficientes aleatorios. Se utiliza el sistema de demanda estimado en conjunto con supuestos sobre la determinación del precio para recuperar los costos marginales, márgenes de ganancia y el pasaje de costos a precios. Se encuentran ratios de pasaje de costos a precios que van del 25% al 86% en mediana para todo el país cuando se supone competencia a la Nash-Bertrand y ratios entre el 11% y 78% cuando se supone colusión. Se utiliza información sobre precios y cantidades vendidas a beneficiarios de un programa social en Uruguay. El trabajo presenta dos limitaciones relevantes en cuanto a la información utilizada: solo se cuenta con las cantidades adquiridas mediante el programa social y no se cuenta con información para el universo de las variedades de cada producto.
L81|Match Quality, Search, and the Internet Market for Used Books|This paper examines the effect of the Internet on markets in which match-quality is important, including an analysis of the market for used books. A model in which sellers of unusual objects wait for high-value buyers to arrive brings out match quality and competition effects through which improved search technologies may increase both price dispersion and social welfare. A reduced-form empirical analysis finds support for a number of more nuanced predictions of the model in the context of the used book market, exploiting both cross-sectional differences across books and time-series differences in the wake of Amazon's acquisition and incorporation of a large used book marketplace. The paper develops a framework for structural estimation of a model based on the theory. The estimates suggest that the shift to Internet sales substantially increased both seller profits and consumer surplus.
L81|The Impact of Big Data on Firm Performance: An Empirical Investigation|In academic and policy circles, there has been considerable interest in the impact of “big data” on firm performance. We examine the question of how the amount of data impacts the accuracy of Machine Learned models of weekly retail product forecasts using a proprietary data set obtained from Amazon. We examine the accuracy of forecasts in two relevant dimensions: the number of products (N), and the number of time periods for which a product is available for sale (T). Theory suggests diminishing returns to larger N and T, with relative forecast errors diminishing at rate 1/√N+1/√T. Empirical results indicate gains in forecast improvement in the T dimension; as more and more data is available for a particular product, demand forecasts for that product improve over time, though with diminishing returns to scale. In contrast, we find an essentially flat N effect across the various lines of merchandise: with a few exceptions, expansion in the number of retail products within a category does not appear associated with increases in forecast performance. We do find that the firm’s overall forecast performance, controlling for N and T effects across product lines, has improved over time, suggesting gradual improvements in forecasting from the introduction of new models and improved technology.
L81|Inter-brand Competition in the Convenience Store Industry, Store Accessibility and Healthcare Utilization|We investigate the impact of access to convenience stores and competition between convenience store chains on medical care use and expenditures in Taiwan; the country with the highest density of convenience stores in the world. Our study makes use of insurance claims from 0.85 million individuals enrolled in Taiwan’s national health insurance program from 2002-2012 and administrative data on convenience store chain sales. While we find that both greater store accessibility and higher levels of inter-brand competition reduce the use and cost of outpatient medical services and prescription drugs, healthcare utilization is more responsive to changes in competition. Since convenience stores in Taiwan are typically the healthier option for ready-to-eat food, we postulate that the decline in medical care utilization is driven by a reduction in convenience store prices and increase in service quality relative to other food outlets. This is supported by findings from survey data indicating that convenience store competition is associated with greater consumption of more healthy foods, lower consumption of less healthy foods, and decreases in obesity rates. While the effects we find are precisely estimated, they are small in magnitude, with the increase in convenience store competition experienced by Taiwan over a 10-year period reducing medical expenditures on outpatient services and on prescription drugs by around one half of one percent.
L81|Market of the Novosibirsk Oblast in the System of Regional Markets|This paper studies integration of the Novosibirsk Oblast market for final goods with markets of all other Russian regions. It considers an aggregated market represented by a basket of basic foods (staples basket). The law of one price serves as the criterion of market integration. It is the base for constructing time series models of the regional costs of the staples basket over 2001–2015 relative to its cost in the Novosibirsk Oblast. Regional markets are divided into four groups: perfectly integrated with the Novosibirsk Oblast market, conditionally integrated with it, not integrated but tending towards integration, and neither integrated nor tending towards integration. Nonlinear time series models with asymptotically decaying trends describe the movement towards integration (price convergence).
L81|Пространственная Интеграция Региональных Рынков Сибири<BR>[Spatial Integration of Siberian Regional Markets]|This paper analyzes integration of 13 regions constituting Siberia with all country’s regions. The criterion of market integration is the law of one price. The data analyzed are time series of the cost of the staples basket over 2001–2015. Pairs of regional markets are divided into four groups: perfectly integrated, conditionally integrated, not integrated but tending towards integration (converging), and neither integrated nor converging.
L81|Power Outages, Its Economic Cost and Firm Performance: Evidence From Ethiopia|The unreliable supply of electricity is the main constraints to doing business in Ethiopia. This paper examined how firms in Ethiopia respond to power outage employing the World Bank Enterprise Survey data. The result shows that, in response to power outages, firms in Ethiopia self-generate electricity. While there is no evidence suggesting outsourcing and improved energy hypothesis, power outages were found to affect the firms’ productivity negatively. From 2011 to 2015 firms’ cost of production rose by 15% due to the power outage. This effect varies positively with output level suggesting that outage is costly particularly for large firms.
L81|Spatial Integration of Siberian Regional Markets|This paper studies market integration of 13 regions constituting Siberia with one another and all other Russian regions. The law of one price serves as a criterion of market integration. The data analyzed are time series of the regional costs of a basket of basic foods (staples basket) over 2001–2015. Pairs of regional markets are divided into four groups: perfectly integrated, conditionally integrated, not integrated but tending towards integration (converging), and neither integrated nor converging. Nonlinear time series models with asymptotically decaying trends describe price convergence. Integration of Siberian regional markets is found to be fairly strong; they are integrated and converging with about 70% of country’s regions (including Siberian regions themselves).
L81|Taxation and Market Power in the Legal Marijuana Industry|In 2012 the state of Washington created a legal framework for production and retail sales of marijuana. Nine other U.S. states and Canada have followed. These states hope to generate tax revenue for their state budgets while limiting harms associated with marijuana consumption. We use a unique administrative dataset containing all transactions in the history of the industry in Washington to evaluate the effectiveness of different tax and regulatory policies under consideration by policymakers and study the role of imperfect competition in determining these results. We examine 3 main research questions. First, how effective is Washington’s excise tax at raising revenue? With the nation’s highest tax rate on marijuana, is Washington maximizing revenue or potentially overtaxing, leading to reduced legal sales and lower tax revenue. Second, what is the incidence of taxes in this industry? Finally, most states have restricted entry, resulting in firms with substantial market power. What is the role of imperfect competition in studying these basic questions on tax policy? We combine structural methods and a reduced form sufficient statistic approach to show a number of results. First, Washington’s 37% excise tax is still on the upward sloping portion of the Laffer curve and state revenue could be substantially higher with a higher tax rate. The amount of revenue generated by a tax increase is significantly larger due to retailer market power than it would be under perfect competition. In addition, these taxes are primarily borne by consumers and not by firms, and there is a large social cost associated with each dollar raised.
L81|Measuring the Welfare of Intermediation in Vertical Markets|We empirically investigate the welfare implications of intermediaries in oligopolistic markets, where intermediaries offer additional services to differentiate their products from the ones of the manufacturers. Our identification strategy exploits the unique circumstance that, in the outdoors advertising industry, there are two distribution channels: consumers can purchase the product either directly from manufacturers, or with the intermediation of retailers. Using product-level data for the whole industry, we estimate a differentiated products’ equilibrium model that includes: consumers who have preferences that are specific to each distribution channel and engage in costly search on the demand side; and two layers of activity (where manufacturers and intermediaries bar- gain over wholesale prices) with two distribution channels (where the two distribution channels compete a la Bertrand) on the supply side. The estimated model is used to simulate counterfactual scenarios, where intermediaries do not offer additional services. These counterfactuals are used to quantify the welfare effects of intermediaries.
L81|Measuring the Welfare of Intermediaries in Vertical Markets|We empirically investigate the welfare of intermediaries in oligopolistic markets, where intermediaries offer additional services. We exploit the unique circumstance that, in our empirical setting, consumers can purchase from manufacturers or intermediaries. We specify an equilibrium model, and estimate it using product-level data. The demand includes consumers with costly search and channel-specific preferences. The supply includes two distribution channels. One features bargaining about wholesale prices between manufacturers and intermediaries, and price competition among intermediaries. The other is vertically integrated. The model is used to simulate counterfactuals, where intermediaries do not offer additional services. We find that intermediaries increase welfare.
L81|Electronic Commerce: Theory and Practice|Electronic commerce in the world is becoming an increasingly popular form of trade. Most shoppers start looking for products, descriptions and quality features online before buying a product. In order to provide customers with more convenience, more and more companies and existing stores are setting up their own online stores where a person can buy at a convenient time, even at night when regular stores are no longer working. Online stores allow you to save time spent by a person searching for a particular product and driving through shops. The article analyzes the concept of e-commerce, the advantages and disadvantages of electronic commerce, and the situation of electronic commerce in Lithuania.
L81|Influence of reference group indicators to the image of modern retail (case in Indonesia)|This study aims to analyze the influence of the reference group to the image of modern retail in Medan. The research population is modern retail consumers in Medan.The samples in this study were consumers who shop at Indomaret, Alfa Mart and Alfa Midi modern retailers in Medan City, Indonesia and tthe sample size obtained was 204 by the fraction sample method. This study analysis uses a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results concluded that the reference group has a significant effect on the modern retail images.
L81|Determinants of profitability in the Indian logistics industry|The Indian economy has one of the highest transportation and logistics cost as a percentage of gross domestic product (13%) globally. This paper analyses trends in profitability and discusses some key macro and micro level factors influencing the Indian logistics industry comprising road transport logistics, storage and distribution. It discusses the role of macroeconomic factors such as tax policy in influencing the logistics network complexity, which in turn increase logistics costs. At a micro level, the paper uses firm-level data of 201 companies from Prowess database and estimates an econometric model to analyse major determinants of profitability in the logistics sector. The study finds that liquidity, market share, debt-equity, and age are significant determinants of profitability in the logistics sector.
L81|Measuring the Welfare of Intermediation in Vertical Markets|We empirically investigate the welfare implications of intermediaries in oligopolistic markets, where intermediaries offer additional services to differentiate their products from the ones of the manufacturers. Our identification strategy exploits the unique circumstance that, in the outdoors advertising industry, there are two distribution channels: consumers can purchase the product either directly from manufacturers, or through intermediaries. We specify a differentiated products’ equilibrium model, and estimate it using product-level data for the whole industry. On the demand side, the model includes consumers who engage in costly search with preferences that are specific to the distribution channel. On the supply side, the model includes two competing distribution channels. One features two layers of activity, where manufacturers and intermediaries bargain over wholesale prices, and intermediaries compete on final prices to consumers. The other is vertically integrated. The estimated model is used to simulate counterfactual scenarios, where intermediaries do not offer additional services. We find that the presence of intermediaries increases welfare because the value of their services outweighs the additional margin charged.
L81|How Do Competition Policy and Data Brokers Shape Product Market Competition?|Abstract This paper empirically analyzes how a data broker affects competition in oligopolistic product markets. It examines a unique case concerning the two dominant Finnish food retail companies’ voluntary withdrawal from information exchange via a data broker. Moreover, the companies jointly approached the Finnish antitrust authority, originating an investigation whether their prior horizontal information exchange was illegal. This resulted in the permanent termination of a data broker’s business in the Finnish food retail sector. The empirical analysis employs quarterly data from the food retail sector of the old EU15 countries for 2005–2017. The difference-in-differences model is used to explore the competitive impacts of a termination of vertical and horizontal information exchange via a data broker in the Finnish food retail sector. Data suggest that competition was less fierce and product prices higher after the termination of information exchange via a data broker. Longer-term evidence on the price increase in the absence of a data broker is inconclusive. Furthermore, discontinuation of data exchange from the downstream to the upstream firms facilitated downstream bargaining power and generated a long-term increase in the gap between retail and producer prices.
L81|E-commerce Development and Entrepreneurship in the People’s Republic of China|We utilize an e-commerce development indicator in tandem with big data to measure the variations of e-commerce development across counties in the People’s Republic of China and assess its impact on entrepreneurship in both rural and urban areas. We find that households living in counties with higher levels of e-commerce development are more likely to run their own businesses. Further study indicates that e-commerce development not only significantly increases the entry of new startups but also decreases the exit of incumbent businesses. We also find that e-commerce development induces sectoral change of household entrepreneurship. It promotes entrepreneurship in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors, but reduces the entrepreneurship in the retail, hotel, and catering sectors. We also show that e-commerce prosperity fuels entrepreneurship by alleviating the financial constraints and moderates the reliance of household entrepreneurship on social networks.
L81|Vertical Contracting with Endogenous Market Structure|A manufacturer chooses the optimal retail market structure and bilaterally and secretly contracts with each (homogeneous) retailer. In a classic framework without asymmetric information, the manufacturer sells through a single exclusive retailer in order to eliminate the opportunism problem. When retailers are privately informed about their (common) marginal cost, however, the number of competing retailers also affects their information rents and the manufacturer may prefer an oligopolistic market structure. We characterize how the manufacturer’s production technology, the elasticity of final demand, and the size of the market affect the optimal number of retailers. Our results arise both with price and quantity competition, and also when retailers’ costs are imperfectly correlated.
L81|M&A Advisory and the Merger Review Process|Two firms propose a merger to the antitrust authority. They are uninformed about the efficiencies generated by the merger, but can hire an expert to gather information on their behalf. The authority is also uninformed about the merger's efficiencies, but can run a costly internal investigation to learn them. We analyze the effect of the disclosure of the expert's contract on consumer welfare, and show that consumers are not necessarily better off with disclosure. This negative effect hinges on a free-riding problem between expert and authority in the information acquisition game, and is more relevant in highly competitive industries.
L81|How Importers May Hedge Demand Uncertainty|This paper examines how firms deal with demand uncertainty when importing intermediate goods takes time, and orders have to be placed before the realization of demand is known. We consider two strategies to hedge this uncertainty: building up inventory of imported goods, and relying on more expensive domestic supplies to cover peak demand. Which strategy is optimal depends on the price of imported relative to domestic goods, and on the degree of demand uncertainty. We also show that there are relative import prices and degrees of demand uncertainty for which the firm chooses not to hedge uncertainty and may thus stock out. The optimal hedging strategy implies a non-monotonic relationship between firm-level output volatility and the relative import price.
L81|Vertical integration in the e-commerce sector|This paper studies vertical integration of a retailer and an operator in the e-commerce sector. It shows first that the comparison between independent oligopoly and integrated monopoly involves a tradeoff between competition and double marginalization which will have the opposite effect. With linear demand we need at least 3 firms (upstream and downstream) for the independent oligopoly to yield larger surplus. With constant elasticity demand, on the other hand, this is always true. Second it considers a setting where the number of firms is endogenous and determined such that gross profits cover fixed costs. While the integration of a single retailer-delivery operator pair may initially be welfare improving, the resulting market structure may not be sustainable. Furthermore, there exist a range of fixed costs for which the integrated monopoly emerges (following a single integration) and is welfare inferior to the initial independent equilibrium even when the reduction in the number of fixed costs is taken into account. Within this setting it also shows that multiple integration is typically welfare superior (for a given total number of firms) to the integration of a single retailer-delivery operator. Third and last, it considers an extension wherein customers differ according to their location, urban or rural, involving di¤erent delivery costs. It shows that urban integration is more likely to have an adverse effect on welfare than full integration.
L81|Airbnb in Paris : quel impact sur l'industrie hôtelière?|In many cities around the world short-term housing platforms have become an alternative in the eyes of tourists. These new players, led by Airbnb, are disrupting the market, raising concerns from the hotel industry and public authorities. Using data from hotels and Airbnb in Paris, this paper proposes a new methodology for measuring the competitive pressure exerted by Airbnb on the hotel industry. The results indicate that an increase in the number of Airbnb hosts close to a hotel leads the hotel to reduce its price. This effect is amplified on weekend evenings.

L81|Regulating the digital economy: Are we moving towards a 'win-win' or a 'lose-lose'?|The digital economy has been growing by leaps and bounds in recent years, mostly as a result of new digital technologies that are promoting a global transformation to industry 4.0. The resulting expansion of digital trade has sparked off a political and policy controversy on digital economy and e-commerce, where its boundaries stand and how best to regulate it. Policy discussions on the topic however do not take into account the true expanse of digital trade, which encompasses hardware, software, networks, platforms, applications and data as its core elements, and stretches the boundaries of e-commerce policy to trade in goods, services and intellectual property protection. This article focuses on the challenges in regulating the digital economy, with a particular focus on development, and offers a discussion of the interdependency between the economic, social, personal and developmental aspects of digital trade for developing countries. Section II opens with a detailed discussion on key digital technologies and their plausible impacts on employment globally and industrial catch-up of particular importance to developing countries, to highlight the divisive nature of digital technologies. Section III then analyses the unfulfilled promise of a pro-development perspective at the WTO looking at how multilateralism has currently failed e-commerce. In this section, the incoherence between digital realities and the policy debates at the WTO are presented to show how the institution might have become a means to legitimise national policies of industrialised countries on a universal level in this important area of policymaking. Norm-setting through FTAs is also analysed at length in section III of the article, which provides a comprehensive review of the plurilateral and bilateral policy developments in e-commerce. The ramifications for developing countries are discussed in the form of a couple of examples. Section IV presents some options for developing countries for the future at the national and international level.
L81|Bargaining at Retail Stores: Evidence from Vienna|The optimality of trading mechanisms has long been a subject of interest in economics, yet there exists little empirical evidence regarding which mechanisms of trade are deployed in practice. Our audit study of retail stores in Vienna documents previously unknown and important facts. Stores agree to a discount off of the posted price approximately 40% of the time. Discounts are more likely to be granted by small-scale firms, for higher-priced products, and for non-sale items. Our findings are consistent with the predictions of a principle-agent model in which a firm decides whether to augment posted prices with bargaining concessions.
L81|Platform-mediated reputation systems in the sharing economy and incentives to provide service quality: the case of ridesharing services|Sharing economy platforms often use reputation systems to actively perform a ‘regulatory’/control role, by excluding from access to the platform users with ratings below a given threshold. We provide a multiple case study analysis of 9 platforms and investigate through a simple inter-temporal choice model the effect of the design of this specific application of online rating systems on users/providers’ incentives to ensure a high level of service quality. Compliance with the platform’s behavioural rules is imperfect even with perfect reviews and even if riders cannot switch across platforms. It can be increased by linking remuneration to performance and by increasing the opportunity cost of reintegrating the endowment of reputation, also by influencing providers’ perception of the magnitude of this cost. Thus, there may be an efficiency rationale for the controversial choice to willingly preserve riders’ uncertainty as to the operation of the algorithm and for portability of reputation.
L81|The impact of broadband and other infrastructure on the location of new business establishments|This paper analyzes the impact of broadband infrastructure, along with a range of other local characteristics such as motorways and other infrastructure, availability of human capital, and access to third‐level educational facilities, on the location of new business establishments. The sample period spans the introduction and recent history of broadband in Ireland. The results indicate that the availability of broadband infrastructure is a significant determinant, but its effects may be mediated by the presence of sufficiently high human capital in an area.

L81|Platform economies and urban planning: Airbnb and regulated deregulation in London|The ‘sharing economy’ has become a new buzzword in urban life as digital technology companies set up online platforms to link together people and un- or underutilised assets with those seeking to rent them for short periods of time. While cloaked under the rhetoric of ‘sharing’, the exchanges they foster are usually profit-driven. These economic activities are having profound impacts on urban environments as they disrupt traditional forms of hospitality, transport, service industry and housing. While critical debates have focused on the challenges that sharing economy activities bring to existing labour and economic practices, it is necessary to acknowledge that they also have increasingly significant impacts on planning policy and urban governance. Using the case of Airbnb in London, this article looks at how these sharing or platform economy companies are involved in encouraging governments to change existing regulations, in this case by deregulating short-term letting. This has important implications for planning enforcement. We examine how the challenges around obtaining data to enforce new regulations are being addressed by local councils who struggle to balance corporate interests with public good. Finally, we address proposals for using algorithms and big data as means of urban governance and argue that the schism between regulation and enforcement is opening up new digitally mediated spaces of informal practices in cities.
L81|What Should Be the EU’s Approach to Global Trade?|Abstract For a global player like the EU, it must adequately respond to US unilateral actions and not give in to threats in order to preserve its credibility. However, it is not in its interest to let trade conflicts escalate and be drawn into trade wars. It is worth noting that through the bilateral rules established in the context of a comprehensive trade agreement, the EU not only influences global norms and standards but that those in turn feed back into the EU’s economic order in a way that traditional trade agreements have not. They can therefore either reinforce the European model or weaken it.
L81|The Initial Effects of EMV Migration on Chargebacks in the United States|To reduce counterfeit fraud in the card-present environment, the United States started migrating to EMV chip technology in the mid-2010s. Since October 2015, merchants have been liable for counterfeit fraud committed using EMV cards if the merchants had not adopted EMV chip-readable terminals. In particular, merchants are held liable through chargebacks. {{p}} This study examines the initial effects of the EMV liability shift on fraud chargeback and merchant loss rates using data from merchant processors and PIN debit networks. Combined with gross fraud rates—overall fraud rates regardless of who incurs fraud losses—estimated in other studies, the results of our study suggest that merchants have faced a significantly higher share of fraud losses since the shift; however, this spike will decline if merchants continue to adopt EMV. Merchant fraud loss rates for signature-based transactions in the card-present channel increased sixfold, but the rates significantly vary between magnetic stripe and chip-to-chip transactions. While merchant fraud loss rates for magnetic stripe transactions are over 9 basis points in value for all merchants combined and vary across merchant categories, the rates for chip-to-chip transactions are very low, around 0.02 basis points, across all merchant categories. Because the gross fraud rates for magnetic-stripe transactions did not increase after the liability shift, our results suggest that the higher merchant fraud loss rates for magnetic-stripe transactions are mainly due to the liability shift. {{p}} Compared with signature-based transactions, fraud chargeback rates for PIN debit transactions in the card-present channel are much lower. Our results suggest that both EMV and PIN are effective in reducing merchant fraud loss rates. However, we need detailed gross fraud rates to examine how effective EMV and PIN are in reducing fraud more generally in the card-present channel. {{p}} Our results for card-not-present fraud chargeback and merchant loss rates are mixed. Both rates increased for some merchant categories, but the rates for all merchants combined actually decreased in our data. This decline is likely due to the underrepresentation of signature-based CNP transactions in our data. The gross fraud rates for card-not-present transactions increased over the same period, and merchants are generally liable for card-not-present fraud.
L81|“Free” Internet Content: Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and the Sources of Economic Growth|The Internet has evolved from Web 1.0, with static web pages and limited interactivity, to Web 2.0, with dynamic content that relies on user engagement. This change increased production costs significantly, but the price charged for Internet content has generally remained the same: zero. Because no transaction records the “purchase” of this content, its value is not reflected in measured growth and productivity. To capture the contribution of the “free” Internet, we model the provision of “free” content as a barter transaction between the content users and the content creators, and we value this transaction at production cost. When we incorporate this implicit transaction into U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), productivity, and household accounts, we find that including “free” content raises estimates of growth, but not nearly enough to reverse the recent slowdown.
L81|Spatial dispersion of retail margins: evidence from Turkish agricultural prices|The farmer share of retail prices is shown to be about 16%, corresponding to about 84% of a distribution share, on average across agricultural products and regions within Turkey. The share of transportation costs in retail prices is only about 7%, while the share of retail margins is about 77% of retail prices. The dispersion of retail prices across regions is shown to be mostly due to local wages and variable markups, while the contribution of traded‐input prices is relatively small. Accordingly, the high dispersion of farmer prices across locations is not reflected in the dispersion of retail prices due to the high contribution of retail margins. These retail margins are also shown to account for about one third of the consumer welfare dispersion across regions and more than half of the consumer welfare dispersion across products.
L81|Redistributive Effects of Gasoline Prices|Abstract Consumers face significantly different gasoline prices across gas stations. Using gasoline price data obtained from 98,753 gas stations within the U.S., it is shown that such differences can be explained by a model utilizing the gasoline demand of consumers depending on their income and commuting distance/time, where the pricing strategies of both gas stations and refiners are taken into account. The corresponding welfare analysis shows that there are significant redistributive effects of gasoline price changes among consumers, where the welfare costs of an increase in gasoline prices are found to be higher for lower income consumers.
L81|Evaluation of best price clauses in online hotel bookings|We analyze the best price clauses (BPCs) of online travel agents (OTAs) using meta-search price data of nearly 30,000 hotels in different countries. We find that BPCs influence the pricing and availability of hotel rooms across online sales channels. In particular, hotels publish their offers more often at Booking.com when the OTA does not use the narrow BPC, and also tend to promote the direct online channel more actively. Moreover, the abolition of Booking.com’s narrow BPC is associated with the direct channel of chain hotels having the strictly lowest price more often.
L81|Convenience pricing in online retailing: Evidence from Amazon.com|To expedite payments, firms use convenience pricing strategies. A price is considered convenient if it can be paid with few coins. Convenient prices are well understood in offline retailing, but not online. This article fills the gap, examining an original panel dataset more than 2.5 million observations of book prices from Amazon.com. We provide empirical evidence supporting two claims. First in a static setup, more convenient prices are more likely to be set. Second in a dynamic setup, more convenient prices are more rigid. Emphasizing the role of convenience, this work sheds new light on price setting in online retailing.
L81|With a little help from my friends: Multinational retailers and China's consumer market penetration|We investigate the supply-side repercussions on Chinese imports after the entry of multinational retailers in China. We exploit sector- and origin-country level import data for a panel of Chinese cities between 1997 and 2012, and differentiate between retailer and non retailer goods and across countries of origin of imports. We find that international global retail presence in Chinese cities produces a disproportionate rise in retail good imports from the retailers' country of origin. Our results point to a trade-cost reducing role of Western retailers that make it easier for foreign retail-good producers from their home country to export to China. Global retailers then act as a bridgehead for the penetration of the Chinese market by producers from their home country, in a way that goes beyond higher sales of imported retail goods by the retailers themselves.
L81|Inside the engine room of digital platforms: Reviews, ratings, and recommendations|The rise and success of digital platforms (such as Airbnb, Amazon, Booking, Expedia, Ebay, and Uber) rely, to a large extent, on their ability to address two major issues. First, to effectively facilitate transactions, platforms need to resolve the problem of trust in the implicit or explicit promises made by the counterparties; they post reviews and ratings to pursue this objective. Second, as platforms operate in marketplaces where information is abundant, they may guide their users towards the transactions that these users may have an interest in; recommender systems are meant to play this role. In this article, we elaborate on review, rating, and recommender systems. In particular, we examine how these systems generate network effects on platforms.
L81|Airbnb in Paris : quel impact sur l’industrie hôtelière?|In many cities around the world short-term housing platforms have become an alternative in the eyes of tourists. These new players, led by Airbnb, are disrupting the market, raising concerns from the hotel industry and public authorities. Using data from hotels and Airbnb in Paris, this paper proposes a new methodology for measuring the competitive pressure exerted by Airbnb on the hotel industry. The results indicate that an increase in the number of Airbnb hosts close to a hotel leads the hotel to reduce its price. This effect is amplified on weekend evenings.
L81|Substitution Between Online Distribution Channels: Evidence from the Oslo Hotel Market|Using an exhaustive database of bookings in one large chain of hotels active in Oslo (2013-2016), we estimate a nested-logit demand model that allows us to evaluate substitution patterns between online distribution channels. Making use of the chains’ decision to delist from Expedia’s platform, we can then compare simulated and actual effects of such an event on prices and market shares and identify ways to improve on simulated counterfactual outcomes.
L81|Determinants of Economies of Scope in Retail|This paper studies the determinants of economies of scope in retail using a dynamic framework and novel product and store data. We estimate store productivity and consumers’ perceived shopping quality and analyze their relationship with intensive and extensive product margins, performance and welfare. We find that high productivity stores offer more products and sell more of each product. High quality stores offer fewer products and sell more of top products. Counterfactual experiments show that productivity innovations increase product variety, especially when demand uncertainty is low and in the long run. Higher shopping quality increases consumer surplus even if stores specialize.
L81|Measuring Market Power in Gasoline Retailing: A Market- or Station Phenomenon?|Applying detailed consecutive daily micro data at the gasoline station level from Sweden we estimate a structural model to uncover the degree of competition in the gasoline retail market. We find that retailers do exercise market power, but despite the high upstream concentration, the market power is very limited on the downstream level. The degree of market power varies with both the distance to the nearest station and the local density of gasoline stations. A higher level of service tends to raise a seller’s market power; self-service stations have close to no market power. Contractual form and brand identity also seem to matter. We find a clear result: local station characteristics significantly affect the degree of market power. Our results indicate that local differences in station characteristics can more than offset the average market power found for the whole market.
L81|What Do You Buy When No One’s Watching? The Effect of Self-Service Checkouts on the Composition of Sales in Retail|Buying items that are unhealthy or are of a private nature may carry a stigma and cause embarrassment. I analyze whether the anonymity provided by self-service checkouts changes customers' shopping patterns in grocery stores. I look at a natural experiment where two stores in a grocery-chain implement self-service checkouts. Using a triple difference estimator, comparing the sales of stigma items to the sales of mundane items and to the sales of a group of control stores, I find that the sales of stigma items increase by 10-15 percent. The increase comes from the product categories candy, chips, soda, ready-made food and alcohol. I find that the increase is caused by existing customers buying more, rather than from self-service checkouts changing the customer base. However, fully converting to self-service seems to scare away some customers and decreases overall sales.

L81|Vertical integration in the e-commerce sector|This paper studies vertical integration of a retailer and an operator in the e-commerce sector. It shows first that the comparison between independent oligopoly and integrated monopoly involves a tradeoff between competition and double marginalization which will have the opposite effect. With linear demand we need at least 3 firms (upstream and downstream) for the independent oligopoly to yield larger surplus. With constant elasticity demand, on the other hand, this is always true. Second it considers a setting where the number of firms is endogenous and determined such that gross profits cover fixed costs. While the integration of a single retailer-delivery operator pair may initially be welfare improving, the resulting market structure may not be sustainable. Furthermore, there exist a range of fixed costs for which the integrated monopoly emerges (following a single integration) and is welfare inferior to the initial independent equilibrium even when the reduction in the number of fixed costs is taken into account. Within this setting it also shows that multiple integration is typically welfare superior (for a given total number of firms) to the integration of a single retailer-delivery operator. Third and last, it considers an extension wherein customers differ according to their location, urban or rural, involving di¤erent delivery costs. It shows that urban integration is more likely to have an adverse effect on welfare than full integration.
L81|Success of firm strategies in e-commerce|The choice of an appropriate e-commerce strategy is crucial for the survival of online stores in B2C e-commerce business. We use a comprehensive data set from the Austrian price search engine geizhals.at to identify successful e-commerce strategies. An e-commerce strategy is a set of choices including the listing decision, availability decision, and decisions on price and shipping cost. We apply cluster analysis to identify the different strategies that have been used by online retailers. Using various success measures such as revenue, clicks, market share, and the survival of firms, as dependent variables in our regression analyses, we present empirical evidence on the effectiveness of different e-commerce strategies.
L81|Power Outages, its Economic Cost and Firm Performance: Evidence from Ethiopia|Unreliable supply of electricity is the main constraints to doing business in Ethiopia. This paper examined how firms in Ethiopia respond to power outage employing the World Bank Enterprise Survey data. The result shows that, in response to power outages, firms in Ethiopia self-generate electricity. While there is no evidence suggesting outsourcing and improved energy hypothesis, power outages were found to affect the firms’ productivity negatively. From 2011 to 2015 firms’ cost of production rose by 15% due to power outage. This effect varies positively with output level suggesting that outage is costly particularly for large firms.
L81|Foreign Multinationals and Vietnamese Firm Exports, 2010-2013| This paper examines the role foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs) played in Vietnamese firm exports during 2010-2013. Consistent with patterns observed in commodity export data, MNEs are found to account for the majority of firm exports during this period. Wholly-foreign MNEs (WFs), which accounted for the vast majority of MNE production in Vietnam, accounted for most MNE exports. Both WFs and MNE joint ventures (JV) made larger direct contributions to exports than to production or employment, as observed in other Asian developing economies. There was a strong tendency for WFs to have the highest export propensities (export-turnover ratios) followed by JVs. Manufacturing firms exported over four-fifths of the total in most years. Tobit estimates that controlled for the effects of firm size, capital intensity, liquidity, location, and industry affiliation for manufacturers indicate WFs also had the highest conditional export propensities, followed by JVs, private firms, while export propensities tended to be similar in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private firms in most industries. Because Vietnam imposes few ownership restrictions on MNEs, these results imply that MNEs generally prefer to export from WFs rather than JVs, and are consistent with previous results for Thailand and Indonesia, for example.
L81|Foreign Ownership and Exports of Thai Manufacturing Plants by Industry in 1996| This paper investigates how foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs) contributed to exports by Thai manufacturing plants at the industry level in 2006. The mean export-sales ratio (export propensities) in heavily-foreign MNEs with foreign ownership shares of 90 percent or more exceeded 50 percent and heavily-foreign MNEs accounted for one-third of plant exports. Minority-foreign (10-49% foreign shares) and majority-foreign (50-89% shares) MNEs combined to account for another one-fifth of plant exports but had lower export propensities, about 30 percent and 40 percent, respectively. The mean export propensity for local plants in 20 sample industries was only 15 percent. In large samples of all 20 industries combined, econometric estimates controlling for industry affiliation with intercept dummies as well as the effects of the scale, age, factor intensities or labor productivity, and BOI-promotion status of plants also indicated that export propensities were the highest in heavily-foreign MNEs, followed by majority-foreign MNEs, minority-foreign MNEs, and lastly by local plants. Moreover, ownership-related differences in export propensities were highly significant statistically. When inter-industry heterogeneity was more fully accounted for by allowing slope coefficients as well as intercepts to differ among the 20 industries, export propensities were the highest in heavily-foreign MNEs and significantly higher than in local plants in 12 industries. However, differences among MNE ownership groups were usually insignificant and MNE-local differentials in export propensities differed substantially among industries, suggesting it is important account for inter-industry heterogeneity as fully as possible.
L81|Search Frictions and Market Power in Negotiated Price Markets|This paper develops and estimates a search and bargaining model designed to measure the welfare loss associated with frictions in oligopoly markets with negotiated prices. We use the model to quantify the consumer surplus loss induced by the presence of search frictions in the Canadian mortgage market, and evaluate the relative importance of market power, inefficient allocation, and direct search costs in explaining the loss. Our results suggest that search frictions reduce consumer surplus by almost $20 per month per consumer, and that 17% of this reduction can be associated with discrimination, 30% with inefficient matching, and the remainder with the search cost.
L81|The Geographic Dispersion of Economic Shocks: Evidence from the Fracking Revolution: Comment|In the mid 2000s, shale-energy-rich U.S. counties experienced a sudden and significant economic shock resulting from energy extraction. While the resulting localized economic effects are relatively well understood, less is known about the geographic dispersion of the effects. We build upon an existing literature, most notably Feyrer, Mansur, and Sacerdote (2017), by examining the conditional economic effects of nearby energy production. Because energy-producing counties tend to be located near each other, producing counties experience inward economic spillovers from other nearby producing counties and this inflates the estimated effect of own-county production. Accounting for this, we identify smaller income effects of hydrocarbon production than Feyrer, Mansur, and Sacerdote (2017), limited to counties within 60-80 miles of the source of production. The proposed estimation strategy can be applied more generally to estimate the dispersion of multiple, simultaneously occurring economic shocks.
L81|E-commerce in Hungary: A Market Analysis|E-commerce is on the rise in Hungary, with significantly growing numbers of customers shopping online. This paper aims to identify the direct and indirect drivers of the double-digit growth rate, including the related macroeconomic indicators and the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI). Moreover, this study provides a deep insight into industry trends and outlooks, including high industry concentration and top industrial players. It also draws the profile of the typical online shopper and the dominant characteristics of online purchases. Development of e-commerce is robust, but there is still plenty of potential for growth and progress in Hungary.
L81|Patterns of domestic and cross-border e-commerce in Spain: A gravitational model approach|This paper presents econometric evidence on the determinants of domestic and cross-border e-commerce in Spain based on BBVA anonymised data. The paper applies the gravity model of trade to explain online credit card payment flows, using all private customer transactions of BBVA for Spain.
L81|The Scale and Scope of Online Retail|This paper studies the growth of online retail over the period 1999–2012, using confidential firm-product-level data for Canada. The revenue of online retailers is decomposed into the contributions of product scope (the number of product categories) and product scale (average revenue per product category). During this period of rapid online sales growth, product scope dropped dramatically from an average of 59 product categories per firm in 1999 to 5 product categories per firm in 2012. Using data on Amazon.ca's expansion, I find suggestive evidence that this reduction in product scope may have been driven by increased competition in the online retail sector.
L81|Adjustment of the Regional Indicator of Income in Retail Trade|INEGI publishes, on a monthly basis, national indexes for sector, subsector and industry group of wholesale and retail trade, and state indexes for commerce sector based on information from the Monthly Survey of Commercial Establishments, EMEC. Although the sample design of this survey is representative at the national level and by industry group of economic activity of the commerce sector, the aggregation of state indexes at industry group level, necessary to construct regional indicators, requires an adjustment in the weighting of the observations. This document presents an aggregation methodology to build regional indexes based on retail trade state income data calculated from the information of EMEC databases. Moreover, a measure of the relative size of real income by region is proposed, it identifies those subsectors of retail trade with greatest contribution to the growth of regional income.
L81|Bargaining at Retail Stores: Evidence from Vienna|The optimality of trading mechanisms has long been a subject of interest in economics, yet there exists little empirical evidence regarding which mechanisms of trade are deployed in practice. Our audit study of retail stores in Vienna documents previously unknown and important facts. Stores agree to a discount off of the posted price approximately 40% of the time. Discounts are more likely to be granted by small-scale firms, for higher-priced products, and for non-sale items. Our findings are consistent with the predictions of a principle-agent model in which a firm decides whether to augment posted prices with bargaining concessions.

L81|The Effects of Mandatory Disclosure of Supermarket Prices|We study how mandatory online disclosure of supermarket prices affects prices and price dispersion in brick-and-mortar stores. Using data collected before and after a transparency regulation went into effect in the Israeli food retail market, multiple complementary control groups and relying on a differences-in-differences research design, we document a sharp decline in price dispersion and a 4% to 5% drop in prices following the transparency regulation. The price drop varied across stores and products; it was smaller among private-label products than among branded products, and it was smaller among stores and products that were likely to have been associated with more intense search patterns even before prices became transparent (e.g., products in heavy-discount chains; popular products; products that meet stringent kosher requirements). Finally, we show that prices declined as more consumers used price-comparison websites, and we highlight the role of media coverage in encouraging retailers to set lower prices.
L81|Price or Variety? An Evaluation of Mergers Effects in Grocery Retailing|Assortment decisions are key strategic instruments for firms responding to local market conditions. We assess this claim by studying the effect of a national merger between two large Dutch supermarket chains on prices and on the depth as well as composition of assortment. We adopt a difference-in-differences strategy that exploits local variation in the merger’s effects, controlling for selection on observables when defining our control group through a matching procedure. We show that the local change in competitive conditions due to the merger did not affect individual products’ prices but it led the merging parties to reposition their assortment and increase average category prices. While the low-variety and low-price target’s stores reduced the depth of their assortment when in direct competition with the acquirer’s stores, the latter increased their product variety. By analyzing the effect of the merger on category prices, we find that the target most likely dropped high priced products, while the acquirer added more of them. Thus, the merging firms reposition their product offerings in order to avoid cannibalization and lessen local competition. Further, we show that other dimensions of heterogeneity, such as market concentration, whether a divestiture was imposed by the Dutch competition authority, and the re-branding strategy of the target stores, are important for explaining the post-merger dynamics. A simple theoretical model of local-market variety competition explains most of our findings.
L81|Innovation and Distribution: A General Equilibrium Model of Manufacturing and Retailing|I propose a general equilibrium model of competition in manufacturing and retailing. Relative to the counterfactual of direct sales by manufacturers, the retail sector increases manufacturing entry and produced variety. Although double marginalization in the sales channel raises prices and hurts consumers in quantity, the retail sector increases variety and convenience, both valued positively. Pricing power in the vertical channel reflects surplus or scarcity of manufactured substitutes relative to retailer store size. Finally, the size of the retail sector is a constant fraction of the total economy across nations of differing size and wealth.
L81|Inventory Behavior, Demand, and Productivity in Retail|This paper studies the factors underlying the heterogeneity in inventory behavior and performance across retail stores. We use a dynamic model of multi-product retailers and local competition to estimate store productivity and consumers' perceived quality of the shopping experience, and we analyze their relationship with inventory behavior and product variety. Using novel and detailed data on Swedish stores and their products, we find that stores learn from demand to improve future productivity. Store productivity is the main primitive that increases inventory turnover and product variety, and this increase is larger for stores with already high inventory turnover. Stores in small markets with intense competition from rivals have higher inventory turnover. Consumers in large markets and markets with large investments in technology benefit from a broader product variety. Counterfactual experiments show that the increase in inventory turnover due to innovations in productivity is three times greater when uncertainty in demand is reduced by 30 percent. Our analysis highlights important trade-offs between productivity and demand that allow retailers to reach high levels of inventory turnover and offer a broad product variety to consumers.
L81|The effect of big data on recommendation quality: The example of internet search|Are there economies of scale to data in internet search? This paper is first to use real search engine query logs to empirically investigate how data drives the quality of internet search results. We find evidence that the quality of search results improve with more data on previous searches. Moreover, our results indicate that the type of data matters as well: personalized information is particularly valuable as it massively increases the speed of learning. We also provide some evidence that factors not directly related to data such as the general quality of the applied algorithms play an important role. The suggested methods to disentangle the effect of data from other factors driving the quality of search results can be applied to assess the returns to data in various recommendation systems in e-commerce, including product and information search. We also discuss the managerial, privacy, and competition policy implications of our findings.

L81|Food Deserts and the Causes of Nutritional Inequality|We study the causes of â€œnutritional inequalityâ€ : why the wealthy eat more healthfully than the poor in the United States. Exploiting supermarket entry, household moves to healthier neighborhoods, and purchasing patterns among households with identical local supply, we reject that neighborhood environments contribute meaningfully to nutritional inequality. Using a structural demand model, we find that exposing low-income households to the same products and prices available to high-income households reduces nutritional inequality by only nine percent, while the remaining 91 percent is driven by differences in demand. These findings counter the common notion that policies to reduce supply inequities, such as â€œfood deserts,â€ could play an important role in reducing nutritional inequality. By contrast, the structural results predict that means-tested subsidies for healthy food could eliminate nutritional inequality at a fiscal cost of about 15 percent of the annual budget for the U.S. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
L81|The Geography of Poverty and Nutrition: Food Deserts and Food Choices across the United States|"We study the causes of ""nutritional inequality"": why the wealthy tend to eat more healthfully than the poor in the U.S. Using two event study designs exploiting entry of new supermarkets and households' moves to healthier neighborhoods, we reject that neighborhood environments have economically meaningful effects on healthy eating. Using a structural demand model, we find that exposing low-income households to the same food availability and prices experienced by high-income households would reduce nutritional inequality by only 9%, while the remaining 91% is driven by differences in demand. In turn, these income-related demand differences are partially explained by education, nutrition knowledge, and regional preferences. These findings contrast with discussions of nutritional inequality that emphasize supply-side issues such as food deserts."
L81|Regulation of Geo-blocking: does it address the problem of low intraEU iTrade?|The goal of the article is to critically verify and to discuss main areas necessary for increasing intraEU iTrade. To achieve this aim, the legal analysis of the regulation is confronted with the econometric approach identifying the main determinants of cross-border e-commerce. The model is based on data from a survey conducted among 6901 Polish business owners in 2017. Our hypotheses include the following issues: (1) the main barrier of intraEU iTrade is the low level of integration of digital technologies by SMEs; therefore (2) the character of the impact of legal means adopted in the regulation 2018/302 on the development of transnational service provision and entrepreneurship based on e-commerce is doubtful. We argue that the introduction of more and more advanced requirements by EC will only reduce their interest in developing business abroad through cross-border e-commerce and result in losing the opportunities linked to the development of digital economy.
L81|The Effects of German Wind and Solar Electricity on French Spot Price Volatility: An Empirical Investigation| We examine the relationship between German wind and solar electricity and French spot price volatility. Using hourly data, we find that French imports from Germany driven by German wind and solar electricity sometimes decrease, sometimes increase the volatility of French spot prices. These two opposing effects depend on the shape of the French supply function and on the French demand. We, therefore, estimate different coefficients for imports depending on different demand levels. We acknowledge the endogeneity problem in identifying these effects and employ instrumental variable techniques to circumvent this problem. Our results show the urgent need for further coordination of national energy policies in order to reduce the potential for negative spill over effects of nationally driven energy policies in neighbouring countries as European electricity markets are becoming more integrated.
L81|Local market structure and consumer prices: Evidence from a retail merger|This paper analyzes the effects of a merger between a German supermarket chain and a soft discounter on consumer prices. We exploit geographic variation in prices within retail chains and brands and use a difference-in-differences estimator to compare regional markets with a change in market structure to a control group in unaffected markets. Our results indicate that both insiders and outsiders raised average prices after the merger, particularly in regions with high expected change in retail concentration. In contrast, we estimate price declines in regions that did not experience a rise in concentration but were potentially affected by cost savings within the merged entity. We also provide evidence that remedies imposed by competition authorities were not sufficient to o set anti-competitive effects.

The suggested methods to disentangle the effect of data from other factors driving the quality of search results can be applied to assess the returns to data in various recommendation systems in e-commerce, including product and information search. We also discuss the managerial, privacy, and competition policy implications of our findings.
L81|Assessing e-commerce productivity for French micro firms using propensity score matching|"The benefits of e-commerce are apparent not only for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and large firms, but also for micro firms. Hence, implementing e-sales for micro firms is worth exploring. This study examines the relationship between the use of e-commerce and productivity implications on micro firms in France using Propensity Score Matching (PSM) for the year 2012. Data used in the analysis is based on community survey ""ICT & e-commerce"" for micro firms. The main objective of using PSM is to assess productivity between, on the one hand, e-selling micro firms and, on the other hand, the non e-selling micro firms. The empirical results show that e-selling micro firms are more productive and have a higher turnover in 2012."
L81|Digitalization of Operations Management with Emotional and Intelligence Tools. Blockchain and IoT integration, the last disruption?|Digital advances and the emergence of disruptive technologies have dramatically changed the business models across sectors and operations economics. The scope of this paper is to contribute to analyze the current disruptive revolution in operations management in a digitalized global market focusing on the impact of blockchain technology and IoT integration. New intelligence tools and emotional analysis are contributing to add trust and promote digital expansion across different sectors. Given the high economic impact of the operations management on virtually all productive enterprises, the benefits of digitalizing operations have continuously increased productivity and enhanced international competitiveness. This paper studies the opportunities of what could be one of the last disruptions in operations management, the introduction of blockchain combined with IoT technology and emotional intelligence tools to automate, in a cryptographically verifiable process, activities in digital supply chain networks. Keywords: Blockchain, IoT, Supply Chain Network, Operations Management, Digital Policy Funding: The research leading to these results has received funding from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through SEMOLA project (TEC2015-68284-R) and from the Autonomous Region of Madrid through MOSI-AGIL-CM project (grant P2013/ICE-3019, cofunded by EU Structural Funds FSE and FEDER).
L81|Competition policy reform in Europe and Germany - Institutional change in the light of digitization|The ubiquitous process of digitization changes economic competition on markets in several ways and leads to the emergence of new business models. The increasing roles of digital platforms as well as data-driven markets represent two relevant examples. These developments challenge competition policy, which must consider the special economic characteristics of digital goods and markets. In Germany, national competition law was amended in 2017 in order to accommodate for digitization-driven changes in the economy and plans for further changes are already discussed. We review this institutional change from an economics perspective and argue that most of the reform's elements point into the right direction. However, some upcoming challenges may have been overlooked so far. Furthermore, we discuss whether European competition policy should follow the paragon of the German reform and amend its institutional framework accordingly. We find scope for reform particularly regarding data-driven markets, whereas platform economics appear to be already well-established.
L81|Digital connectivity & e-commerce: Overview of financing flows and examples of aid for trade support|Digital networks are an increasingly critical component of global trade. In 2017, the Global Review of Aid for Trade highlighted the importance of accessible and affordable connections for trade connectivity. Drawing extensively on information harvested in the Monitoring and Evaluation exercise in preparation for the Review, this paper analyses aid for trade for digital connectivity and e-commerce. Also presented in this paper are the types of issues and challenges faced in cross-border electronic transactions - an area in which demand for support is set to grow. The paper also surveys flows reported to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Creditor Reporting System. Funds disbursed to digital connectivity amounted to US$6.6 billion in concessional financing and US$8.3 billion in non-concessional financing in the period 2006-2016. The top providers of financing were the European Union, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the World Bank Group. The paper also highlights the various methodological difficulties encountered, and explains the need to further refine reporting definitions so as to better capture financing flows to digital connectivity and to understand how aid for trade is being used to leverage private sector financing for ICT. The analysis concludes by reviewing the catalytic role that aid for trade is playing in mobilizing private sector financing. Research for the 2017 Global Review suggests that both developing countries and donors view ICT connectivity as an area where demand for financing will grow in future.
L81|Hotel rankings of online travel agents, channel pricing and consumer protection|We investigate whether online travel agents (OTAs) assign hotels worse positions in their search results if these set lower hotel prices at other OTAs or on their own websites. We formally characterize how an OTA can use such a strategy to reduce price differentiation across distribution channels. Our empirical analysis shows that the position of a hotel in the search results of OTAs is better when the prices charged by the hotel on other channels are higher. This is consistent with the hypothesis that OTAs alter their search results to discipline hotels for aggressive prices on competing channels, and by this reduce search quality for consumers.
L81|Vertical Bargaining and Retail Competition: What Drives Countervailing Power?|This article investigates the effects of changes in market concentration on the equilibrium prices in a supply chain. Results are derived from a theoretical model of bilateral bargaining between upstream and downstream firms which allows for general forms of demand and retail competition. Whether countervailing buyer power arises, in the form of lower input prices following greater concentration downstream, depends on the pass‐through rate of input prices to retail prices. Countervailing buyer power generally does not translate into lower retail prices because of heightened market power at the retail level.
L81|Negative consumer value and loss leading|Large retailers competing with smaller stores that carry a narrower range can exercise market power by pricing below cost for some of their products. Below-cost pricing arises as an exploitative device rather than a predatory device (e.g., Chen and Rey, 2012). Unlike standard textbook models, we show that positive consumer value is not required in these frameworks. Large retailers can sell products offering consumers a negative value. We use this insight to revisit some classic issues in vertical relations.
L81|End of 9-endings, price recall, and price perceptions|Prices that end with 9, also known as psychological price points, are common, comprising about 70% of the retail prices. They are also more rigid than other prices. We take advantage of a natural experiment to document an emergence of a new price ending that has the same effects as 9-endings. In January 2014, the Israeli government passed a new regulation prohibiting the use of non 0-ending prices, bringing an end to 9-ending prices. We find that seven months after 9-ending prices have disappeared, 90-ending prices acquired the same status as 9-ending prices had before the new regulation was adopted. Thus, 90-ending prices became the new psychological price points, partially eliminating the regulation’s intended effect.

L81|Zukunft der Innenstädte? - Auswirkungen zunehmender Online-Käufe auf den stationären Einzelhandel und die Innenstädte|Demographischer Wandel, Innovationen innerhalb der Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologie und die Digitalisierung ändern das Kaufverhalten der Konsumenten zunehmend. Innerhalb der letzten zwei Jahrzehnte ist der E-Commerce in Deutschland ständig gewachsen und hat sich die Struktur des stationären Handels stark verändert. In der Folge nimmt die Versorgungsfunktion des stationären Handels in den Städten ab und macht diese zusehends weniger attraktiv. In einigen Regionen Deutschlands, vor allem in ländlichen Gegenden und in der Umgebung von Großstädten, leiden Kleinstädte unter diesen strukturellen Veränderungen der Handelslandschaft. Immer häufiger wird in der Öffentlichkeit die Frage nach der Verödung der (Innen-)Städte gestellt. Mit diesem Arbeitspapier wird eine breite Informationsgrundlage geschaffen, die Motive für den Innenstadtbesuch bzw. für den Kauf in Geschäftsstätten des stationären Einzelhandels, das gegenwärtige Online-Kaufverhalten, Prognosen zur zukünftigen Entwicklung des E-Commerce und schließlich Handlungshinweise, wie auf diese grundlegenden Änderungen reagiert werden kann, umfasst. Die Handlungshinweise richten sich an Unternehmen des Einzelhandels, ihre Verbände und Interessengemeinschaften, ebenso wie an Kammern, Immobilienbesitzer und an die öffentliche Verwaltung.
L81|Regionale Erreichbarkeit von ausgewählten Fachärzten, Apotheken, ambulanten Pflegediensten und weiteren ausgewählten Medizindienstleistungen in Deutschland: Abschätzung auf Basis des Thünen-Erreichbarkeitsmodells|Die Erreichbarkeit von Infrastrukturen der Daseinsvorsorge spielt sowohl für Standort-entscheidungen als auch für die individuelle Lebenssituation der Bürger eine wichtige Rolle, denn Erreichbarkeitsverhältnisse bestimmen neben der Qualität des Infrastrukturangebots den regionalen Versorgungsgrad mit Infrastruktur. Damit sind sie ein wichtiger Faktor der regionalen Entwicklung. Auch für die Diskussion über die Sicherung der Daseinsvorsorge sind aktuelle Informationen über die Erreichbarkeit von Einrichtungen der Daseinsvorsorge notwendig, um sich vor dem Hintergrund des normativen Anspruches der Aufrechterhaltung gleichwertiger Lebensverhältnisse im Bundesgebiet ein realistisches Bild über die derzeitige Situation als Ausgangsbasis für ggf. notwendige Politikinterventionen machen zu können. Vor diesem Hintergrund befasst sich die vorliegende Studie mit der Abschätzung der regionalen Erreichbarkeit von Ärzten, Krankenhäusern, Apotheken und ambulanten Pflegediensten nach Sozialgesetzbuch Elftes Buch (SGB XI) in Deutschland als - insbesondere in ländlichen Räumen - wichtige Schlüsseldienstleistungen für die Versorgung der Bürger. Dazu wird auf Basis eines rasterbasierten GIS-Erreichbarkeitsmodells ein einfacher generischer Erreichbarkeitsindikator ermittelt, der Rückschlüsse auf die Grundversorgungssituation flächendeckend für Deutschland ermöglicht.
L81|Incentives through inventory control in supply chains|The paper shows that taking inventory control out of the hands of competitive or exclusive retailers and assigning it to a manufacturer increases the value of a supply chain especially for goods whose demand is highly volatile. This is because doing so solves incentive distortions that arise when retailers have to allocate inventory across sales periods, and thus allows for better intertemporal price discrimination. Assigning inventory control to a manufacturer is also shown to have effects on total inventory and social welfare.
L81|Wettbewerbsregeln für das Digitale Zeitalter - Die Ökonomik personalisierter Daten, Verbraucherschutz und die 9. GWB-Novelle|Die Digitalisierung der Wirtschaftsbeziehungen stellt die Wettbewerbspolitik vor erhebliche Herausforderungen. Um diesen zu begegnen, soll das Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen (GWB) mit Hilfe der 9. Novelle fit gemacht werden für das digitale Zeitalter. Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt eine Übersicht über die wesentlichen Änderungen der deutschen Wettbewerbsregeln und diskutiert ausgewählte, die digitale Ökonomie betreffende Änderungen vor dem Hintergrund des aktuellen Standes der Wirtschaftstheorie. Dabei wird deutlich, dass die 9. Novelle in einigen Bereichen eine Verbesserung der Wettbewerbspolitik in digitalisierten Märkten ermöglicht, in anderen Bereichen jedoch zu kurz greift. Schließlich werden drei Bereiche des andauernden Digitalisierungsprozesses skizziert, von denen zu erwarten ist, dass sie die Wettbewerbspolitik in den nächsten Jahren vor neue Herausforderungen stellen werden.
L81|Markets Take Breaks: Dynamic Price Competition with Opening Hours|We study price cycles in the German retail gasoline market. We extend existing models of Bertrand competition by product differentiation, firm size and business hours. With sufficiently low product differentiation, there exists a unique subgame perfect equilibrium featuring Edgeworth price cycles. We test the model's predictions using an extensive data set. Last, we evaluate policy interventions and show that restrictions on price setting or increased market transparency harm consumer welfare.
L81|Evaluation of best price clauses in hotel booking|We analyze the best price clauses (BPCs) of online travel agents (OTAs) using meta-search price data of more than 45,000 hotels in different countries. Although OTAs apparently have not changed their standard commission rates following the partial ban of BPCs in Europe, we find that BPCs do influence the pricing and availability of hotel rooms across online sales channels. In particular, the abolition of Booking.com's narrow BPC is associated with the hotels' direct channel being the price leader more often. Moreover, hotels make rooms more often available at Booking.com when it does not use the narrow BPC.
L81|The effect on CO2 emissions of taxing truck distance in retail transports|To finance transportation infrastructure and to address social and environmental negative externalities of road transports, several countries have recently introduced or consider a distance based tax on trucks. In competitive retail and transportation markets, such tax can be expected to lower the demand and thereby reduce CO2 emissions of road transports. However, as we show in this paper, such tax might also slow down the transition towards e-tailing. Considering that previous research indicates that a consumer switching from brick-and-mortar shopping to e-tailing reduces her CO2 emissions substantially, the direction and magnitude of the environmental net effect of the tax is unclear. In this paper, we assess the net effect in a Swedish regional retail market where the tax not yet is in place. We predict the net effect on CO2 emissions to be positive, but off-set by about 50% because of a slower transition to e-tailing.
L81|Family ties: the intersection between data protection and competition in EU Law|Personal data has become the object of trade in the digital economy, and companies compete to acquire and process this data. This rivalry is subject to the application of competition law. However, personal data also has a dignitary dimension which is protected through data protection law and the EU Charter rights to data protection and privacy. This paper maps the relationship between these legal frameworks. It identifies the commonalities that facilitate their intersection, whilst acknowledging their distinct methods and aims. It argues that when the material scope of these legal frameworks overlap, competition law can incorporate data protection law as a normative yardstick when assessing non-price competition. Data protection can thus act as an internal constraint on competition law. In addition, it advocates that following the legal and institutional changes brought about by the Lisbon Treaty, data protection and other fundamental rights also exercise an external constraint on competition law and, in certain circumstances, can prevent or shape its application. As national and supranational regulators grapple with the challenge of developing a dynamic information economy that respects fundamental rights, recognition of these constraints would pave the way for a more coherent EU law approach to a digital society.
L81|The role of beneficiaries in transnational regulatory processes|The editors of this volume highlight the role of intermediaries, alongside regulators and targets, as a way to better understand the outcomes of regulatory processes. Here, we explore the benefits of distinguishing a fourth category of actors: the groups whose interests the rules are meant to protect: the (intended) beneficiaries. We apply that framework to nonstate regulation of labor conditions, where the primary intended beneficiaries are workers and their families, especially in poorer countries. We first outline the different ways in which beneficiaries can relate to regulators, intermediaries, and targets; we then develop conjectures about the effect of different relationships on regulatory impacts and democratic legitimacy in relation to corporate power structures, specifically those embedded in the governance of global supply chains. We illustrate these conjectures primarily with examples from three initiatives—Rugmark, the Fair Labor Association, and the Fairtrade system. We conclude that it matters whether and how beneficiaries are included in the regulatory process.
L81|Last look|In over-the-counter markets, a trader typically sources indicative quotes from a number of competing liquidity providers, and then sends a deal request on the best available price for consideration by the originating liquidity provider. Due to the communication and processing latencies involved in this negotiation, and in a continuously evolving market, the price may have moved by the time the liquidity provider considers the trader’s request. At what point has the price moved too far away from the quote originally shown for the liquidity provider to reject the deal request? Or perhaps the request can still be accepted but only on a revised rate? ‘Last look’ is the process that makes this decision, i.e. it determines whether to accept—and if so at what rate—or reject a trader’s deal request subject to the constraints of an agreed trading protocol. In this paper, I study how the execution risk and transaction costs faced by the trader are influenced by the last look logic and choice of trading protocol. I distinguish between various ‘symmetric’ and ‘asymmetric’ last look designs and consider trading protocols that differ on whether, and if so to what extent, price improvements and slippage can be passed on to the trader. All this is done within a unified framework that allows for a detailed comparative analysis. I present two main findings. Firstly, the choice of last look design and trading protocol determines the degree of execution risk inherent in the process, but the effective transaction costs borne by the trader need not be affected by it. Secondly, when a trader adversely selects the iquidity provider she chooses to deal with, the distinction between the different symmetric and asymmetric last look designs fades and the primary driver of execution risk is the choice of trading protocol.
L81|Corporate volunteering climate: mobilizing employee passion for societal causes and inspiring future charitable action|As a society, we grapple with a host of national and global social issues — ranging from hunger and poverty to education to financial stability. Today’s corporations are playing an increasing role in efforts to address such concerns, predominantly through corporate volunteering. Yet, because research on corporate volunteering has been primarily focused on the individual volunteer experience, we still know relatively little about how corporate volunteering can help address grand challenges. In this study, we introduce the concept of corporate volunteering climate in order to examine the broader, more system-level functioning of corporate volunteering in workplaces. Drawing on the sensemaking process, we theorize about how a corporate volunteering climate develops — to what extent is it driven by company-level policies versus employee convictions for a cause? We also explore the potential influence of corporate volunteering climate for volunteers and non-volunteers, both in terms of the workplace (through employee affective commitment) and in terms of the broader community (through employee intentions to volunteer, both in corporate opportunities and on personal time). The results of a study conducted with United Way Worldwide suggest that corporate volunteering climate not only arises through either employees’ belief in the cause or corporate policies, but also that these forces act as substitutes for one another. Moreover, by fostering a sense of collective pride among employees, this climate is related to affective commitment, as well as both corporate and personal volunteering intentions.
L81|Multi-category Competition and Market Power: A Model of Supermarket Pricing|In many competitive settings, consumers buy multiple product categories, and some prefer to use a single firm, generating complementary cross-category price effects. To study pricing in supermarkets, an organizational form where these effects are internalized, we develop a multi-category, multi-seller demand model and estimate it using UK consumer data. This class of model is used widely in theoretical analysis of retail pricing. We quantify cross-category pricing effects and find that internalizing them substantially reduces market power. We find that consumers inclined to one-stop (rather than multi-stop) shopping have a greater pro-competitive impact because they generate relatively large cross-category effects.
L81|Regulating 'platform power'|Increasing regulatory and doctrinal attention has recently focused on the problem of ‘platform power’. Yet calls for regulation of online platforms fail to identify the problems such regulation would target, and as a result appear to lack merit. In this paper, two claims are advanced. First, that the concept of ‘platform power’ is both an under and over-inclusive regulatory target and, as such, should be replaced by the broader concept of a ‘digital gatekeeper’. Second, that existing legal mechanisms do not adequately reflect the power over information flows and individual behaviour that gatekeepers can exercise. In particular, this gatekeeper power can have implications for individual rights that competition law and economic regulation are not designed to capture. Moreover, the technological design, and complexity, of digital gatekeepers renders their operations impervious to scrutiny by individual users, thereby exacerbating these potential implications.
L81|Price regulation in the social market economy|Establishing open and undistorted competition within the internal market is a primary goal of the EU legal framework. Price controls, by contrast, are among the clearest derogations from this overarching objective. Yet much price regulation continues to occur within the internal market. The treatment of such regulation thus raises challenging questions, both substantive and institutional, about the nature of economic governance in the context of the EU’s ‘highly competitive social market economy’. This article begins with a consideration of price regulation, both in economic terms and in relation to its place within the institutional and ideological structure of the EU. It then examines differing approaches seen in EU law: from a sceptical prohibitive approach, to a cautious yet more receptive permissive approach, to an essentially prescriptive approach incorporating price regulation into the fabric of the internal market. The aim is to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the challenges facing the pursuit of ‘open and undistorted competition’ within a modern social market economy.
L81|Are 'sea turtles' slower? Returnee entrepreneurs, venture resources and speed of entrepreneurial entry|We add to neglected research on how venture resources and founder experience outside the home country interplay in facilitating venture creation speed. In particular, we investigate how returnee entrepreneurs influence the role of venture resources in the speed of entrepreneurial entry. Using a novel sample of 388 new ventures covering a range of technologies in China, we find that returnees from abroad are slower in new venture entry in the home country, compared with homegrown entrepreneurs. At the same time, ventures with innovative technology and backed by foreign capital are slower to set up due to higher levels of liability of newness and liability of foreignness. However, when these firms have a returnee founder who can leverage their experience with foreign resources and technological knowhow, such negative effects on entry speed are significantly mitigated. We discuss implications for further research and practice.
L81|A normalized value for information purchases|Consider agents who are heterogeneous in their preferences and wealth levels. These agents may acquire information prior to choosing an investment that has a property of no-arbitrage, and each piece of information bears a corresponding cost. We associate a numeric index to each information purchase (information-cost pair). This index describes the normalized value of the information purchase: it is the risk-aversion level of the unique CARA agent who is indifferent between accepting and rejecting the purchase, and it is characterized by a “duality” principle that states that agents with a stronger preference for information should engage more often in information purchases. No agent more risk-averse than the index finds it profitable to acquire the information, whereas all agents less risk-averse than the index do. Given an empirically measured range of degrees of risk aversion in a competitive economy with no-arbitrage investments, our model therefore comes close to describing an inverse demand for information, by predicting what pieces of information are acquired by agents and which ones are not. Among several desirable properties, the normalized-value formula induces a complete ranking of information structures that extends Blackwell's classic ordering.
L81|Monopolistic competition and optimum product selection: Why and how heterogeneity matters|After some decades of relative oblivion, the interest in the optimality properties of monopolistic competition has recently re-emerged due to the availability of an appropriate and parsimonious framework to deal with firm heterogeneity. Within this framework we show that non-separable utility, variable demand elasticity and endogenous firm heterogeneity cause the market equilibrium to err in many ways, concerning the number of products, the size and the choice of producers, the overall size of the monopolistically competitive sector. More crucially with respect to the existing literature, we also show that the extent of the errors depends on the degree of firm heterogeneity. In particular, the inefficiency of the market equilibrium is largest when selection among heterogenous firms is needed most, that is, when there are relatively many firms with low productivity and relatively few firms with high productivity.
L81|Multi-product firms and product quality|We examine the global operations of multi-product firms. We present a flexible heterogeneous-firm trade model with either limited or strong scope for quality differentiation. Using customs data for China during 2002–2006, we empirically establish that firms allocate activity across products in line with a product hierarchy based on quality. Firms vary output quality across their products by using inputs of different quality levels. Their core competence is in varieties of superior quality that command higher prices but nevertheless generate higher sales. In markets where they offer fewer products, firms concentrate on their core varieties by dropping low-quality peripheral goods on the extensive margin and by shifting sales towards top-quality products on the intensive margin. The product quality ladder also governs firms' export dynamics, both in general and in response to the exogenous removal of MFA quotas on textiles and apparel. Our results inform the drivers and measurement of firm performance, the effects of trade reforms, and the design of development policies.
L81|A hitch-hiker’s guide to post-Brexit trade negotiations: options and principles|Brexit will require the UK to negotiate new trade arrangements with the EU. After summarizing the main options for future UK–EU trade relations, this article reviews the purpose of trade agreements. We highlight that trade negotiations are a bargaining game between countries seeking to reap the gains from international coordination while conceding as little as possible to their negotiating partners. This leads us to propose four principles the UK should adopt to guide its trade negotiating strategy: (i) you get what you give; (ii) where negotiations start from matters; (iii) bargain from a position of power; and (iv) invest in negotiating capacity.
L81|The Human Capital Stock: A Generalized Approach: Comment|Jones (2014) examines development accounting with imperfect substitutability between different types of skills in the production of output. He finds that human capital variation can account for the totality of the variation in income across countries. We show that this finding is entirely due to an assumption that the relative wage of skilled workers is solely determined by attributes of workers (once the supply of skilled workers is accounted for). If skill premia are predominantly determined by technology, institutions, and other features of the economic environment, human capital differences explain none of the variation in income per worker.
L81|Strategic Entry and Potential Competition: Evidence from Compressed Gas Fuel Retail|We study the effect of competition on preemption incentives. An unexpected change in regulation in the Italian retail market for compressed natural gas fuel allows us to identify the potential entrants and creates exogenous variation in their number. We document that markets with a larger pool of potential competitors experience faster entry. We provide evidence suggesting that this occurs because a larger number of potential entrants raises firms' incentives to preempt.
L81|¿Realmente bajan los precios durante el Buen Fin?|Background. The Buen Fin is a commercial annual event consisting of four days of promotions and sales of products and services during the third week of November in Mexico. The event has gradually increased in relevance since its first edition in 2011. However, there is no formal analysis that assess the effect of the event on prices, mainly because of the lack of relevant information. Methods. This article analyzes the pricing policy during the Buen Fin in Mexico for a sample of urban establishments in the country. Using the database “Who’s Who in prices?” of the Federal Consumer Protection Agency, an unbalanced panel of weekly prices for electronic products in 525 establishments during 2010-2015 is built. An event study design is further implemented in order to analyze the effects of the Buen Fin over average and specific prices of products and establishments and over the strategic pricing policies from participating companies. Results. The Buen Fin reduces the average prices of electronics items in 7% when compared with the prices observed in September before the event. Only 52% of the products in the sample effectively reduced their prices during the event. Accounting only for discounted products, an average discount of 15% is observed. There is also evidence of a systematic increase in electronic prices weeks before the event, on average, 2%; some establishments have adopted practices to make discounts more salient for consumers. Conclusions. The Buen Fin cannot be considered as an event of widespread sales and discounts. The discounts offered by different chains have significant differences. In some cases, several establishments have taken strategic practices to make more evident the deals offered during the event.// Antecedentes. El Buen Fin es un evento comercial de periodicidad anual que consiste en cuatro días de promoción y rebajas de productos y servicios durante la tercera semana del mes de noviembre en México. El evento ha incrementado su relevancia desde su primera edición en 2011. Sin embargo, no existe un análisis formal que evalúe el efecto del Buen Fin sobre los precios y las políticas de fijación de precios de las empresas, principalmente debido a la falta de información relevante. Métodos. Este artículo analiza la fijación de precios durante el Buen Fin para una muestra de establecimientos ubicados en áreas urbanas del país. Empleando la base de datos ¿Quién es quién en los precios? de la Procuraduría Federal del Consumidor (Profeco) se construye un panel no balanceado de precios semanales de productos electrónicos para 525 establecimientos durante 2010-2015. Posteriormente, se utiliza la metodología de estudio de eventos para analizar los efectos del Buen Fin en el nivel de precios promedio y en los precios específicos por producto y por cadena. Adicionalmente, se analizan las políticas de fijación estratégica de precios para las empresas participantes. Resultados. El Buen Fin reduce en promedio 7% los precios con respecto al precio observado en septiembre antes del evento. Sólo 52% de los productos analizados reduce efectivamente su precio en el Buen Fin. Restringiendo el análisis a productos descontados, se obtiene un descuento promedio de 15%. El aumento promedio de precios antes del evento es de 2%, evidencia de que algunos establecimientos han adoptado prácticas para hacer más evidentes las ofertas del Buen Fin. Conclusión. El Buen Fin no puede ser considerado como un evento de baja generalizada de precios. Los descuentos ofrecidos por distintas cadenas tienen diferencias considerables. En algunos casos, diversos establecimientos han adoptado prácticas estratégicas que permiten hacer más evidentes las ofertas ofrecidas durante el evento.
L81|An Evaluation of Cross-Efficiency Methods, Applied to Measuring Warehouse Performance|In this paper method and practice of cross-efficiency calculation is discussed. The main methods proposed in the literature are tested not on a set of artificial data but on a realistic sample of input-output data of European ware- houses. The empirical results show the limited role which increasing automation investment and larger warehouse size have in increasing productive performance. The reason is the existence of decreasing returns to scale in the industry, resulting in sub-optimal scales and inefficiencies, regardless of the operational performance of the facilities. From the methodological perspective, and based on a multidimensional metric which considers the capability of the various methods to rank warehouses, their ease of implementation, and their robustness to sensitivity analyses, we conclude to the superiority of the classic Sexton et al. (1986) method over recently proposed, more sophisticated methods.
L81|Measuring the Free Digital Economy within the GDP and Productivity Accounts|We develop an experimental methodology that values ”free” digital content through the lens of a production account and is consistent with the framework of the national accounts. We build upon the work in Nakamura, et al. (2016) by combining marketing‐ and advertising‐supported content and find that the impact of ”free” digital content on U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) has accelerated in recent years, particularly since 2005. However, the explosion in ”free” digital content is partially offset by a decrease in ”free” print content like newspapers. Including these, real GDP growth would grow at 1.53 percent a year from 2005 to 2015 rather than the official growth rate of 1.42 percent, a tenth of a percent faster. Thus, there is a substantive impact on 2005 to 2015 real growth, even when we do not measure the full consumer surplus benefits of free goods. In addition, from 1995 to 2005, real GDP growth, including ”free” content, would grow 0.07 percentage point faster, and in the earlier period, from 1929 to 1995, 0.01 percentage point faster. We further find that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and core PCE deflators would have risen about 0.1 percentage point slower from 2005 to 2015. To analyze the impact of ”free” content on measured private business total factor productivity (TFP) growth, we account for inputs of ”free” content used in production. We find that TFP would grow faster by 0.07 percentage point per year from 2005 to 2014 and faster by 0.07 percentage point from 1995 to 2005.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L81|Geographical dispersion of consumer search behaviour| This article investigates whether consumer search behaviour differs across zip codes within the U.S. As an application, daily gasoline price data covering virtually all gas stations within the U.S. are employed to estimate the distribution of search costs in each zip code. The results show that there are significant differences across zip codes regarding the expected number of searches achieved before consumers purchase gasoline. In order to have a systematic explanation, such differences are further connected to geographic, demographic, and economic conditions of the zip codes in a secondary analysis. The corresponding results imply several strategies for gas stations in order to maximize profits/markups; suggestions follow for policy makers and regulators to reduce redistributive effects of information barriers across locations.
L81|Économie des algorithmes et ordre concurrentiel - Réflexions sur les abus d'exploitation et les collusions fondés sur des algorithmes de prix|Il s'agit de s'interroger sur les problèmes concurrentiels qui peuvent procéder de l'utilisation d'algorithmes de prix. La masse des données disponibles et les capacités de traitement des algorithmes (notamment via l'intelligence artificielle) rendent possibles des stratégies de discrimination parfaite par les prix, qui peuvent se traduire par des abus d'exploitation et peuvent favoriser l'émergence et le maintien d'équilibres de collusion tacite. Nous montrons les difficultés que peuvent rencontrer les règles de concurrence pour contrecarrer de tels risques et considérons d'autres types de réponses tenant à une régulation publique ou à l'exercice de contrepoids par les consommateurs.
L81|Merchant Acceptance of Payment Cards: “Must Take” or “Wanna Take”?|In recent years, regulators in various parts of the world have capped interchange fees on debit and credit cards. The justification for the caps rests to a large extent on the argument that these cards have, for certain merchants, become must-take cards rather than “wanna-take cards.” That is, there are merchants who accept payment cards not because they bring net convenience benefits but out of fear of losing profitable business to card-accepting competitors. This paper presents an original approach that allows to quantify, for the first time, the relative importance of the two motivations. We find, for the case of France in 2008, that the must-take phenomenon effectively exists, but that it applies to only 5.8–19.8 percent of the card-accepting merchants and to a mere 3.9–13.5 percent of all retailers.
L81|Evaluating Willingness to Pay as a Measure of the Impact of Dyslexia in Adults|While much is known about dyslexia in school-age children and adolescents, less is known about its effects on quality of life in adults. Using data from the Connecticut Longitudinal Study, we provide the first estimates of the monetary value of improving reading, speaking, and cognitive skills to dyslexic and nondyslexic adults. Using a stated-preference survey, we find that dyslexic and nondyslexic individuals value improvements in their skills in reading speed, reading aloud, pronunciation, memory, and information retrieval at about the same rate. Because dyslexics have lower self-reported levels on these skills, their total willingness to pay to achieve a high level of skill is substantially greater than for nondyslexics. However, dyslexic individuals' willingness to pay (averaging $3000 for an improvement in all skills simultaneously) is small compared with the difference in earnings between dyslexic and nondyslexic adults. We estimate that dyslexic individuals earn 15% less per year (about $8000) than nondyslexic individuals. Although improvements in reading, speaking, and cognitive skills in adulthood are unlikely to eliminate the earnings difference that reflects differences in educational attainment and other factors, stated-preference estimates of the value of cognitive skills may substantially underestimate the value derived from effects on lifetime earnings and health.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L81|Multiproduct retailing and buyer power: The effects of product delisting on consumer shopping behavior|This paper empirically examines the effects of product delisting on consumer shopping behavior in a context of grocery retailing by large multiproduct supermarket chains. A product is said to be delisted when a supermarket stops supplying it while it continuous being sold by competing stores. We develop a model of demand in which consumers can purchase multiple products in the same period. Consumers have heterogeneous shopping patterns: some find it optimal to concentrate purchases at a single store while others prefer sourcing several separate supermarkets. We account for this heterogeneity by introducing shopping costs, which are transaction costs of dealing with suppliers. Using scanner data on grocery purchases by French households in 2005, we estimate the parameters of the model and retrieve the distribution of shopping costs. We find a total shopping cost per store sourced of 1.79 € on average. When we simulate the delisting of a product by one supermarket, we find that customers'probability of sourcing that store decreases while the probability of sourcing competing stores increases. The reduction in demand is considerably larger when consumers have strong preferences for the delisted brand. This suggests that retailers may be hurting themselves, and not only manufacturers, when they delist a product. However, when customers have strong preferences for the store such effects are lower, suggesting that inducing store loyalty in customers appears to have an effect on vertical negotiations and, in particular, it enables powerful retailers to impose vertical restraints on manufacturers.

L81|The Effects of a Day Off from Retail Price Competition: Evidence on Consumer Behavior and Firm Performance in Gasoline Retailing|First, we analyze how regular days off from competition and a time-dependent price pattern affect firm performance. Second, we examine the effects on firms' profitability from consumers’ changing search- and timing behavior. We use microdata from gasoline retailing in Norway. Since 2004, firms have practiced an industry-wide day off from competition, starting on Mondays at noon, by increasing prices to a common level given by the recommended prices (decided and published in advance). Hence, firms know when and to what level to raise their price. In areas without local competition, retail prices are always equal to the recommended prices. Hinged on this, we regard recommended prices as the monopoly price level. In turn, a foreseeable low-price window is open before every restoration. During the data period, we observe an additional weekly restoration on Thursdays at noon. We show that an additional day off from competition increases firm performance. As expected, a conventional price search of where to buy reduces firms’ profitability. In contrast, consumers who are aware of the cycle and spend effort on when to buy have a positive impact on firms’ profitability. If consumers spend effort on when to buy rather than where to buy, price competition might be softened even in the low-price windows.
L81|CMO priorities in approaching consumer decision journey, and inspiration and influence in marketing|In today’s digital world there is a real need of approaching consumer decision journey within a well-orchestrated program by placing more emphasis on the initial consideration set, and expanding initial consideration. CMO are challenged to clearly identify priorities in the year of data and measurement, of Agile Marketing, focusing marketing activity on creating customer value, tying marketing’s contribution to this customer value, and measuring marketing’s performance within the context of the company’s business value. They also need to include customer inspiration as a metric in managerial decision-making, and to consider influence as a driving force for change in approaching customer experience, building proper relationships on the way of digital transformation, and enabling the customer-centricity, reimagining marketers’ role as a central driver of organisational change, output, and impact, and avoiding thinking of influencers in a linear way.
L81|Variety and the Cost of Search in Supermarket Retailing|Abstract We examine search costs and product variety among multi-product retailers. Search costs may rise in variety, because consumers have more alternatives to consider, but may fall on the margin as product variety allows better matches between consumers and brands. We estimate a hierarchical model that disentangles the effect of variety on brand and store search costs. Our findings reveal that search costs within each store rise in product variety, suggesting that retailers reduce consumer search by offering deeper product assortments. But, the cost of searching among stores falls in product variety, which limits the exercise of market power.
L81|Shopping hours and entry - An empirical analysis of Aldi's opening hours|Aldi, the biggest discounter in Germany, started to systematically extend shopping hours of its stores in 2016. We interpret the decision to extend opening hours of a specific Aldi store as entry into a new market. By using a novel data set containing the opening hours of nearly all German grocery retailers, we find that consumer and firm learning infl uence that decision. The presence of a nearby Aldi already opened longer increases the probability that a given Aldi extends its opening hours. However, if a nearby competitors store is short opened, the probability that Aldi extends opening hours decreases.

L81|Buyer Power and Information Disclosure|We study how buyer power affects producersâ€™ incentives to share information with retailers. Adopting the Bayesian persuasion framework, we show that full information disclosure is optimal only when buyer power is suciently low. Using the presence of retail price recommendations as the proxy for information sharing between producers and retailers, we empirically examine the implication of our model. Consistent with the theory, we find that producers of products whose sales rely more on powerful retailers are less likely to use retail price recommendations
L81|Will Ad Blocking Break the Internet?|Ad blockers allow Internet users to obtain information without generating ad revenue for site owners; and by 2016 they were used by roughly a quarter of site visitors. Given the ad-supported nature of much of the web, ad blocking poses a threat to site revenue and, if revenue losses undermine investment, a possible threat to consumers' access to appealing content. Using unique, proprietary, and site-specific data on the share of site visitors using ad blockers at a few thousand sites, along with Alexa traffic data, we explore the impact of ad blocker usage on site quality, as inferred from traffic ranks, 2013-2016. We find that each additional percentage point of site visitors using ad blockers raises (worsens) its traffic rank by about 0.6 percent over a 35 month period, with stronger effects at initially worse-ranked sites. We provide additional evidence of causality by showing that the relationship between traffic trends and eventual ad blocking does not predate ad blocking. Plausible instruments for ad blocking also deliver consistent results. Effects of ad blocking on revenue are compounded by the fact that ad blocking reduces visits, while also generating less revenue from remaining visitors employing ad blockers. We conclude that ad blocking poses a substantial threat to the ad-supported web.
L81|Economies of Density in E-Commerce: A Study of Amazon’s Fulfillment Center Network|We examine the economies of density associated with the expansion of Amazon’s distribution network from 2006 to 2018. We demonstrate that, in placing a fulfillment center in a new state, Amazon faces a trade-off between the revenue implications of exposing local customers to sales tax on their purchases and the cost savings from reducing the shipping distance to those customers. Using detailed data on online transactions, we estimate a model of demand for retail goods and show that consumers’ online shopping is sensitive to sales taxes. We then use the demand estimates and the spatial distribution of consumers relative to Amazon’s fulfillment centers to predict revenues and shipping distances under the observed fulfillment center roll-out and under counterfactual roll-outs over this time period. Using a moment inequalities approach, we infer the cost savings from being closer to customers that render the observed network roll-out optimal. We find that Amazon saves between $0.17 and $0.47 for every 100 mile reduction in the distance of shipping goods worth $30. In the context of its distribution network expansion, this estimate implies that Amazon has reduced its total shipping cost by over 50% and increased its profit margin by between 5 and 14% since 2006. Separately, we demonstrate that prices on Amazon have fallen by approximately 40% over the same period, suggesting that a significant share of the cost savings have been passed on to consumers.
L81|Digital Economics|Digital technology is the representation of information in bits. This technology has reduced the cost of storage, computation, and transmission of data. Research on digital economics examines whether and how digital technology changes economic activity. In this review, we emphasize the reduction in five distinct economic costs associated with digital economic activity: search costs, replication costs, transportation costs, tracking costs, and verification costs.
L81|Upstream, Downstream: Diffusion and Impacts of the Universal Product Code|This paper matches archival data from the Uniform Code Council to establishments in the Longitudinal Business Database and Economic Census to study the diffusion and impacts of the Universal Product Code (UPC). We find evidence of network effects in the difusion process. Matched-sample difference in-difference estimates show that employment and trademark registrations increase following UPC adoption by manufacturers or wholesalers. Industry-level imports also increase with domestic UPC adoption. Our findings suggest that barcodes, scanning and related technologies helped stimulate variety-enhancing product innovation and encourage the growth of international retail supply chains.
L81|Food Deserts and the Causes of Nutritional Inequality|We study the causes of “nutritional inequality”: why the wealthy eat more healthfully than the poor in the United States. Exploiting supermarket entry, household moves to healthier neighborhoods, and purchasing patterns among households with identical local supply, we reject that neighborhood environments contribute meaningfully to nutritional inequality. Using a structural demand model, we find that exposing low-income households to the same products and prices available to high-income households reduces nutritional inequality by only nine percent, while the remaining 91 percent is driven by differences in demand. These findings counter the common notion that policies to reduce supply inequities, such as “food deserts,” could play an important role in reducing nutritional inequality. By contrast, the structural results predict that means-tested subsidies for healthy food could eliminate nutritional inequality at a fiscal cost of about 15 percent of the annual budget for the U.S. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
L81|The dynamics of online hotel prices and the EU Booking.com case| This paper analyses the dynamics of hotel prices listed on Booking.com in the period 2014-16. This period is characterised by the most important antitrust decisions regarding the use of price parity clauses by online travel agencies (OTAs) in the EU. First, we document the dynamics of hotel prices on Booking.com in tourism regions of three EU member states: France, Italy, and Spain. The evidence suggests that prices decreased in 2015, the year in which the major antitrust decisions took place, whereas they bounced back in 2016. Second, we provide both a comprehensive explanation of the previous evidence and a rationalisation based on a theoretical model of the OTA sector. Overall, our overarching analysis of the price dynamics on Booking.com allows to explain both the impact of removing price parities and the possible response of the OTAs.
L81|Online Auctions and Digital Marketing Agencies| We present an empirical investigation of the role of marketing agencies in Googleâ€™s online ad auctions. By combining data on advertisersâ€™ affiliation to marketing agencies with data on bidding in ad auctions, we analyze how changes in the concentration of clients in the same industry under the same ad network are associated with changes in keyword bidding in terms of entry, exit, and pricing strategies. Moreover, by exploiting the case of a recent merger between agencies, we estimate through a difference-in-differences strategy that an increase in concentration leads to reduction in the average cost-per-click of the keywords affected by the merger.
L81|Logistics Services, Technics and Software in Bulgaria from the Perspective of the Manufacturing and Trading Enterprises and Their Competitive Strategy|Logistics outsourcing is an increasingly common practice among manufacturing and trading enterprises. Being customers of the logistics sector, their perceptions of the supplied logistics technics, software services in Bulgaria, as well as the used logistics services by them, are important for the development of the logistics sector and logistics in our country. On the basis of empirical data this study evaluates the availability, quality and price of the supplied logistics services, technics and software from the point of view of the manufacturing and trading enterprises, the extent of usage of the different logistics services, as well as the existing differences between enterprises concerning their type, size and strategy. The competitive advantages that are achieved through the usage of some services are outlined too. The methods of descriptive statistics and statistical hypothesis testing are applied for data analysis. The existence of differences between the studied enterprises concerning their type and strategy is determined through t-test. The impact of the enterprisesï¿½ size on the used services is estimated trough the nonï¿½parametric equivalent of one-way analysis of variance - the Kruskalï¿½Wallis test, and the relationships between the different dimensions of competitiveness and the used logistics serï¿½vices ï¿½ through Spearmanï¿½s rank correlation coefficients. The study finds out that it is necessary to improve the ratio between quality and price of most services and the capabilities of logistics companies in relation to providing value-added services, management of distribution/procurement for their customers and total logistics packages. Evidences are brought fourth that enterprises using a variety of logistics services, besides the traditional transportation and ware housing, achieve a higher level of competitiveness concerning its different dimensions, especially those ones that have mainly a differentiating character.
L81|Austria’s digital transition: The diffusion challenge|Austria’s transition to a digital economy and society is slower than in other high-income small open European economies. The rate and pace of utilisation of eight main ICT applications shows that Austrian firms follow peer country counterparts with a gap, which has widened in most areas in recent years. Two dynamics drive digital transitions and Austria has room for progress in both of them. First, the potential for digitalisation in all firms, and especially in the smaller ones (where gaps are largest) should be freed-up by upgrading the full range of ICT-generic, ICT-specific and ICT-complementary skills. Second, Austria needs to make its business environment more conducive to firm entry and exit. The rate of entry of new firms and their growth are crucial for the diffusion of new business models and ICT innovations but fall behind peer countries. The adoption of ICT innovations by households also follows a staggered path: young and highly educated Austrians adopt ICT applications in similar ways to their counterparts in peer countries, while middle and older age cohorts display noticeable gaps. This calls for policies to help lagging groups become more acquainted with innovations. A whole-of-government approach, including large-scale utilisation of e-government applications in enterprises and households, should help to embrace change and facilitate the flourishing of innovative businesses, work practices and lifestyles throughout Austria. This Working Paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of Austria (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-austria.htm)
L81|Digital Trade: Developing a Framework for Analysis|This paper explores the definition, measurement, and policy implications of digital trade, proposing a tentative typology of digital trade that can be used to unpack transactions and analyse the issues. Digitalisation is changing what and how we trade: from digital delivery to greater physical trade enabled by digital connectivity. Online platforms mean more small packages crossing borders, while new technologies are changing how services are produced and delivered. Underpinning digital trade is the movement of data: data is a means of production, an asset that can itself be traded, and the means through which some services are traded and GVCs are organised. While there is no single definition of digital trade, there is a growing consensus that it encompasses digitally enabled transactions in trade in goods and services which can be either digitally or physically delivered involving consumers, firms and governments. Unpacking trade transactions along these lines using a tentative typology can help in understanding and identifying issues. For example, measuring digital trade poses challenges ranging from identifying transactions that are digitally enabled to the sectoral classification of services in a transaction, and efforts are underway to better reflect digital trade in trade statistics. For trade policy, the increased bundling of goods and services raises issues about which trade rules (GATT or GATS) apply; trade facilitation is ever more critical for just-in-time delivery and GVCs; and the role of data flows in enabling digital trade may require further attention, along with how to ensure that the gains from digital trade are inclusive, within and across countries.
L81|The Influence Of The Concentration On The Performance Of Firms In Retail Industry In The Republic Of Croatia|According to SCP paradigm (Structure-Conduct-Performance paradigm) the industry structure affects the behaviour of firms in the industry, which affects their performance. The paradigm is consistent with the Neoclassical Theory of the Firm which assumes that there is a direct link between the industry structure, entrepreneurial conduct and performance. The basic principle of this paradigm might be the ability of entrepreneurs to exercise market power in a concentrated industry. High industry concentration is correlated with high profits, especially if the concentration level exceeds a certain critical level under the condition that there are some barriers to entry of new entrepreneurs in the industry. Economic theory supports the view that the industry concentration is in a positive relationship with efficiency, and it can be argued that the growth of industry concentration will increase the efficiency of industry. Current approaches in economic theory and recent empirical studies do not follow the SCP theory,they suggest that the above-average profits, which occur in most concentrated industry’s, are results of economic efficiency and effectiveness, and not a consequence of non-competitive behaviour. In this paper we will try to give an answer to the above-mentioned issue present in economic theory. The study will try to demonstrate a statistically significant link between the measure of concentration and measure of efficiency in retail industry in the Republic of Croatia.
L81|Examining the influence of products’ quality perception in specialty retailing|This paper addresses the following issue: “Does the products’ perceived quality influence on satisfaction and loyalty towards the specialty retailing?” For this purpose we propose a conceptual model on the creation of satisfaction and loyalty in the specialty retailing setting, to examine the influence of products’ quality perception. Data were analyzed through Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) on a sample of 592 consumers. Our findings show that the specialty food store-based attributes have different influence depending on the products’ quality perception, while suggesting its moderating role. Our major contribution is the examination of one subjective consumer-based variable in the specialty retailing setting.

L81|Spatial pattern of Russia’s market integration|This paper studies integration of regional goods markets in Russia over 2001–2015 with the use of time series analysis, based on the law of one price as the criterion of market integration. The cost of a staples basket is used as a price representative. The analysis involves all pairs of country’s regions, thus providing a comprehensive pattern of market integration. The region pairs are classified as belonging to one of four groups: integrated, conditionally integrated, not integrated but tending towards integration, and neither integrated nor tending towards integration. The results suggest that only less than a quarter of region pairs fall into the fourth category.
L81|The Moscow market in the country’s economic space|This paper studies integration of the Moscow market for final goods with markets of all other Russian regions. It considers an aggregated market represented by a minimum food basket. The law of one price serves as a criterion of market integration. It is a base for constructing time series models of the regional costs of the staples basket over 2001–2015 relative to its cost in Moscow. Regional markets are divided into four groups: integrated with the Moscow market, conditionally integrated with it, not integrated but tending towards integration with the Moscow market, and neither integrated nor tending towards integration. Nonlinear time series models with asymptotically decaying trends capture a movement towards integration (price convergence).
L81|Multiproduct Intermediaries and Optimal Product Range|This paper develops a framework for studying the optimal product range choice of a multiproduct intermediary when consumers demand multiple products. In the optimal product selection, the intermediary uses exclusively stocked high-value products to increase store tra¢ c, and at the same time earns pro?t mainly from non-exclusively stocked products which are relatively cheap to buy from upstream suppliers. By doing this the intermediary can earn strictly positive pro?t, including in situations where it does not improve e¢ ciency in selling products. A linkage between product selection and product demand features such as size and shape is established. It is also shown that relative to the social optimum, the intermediary tends to be too big and stock too many products exclusively.
L81|Leadership Styles and Job Satisfaction|Low compensation in the retail sector is adversely affecting employee satisfaction and turnover. Leadership style is important for motivating employees and increasing their satisfaction level. This study has examined the effect of transformational and transactional leadership styles on job satisfaction in selected retail outlets of Slough, United Kingdom. The adapted questionnaire was administered to the employees of the retail outlets. The sample size was 270 and the response rate was 85%. The study found that transformational leadership style has a positive effect on job satisfaction, whereas transactional leadership style has an insignificant effect on job satisfaction. Therefore, it can be argued that the transformational leadership style is more effective in the retail sector of Slough, United Kingdom.
L81|Roadmap for Renewal: A Shared Platform in the Food Industry|Abstract The majority of digital platform research has focused on consumer-centric platforms. Driven by the vast growth potential of direct consumer market access, industrial communities locked behind the conventional gatekeepers in their respective value chains have lately started to tinker with their own platform creation initiatives. Aided by fifteen food industry actors, we identify two critical managerial prerequisites for and design a six-step roadmap towards a participatory infrastructure platform – a platform that allows platform participants to share proprietary data and – by exploiting the data – to create new artifacts in consumer-centric marketplaces. Beyond product innovations, sharing data also enables new optimization layers for operational efficiencies and increased productivity on the industry level. In exploring the participants’ commitment and willingness to shift towards such a platform model, we found three operational data types that the companies would readily be willing to share: 1) transportation data, 2) warehousing data, and 3) demand/supply data managed with decentralized governance models. In the short term, each data type could provide the foundation for the establishment of a specific type of an operational platform: a transportation platform, a warehousing platform, or a market platform. The latter would provide the long-sought direct access to consumer markets. Building on these models, we identify another three strategic avenues for long-term joint development: 1) algorithmic development and evolution of the platform, 2) cross-industry interoperability of the platform, and 3) interoperability with competing platforms. Laying out a roadmap of evolving platform models towards a consumer-driven business ecosystem, we contribute to the empirical literature on industrial platform creation.
L81|E-Commerce Trend Forecasting For Romania Vs European Union|Considering the e-commerce as a dynamic channel sale, I conducted an analysis on the evolution of European e-commerce vs. Romania. For this purpose, I made a direct analysis, based on data available on Eurostat. Another purpose of the research was the identification of discrepancies on consumers' behavior related to online purchases between the EU and Romania.
L81|Analyzing the dependences of multi-category purchases on interactions of marketing variables|Abstract We extend the usual specification of the multivariate probit model frequently used to analyze multi-category purchase incidence data by introducing interaction effects between marketing variables. Models are estimated by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation method using 24,047 shopping visits made by a random sample of 1500 households in one specific grocery store over a one year period. Our data refer to a total of 25 food and non-food product categories and include socio-demographic household attributes in addition to purchases and marketing variables. Information criteria agree on the superiority of the extended specification. Estimation results demonstrate that many interaction effects are erroneously attributed to the main effects of marketing variables if one applies the usual specification instead. We derive managerial implications with respect to sales revenue by stochastic simulation. If managers base decisions on the usual specification in spite of its worse statistical performance, they run the risk to overestimate sales revenue increases due to sales promotion activities.
L81|Multi-category purchase incidences with marketing cross effects|Abstract We focus on cross effects of marketing variables and cross category dependences for multi-category decisions which households take during a shopping trip to a retail store. A cross effect is defined as the effect which a marketing variable used for a certain product category exerts on purchases of another category. Using Dirichlet process mixture models with multivariate probit components we analyze purchase incidences of 24,047 shopping visits of a random sample of 1500 households. Independent variables of these models encompass marketing variables for 25 product categories and household attributes. We discuss differences between the two best performing models, a full model which includes both cross effects and cross category dependences, and a related restricted model which ignores cross effects. We obtain several high and significant differences with respect to category constants and cross category dependences between these two models. We also present explanations for the larger (in absolute terms) cross effects of features or displays. We demonstrate that by ignoring cross effects management runs the risk to obtain in many product categories too optimistic forecasts of sales revenue changes due to promotions. In contrast to previous related work suggesting not to use promotions which are not tailored to individual households in any of the investigated categories, we obtain support for such promotions in at least 48 % of the 25 product categories. In addition, based on the full model we demonstrate that often different categories are appropriate for promotions which are targeted at household clusters.
L81|The impact of process innovation on prices: Evidence from automated fuel retailing in The Netherlands|In the last decade, many European countries have seen a sharp increase in the number of automated fueling stations. We study the effect of this process innovation on prices at stations that are automated and their competitors using a difference-in-differences matching strategy. Our estimates show that prices at automated stations drop by 1.7 to 3.2% immediately after conversion and stabilize at this lower level. Unlike previous studies, our estimates do not reveal a difference in impact between early and later adopters of automation. Indicative of competitive spillovers, prices at stations within 2 km of an automated station decrease on average with a precisely estimated 0.2%.
L81|On the countervailing power of large retailers when shopping costs matter|We consider a set-up with vertical contracting between a supplier and a retail industry where a large retailer competes with smaller retailers that carry a narrower range of products. Consumers are heterogeneous in their shopping costs; they will either be multistop shoppers or one-stop shoppers. The countervailing power of the large retailer is modeled as a threat of demand-side substitution. We show that retail prices are higher, and industry surplus and social welfare fall, when the large retailer possesses countervailing power. Increasing marginal wholesale prices discourages multistop shopping behavior of consumers, making demand substitution less attractive for the large retailer.
L81|Private Label Positioning and Product Line|This article examines (i) how retailers position private label products, (ii) why private labels are sold in some product categories but not in others, and why some national brand products may have difficulty in accessing retailers¡¯ shelves, (iii) why some private label products are positioned as ¡°premium¡± brands, and (iv) how consumers¡¯ surplus and total welfare are affected by private labels. We find that private label positioning leads to less differentiation in product category, which structurally changes a retailer¡¯s product line in return. Consumer welfare and total welfare are lower.
