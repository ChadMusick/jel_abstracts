B54|(In)visibility, care and cultural barriers: the size and shape of women’s work in India|Based on primary data from a large household survey in seven districts in West Bengal in India, this paper analyses the reasons underlying low labor force participation of women. In particular, we try to disentangle the intertwined strands of choice, constraints posed by domestic work and care responsibilities, and the predominant understanding of cultural norms as factors explaining the low labor force participation as measured by involvement in paid work. We document the fuzziness of the boundary between domestic work and unpaid (and therefore invisible) economic work that leads to mis-measurement of women’s work and suggest methods to improve measurement. We find that being primarily responsible for domestic chores lower the probability of “working”, after accounting for all the conventional factors. We also document how, for women, being out of paid work is not synonymous with care or domestic work, as they are involved in expenditure saving activities. We also find that religion and visible markers such as veiling are not significant determinants of the probability of working. Our data shows substantial unmet demand for work. Given that women are primarily responsible for domestic chores, we also document that women express a demand for work that would be compatible with household chores.
B54|Reflexiones sobre la teoría económica desde las perspectivas feministas|A partir de una revisión general de la literatura, el documento busca reflexionar sobre la necesidad de incluir en la historia y el pensamiento económico los aportes del feminismo. Para ello, se esbozan las principales críticas que el feminismo hace a la ciencia económica y se identifican dos enfoques de economía feminista: integracionista y de ruptura. Luego, se plantean tres ejemplos de cómo el pensamiento económico ha intentado enfrentar las críticas provenientes del feminismo, para posteriormente nombrar tres pistas proporcionadas por las perspectivas feministas para el desarrollo tanto de la ciencia económica como de sus metodologías de trabajo. Finalmente, la revisión concluye con algunas posibilidades de reflexión a partir de las economías feministas, no solo en el ámbito académico, sino también político. *** From a general literature survey, the document seeks to reflect on the need to include the contributions of feminism in history and economic thought. To achieve this objective, the main criticisms that feminism target to economic science are outlined and two approaches to feminist economics are identified: integrationist and rupture. Next, three examples of how economic thinking has tried to face the criticism of feminism are raised. Then, three indications are provided from feminist perspectives for the development of both economic science and its working methodologies. Finally, the survey concludes with some possibilities for reflection from feminist economics, not only in academia but also in politics.

B54|Closing the Finance Gap by Nudging: Impact Assessment of Public Grants for Women Entrepreneurs|Several recent papers draw attention to a lack of rigorous research on public policies supporting women entrepreneurs' competitiveness. This paper evaluates the effect of small business development gender-specific matching grants using a quasi-experimental approach. The grants have a positive effect on firm survival, as well as positive effects on obtaining bank loans, turnover, value added, employment, and total factor productivity. Heterogeneous treatment effects show that the grants increase the chance of young women entrepreneurs' firm survival and are even more effective for firms owned by mature women. Cost-benefit analysis estimates an increase in value added, which outweighs scheme-induced costs by 80% in the short-run and 170% in the long run.
B54|A missing touch of Adam Smith in Amartya Sen’s account of Public Reasoning: the Man Within for the Man Without|Sen claims that his 2009 theory of justice is based in part upon Smith’s idea of the “impartial spectator”. His claim has received criticism: some authors have responded that his interpretation of Smith’s concept is unfaithful to the original (e.g., Ege, Igersheim and Le Chapelain 2012); others, focusing on internal features of Sen’s analysis, critique his use of the Smithian impartial spectator, arguing that it is a weak point in his comparative theory of justice (e.g., Shapiro 2011). In this paper we address both sets of criticisms. While agreeing with commentators that Sen’s reading of Smith is somewhat unfaithful, we reiterate that his aim in The Idea of Justice is not to provide an exegesis of Smith but rather to build his own comparative theory of justice by “extending Adam Smith’s idea of the impartial spectator” (IJ: 134) to his own project. After clarifying their distinct approaches to the concept of the impartial spectator, we draw upon our account of these differences to evaluate Sen’s own use of the concept. Despite significant divergences, we show that Sen’s version of the impartial spectator is not inconsistent with Smith’s analysis. Though it does not correspond to Smith’s concept, i.e. to what the Scottish philosopher sometimes calls the “man within”, it is reminiscent of another figure from Smith’s moral philosophy: the “man without”. Beyond this analogy, there are further connections between Smith’s imaginary figure of the “man within” and Sen’s account of “common beliefs”—both notions are ways of representing our beliefs regarding what is moral or just. But whereas Smith’s moral philosophy offers an analysis of the process by which the “man without” influences the “man within”, nothing of that kind is to be found in Sen’s conception of public reasoning. And it is here that Smith’s famous concept of “sympathy” can supplement Sen’s theory, in a way which furnishes an answer to Shapiro’s (2011) criticism regarding the possibility of the spontaneous change of beliefs toward greater impartiality.
B54|Culture counters Male-Backlash: Causal evidence from India's Northeast|The reverse causality between female employment and domestic violence is debatable. Due to the adverse health consequences of domestic violence women shy away from employment. For fears about backlash from their husbands, wives may abstain from working. Battered women may also take up employment to liberate themselves from the grip of domestic violence. Using a new dataset that combines ethnographic data with the third wave of the National Family and Health Survey, I identify three instruments. Those are traditional tribal norms that are more conducive to the participation of women in activities outside of their homes, namely, female political engagement, female hunting, and female gathering of food, fodder and fuel. The instrument variable procedure generates significant protective effects for working wives with a 38 percent reduction in the probability of physical violence, while controlling for observable social norms surrounding tribal marriage, separation, descent, inheritance, subsistence, and settlement patterns.
B54|Structural change and female participation in recent economic growth: A multisectoral analysis for the Spanish economy|Economic growth has different impacts on gender gaps. Despite that the incorporation of women into the labour market drove towards a convergence with male participation in recent decades, a notable gender pay gap still persists standing at around 15% on average in the European Union. In this context, this paper evaluates the impact of economic growth patterns on the evolution of female employment and gender pay gaps. As a case study, we examine Spanish economic growth from 1980 to 2007 and the influences on the size, composition (by skill), and distribution (by sector) of female and male employment, as well as the consequences for gender gaps. First, sectorial feminization, direct discrimination, and structural change factors are identified and evaluated as sources of change in gender pay gap. Second, we explore the influence of demand, technology, and intensity factors on the evolution of employment in Spain, combining gender, skill, sectorial, and temporal perspectives.
B54|Economic Pluralism in the Study of Wage Discrimination: A Note|Economic pluralism proposes that economists and social planners should consider alternative theories to establish a range of policy actions. Neoclassical, Feminist and Marxian theories evaluate well-grounded causes of wage discrimination. Racist attitudes, uncertainties regarding minority workers’ productivity and power relations in lower-status sectors might generate discriminatory wages. Each cause deserves corresponding policy action. Given pluralism, wage discrimination might be reduced by implementing equality campaigns, creating low-cost tests to predict workers’ productivity and abolishing power relations towards minority workers. Pluralism might be jeopardised if there is a limited desire to engage with less-dominant theoretical frameworks. Also, pluralism might be misled with rejection of dominant theories.
B54|Social Norms and Competitiveness: My Willingness to Compete Depends on Who I am (supposed to be)|Women often respond less favorably to competition than men. In this paper, we test for the effects of social norms on willingness to compete. Subjects compete in two-person teams. In the treatment, one team member is randomly assigned the role of “breadwinner”, and the other person is randomly assigned as the “supporter”. There are no real differences between the roles in our experiment, except for the framing. These two roles have opposite social norms for competitiveness, reminiscent of gender roles in western society. In the baseline, subjects compete in two-person teams without role assignment. We find women’s willingness to compete significantly increases when they are assigned as breadwinners compared to women in the base- line or female supporters. We also find that there is no gender gap in willingness to compete between female breadwinners and males in the baseline. The increase in willingness to compete is mainly contributed by high-ability women. Males are also affected by the role assignment; male supporters are less likely to enter the tournament than male breadwinners. We argue that the changes in willingness to compete are mainly driven by the social norms implied by the two roles.
B54|The influence of Sen’s applied economics on his “social choice” approach to justice: agency at the core of public action to remove injustice|Our paper shows that Sen’s (2009) alternative theory of justice is greatly influenced by 1) his work on famines ; 2) his empirical work on gender inequalities, specifically within the Indian society, that helped him to refine his approach to hunger ; and 3) his involvement in the creation of the human development approach. All these engagements — seemingly completely separate from his contribution to the theories of justice — have, in fact, fostered the formulation of a novel approach in which agency and public reasoning are the core elements.
B54|Family formation, gender and labour during the First Globalization in Montevideo, Uruguay|The aim in this research is to analyse the impact of institutions such as the family for a better comprehension of the status of women in the formation of Uruguayan society. Uruguay was a country with a large contingent of European immigrants who came mainly from Spain, followed by Italy. Although these two countries are not representative of the Western European Marriage Pattern, it will be argued that the immigration process caused a disruption of the original family patterns and led to more unstructured family formation and to weaker family ties and greater predominance of the nuclear family. Weaker family ties characterized by more egalitarian gender and intergenerational relations are supposed to allow for women to take on a less traditional role and stimulate higher female labour force participation. Our results show that the effects of migration cannot only be derived from the specific demographic, cultural and human capital profile of the immigrants, but also indirectly from the consequences of their decision to immigrate in their life courses and labour options.
B54|Spousal Violence and Social Norms in India's North East|A body of extant literature suggests that improvements in wellbeing and empowerment of women in the process of development are hindered by traditional social norms, which are often patriarchic. This paper investigates the link between traditional social norms and women’s status, in particular, the women's attitude towards violence and incidence of spousal violence. The study context is the tribes of Meghalaya and neighboring areas, where there is great variation regarding patriarchic versus matriarchic lineage, residence and inheritance customs. For the statistical analysis, we combine information on social norms prevailing among the different tribes from the comprehensive ethnographic atlas People of India with household-level data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS). In addition to individual characteristics, we find the extent to which social norms determine violence against women and under what prevailing norms working women are better-off.

B54|Do Women in Highly Qualified Positions Face Higher Work-To-Family Conflicts in Germany than Men?|Changing employment conditions lead to new chances, but also new risks for employees. In the literature, increasing permeability between occupational and private life is discussed as one special outcome of this development that employees must face, especially those in highly qualified positions. Drawing on existing research, we investigate in how far women and men in those positions differ in their perceived work-to-family conflicts (WFC), considering the mediating role of gender specific job opportunities. Referring conflicting theoretical arguments, we hypothesize that in Germany - as a conservative welfare state - women, especially those with family responsibilities, will perceive higher WFC than men in those positions. Our analysis is based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP). Using the Siegrist instrument on effort-reward imbalance we find that women in highly qualified positions perceive higher WFC than men. This association is explained by women’s lower willingness to take risks, and also party explained by lower job rewards women receive. It gets visible even more strongly if women’s lower time-based burdens in the job are controlled for. Mixed results are observed concerning associations between family responsibilities and WFC, which is in line with ambivalent results in the literature.

B54|Drivers of gendered sectoral and occupational segregation in developing countries|Occupational and sectoral segregation by gender is remarkably persistent across space and time and is a major contributor to gender wage gaps. We investigate the determinants of one-digit occupational and sectoral segregation in developing countries using a unique, household-survey based aggregate data base including 69 developing countries between 1980 and 2011. We first show that occupational and sectoral segregation has increased in more countries over time than it has decreased. Using fixed effect panel regressions, we find that income levels have no impact on occupational or sectoral segregation. Rising female labor force participation is associated with falling sectoral but increasing occupational segregation; rising education levels, either overall or for females relative to males, tends to increase rather than decrease segregation.
B54|Feministic Analysis of Arundhati Roy's Postmodern Indian Fiction: The God of Small Things|"""Objective – The aim of the research is to identify the feminist strains in the postmodern Indian Fiction The God of Small Things (TGST). The researcher has planned to investigate the text systematically for seeking feministic values. Methodology/Technique – The study reviews previous literature. Findings – Gender bias and feminism are relevant themes explored by postmodernists. Arundhati Roy portrays the predicament of women through her female characters belonging to three generations in this novel. In the novel, a sense of antagonism and division also infuse the difference senses of identity among the different generation of women. It also generates a line of the clash between the older and the younger generation. Family and political customs play a key role in disadvantaging women. Social constrains are so built up as to sanctify the persecution of women. This is because, in most of the civilizations, social structures are basically patriarchal. Arundhati's novel challenges this position, though her avowed feminist stance. Novelty – Women across the globe worldwide, nationwide, regionally and may be capable of holding the influential note of feminism and being capable of deconstructing a constructive implication of their own femaleness and womanhood after reading this paper."""
B54|Designing Women: Consumer Goods Innovations in Britain, France and the United States, 1750-1900|Economic studies typically underestimate incremental changes in consumer goods and design innovations that enhance allocative efficiency and structural dynamics. This paper assesses over 12,000 innovations by female patentees and participants in industrial fairs and prize-granting institutions in Britain, France and the United States, compared to parallel samples of some 60,000 patented and unpatented innovations by men. These data uniquely allow for the systematic assessment of women’s creativity within the nonmarket household sector and outside the patent system. The analysis distinguishes between improvements in consumer final goods, changes in designs, and other forms of technological creativity. The results indicate that women, especially nonpatentees, were significantly more likely than men to be associated with innovations in consumer final goods and design-oriented products at the boundary of art and technology. Even those who did not commercialize their products or work outside the home pursued such improvements to benefit their families. The patterns suggest that framing women’s creativity in terms of a “gender difference” rather than a “gender gap” might yield useful analytical insights. A general implication is that, by inaccurately gauging consumer innovations within the household and in the market, economic research likely underestimates the extent of technological progress and advances in welfare.
B54|The Differences Between Women Executives In Japan And Romania|FAround the world employment of women on an equal bases allows companies, industries and countries to make better use of the available talent pool, generally with potential growth implication. In Japan, since 2013, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been a ceaseless advocate for the increase in the number of female employees for the revival of the economy, and many governmental programs in support of working women have been put in place. However, the traditional Japanese management systems of lifetime employment, enterprise unions, seniority systems, together with a group-oriented and risk-adverse orientation make things change slowly. In Romania, the second country analyzed in this article, women entrepreneurs also face professional stereotypes, difficulties in getting specific jobs, traditional prejudices and a collective mentality related to women’s place in society. This article explores and compares how Romanian and Japanese cultures, societies, and economies have either encouraged, or discouraged, the growth of female entrepreneurship on their own territories, and analyzes how the best emerging female executives can be supported in the future in order to maximize their potential. The analysis is based on the data provided by OECD, the World Bank, the Global entrepreneurship monitor, Japan statistics, the legislations of the two countries and the literature related to the two social environments. The findings indicate that although there are many similarities between the two countries, the percentage of female executives in Japan is much smaller than the one in Romania. This is due to the fact that Japan, with all the governmental programs in action, for the moment, still has a stricter social and work environment, a weaker maternity and childcare legislation and a higher gender gap.
B54|Women Empowerment Index: Construction of a Tool to Measure Rural Women Empowerment Level in India|Poverty ignites the societal gap between men and women, while economic development narrows it down through its gender promotional activities. There is bidirectional relationship between economic development and empowerment of women. Women empowerment, being dependent on complex sociological and economic issues, needs to be measured in terms of specific parameters like ‘access to resources’, ‘decision making capability’ and ‘ability to take a stand’. This particular study develops an Index based on few sector-specific parameters to measure empowerment level of women engaged in Self Help Groups. Both ‘individual empowerment index’ and ‘group empowerment indices’ have been constructed, where‘financial liberty’, ‘ability to take decisions’, ‘heath condition of the women and ‘ability to stand up against the evils of the society’ have been considered as her empowerment parameters. The index was applied on 300 SHG Group members of rural West Bengal, which provided us an idea about the existing level of rural women empowerment in West Bengal.
B54|Gendered careers: women economists in Italy|Recent reforms of the Italian university system introduced a centralized national qualification competition (called ASN), necessary for accessing all academic positions in the country. Following a well-known international trend, the new mechanism is founded on rigid standardized indexes of “scientific productivity” based on bibliometric indicators. In economics, women’s lower success rate (35%) compared to men’s (44%) is often connected to lower productivity. We provide evidence matching all candidates’ CVs with their record of publications on EconLit, showing that women’s typical career profiles, e.g. in terms of type of publications, topics and methods of inquiry, were penalized regardless of scientific productivity. Our work aims not only at documenting, through a large scale natural experiment, the causes of the underrepresentation of women in academia (especially in top positions) and within economics, but also at raising the issue of new incentives and constrains that increasingly push women to uniform their careers and their research interests to those of their men colleagues.
B54|Microfinance and Gender: Issues, Challenges and The Road Ahead| This special collection examines the claim that microfinance promotes gender equality. The focus is on three areas of the debate: first, the question of how successful microfinance has been in empowering women; second, whether and how negative gender discrimination operates within the sector; third, how power relations within and beyond the household shape the context and outcomes of microfinance initiatives. The papers in this collection demonstrate the divergence of circumstances and emphasise the need to go beyond the past searches for a simple narrative regarding the impact of microfinance. Rather, as the sector evolves and is incorporated into the mainstream financial system, the challenge ahead for researchers is to marshal the evidence on gendered dynamics to ensure that the gains made are built on through deeper understanding of why impact outcomes and processes differ and use this to inform new initiatives to further gender equality.
B54|Are all researchers male? Gender misattributions in citations|Abstract I screen academic literature for cases of misattribution of cited author’s gender. While such mistakes are overall not common, their frequency depends dramatically on the gender of the cited author. Female scholar are cited as if they were male more than ten times more often than the opposite happens, probably revealing that citers are influenced by the gender-science stereotype. The gender of the citing author and the field of study appear to have only limited effect.
B54|Gendered Effects of the Personal Income Tax: Evidence from a Schedular System with Individual Filing in a Developing Country|This article analyzes the gender differences in the Personal Income Tax (PIT)-to-income ratio in Uruguay. Although the tax code does not explicitly specify gender differences, the tax burden varies among households types. When analyzing these differences, our findings suggest that the PIT serves as somewhat of an incentive towards equal gender time allocation within the family, which is consistent with gender equity. In turn, this pattern is reinforced by non-desirable aspects such as higher levels of informality among women and a higher level of non-taxable sources of income among single female households. The above conclusion relies on the assumption of individual filing. Our analysis also observes that the strengths of the PIT system from the gender perspective are eroded by the possibility to opt for a (rarely used) joint filing. The empirical strategy was assessed through the estimation of a zero-one inflated beta model (ZOIB). This model properly addresses the fact that the PIT-to-income ratio includes many zero data points.
B54|The Political Economy of State Regulation : The Case of the English Factory Acts|This paper proposes a theory of why the state enacted social policy that regulated the length of the working day in 19th century industrial England. This paper will argue that, far from being capable of self-regulation, the capitalist labor market during Britainâ€™s industrial revolution is best conceptualized as consisting of two major social coordination problems resulting from conflicting interests between and within capital and labor. Left unregulated, this dual social coordination problem caused the overexploitation of labor, with dire consequences for both the capitalist and working classes. The reason why this coordination problem could not self-correct was because the wage-labor bargain contained the externality of unwaged household labor. The existence of this externality became deleterious to firmsâ€™ profitability and workersâ€™ survival, especially given the high levels of female labor force participation. This social coordination problem justified and required state regulation into industrial relations. By conceptualizing protective policy as the solution to a dual social coordination problem caused by conflicting interests among heterogeneous firms and workers, this paper extends the Polanyian framework with an explicit theory of exploitation based on the classical theory of competition and a feminist emphasis on social reproduction and unwaged labor.
B54|Male Is a Gender, Too: A Review of Why Gender Matters in Economics by Mukesh Eswaran|Mukesh Eswaran's Why Gender Matters in Economics presents a generally well-researched review of the literature on women and economics, and admirably attempts take a global perspective. Eswaran's analysis is compromised, however, by an unreflective use of perspectives and methods that themselves, when seen in a broader perspective, reflect gendered biases. With particular reference to Eswaran's discussions of gender differences in preferences, the preferential treatment of groups, and work/family issues, this essay outlines how these biases arise, and how economic analysis must change if it is to become more rigorous.
B54|Gender roles as indicator of academic failure|Recent empirical literature has highlighted that boys and girls show differences in academic performance. The present study intends to disentangle the contribution of some –less well-known– factors to that gender gap between boys’ and girls’ achievement in the fourth level of secondary education. To this aim we use recent methodological advances in decomposition techniques applied to a rich dataset with information not only on students’ personal characteristics and family environment, but also on real scores –as marked by teachers–, academic track elections and expectations for academic success. Not surprisingly, we observe that girls are more likely to get better marks than boys, whereas boys are more likely to get the worst grades and to fail. More interestingly, expectations and post-compulsory academic elections have been found to explain most of this gap in favor of girls, denoting that girls are more responsible in the achievement of their goals and present higher productivity in studying, while boys rely more on their innate skills to pass. This could be highlighting gender differential attitudes and roles towards academic achievement, what denotes the need to perform policy interventions to the extent that academic achievement will condition career progression.
B54|Gender, institutions and educational achievement: a cross country comparison|An issue in the literature on educational production functions is the contribution of variables related to students’ lifestyles towards explaining the gender gap in terms of educational achievement. We intend to shed further light on this issue by means of empirical evidence based on international data from 22 countries. In order to carry out this research, we analyze the effect of a set of variables from different international surveys that allow the study of the potential country-level factors which could influence this gap. Our results show that it is essential to foster entrepreneurship attitudes among tertiary education students. On the contrary, until high school education years it could be counterproductive. It is also relevant to enhance girls’ self-confidence in business management abilities, as they show a higher average risk-aversion than boys and they are also more affected by a range of gender stereotypes.
B54|Determinants of participation in self-help-groups (SHG) and its impact on women empowerment|Purpose - The purpose of this study is to gain meaningful insights into a microfinance programme in two different agro-ecological settings in India. The study, using primary survey data, attempts to examine individual, household and environmental characteristics that determine participation in a self-help group (SHG)–bank linkage programme in Odisha. Design/methodology/approach - Primary data are collected by a stratified random sampling method. The sample size is 300 households and information is collected by canvassing a pre-designed schedule to women through door-to-door in-depth interviews. In addition, focus group discussions have been conducted to get qualitative information. A probit binary model is applied to examine the factors determining participation in a SHG–bank linkage programme. A composite index of women empowerment is computed taking three dimensions: autonomy, economic empowerment and the gender relationship. Further, ordinary least square multiple regression and treatment effect evaluation by propensity score matching is carried out to study the impact of participation on women empowerment. Findings - The study finds that the programme has by-passed the poorest of the poor. It is observed, however, that participation in microfinance has a positive and significant impact on women empowerment. Research limitations/implications - Given the research methodology adopted in this study, one concern is whether the results generalise. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications - To improve status of women particularly in developing and underdeveloped regions, microfinance can act as a catalyst. Social implications - Microfinance in the form of SHG–bank linkage should be promoted, particularly for those social groups and religious communities where women are discriminated. Their participation in SHG–bank linkage programme will improve their social status through empowerment. Originality/value - This study illustrates how microfinance can improve the status of women.
B54|How to Attract an Audience at a Conference: Paper, Person or Place?|We analyze the drivers of the size of the audience and number of questions asked in parallel sessions at the annual conference of the German Economics Association. We find that the location of the presentation is at least as important for the number of academics attending a talk as the combined effect of the person presenting and the paper presented. Being a presenter in a late morning session on the second day of a conference, close to the place where coffee is served, significantly increases the size of the audience. When it comes to asking questions, location becomes less important, but smaller rooms lead to more questions being asked (by women). Younger researchers as well as very senior researchers attract more questions and comments. There are also interesting gender effects. Women attend research sessions more diligently than men, but seem to ask fewer questions than men. Men are less likely to attend presentations on health, education, welfare, and development economics than women. Our findings suggest that strategic scheduling of sessions could ensure better participation at conferences. Moreover, different behaviors of men and women at conferences might also contribute to the lack of women in senior scientist positions.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B54|What are production, work and consumption? Trans-historical re-conceptualisations|This paper argues for trans-historical reformulations of the basic economic concepts of production, work and consumption. The definition of the production boundary by System of National Accounts (SNA) is inconsistent from a scientific point of view. For example, while some non-market and illegal services are viewed as productive, others are not, and services and goods are treated differently. The definition proposed by feminist economics, the so-called third person criterion, is consistent, but in need for further development; furthermore, it is a definition of work and not of production. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether it is possible to formulate a non-eclectic set of logically consistent definitions that could be considered variations of a common underlying understanding across various theoretical traditions – mainly Classical, Neoclassical, Institutional, Marxist, Feminist and Keynesian Economics – of how humans consciously change external nature in order satisfy human needs. Important issues concern how to deal with violence, double counting of transaction costs, human capital formation, non-market activities and causation of final consumption. Production, work and consumption are defined as relations between events, the subject matter and the agent, and in the main definitions reduced to non-economic sentences. Even the utility concept is avoided. First-order logic is used, complemented with modal operators for some of the sentences. In this study, it is shown that production, work and consumption all share the common feature of intentional physical transformation of the intrinsic properties of the subject matter. The object transformed during the productive activity and work must at some point in time be external to the agent. For work, the purpose of transforming an external object must not lie in the transformation of the agent. A productive activity must potentially be able to cause the satisfaction of human needs, or final consumption, which is not a condition for work or required by the third-person criterion. Final consumption involves the transformation of the subject matter that is a final purpose for the consumer or serves as a purpose for transforming the consumer. Using a criterion applied by the institutional economist Cheung to identify transaction costs, this study defines social reproduction as an activity that would not occur in a Robinson Crusoe economy. Social reproduction occurs under an institutional setting. We can further differentiate between coercive and non-coercive social reproduction. In this study, eight different definitions of production are presented. The definition of agent external production is close to the third person criterion, but the possible causation of future final consumption is included as a condition for a productive activity. It is also related to the basic neoclassical model with its assumptions of no transaction costs. The definition of agent external non-coercive production entails that transformations of persons against their own will, whether legally or illegally performed, are unproductive activities. The definition of agent external non-social production entails that all socially reproductive activities are unproductive, and comes close to the distinction made by Classical and Marxist economists of productive and unproductive work. Humanity external production only includes the transformation of non-persons. The three definitions of time scale invariant production entails that human capital formation could be considered productive activities. Market production comes close to Keynesian theory and the present definition of SNA, with the difference that it excludes non-market goods production. The present study also opens for the possibility of unproductive work, for example failed production or professional murder, and productive final consumption that does not involve any work, for example hobby-hunting, play with children or research activity for own pleasure. Which definition of production is applied greatly affects the modelling and empirical application of growth theory and the analysis of the driving forces in economic history. For example, assume trade causes labour productivity outside of trade to increase four-fold due to specialisation, while the share of GDP in total working time increases from nil to half. With the same value added per productive hour and with total hours worked kept constant, the value added of agent external production then records a four-fold increase, while that of non-social production only a doubling. Similarly, during wars the SNA GDP often increases substantially, while the concept of agent external non-coercive production entails that all war expenses are treated as unproductive. Time frame invariant production grows faster than agent external production during expansions of the education system. Market production could serve important analytical purposes, for example to investigate the relation between money supply and inflation, but should be rid of inconsistencies such as the inclusion of non-market goods production.
B54|'Even' After Access to Financial Services? Ricocheting Gender Equations|The paper focuses on women's financial behaviour in their use of higher order financial services in Ghana and South Africa, inviting a gendered and social analysis of deconstructing financial behaviour. Women in South Africa are more likely to use general financial products than in Ghana, though in general more men use advanced investment products. Race has an important effect in South Africa. Much of these gender differentials is related to differences in gendered behaviour, yet generalizations on how gender relates to risk aversion is not supported. Rather non-financial approaches may explain how social relations propel women's decision to prioritise the use of financial services as a result of ascribed gender and social roles. These findings contribute to the debates on the feminisation of finance, as women are increasingly interpellated as financial subjects, manifesting the gendered organisation of global financial structures that operate on gendered norms and behaviour.
B54|Conditions for high-potential female entrepreneurship|Female-led ventures that are market-expanding, export-oriented, and innovative contribute substantially to local and national economic development, as well as to the female entrepreneur’s economic welfare. Female-led ventures also serve as models that can encourage other high-potential female entrepreneurs. The supply of high-potential entrepreneurial ventures is driven by individuals’ entrepreneurial attitudes and institutional factors associated with a country’s conditions for entrepreneurial expansion. A systematic assessment of those factors can show policymakers the strengths and weaknesses of the environment for high-potential female entrepreneurship.
B54|Women, Work and Welfare in the Middle East and North Africa:The Role of Socio-demographics, Entrepreneurship and Public Policies|In the aftermath of the Arab Spring, and in light of socio-economic and geopolitical challenges facing governments old and new, women's rights and empowerment have gained new urgency and relevance. Groups in power, or groups contesting for power, are more conservative than expected, and there are serious threats to roll back some of the gains women had achieved over the past 20–30 years on economic and social fronts.
B54|Women, Work, and Welfare in the Middle East and North Africa: Introduction and Overview|Providing an empirical and conceptual context for the volume, this chapter discusses patterns and trends in women's social and economic participation in the region, draws together the themes explored in individual chapters, and offers policy recommendations and suggestions for future research. Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries have made good progress in educating women, whose schooling attainments often outstrip those of men, and in reducing fertility rates, but most of MENA women remain out of the labor force, and those who do work outside the home face a wide range of difficulties associated with their gender. Having so few women working is costly for the countries in the region, limiting their economic size and growth prospects. From a policy perspective, it is important to understand why so few women work. Reasons include discriminatory practices in the workplace and difficulty in obtaining access to credit and productive assets; women's reservation wages and internalized gender roles in traditionally patriarchal societies; and discrimination by government policies against female market-based activities. The chapter seeks to understand the links between these causual factors within a coherent analytical framework that can handle both diversity and difference.
B54|Returns to Education in Palestine and Turkey: A Comparative Analysis|This study compares the private returns to education in Palestine and Turkey over the period 2004-2008. Alhough educational enrollment ratios are similar in both countries, the labor force participation of women is much lower in Palestine: such structural differences are likely to affect labor market outcomes especially along gender lines. In both countries, the results show high returns to an additional year of education at the two-year tertiary and the university levels. The returns to education are higher for females than for males in both countries, although the gender gap is larger in Palestine than in Turkey. In Turkey, with its open borders and stronger export potential, private-sector capacity is much greater than in Palestine. Workers in Turkey earn higher returns to education in both the formal and informal private sectors than do workers in Palestine, whose labor market is dominated by the government sector and the international organizations. Overall, the results imply that years of schooling and experience explain wages better in Turkey than in Palestine, and that within Palestine they explain wages better for women samples than for men.
B54|Gender Effects of Education on Economic Development in Turkey|Several empirical studies have examined the gender-differentiated effects of education on economic growth or on a steady-state level of economic output, using cross-country data to determine the quantitative importance of these effects and the direction of correlation. This chapter reports on a similar study of the gender effects of education using province-level data for Turkey. It finds that female education positively and significantly affects the steady-state level of labor productivity, while male education has either positive or insignificant effects. A separate examination of the effect of the educational gender gap finds a negative relationship with output. The results are robust to a number of sensitivity analyses, such as elimination of outlier observations, controls for simultaneity and measurement errors, controls for omitted variables through the inclusion of regional dummy variables, the use of steady-state versus growth equations, and the consideration of different samples.
B54|Gender effects of education on economic development in Turkey|Purpose - – This study is concerned with the separate output effects of female and male education, as well as output effects of the educational gender gap. Several recent empirical studies have examined the gender effects of education on economic growth or on output level using the much exploited, familiar cross-country data. This paper aims to undertake a similar study of the gender effects of education on economic growth using a panel data across the provinces of Turkey for the period 1975-2000. Design/methodology/approach - – The theoretical basis of the estimating equations is the neoclassical growth model augmented to include separate female and male education capital and health capital variables. The methodology the authors use includes robust regression on pooled panel data controlling for regional and time effects. The results are found to be robust to a number of sensitivity analyses, such as elimination of outlier observations, controls for simultaneity and measurement errors, controls for omitted variables by including regional dummy variables, steady-state versus growth equations and different samples of developed and less-developed provinces of Turkey. Findings - – The main findings indicate that female education positively and significantly affects the steady-state level of labor productivity, while the effect of male education is in general either positive or insignificant. Separate examination of the effect of educational gender gap was to reduce output. Originality/value - – As evident in the literature, there is controversy surrounding the gender effects of education on growth. This paper provides new evidence on this issue from the perspective of a single country rather than a cross-country viewpoint.
B54|Intra-Household Resource Allocation in Egypt: Effect of Power Distribution within the Household on Child Work and Schooling|This study uses data from the 2006 Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey to gauge and compare the effects on children's education and children's working hours of parent-specific characteristics, namely the educational attainment of parents and the contributions made by the mother and the father to their marriage costs. The empirical model used for this purpose is a reduced-form regression model inspired by the collective rationality model of household decision making. The analysis suggests that mothers' and fathers' characteristics have differential effects on children's education and work. The effects of parents' educational attainment are more nuanced. The findings are consistent with the assumption that the mother's and the father's relative decision making powers differently affect children's welfare, especially children's educational attainment.
B54|Gender, Resources across the Life Course, and Cognitive Functioning in Egypt|This chapter evaluates the life-course determinants of cognitive functioning among 1,003 women and men of 50 years and older in Ismailia, Egypt. Three questions motivate this analysis: (a) Do older women have poorer cognitive functioning than older men? (b) Do cognitive resources accrued in childhood and adulthood have net positive associations with later-life cognitive functioning for women and men? and (c) To what extent do differences in the amounts and effects of women's and men's cognitive resources account for gaps in their cognitive functioning? The results show that, compared to older men, older women have lower Modified-Mini Mental Status Exam (M-MMSE) scores for overall cognitive functioning. Cognitive resources in childhood and adulthood are jointly associated with the M-MMSE score. About 83 percent of the gender gap in mean M-MMSE scores is attributable to gaps in men's and women's attributes across the life course. Gender gaps in childhood cognitive resources, and especially schooling attainment, account for the largest share (18 percent) of the gender gap in cognitive functioning.
B54|Socio-Demographic and Economic Characteristics and Problems of Jordanian Female-Headed Households|This chapter uses data from a commissioned nationwide sample survey of some 1,100 female-headed households, as well as from focus groups with female household heads. Women-headed households constitute about one-tenth of Jordan's households. By region of residence, religion, and household size they differ little from households in the country at large. But nearly half of them (48 percent) are living below the poverty line, compared with about 13 percent in the population at large. Their annual spending is less than one-third of the nationwide average. Very few of the women household heads work outside the home: 78 percent of them are not and have never been employed. Their education levels are low: about 54 percent are either illiterate or have only basic schooling, and about 27 percent have secondary education. The problems faced by women household heads include malnutrition (a problem in nearly one in five of these families); social stigma attached to themselves and their children; problems in rearing their sons, many of whom drop out of school and become socially withdrawn; and pressures from their own or their husband's family. Recommendations are made for policies and other measures to assist female-headed households.
B54|Women Entrepreneurs in Egypt: Obstacles, Potential, and Prospects|Women own an estimated 10 percent of the micro and small enterprises (MSEs) in Egypt. A nationally representative survey of some 5,000 MSEs in Egypt (2003/2004) shows that women entrepreneurs seem to start their businesses from a relatively modest base, having higher illiteracy rates, more limited educational backgrounds, and more limited training and experience than their male counterparts, and often more burdensome social responsibilities, along with modest financial and non-financial resources. Their modest beginnings affect the size of their enterprises, markets, economic activities, products, and performance. Women's enterprises are, on average, smaller and less efficient than men's; they are mostly in the trade sector; more likely to be informal; and more likely to use traditional production techniques. Those in rural areas face particular disadvantages and their productivity is particularly low.
B54|Women Entrepreneurs in Lebanon: Obstacles, Potential, and Prospects|Lebanon's institutional and legal framework for small enterprises is one of gender equality. Yet women's legal status is still considered inferior to that of men by Lebanon's religious personal status courts, and a lack of reform in personal status laws considerably affects women and, especially, women entrepreneurs. Women's economic participation tends to be limited, characterized by gendered career choices, limited technical skills, and early exit from the labor force at marriage. Enterprises led by women have developed less favorably than those led by men. A sample survey of nearly 3,000 micro and small enterprises (8 percent of them led by women) shows that those run by women are mostly crowded together in the trade sector, tend to be very small, experience tougher competition than men's businesses, and achieve profitability only two-thirds that of men's. Women make very little use of business support services and also have more difficulty with taxes and tax administration, and with customs duties. Recommendations are made to increase women's access to vital business skills and to create a more favorable environment for women-owned small- and medium-size enterprises.
B54|Women Entrepreneurs in Turkey: Obstacles, Potentials, and Prospects|The male-dominated social structure in Turkey constitutes a serious barrier to women's entrepreneurship. Gender discrimination experienced by women in the private as well as the public sphere significantly limits their visible participation in the economic life outside their homes. A sample survey of nearly 5,000 Turkish micro and small enterprises (MSEs), 6 percent of them led by women, shows that women's businesses tend to be very small. Nearly half are in trade and one-third are in industry. Many of the one-person women's enterprises are in home-based manufacturing. Women entrepreneurs tend to be younger and have more education than men entrepreneurs, and about half of the women entrepreneurs were employed as wage earners before starting their own businesses. Virtually none of them made use of credit for starting their businesses and very few had access to business support services of any kind. Recommendations are made for improving the environment for women's MSEs, including establishing a Women's Entrepreneurship Center.
B54|Self-Employed Persons and Wage-Earners in Algeria: Application of a Bivariate Probit Model by Gender and Sector|This chapter provides indicators of Algerian women's economic activity and education, and their contribution to economic life. Using data from the 2003 Household Employment Survey, which covered more than 14,000 Algerian households, we analyze the socioeconomic characteristics of men and women, and then apply a bivariate probit model in which an individual's choice of occupation is associated jointly with employment status (self-employed/wage earner) and sector (urban/rural). The results show that educational level, work experience, and whether the employment is in industry or in services, all significantly affect whether men and women choose to work as wage earners or as self-employed persons. Women spend a considerable amount of time out of the labor market on child rearing and domestic tasks, and hence they have less potential work experience than men. In rural areas, women have a lower probability than men of being either self-employed or working for wages. Urban women are more educated than rural women, and therefore have better opportunities to be self-employed or wage earners. The services sector is Algeria's second-largest employer of women (administration is the largest): it is followed by agriculture and industry.
B54|Gender and Entrepreneurship in Iran|This study documents the characteristics of a sample of enterprises in Iran, applying a survey that uses the World Bank's Enterprise Survey questionnaire. It finds that, as in the rest of the region, female entrepreneurs are more prevalent in larger firms than in small-and medium-sized ones. They have a high presence in the service sector, especially in gender-segregated activities, but also in some new and growing industries such as electronics and information technology. In some cases women's businesses face gender-based disadvantages, particularly in accessing telecoms services and the Internet. Yet compared to their counterparts elsewhere in MENA, women entrepreneurs expressed fewer complaints about other aspects of business such as obtaining permits and paying taxes. The authors find that economic sanctions imposed by the West pose a major obstacle, mainly because many female-owned firms are new and tend to be technology- and trade-intensive.
B54|The Determinants of Female Labor Force Participation in the Middle East and North Africa Region: The Role of Education and Social Norms in Amman, Cairo, and Sana'a|In recent decades, the Middle East and North Africa region achieved substantial improvement in women's education, but without a commensurate increase in women's participation in the labor market. Using primary household survey data collected in 2008 in Amman, Cairo, and Sana'a, this chapter empirically investigates whether education acts as a vehicle for labor market participation among urban women. As a baseline, we investigate the determinants of female labor force participation by means of a single-equation probit model. Based on the results of the probit model, we analyze the role of social norms. Results confirm that education increases female labor supply. However, when levels of schooling are considered, only high levels of education (post-secondary/university/post-university education) show a positive and significant effect. The study also confirms the negative association between traditional attitudes and female labor supply. Thus, policies in the region that aim to raise female labor force participation need to focus more broadly than on investment in education, to take account of other economic and non-economic barriers to female labor supply. Further investment in education in itself may not achieve the full intended goal for women in the labor market.
B54|Women and Work in Dubai City: Institutional Barriers and Potentials|Using data from a survey of 1,500 households in Dubai City, this chapter explores the impacts of social, cultural, and religious factors on female labor force participation (FLFP) and finds that marriage and conservative cultural norms constitute the primary cause of economic inactivity among women. Secondary and tertiary education show positive impacts on FLFP. The impact of children is not always significant. Being expatriate has a positive impact on FLFP. Marriage has a significant negative impact on female participation. The findings suggest that changing perceptions and actions coexist with many old cultural and social norms, but also that the growing tendency is to accept the public presence and labor market participation of women. The women survey respondents expressed more conservative views than men, and expressed more support than men for cultural norms that allow for male control and limit women's freedom to move and choose employment. The younger generation (aged 15–24) expressed more conservative views than older people, despite being better educated than previous generations.
B54|Private–Public Sector Employment Choice and Wage Differentials in Palestine: A Gender Perspective|This study is the first to analyze wage differentials and sector choice by gender in Palestine. It uses Palestine Central Bureau of Statistics Labor Force Surveys for the years 1999, 2001, 2007, and 2010. The results show positive, although relatively low, returns to education at all levels. They indicate stark differences by gender from the viewpoint of sector choice, returns to education, and decomposition of sector and gender wage differentials. The low returns to education in Palestine tend to diminish the importance of the endowment effect in explaining the sector and gender wage gaps. Analysis of gender wage differentials shows that in the public sector, predicted log hourly wages are consistently higher for women than men, but in the private and ‘other’ sectors the results are mixed. Such wage differentials help explain why better educated women migrate toward the public sector, and those with lower educational levels are more likely to be found in the private sector.
B54|Offshoring and the Availability of Female Labor in the MENA Region|This chapter explores the attractiveness of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) relative to other regions for trade in services by European firms. Businesses no longer just search for low-cost labor but also seek to tap into the talent markets of emerging countries in knowledge-intensive core business functions. The availability of large talent pools that can be trained and retained is a key deciding factor in the choice of an offshore location, as is the size and the depth of the female labor force. The study finds that the MENA region has the necessary market and labor fundamentals to become a viable near-shoring destination for European firms and that it has a significant advantage associated with its female talent pool. Nonetheless, it also has highly significant disadvantages, due to impediments that women face in joining and staying in the labor market. Overall, the findings suggest that MENA may lose the competition to attract jobs in this growing global sector.
B54|Did Trade Liberalization Benefit Female Workers? Evidence from Egypt on Wage and Employment Effects|Egypt has undergone a dramatic, albeit slow, economic reform and trade liberalization that has reduced its average tariff rates by more than 50 percent over 15 years. This study investigates the extent of gender discrimination in Egyptian manufacturing, and the impact of trade reform on the gender wage gap and on female employment. Results indicate that the gender wage gap, most of which is unexplained by worker characteristics, has widened over time. Results indicate that trade liberalization is associated with a tradeoff for women in the labor market: in industries facing a larger change in the degree of import competition, there is higher female employment, but only at the expense of a wider gender wage gap. Industries facing a larger change in the degree of their export intensity, on the other hand, have witnessed a decline in their gender wage gap but also a fall in female employment. These patterns have important implications for policymakers attempting to create more equitable labor market conditions.
B54|Gender and Employment Impacts of Taxation Policy in Middle East and North A Comparative Analysis of Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia|Evidence suggests that gender inequality is likely to condition the impacts of economic policies. While gender-responsive budgeting has made significant headway into economic policy, gender-responsive taxation policy has lagged behind. Because tax policy is the most economically direct way by which governments can influence individual behavior, requests have been made for gender-responsive tax policy that promotes gender equality. This chapter analyzes the tax-policy-induced gender bias in employment in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia. The possible distortive impact of indirect taxation on male and female employment is assessed with the use of a gender-focused computable general equilibrium model. The analysis shows that indirect taxes, in particular import duties, are biased toward female employment in Algeria and Egypt, but not in Morocco and Tunisia. Female labor-intensive industries in the former countries are highly protected in the benchmark and are not competitive internationally, so that removing protection would increase competition with cheaper import substitutes and cause the sector to contract and lay off workers. In Morocco and Tunisia, female labor-intensive industries are less protected, so the removal of indirect taxes would have quasi-neutral effects between male and female salary and wage earnings.
B54|Family Planning and Female Empowerment in Iran|This chapter examines the impact of an important Iranian government policy — the construction of rural health clinics and promotion of family planning — on the fertility and education of rural women. The evidence shows that the direct effect of family planning on fertility was rather modest: at best we can attribute one-fifth of the decline in fertility to the presence of clinics in villages. But the government's push to win acceptance of family planning played a crucial role in helping women to overcome the traditional norms against women's participation in the fertility decisions of the family. The newfound ability of young rural women to seek independent advice from health practitioners shifted power over this important family decision from men and the extended family to women. At the societal level, it broadened the definition of a ‘good Muslim woman’ from one who obeys her husband and primarily engages in childbearing and domestic work, to one who has a say in important decisions about childbearing and child education.
B54|The Impact of Labor Nationalization Policies on Female Participation Rates in the Arab Gulf|Based on interviews with policymakers in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, this chapter finds that although existing labor nationalization policies have led to small increases in female participation rates, these countries will need to undertake more systemic socioeconomic reform if they are to better capitalize on the ‘valuable human resource asset’ that women are said to constitute. Compared with male nationals, female nationals in the Arabian Gulf achieve higher grades in education and obtain considerably more vocationally oriented tertiary-level qualifications. But cultural attitudes, alongside structural issues, continue to bar their employment in the private sector. The issue is of contemporary importance, as the key domestic policy challenge faced by the region is said to be growing levels of national unemployment. The challenge is compounded by the Gulf's pyramid-style demographic profile and the fact that the respective public sectors, which have been the de facto employer to date, can no longer accommodate most of the people now seeking to join the workforce. The consensus view among interviewees is that labor nationalization policy will need to feature strategies to normalize the role of women nationals pursuing a private-sector career.
B54|Productividad agrícola de la mujer rural en Colombia: ¿restricciones o decisiones?| Este documento compara productividades agrícolas entre hombres y mujeres en zonas rurales de Colombia, explicando las posibles causas de la brecha productiva entre ambos grupos. Con datos de la Encuesta Longitudinal Colombiana de La Universidad de los Andes-ELCA en 2010, se estiman diferencias de género en la productividad agrícola en 4 subregiones de Colombia (Atlántica Media, Cundí-Boyacense, Eje Cafetero y Centro Oriental). Los resultados muestran que los hogares cuyo agricultor principal es un hombre son más productivos que los hogares cuyo agricultor principal es una mujer. Mediante un análisis de mediación se encuentra que las diferencias en productividades agrícolas entre hombres y mujeres están relacionadas con diferencias en el uso de fertilizantes, maquinaria agrícola, asistencia técnica y nivel de autoconsumo del hogar.
B54|The Changing Face of Economics? Ethical Issues in Contemporary Economic Schools as a Consequence of Changes in the Concept of Human Nature|The last financial crisis combined with some recent social trends (like growing inequality or environmental problems) inspired many contemporary economists to the re-evaluation of actual economic knowledge in the search for solutions to these problems. Modern economic schools (especially heterodox ones) stress the meaning of ethical issues in economics more often. The thesis of the paper is that this revival of the ethical face of present economics depends very strongly on the changing assumptions of human nature within economics and other disciplines which work alongside economics, such as social psychology or business ethics, for instance. In order to prove the thesis, the paper provides an evaluation of current economic schools, especially within the heterodoxy, in search of their ethical aspects, and presents them as a result of the changing assumptions about human beings within those schools. This ethical dimension of human beings manifests itself in different ways, which can be perceived as a result of it being based on different ethical schools and different psychological and philosophical assumptions about human nature. Therefore, the paper also considers the current developments of the view on human beings in contemporary schools of economic ethics.
B54|Economics as a Discipline of Instrumental Reason. Looking at Economics as a Science from the Perspective of the Frankfurt School of Philosophy|The article is built around the analysis of The critique of instrumental reason by Horkheimer, applied to issues connected with the philosophy of economics. Positive economics is under-stood as an example of a discipline where the pragmatic paradigm has been implemented. Therefore, economics functions within the boundaries of what Horkheimer called instrumental rationality. The starting point is the intellectual source shared by economics and the Frankfurt School, namely Kant’s philosophy of rationality. In the first part of the article, three of Kant’s ideas that are fundamental to economics are presented, and then the development of their application in philosophy of science, as seen by Horkheimer in 1947, is laid out. The second part of the article consists of enumerating various distinctive features of economics that set it apart from other social sciences and which constitute factors for which it can be considered a realm of the reign of ‘instrumental rationality’, with all the threats such an approach provokes. The above-mentioned features concentrate on treating humans in economics as a means, not as a goal. This aspect of the philosophy of science of the Frankfurt School (unlike its critique of capitalism as an economic system) has not been widely received.
B54|Well-Paid Nurses are Good Nurses|Some recent articles suggest that increasing wage in the nursing market with the aim of reducing shortage may yield a negative effect on the average ability and motivation of applicants attracted and, in turn, on the average quality of care. This finding is at odds with empirical evidence and has been criticized on the grounds that nurses' motivation is modeled in an overly simplistic way. The present paper provides a novel theoretical framework where the orientation of nurses' motivation - intrinsic versus extrinsic - is taken into account, and the precise distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation is delineated on the basis of self-determination and person-environment fit theories. Findings show that high wages attract able and motivated individuals, thus maximizing the average quality of care. This result reconciles theory with evidence.
B54|Principales aportes de las mujeres al pensamiento económico entre los siglos XVIII-XX|El Propósito central del presente escrito es destacar ciertos estudios realizados por pensadoras entre los siglos XVIII y XX, que han contribuido significativamente al desarrollo al pensamiento económico, principalmente a las líneas clásica y marxista, con el interés de resaltar su papel en la construcción de dichas teorías económicas. De este modo, a partir de una revisión bibliográfica se logra rescatar las ideas de varias mujeres que expusieron importantes puntos de vista teóricos, y que por razones sociales, culturales, entre otras, quedaron -en su mayoría- bajo la sombra de otro autor, o simplemente no tuvieron la divulgación necesaria para su reconocimiento académico.
B54|Hogares y Cuidado Doméstico no Remunerado en Colombia|En el presente artículo se estudian las actividades de cuidado no remunerado realizadas en los hogares Colombianos. Los datos empleados fueron obtenidos de la primera Encuesta Nacional de Uso del Tiempo (ENUT) realizada en Colombia -por el Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadísticas (DANE)- durante el segundo trimestre de 2012 y el primer trimestre de 2013. El artículo tiene tres partes: en la primera se aborda teóricamente el concepto de cuidado doméstico realizado en los hogares, en la segunda se analiza la naturaleza de los servicios de cuidado realizadas en los hogares colombianos, se estima su magnitud y se exploran algunos de sus determinantes socioeconómicos. Por último, en la tercera sección se presentan las conclusiones principales.
B54|An Application of Partial Least Squares to the Construction of the Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) and the Corruption Perception Index (CPI)|Abstract Composite indices used in social science research often rely on principal components analysis (PCA) as a way to derive weights for component variables, which emphasizes the largest variations in the variables in a composite index. However, PCA may not work when the informative variations account for only a small share of the variance in the variables; also, the best weighting scheme may also depend on the use of a particular composite index. We consider partial least squares (PLS) as an alternative weighting scheme, which takes advantage of the relationship between outcome variables of interest and the variables in a composite index. In this paper, the Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI), a composite index produced by the OECD, is re-constructed using weights generated by PCA and PLS. Using the revised SIGIs and female education, fertility, child mortality, and corruption as outcome variables, we investigate the relationship between social institutions related to gender inequality and these development outcomes, controlling for relevant other determinants. We find that gender inequality in social institutions has a significant correlation with fertility and corruption regardless of the weighting procedure, while for female education and child mortality only the SIGIs based on PLS show significant results. Additionally, PLS brings benefits in terms of prediction compared to PCA for female education and child mortality. In our analysis of corruption, we consider not only the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) as our measure of corruption, but also create new reweighted CPIs again using PLS and PCA as weighting procedures. The CPI based on PCA shows a significant correlation with gender inequality, while the correlation is only marginally significant when using the PLS.
B54|Husbandry: A (Feminist) Reclamation of Masculine Responsibility for Care|While extremely important and revolutionary, much feminist work on the economics of care has risked reinforcing an association of care with only women and with only womenâ€™s traditional activities. This essay revives the image of â€œhusbandry,â€ understood as careful cultivation, tending, and management, as a complement to the image of mothering. A rich masculine prototype of care may be helpful in re-awakening male responsibility for care, and revitalizing the recognition of the necessity of concern and carefulness in all of economic life. The ''good husbandman'', in stark contrast to â€œeconomic man,â€ lives a fuller life, acting responsively and responsibly. This essay lays out the need for such a rich image; suggests applications to the environment, carework, and business management; and addresses some possible drawbacks.
B54|A Veblenian articulation of the monetary theory of production|The article presents a further articulation of the monetary theory of production inspired by the writings of Thorstein Veblen. Particularly I offer a formulation of the monetary theory of production as part of broader theorizing about social provisioning and the life process. This includes an analytical focus on non-commodities; an extension of the Veblenian dichotomy to non-market activities; discussion of Veblen’s theory of social valuation in connection to monetary theory of production and class; delineation of as social processes that constitute social provisioning and their commodity and non-commodity aspects. The goal is bridging the gap between monetary theory of production and analysis of “the social”.
B54|Women entrepreneurship. Changes in access to credit and business results (2003-2013)|The research on women entrepreneurship has mainly studied these topics: i) the characteristics and motivations (Brush and Hisrich, 1991; Pablo-MartÃ­ et al., 2014), ii) the strategic choice (Verheul et al., 2008), iii) the role of leadership (Schwartz, 1976; Justo et al. 2006)), iv) the entry barriers (Brush and Gatewood, 2008), mainly access to funding (Klapper and Parker, 2010), and v) the performance and achieved results (Coleman and Robb, 2009; DÃ­az and JimÃ©nez, 2010; Crespo-Espert et al., 2012). These topics have been well studied. However, further research on this field is required. The long period of crisis from 2007 on has changed some of the findings related to these issues. This is especially significant in the most affected economies such as those of the southern countries of the EU. In these countries the severity of the crisis has had significant consequences for the productive sector (destruction of companies, high unemployment, credit restrictions) and on public finances under severe uncertainty (sovereign debt crisis, banking crisis). This is generating major changes in productive activity and business competitiveness, which is associated with the deleveraging of companies, as well as the varying prevalence of smaller companies (SMEs) in the economies. In this context, it may be hypothesized that the progress and results of activities led by women entrepreneurs had significant changes between the period before the crisis and the current stage of uncertain recovery. In this paper we analysed the dynamics and evolution of entrepreneurial activity of women in Spain in the period 2003-2013. It includes a stage of strong expansion and other recessive. Also, the research focuses on the differences found in two of the topics listed above: a) the obstacles in accessing to funding and b) the results of businesses women-owned compared to those of male-owned businesses. We made use of the SABI database. It includes information from the commercial registers. It has over one million companies with employees that represent most of the Spanish companies. The samples for this study differentiate whether the company is owned by a man or a woman. These samples are representative for company sizes, sectors and regions. Thus the results that adopt a regional approach can be segmented for a better understanding of the different types of women's businesses. The variables of the study are some financial indicators: credit ratio, debt ratio, productivity, EBITDA over assets, EBITDA over turnover, economic profitability and financial profitability. We employ various dummies to control for differences in size, sector and location of firms. The results allow understanding the different behaviour of women entrepreneurs and its reasons. They can also serve to develop new entrepreneurship policies related to gender in economic recovery.
B54|Attracting Attentive Academics. Paper, Person or Place?|We examine the determinants of the number of attendees and questions and comments in parallel sessions at a large economics conference. We use the annual meeting of the German economics association in 2012 in G ttingen as an empirical case study. We find that the place (close to the coffee and before lunch) of the presentation is most important for attendance, whereas the person and the paper presented has a minor effect on other academics attending the presentation. However, papers with long titles as well as those by junior researchers attract significantly fewer attendees. There are also interesting and sizable gender effects. Sessions by female presenters are frequented more, but mainly because more women attend sessions in general, and sessions with female presenters in particular. Female researchers are also interested in different topics than male researchers. When it comes to asking questions, location becomes less important, but smaller rooms lead to more questions asked. Younger researchers attract more questions. Women ask fewer questions, but a large share of women increases the likelihood of a woman to ask a question. Our findings suggest that scheduling sessions should be taken more seriously to ensure better participation at conferences, and to take into account differences in preferences between men and female researchers.
B54|Gender Differences in Attitudes Toward Debt and Financial Position: The Impact of the Great Recession| We use the 2007 and 2010 Surveys of Consumer Finances (SCF) and a difference-in-differences approach to investigate whether the Great Recession differentially affected the attitudes of men and women towards taking on debt, as well as whether it affected the relative financial position of women. In order to separate the influence of gender per seÂ from the influences of household composition and intra-household bargaining, we compare never-married women to never-married men. We also compare never-married women to all households. We find that the Great Recession gave never-married women the confidence to use debt to mitigate short-term threats to living standards while making them more cautious about taking on debt for non-essentials. The financial position of women in 2010 improved relative to the position of men and relative to all households.
B54|Productividad agrícola de la mujer rural en Colombia: ¿restricciones o decisiones?|Este documento compara productividades agrícolas entre hombres y mujeres en zonas rurales de Colombia, explicando las posibles causas de la brecha productiva entre ambos grupos. Con datos de la Encuesta Longitudinal Colombiana de La Universidad de los Andes-ELCA en 2010, se estiman diferencias de género en la productividad agrícola en 4 subregiones de Colombia (Atlántica Media, Cundí-Boyacense, Eje Cafetero y Centro Oriental). Los resultados muestran que los hogares cuyo agricultor principal es un hombre son más productivos que los hogares cuyo agricultor principal es una mujer. Mediante un análisis de mediación se encuentra que las diferencias en productividades agrícolas entre hombres y mujeres están relacionadas con diferencias en el uso de fertilizantes, maquinaria agrícola, asistencia técnica y nivel de autoconsumo del hogar
B54|Don’t ask don’t tell (that you’re poor). Sexual orientation and social exclusion in Italy|The role and extent of sexual orientation discrimination is the focus of a growing body of literature in economics and in other social sciences, across a wide range of social domains. This work aims at providing a holistic approach to the assessment of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people's life experience by developing a synthetic index of social inclusion. This is obtained by aggregating several variables pertaining to the following domains: monetary poverty, labour market attachment, housing conditions, subjective well-being, and education. We focus on the case of Italy due to the availability of a peculiar dataset that allows us to distinguish LGB people who are open about their sexuality and those who choose not to declare it. The empirical analysis highlights a lower level of inclusion of individuals in same-sex couples that cannot be explained by other observable characteristics. Thus, it may denote a lack of equal opportunities and a need for adequate inclusion policies. Being publicly open about one's sexuality is found as a crucial correlate of the welfare of LGB people, to an extent so far neglected by the literature.
B54|Social Change and Women Entrepreneurship in Algeria|Algerian women had a culture of staying at home, but with the beginning of this century, the Algerian women are holding positions of responsibility. Many of them chose to be entrepreneurs, which demonstrate that the country is living profound social and cultural changes. The current environment in Algeria promotes access to education and training for girls, but the socio-cultural environment remains a difficult obstacle to overcome for women. Few years ago, to see women as entrepreneurs was inconceivable in a male and conservative society. Despite the improving economy, Algeria is experiencing a high rate of unemployment, including the young graduates. This motivated the state to adopt a policy of youth employment, by granting them financial facilities, in order to create their own businesses. These factors have encouraged women who graduated to venture into entrepreneurship businesses. 22 female entrepreneurs were interviewed and the impact of social, cultural changes and attitudes in Algerian society were explored. The results from this study showed that the Algerian society is undergoing big socio-cultural changes and women entrepreneurs became a usual matter in Algeria. In spite of this facts, the majority of them complain of socio-cultural constraints. The purpose of this paper is to study the socio-cultural changes and constraints of women entrepreneurs in Algeria. It also highlights the support received by them from their families, to confront the constraints of a male society.
B54|Cultural and Socio Economic Experiences of Female Entrepreneurs in Brazil and the United States: An Exploratorial and Empirical Analysis|Over the last twenty years female entrepreneurs have been increasing in numbers in economies of developing and developed nations across the world. But although female entrepreneurship participation rates have increased worldwide, it appears that economic and socio cultural patterns still prescribe whether a female can become or want to become an entrepreneur in her society. This qualitative exploratory study investigates the phenomenon of female entrepreneurship comparing female entrepreneurship in two contexts: Brazil and the United States. The economic differences on a macro level between these two countries have been well documented and national socio cultural differences have been discussed. But very little has been focused at the individual level of the female entrepreneur per se, that is, how they perceive and experience the economic and the social cultural macro environment with their businesses. This research attempts to fill this gap and this was done by reviewing the literature and by analyzing the responses from interviews with 60 female entrepreneurs in Brazil and in the United States. The findings indicated that the female entrepreneurs from both countries share similarities in motivation for starting the business in terms of pull factors, such as search for financial independence, want to be one’s own boss, need for autonomy, and self actualization. The women from both groups also identified customer satisfaction and recognition from society as key elements for success. The perception of gender barriers was shared by both groups but other factors such as religion were emphasized only by the Americans. Networking was perceived as important, but different patterns of networking emerged among the Brazilians and the Americans. Definitions of success also differ among the women independent from their nationality. This research contributed to an increased understanding of the process of female entrepreneurship as it related to how economic and socio cultural forces influence these processes. The findings indicated that the female entrepreneurship process becomes a combination of two processes: a person driven process and a response to environment process.
B54|Women Entrepreneurship Through “Self Help Group” in YSR District, India|The position of women and their status in any society is an index of its civilization. Women are to be considered as equal partners in the process of development. But, because of centuries of exploitation and subjugation, Indian women have remained at the receiving end. Women in India have been the neglected lot. The rate of growth of women employment in India is very low. This is because of the low growth rate of new and productive employment. The more attractive scheme with less effort is “Self Help Group” under micro finance. It is a tool to remove poverty and improve the women entrepreneurship and financial support in India. ASHGs is a small economically homogeneous affinity group of the rural poor voluntarily coming together to save small amount regularly. The present paper is mainly focusing the women entrepreneurship and economic empowerment of women after they joining SHGs in YSR District, A.P. India. It concluded that SHG movement in study area has helped in improving the economic status of the families.
B54|Female Entrepreneurship and the Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry: Economic Emancipation and Clout for Pakistani Women|massive impact on the societies in South Asia. Pakistan is a Muslim society that has lived side by side with the culture driven religion of the Indian society. There are numerous cultural overlaps though Muslim characteristic is an identity and practical way of life. In defining the entrepreneurial portrait of a Muslim female entrepreneur in Pakistan it has to be borne in mind that culture plays the dominant role as the hurdle. There is so much of complexity in the culture of South Asia that Amartiya Sen raises the question “How much of this can a foreigner with no more them a cursory knowledge of the factors involved – feel and respond to? --- and consequently warp the judgment”. And furthermore Roomi (2005) contends women face deep rooted discriminating cultural and social factors that hamper their growth. Yet the empowerment of women in Pakistan has come about following the example of Prophet Muhammad’s (SAW) wife Khadija (RA). This contradiction in terms and this evolution among Muslim women is a subject of interest to researcher what inhibits the growth of female entrepreneurs in a Muslim society like Pakistan. The objective of this paper is to bring out for the benefit of the global community the nature of the environment and the impact of customs, traditions and culture and deterring factors of religious entrepreneurism. Existing literature on female entrepreneurship has been reviewed and especially the role of the Diana Project. But the constraint was owing to limited literature on female entrepreneurs of the Muslim of South Asia and Pakistan in particular qualitative methodology, in-depth interviews and case studies were adopted. The surveys recorded and transcribed the responses. The findings indicate that under the garb of religion, false philosophy is practiced. Women have discovered clout comes from having platform and hence the long down struggle to setup the Women Chamber of Commerce & Industry. Conducting the paper has identified that there is not enough literature on this subject. Yet it is still surviving on the theoretical aspect of papers written on Western society by the Western researchers. Research must now look beyond the current limited and scope go for studying the various culturally linked factors and how to change the future growth of female entrepreneurship.
B54|Maybe He’s Just Better Than You”: Generation X Women and Higher Education|The next five years will be significant in international higher education as the baby boomer generation leaves our campuses. What legacy will they leave and how will the next generations manage the ‘leaderist’ turn in universities? This article enters the tight cluster of gender, generation and leadership, and probes how masculine ideologies of achievement, power and recognition can be critiqued and challenged. Recognizing Laura Bates ‘everyday sexism’ project, my piece names the daily structures, stories and scenarios that undermine and minimize women in universities.

This case study discusses in detail the education acquired by the entrepreneur, her vision, initiative, development and operation of the venture, growth enjoyed in the last few years and the plans for future expansion. It also showcases how this woman entrepreneur was successful in creating innumerable jobs in the society, besides earning a livelihood for herself.
B54|Well-being and social development in the context of gender equality|"This paper concentrates on the three major fields listed in its title: the notion of well-being, the understanding of social development and efforts for gender equality. Due to the complexity and diversity of approaches, all of them are shown in the light of different theories, which to some extent I try to reflect in this paper. Additionally, to meet the goal of the ""Gender equality and quality of life"" project, that is construction of a new indicator, I summarise the existing indexes on well-being and gender and juxtapose them in tables. This provides readers with a clear picture of the focus areas and development trends of these measures, followed by the message they send. Critical reflection on the presented models and the final discussion might help in future work on quality of life and gender equality issues as well as their measurement and interpretations."
B54|From Monetary Theory of Production to Culture-Nature Life Process:Feminist-Institutional Elaborations of Social Provisioning|The article seeks to contribute to the literature on social provisioning as an organizing concept in heterodox economics. Particularly, the article details social provisioning as an amalgamation of processes and as a part of a system of culture-nature life process. First, the article delineates a categorization of social provisioning activities with respect to motivation in their organization – monetary and non-monetary, emphasizing the differences, as well as links between those. Second, the article discusses valuation of social activities, applying institutional theory. Third, the concept of a social process is delineated. It is argued that the concept captures agency and structure without reducing one to the other, and allows for theorizing open-endedness of social provisioning. The fourth section offers a categorization of processes and briefly explains each one of those, conceptualizing social provisioning within a historical culture-nature life process. Finally, the article concludes.

B54|Trends in Gender Equality in the UK, 1968 to 2012: Four Barriers to ¡®Equal Pay¡¯ for Women|This paper disaggregates the pay gap between men and women into four possible ¡®barriers¡¯: access to paid work; part-time versus full-time jobs; entrance into higher-paid jobs; and similar pay for equivalent work. UK data from 1968 to 2012 are analyzed, to investigate these possible barriers. All four barriers have persisted for decades, and all four ¡®barriers¡¯ tend to work in favour of men. There is evidence of progress in gender equality since 1968 ¨C for example, the 1970 ¡®Equal Pay Act¡¯ and 1975 ¡®Sex Discrimination Act¡¯ seem to have reduced inequality; but some forms of discrimination seem immune to attempted equality legislation and change.

B54|Penalización del Aborto y Sin Taxes en Chile: ¿Se Puede Alegar Paternalismo de Estado?|Dentro de la literatura económica un “sin tax” es un impuesto específico que grava un bien o actividad considerado como pecaminoso o dañino para la sociedad. En los últimos años este tipo de impuesto ha tenido gran apoyo gracias al avance de la economía conductual, cuyo marco teórico plantea que a la hora de tomar decisiones de consumo, los individuos se comportan de forma irracional. Así, la intervención y regulación estatal se justifica, pues permite desincentivar el consumo de bienes que no brindan bienestar en el largo plazo a los individuos y que, sin embargo éstos consumirán en el corto plazo. El avance de un Estado paternalista a través del uso de “sin taxes”, sin embargo, no está libre de discusión. Existen autores bastante críticos respecto de si los efectos de estos impuestos son efectivamente beneficiosos para los individuos o si el avance de este tipo de políticas más bien atenta contra la libertad individual. El presente ensayo analizará si la estructura de la penalización del aborto en Chile permite que ésta se entienda como un sin tax, revisando las características de la penalización que son homologables a este tipo de impuestos e instalando el aborto dentro de la discusión sobre el paternalismo de Estado.
B54|The Commodified Womb and Neoliberal Families|Neoliberalism as an economic ideology of governance through markets has functioned to break down the gendered dichotomies of public and private, market and home, and production and reproduction and in so doing has created new forms of subjectivity, families, and relationships between women. A critical analysis of the globalization and commodification of reproduction in the form of transnational surrogate motherhood contracts between Western and Southern women reveals the different ways in which intending parents and surrogate mothers are incorporated into gendered and racial circuits of global specialization and exchange.
B54|Education capability: a focus on gender and science|The focus of the paper is on the measurement of science education capability with a gender perspective. Measuring science education capability implies going beyond the measurement of children test scores. In the capability approach, we aim at the real opportunities that children can develop later in life and therefore it is important to include some measures of non-cognitive skills. We utilize, therefore, different indicators in addition to test scores in science: enjoyment in science, interest in science, general and personal values of science, self - confidence in performing science related tasks, awareness and perception of environmental issues, and responsibility for sustainable development. We utilize the 2006 PISA survey for Italian 15 year old children because it contains a particular focus on science and we estimate a Structural Equation Model to take into account that capabilities are latent constructs of which we only observe some indicators. We also investigate the determinants of children’s science education capability in Italy taking into account household, individual and school factors. Results confirm that boys outperform girls in science education capability. Our theoretical construct for the science education capability confirms that all the indicators are relevant to measure this capability. School activities to promote sciences improve girls’ capability and interactive methods of teaching improve both girls and boys capability. The household educational resources and the household educational possession are also positively correlated with girls’ and boys’ science education capability.
B54|A caring interpretation of stakeholder management for the social enterprise. Evidence from a regional survey of micro social cooperatives in the Italian welfare mix|The stakeholder literature on the social enterprise is still a nascent and largely under investigated field of knowledge. This literature is characterized by the existence of two persistently divergent theorizings, broadly, the ÔcorporateÕ and the Ôsocio-politicalÕ approach. We assume that the reason of this divergence lies in the absence of proper moral justifications underpinning the notion of stakeholder legitimacy, which results in devaluations and misinterpretations of the normative foundations of stakeholder management. In order to bridge this gap, we propose to conceive of the two theorizings as if they were empirical streams of research of a common normative framework of stakeholder thought. A special focus is given to the feminist theory, and, especially, to the Ôethics of careÕ (Gilligan 1982, Noddings 1984, 1999; Held, 2003), as meaningful moral grounding for advancing descriptions and managerial interpretations of the particular nature and functions of firm stakeholder relationships in social enterprises. To the purpose, we draw from the specialized literature on caring both insights and criteria of an ideal architecture of firm as Ôcaring organizationÕ (Liedtka, 1996), in order to offer an operationally meaningful conceptualization of how social enterprises might simultaneously enhance both the effectiveness and the moral quality of stakeholder management. Then, we test these assumptions on a regional survey of micro social co operatives in the Italian welfare mix. Findings reveal that the caring for attribute of ÔproximityÕ shaping firm stakeholder relationships offers a lot of useful insights to conceive of caring as suitable moral grounding for a common stakeholder theorizing of social enterprise.
B54|Overcoming Gender Disadvantages. Social Policy Analysis of urban middle-class women in Colombia|The World Bank Report 2012 starts with this statement: “Gender equality matters in itself and it matters for development because, in today’s globalized worlds, countries that use the skills and talents of their women would have an advantage over those which do not use it.” With the frame that suggest that gender equality matters, this paper describes some policy alternatives oriented to overcome gender disadvantages in the formal labor market incorporation of the urban middle class women in Colombia. On balance, the final recommendation suggest that it is desirable to adopt policy alternatives as Community Centers, which are programs oriented to a social redistribution of the domestic work as a way to encourage women participation in the formal labor market with the social support of the members of their own community. The problem that the social policy needs to address is the segregation of women in the formal labor market in Colombia. Although the evidence shows that the women overcome the educational gap by showing better performance in education that their male peers, women are still segregated of the labor market. The persistence of high rates of unemployment on the female population, the prevalence of the informal labor market as a women labor market, and the presence of the payment difference between men and women with similar professional trainings are circumstances that sustain the segregation statement. These circumstances are inefficient for the society because an economic analysis shows that the cost of maintain the statu quo is externalized in the social security system that includes health, pension and maternity leave regimens. Therefore, the women segregation involves a market failure. This paper evaluates five policy alternatives each directed to the progress of a different causal dimension of the problem: (i) Quotas in the private market, (ii) Flexible working hours, (iii) replace the maternity leave with a family leave, (iv) Increase the Community Centers for redistributing the care work, and (v) Equal payment enforcement. The first alternative looks to increase women’s participation in the formal labor market. The second, third, and fourth
B54|Productividad ecológica territorial: ¿un camino a la seguridad alimentaria?|El documento presenta algunos elementos asociados con los enfoques relacionados con la bioeconomía. Su objetivo es poner en discusión los conflictos en el territorio cuando este se concibe como un espacio de construcción histórica social regido por leyes e instituciones humanas que permiten atenuar los diferentes niveles de poder que se ejercen sobre su suelo, y como medio natural autorregulado por la ley de la termodinámica. Como una aproximación metodológica, se toma el estudio de caso en la ciudad de Medellín “Mujeres populares en la gestión alimentaria en la ciudad urbano-rural de Medellín”. Lo anterior, como un interés por comprender cómo se establecen los flujos de energía y los ciclos de materiales en los ecosistemas, su valor de uso y su valor de cambio en las interrelaciones e intereses tanto del mercado como en el proceso y las estrategias de las comunidades para garantizar su seguridad alimentaria.
B54|Hacia un enfoque integrador de la sostenibilidad: explorando sinergias entre género y medio ambiente|Occidente atraviesa por una de sus peores crisis económicas, pero los gobiernos se ocupan del equilibrio macroeconómico sin abordar la desconexión entre economía y medio ambiente, ni los componentes sociales del desarrollo. La degradación ecológica planetaria y su impacto en el bienestar requieren un enfoque sostenible. Aunque ha habido avances desde la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Medio Ambiente y el Desarrollo de 1992, aún no se ha adoptado una vía de desarrollo que contemple el funcionamiento de los ecosistemas o las persistentes desigualdades sociales y de género. Las economistas feministas han elaborado propuestas teóricas y metodológicas tendientes a reconocer el valor del trabajo doméstico, que podrían fortalecerse mediante una perspectiva ecológica. Asimismo, el desarrollo sostenible podría incorporar la perspectiva de género y la ética del cuidado cuya conexión se examina aquí, explorándose las sinergias entre género y medio ambiente y delineando un enfoque integrador sobre la sostenibilidad.
B54|Towards an integrative approach to sustainability: exploring potential synergies between gender and environment|In the midst of one of the worst economic crises the Western world has faced, governments are focusing on macroeconomic equilibrium and failing to address the economy-environment disconnect and the social components of development. The ecological degradation of our planet and its implications for human well-being necessitate a sustainable approach. Although some progress has been made since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992, we have yet to adopt a development path that takes account of the way that ecosystems work or the persistent social and gender inequalities. Feminist economists have developed theoretical and methodological proposals for recognizing the value of domestic work, which could be strengthened by integrating an ecological perspective. In turn, sustainable development could be enhanced by mainstreaming the gender perspective and the ethics of care. The link between these elements is examined here, as we explore the synergies between gender and the environment and outline an integrative approach to sustainability.

B54|Free Labour, Free Women. Re-appraising Harriet Taylor’s Feminist Economics|Harriet Taylor has been long forgotten as an economist and political philosopher, while merely remembered as John Stuart Mill’s friend and belatedly wife. Never was fate more unjust: we only need to recall that Taylor - whose liberal background soon led her to be fascinated by socialist theories and the evolution of labour movements - wrote chapter VII of the fourth book of the Principles of Political Economy, the well-known On the Probable Futurity of the Labouring Classes. Not to mention, moreover, her reflections on social mobility, women’s rights and female participation to the labour market, delivered in brilliant essays like Enfranchisement of Women. Detaching from mainstream Taylor’s scholarship, this paper tries to confer autonomy to her economic thought (compared to Mill’s) by suggesting that its original feature lies in the correspondence she established amid the liberation of the working classes and women’s enfranchisement, in order to place Taylor’s ideas in a more accurate intellectual perspective.
B54|The Relevance of the Theory of Fiscal Illusion. The Case of the Italian Tax System|This work analyses the phenomenon of fiscal illusion (Puviani, 1903) in the context of the Italian tax system. Financial (or fiscal) illusion refers to mechanisms which cause a cognitive alteration on the part of the taxpayer regarding the evaluation of the costs and benefits of public policies. Puviani (1903) was the first to classify the different types of financial illusions. He highlighted the main strategies used to hide the real costs of financing public goods and services through taxes (illusions on revenue) or to overestimate their usefulness (illusions on expenditure). The main conclusions of the work are that: (i) from a methodological point of view, there is a connection between Puviani’s theory of fiscal illusion and some of the assumptions of the behavioral approach and (ii) from an operational point of view, it is a useful tool to understand the motives that could have inspired several recent taxes and legislative measures within the Italian tax system. These results support the relevance of Puviani’s theory to the contemporary theory and practice of public finance.
B54|Female Entrepreneurship: Theoretical Approaches|Due to different approaches to female entrepreneurship, the author suggested that this field of research is considered to be very broad. Some of the theories outlined in this article can be linked to the study of this phenomenon, such as gender theories, managerial theories, public policy, etc. In line with this, the author proposed that all of these approaches should be as integrated as possible in order to provide a complete understanding of female entrepreneurship.
B54|Characterising Women in the Informal Sector and Their Struggles to Eke a Living Lessons from Ruwa, Zimbabwe|The paper maps and the struggles and challenges that women in the informal sector face in emerging satellite towns providing a case of Ruwa which is located some 20 kilometres from Harare the capital city of Zimbabwe. The study engaged forty women in informal sector and trading goods and services of various types with the objective of eking a living given the constrained job market dictated upon by the unstable macro-economic environment in urban centres and the country at large. Simple random sampling was adopted to cover street (off-plot) and on-plot activities by the women in the settlement. Besides, non-probability sampling applied with some of the respondents who the research interviewed to let the story of the realities of the women unfold. In their struggle to eke a living the women face and have to brace with challenges including exposure to elements weather (rain, wind, and the sun), service provision, marketing of products, and regulatory forces. Given the macro-economic stability the country has been facing since the year 2000, some of the stakeholders like the town council and private actors in Ruwa have been on a precarious position to offer services. The industry and other employment sectors are operating below capacity. Despite this ‘freeze’ situation, stakeholders can still work together inclusive of the women in the informal sectors to create a forum of dialogue. Through dialogue, it is possible to formulate poverty-reduction strategies that are accommodative of the plight and challenges of the peri-urban women and coin that in local developmental planning. The paper posits that a good governance approach is required in improving the life of the women in the informal sector in Ruwa and elsewhere.

B54|Social Organization of Textile – Trading Among Yoruba Women Textile Traders: Implication towards Entrepreneurial Development in Informal Economy in Nigeria|It is unknown how Yoruba women textile traders organize their textile enterprises, despite the vagaries of informal economy. However, in an informal economy, trade in every commodity has its own social organizational structures and politics. Scholars have argued that commodity needs to be separately studied so to detangle the various structures and politics associated with each commodity so that behavioural patterns that lead to entrepreneurial development can be determined. The focus of this paper therefore is to examine the organizational strategies of Yoruba women textile traders. The paper hinges on social action theory by Max Weber. The research design is qualitative in nature. Eight focus group discussions were conducted among the women respondents; Forty (40) in depth- Interview, and six case- studies were conducted. The findings reveals that in social organization of textile trading, several unique methods were adopted such as; placing of exclusive rights on some textile materials, innovation and imitation of textile materials for continuous trading of textile materials. In promotion of textile materials, the finding reveals that economic and non-economic activities were utilized to promote sales. While some classical tenets of entrepreneurship, were adopted by the women in recording the transactions. The paper recommends innovative attitude, importance of role mentors, building of social Capital among other traders in the market, and teaching of record keeping of transaction. All these are essential tools for women entrepreneurship development in informal economy.
B54|Identifications and Exploitation of a Business Opportunity: Case of Women Entrepreneurship in India|This case study showcases the initiative and hard work of a women entrepreneur from India, who had a passion to guide and counsel the young graduates towards their professional education. This case study discusses in detail the education acquired by the entrepreneur, her vision, initiative, development and operation of her venture, major impediments that came her way, measures adopted by her to overcome them and her plans for future expansion and growth. It also showcases how the women entrepreneur was successful in creating several new jobs in the society, besides assisting the youth to take up their desired career path.
B54|Female Entrepreneurs’ Motives and SME’s Growth: An International Study|The growth of the proportion of female-owned businesses has been constant over the past decades. However, despite the persistence of the phenomenon, research has shown that female-owned businesses were still smaller and underperforming in terms of growth as compared to male-owned firms. This research contributed to updating the state of knowledge on this topic given the constant evolution of female entrepreneurs’ profile, as well as the characteristics of their businesses. A sample of 1,211 entrepreneurs from Canada, Mexico, and the United States, was tested in order to examine these issues.
B54|Female Entrepreneurship in Serbia and Opportunities for its Development|Today, entrepreneurship is a key element in the development of the economic potential of each country. Recently, one of the possible directions of development of entrepreneurship that stands out is female entrepreneurship, and the number of companies and businesses whose owners are women is increasing. Problems that exist and need to be solved in order for this sector to develop properly are, in the first place, to provide adequate financial assistance to women who want to step into the world of entrepreneurship. Improving of the environment for the development of female entrepreneurship through the introduction of tax incentives, easier access to finance, women support through monitoring, advisory services, are just some of the possibilities to develop female entrepreneurship in the right way. This paper presents the current state of female entrepreneurship in Serbia.
B54|The Position of Women Leaders and Managers in Serbia|"This paper describes the current situation of women leaders in the Serbia. Women throughout history have never been free and liberated as today, both in Western societies and Serbia, where the actual reality that a woman is entitled to all the rights that are regulated by national legislation, taking into account the principle of gender equality. The position of women in the labor market is one of the key aspects of gender equality in the society. However, by the time they follow the invisible barriers that prevent women from achieving leading positions in corporate leadership, which is now called the ""glass ceiling."" The aim of the research is to describe and analyze the current situation of women managers and discover the causes and factors limiting their professional recognition. The research results make it possible to describe and see two models of the behavior women managers in the current situation in Serbian economy, which is a basic criterion for the dominance of the identified factors: factors barriers and support factors to the advancement of women in professional careers. Specifically we are talking about the behavior patterns that women managers as points of support combine its own strengths and supportive environment and a model of behavior that women managers as a point of support using its own forces."
B54|A Phenomenological Exploration of the Mentoring Experiences of Women Business Owners in Central Florida|Women have been starting businesses at twice the rate of men in the United States, yet women-owned businesses have had lower sales, profits, and survival rates. Although entrepreneurship centers and other institutions have developed training and developmental programs to support nascent entrepreneurs, there is a need for more resources to help established businesses survive and grow, especially women-owned businesses. Therefore, a qualitative phenomenological study was conducted using a purposive sample of 10 women business owners in Central Florida who were protégés in an entrepreneurial mentoring program. The purpose was to understand the aspects of mentoring that were perceived to foster successful business and personal experiences and outcomes. The study used Moustakas’ phenomenological approach that included in-depth, open-ended interviews. According to study participants, the aspects of mentoring that were perceived to foster successful business and personal experiences and outcomes were: (a) access to an ad hoc mentoring team of subject matter experts, (b) opportunities to learn essential business skills, (c) psychosocial support from mentors, and (d) networking and relationship-building opportunities. The study contributes to the developmental networks knowledge base by describing how group mentoring provides career and psychosocial support to established women business owners. Future research should explore the mentoring experiences of early-stage women entrepreneurs, investigate gender differences within the entrepreneurial mentoring context, and examine how the developmental networks of women business owners grow and change over time.
B54|The Importance of Fieldwork Research to Reveal Women Entrepreneurs Competence in Communication|This study reviews the main bases of interpersonal communication competence that determine women entrepreneurs’ success: knowledge, motivation, and communication skills. The rising phenomenon of women becoming entrepreneurs could encourage the processes of socioeconomic development; however, many women face barriers when trying to become successful entrepreneurs. The literature suggests interpersonal communication is especially relevant in the construction of women’s business networks, and that various communication acts showcase women entrepreneurs’ knowledge, in terms of understanding social contexts, and motivation. Despite the literature’s existing breadth, further studies are stll needed to complete this topic because the research subjects do not always easily express their subjective consciousness. Accordingly, fieldwork research, which provides qualitative data, is an alternative way to gather findings.
B54|Consumption as a Social Process within Social Provisioning and Capitalism: Implications for Heterodox Economics|The article discusses consumption as a social process that is a part of social provisioning and is in an evolutionary interplay with other social processes. The discussion is grounded in, but is not limited to the contributions of Thorstein Veblen. The first section delineates social provisioning as a framework for consumption inquiry. This section emphasizes that social provisioning is a part of collective life process embedded in culture and nature, and that it is comprised by two general sets of activities – those motivated by money and those that are not motivated by making money. The second section delineates features of capitalism as a system, so that it provides a social context for consumption inquiry. The third section formulates a categorization of social processes, one of which is the consumption process. Further, the section delineates the meaning and components of the concepts: social activities, institutions, and habits of life and thought. The fourth section applies these concepts to consumption social process in the specific context of capitalism. The section discusses consumption activities; institutions and systems of provision; and habits of life and thought – illustrating with examples obtained from various disciplines. The section introduces “gated consumption” as an example of a habit of life and thought. It is argued that the formulated analysis transcends the cultural-material dualism. Finally, the article draws implications of the offered analysis, concluding that the category of “consumers” is of little use to heterodox economics.
B54|Women entrepreneurs in the informal economy: Is formalization the only solution for business sustainability?|The existing marketing, strategy and economics literature have little to offer by way of recommendations to promote entrepreneurship in the informal economy, except to advocate that multinationals, local firms, state and public agencies should work together to bring the informal economy into the fold of the formal economy. In contrast, this paper argues that the business sustainability of women entrepreneurs in the informal economy depends upon their engagements or business partnerships with other women (and men) and women-focussed intermediaries. More than formalization, women entrepreneurs need 'spaces' for dialogue with other women (and men) to learn and build business capabilities. Both the State and firms wanting to penetrate the informal economy can create such spaces through partnerships with NGOs and women-focussed organizations. While formalization of entrepreneurial activity is favourable under some circumstances, it can be detrimental under others - necessitating a case by case evaluation rather than a general rule. In order to ensure the business sustainability of women's ventures in the informal economy, any sort of formalization must occur through a gradual process accompanied by intermediaries. These results are formulated through the compilation and analysis of the existing literature and the study of six detailed case studies of women entrepreneurs from developing countries validated by extensive interviews. The results are then used to propose a closed model of linkages between formal and informal economies which has novel organizational implications for firms competing to establish consumer bases and business partnerships in the Base of Pyramid (BoP) markets of developing countries.
B54|The gendered nature of intra-household decision making in and across Europe|After surveying the literature on the economics of household decision-making, we employ data from the 2010 European Union Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) to study the relationship between personal characteristics such as gender and decision-making power and responsibility. We find that across Europe, women more often make decisions about everyday spending and purchases for children, while it is mainly men who make the financial decisions in a household. Greater intrahousehold inequality in income and education is correlated with a lower probability of couples making decisions together, as is having a housewife in the home. Interesting patterns of household decision-making across countries emerge; in the Southern European countries, for example, educational differences do not seem to be strongly related to decision-making power and responsibility, and women in Eastern European countries are more likely to make financial decisions when the household reports facing difficult economic conditions.
B54|Segregación laboral y discriminación salarial de género en Colombia: El caso de las trece áreas metropolitanas, 2001, 2005 y 2009|El mercado laboral colombiano ha acogido cada vez más al género femenino hasta el punto de ocupar cargos de altos salarios y reconocimiento. Para analizar lo anterior, se tomaron en cuenta los registros de la Encuesta Integrada de Hogares, datos oficiales, para los segundos trimestres de los años 2.001, 2.005 y 2.009. Se demostró que la segregación genera brechas salariales, respuesta para el cuestionamiento principal de este documento. Pese a ello, los esfuerzos de las mujeres en pertenecer al mercado laboral han reducido la brecha salarial entre las que pertenecen sectores donde son segregadas y las que no lo están. Su mayor preparación profesional, el menor número de personas en el hogar, su posición de jefe del mismo, entre otros factores han hecho que éstas participen más activamente de actividades que anteriormente eran consideradas exclusivas para los hombres.
B54|Los fundamentos económicos en la comprensión del mundo social en la infancia|El siguiente es un artículo de reflexión producto de la revisión del estado del arte sobre el desarrollo de la comprensión del mundo socioeconómico en la infancia. La vida cotidiana es una valiosa fuente de aprendizajes que le facilitan al niño el desarrollo de habilidades para desempeñarse social y económicamente desde temprana edad, y esto a la vez aporta al desarrollo de un pensamiento más complejo y apto para diversas operaciones. Sin embargo, la dinámica global actual representa un desafío para todos los agentes del mercado, y los niños que crecen en entornos vulnerables requieren de propuestas educativas que enriquezcan sus experiencias cotidianas y favorezcan el desarrollo de competencias para una mayor comprensión y desempeño en la dinámica socioeconómica que mueve al mundo.
B54|Occupational Sex Segregation and Management-Level Wages in Germany: What Role Does Firm Size Play?|"The paper analyzes the gender pay gap in private-sector management positions based on German panel data and using fixed-effects models. It deals with the effect of occupational sex segregation on wages, and the extent to which wage penalties for managers in predominantly female occupations are moderated by firm size. Drawing on economic and organizational approaches and the devaluation of women's work, we find wage penalties for female occupations in management only in large firms. This indicates a pronounced devaluation of female occupations, which might be due to the longer existence, stronger formalization, or more established ""old-boy networks"" of large firms."

B54|The Role Of Women In The Early Years Of The Canning Industry In Spain|Women have played an important role in fishing communities all over the developed world and they also play an important role in developing economies. Our analysis focuses on this role. The purpose of this article is to look at the role of women in the Spanish fish canning industry. To do so, our analysis focuses on Spain's primary fishing and canning region: the Ría de Vigo, a large estuary in Galicia (the north-western part of Spain). Our analysis is also limited to the historical period of its consolidation, in the late 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century. The development of a new female labour force in the first decade of the 20th century is one of our most significant conclusions.
B54|Tanzanian Education and Entrepreneurial Influence among Females|Several approaches have been proposed by researchers to the economic empowerment of women. Starting and sustaining an individual business is one of the strategies for the economic development of entrepreneurially-oriented females. This study evaluated the factors influencing entrepreneurial activities; there was a further ingoing examination of the impact of education on Tanzanian females starting-up their own businesses. A total of 128 business women from Makambako and Njombe participated in the study, which primarily employed a questionnaire for data collection. Findings indicated that the government policy, strategies and support for female entrepreneurs had little or no impact on their entrepreneurial motivation. In addition, the level of formal education that women attained was found to have little impact. It was found, however, that the kind of training a female entrepreneur underwent was the most important factor in the business start-up. Thus, this study proposes that more effort should be put into practical and vocational training that has a direct impact on the kind of business that women can establish.
B54|Unlocking Innovation in Women-Owned Firms: Strategies for Educating the Next Generation of Women Entrepreneurs|In this article we report on the results of a survey of innovative practices in a sample of U.S. firms. Survey results reveal gender differences in the areas of both human and social capital. In the area of human capital, women were less likely to have advanced degrees or senior management experience. In the area of social capital, although a high percentage of women engaged in networking activities, there is some evidence that their networking strategies were less targeted than those of men. Consistent with prior research, women entrepreneurs had lower levels of “self-efficacy” or confidence in their ability to identify and develop innovative ideas. The implications of these findings for the education and training of women entrepreneurs are discussed.
B54|The Development of Female Entrepreneurship in the Function of Overcoming Unemployment of Women in Serbia|Entrepreneurship is the engine of economic development of each country. The above facts indicate that entrepreneurship should be given special attention and it should constantly be developed. As one of the possible directions of development of entrepreneurship in recent decades, the development of women entrepreneurship stands out. Although in most countries of the world it is believed that women are less capable for entrepreneurship than men, and despite the fact that the majority of large enterprises are managed by men, a rise of women entrepreneurs in the world has been noticed, especially in developing countries. And in recent years in Serbia the number of companies headed by women has increased, so it is now about 25%, which means that women control or manage every fourth company in Serbia. As reasons for this increase we could cite the change of consciousness among women and that they can be just as successful in leading the company as men, but also the fact that starting their own business can supplement their income and improve themselves through self-employment, increase their independence and be more respected in society. Although women are forced to fight in today's world to be recognized not only as women-mothers but also as successful women-entrepreneurs, their determination, perseverance, willingness to take risks and all the problems which entrepreneurship brings, show that the time of women's entrepreneurship is yet to come.
B54|Small Companies Access to Multi Guarantee Mechanisms - An Evidence from Serbian Female Companies|Financial markets and sources of funds are scarce in Serbia for small companies, especially for these owned by women. There is a little mobilized capital for various reasons to support innovative small companies, the lack of private equity funds and various multi guarantee schemes, and private public sources. The main objective of this paper is to show the opportunities for the better transfer of best current practice into the system and practical solutions of the Serbian financial intermediaries and end users in the field of guarantees /loans, equity or joint venture, the proportion of the guarantee/ which covers the loan, interest rate, length, and conditions of the applications /, service/ multi societies or state agencies/. Investments in the Development of small companies, female owned, especially in the innovation of products, services and technology are the main precondition to their greater involvement in exporting, selling goods with higher added value to global market and sustainability of their business.
B54|Why Women Enter into Entrepreneurship? An Emerging Conceptual Framework Based on the Peruvian Case|The study identifies the various reasons why women become entrepreneurs, considering their life cycle and the factors that have encouraged them, using the qualitative paradigm based on case studies of twenty-four women entrepreneurs in Peru. The research identified six profiles according to the different routes by which women choose entrepreneurship: Young Women with Employment Options, Growing Women with External Constraints, Consolidated Women with a Trunked Career, Natural Young Women, Growing Women, and Consolidated Professional Women. The findings proposed that women entrepreneurs are not a homogeneous group, considering a sole dimension to understand why women become entrepreneurs is an inadequate simplification.
B54|Studying the Barriers of Women’s Progress in the Organization & Its Impact on Organizational Commitment and Job Satisfaction: A Case Study at Tehran Tax Organization|Research shows that only 14% of women holding managerial posts in Iran. This rate is very low when compared with other countries. In connection with this problem, this paper aims to study the obstacles in women's progress in the organization and its impact on organizational commitment and job satisfaction of Members of Tehran Tax Organization Staff. For this purpose a comparative method correlation type has been applied. The number of the population sampled based on randomized method is equal to 120 personnel of the said organization. The questionnaire which was used for the purpose of this research is made up of two parts. The first part includes demographic questions and the second part relates to the questionnaires for job satisfaction (α=0.76.8), organizational commitment (α=0.87) and restrictions on the women's progress at the organization (α=0.8492). For the purpose of the qualitative analysis of the general data from the first part of the questionnaire a descriptive statistical method was used and In order to determine the significant relationship between the general questions of the questionnaire and the assumptions of the research the T- Test and Variance Analysis were employed. The findings of this research show that the highest correlation coefficient has related to the relationship between the managers' negative attitude and female gender and the lowest rate was for the relationship between the managers' negative attitude and women's technical skills and abilities. Besides, the results of the correlation coefficient show that the most important factor hindering the women's job promotion are the cultural, socio-cultural and social factors affecting the managers' views and attitude.
B54|What Do Poor Women Want? Public Employment or Cash Transfers? Lessons from Argentina|"The literature on public employment policies such as the job guarantee (JG) and the employer of last resort (ELR) often emphasizes their macroeconomic stabilization effects. But carefully designed and implemented policies like these can also have profound social transformative effects. In particular, they can help address enduring economic problems such as poverty and gender disparity. To examine how, this paper will look at the reform of Argentina's Plan Jefes into Plan Familias. Plan Jefes was the hallmark stabilization policy of the Argentine government after the 2001 crisis. It guaranteed a public sector job in a community project to unemployed male and female heads of households. The vast majority of beneficiaries, however, turned out to be poor women. For a number of reasons that are explored below, the program was later reformed into a cash transfer policy, known as Plan Familias, that still exists today. The paper examines this reform in order to evaluate the relative impact of such policies on some of the most vulnerable members of society; namely, poor women. An examination of the Argentine experience based on survey evidence and fieldwork reveals that poor women overwhelmingly want paid work opportunities, and that a policy such as the JG or the ELR cannot only guarantees full employment and macroeconomic stabilization, but it can also serve as an institutional vehicle that begins to transform some of the structures and norms that produce and reproduce gender disparities. These transformative features of public employment policies are elucidated by turning to the capabilities approach developed by Amartya Sen and elaborated by Martha Nussbaum-an approach commonly invoked in the feminist literature. This paper examines how the access to paid employment can enhance what Sen defines as an individual's ""substantive freedom."" Any policy that fosters genuine freedom begins with an understanding of what the targeted population (in this case, poor women) wants. It then devises a strategy that guarantees that such opportunities exist and removes the obstacles to accessing these opportunities."
B54|Análisis de la integración del enfoque de género en las políticas de cooperación al desarrollo: El caso de las instituciones del País Vasco/Analysis of the Integration of the Gender Perspective in Development Cooperation Policies: The Case of the Basque Institutions|Este artículo se centra en el análisis de la integración del enfoque de género en los documentos de planificación de las políticas de cooperación al desarrollo y más concretamente de la cooperación descentralizada española. Para ello, se plantea un marco de referencia capaz de evaluar el diseño y la coherencia de las políticas, sin plantear por tanto un análisis de los resultados ni del impacto de dichas políticas, teniendo en cuenta las limitaciones en la aplicación de la perspectiva de género de los principales organismos internacionales de cooperación, las características de la coopera¬ción descentralizada y la necesidad de un marco de evaluación de dichas políticas. Posteriormente utilizamos dicho marco para evaluar las políticas de cooperación de las principales instituciones públicas del País Vasco. This article focuses on the analysis of the integration of gender perspective in planning documents of development cooperation policies and more specifically, in Spanish decentralized cooperation policies. For this analysis, we suggest a framework in order to evaluate the design and the coherence of these policies, without taking into account the result and the impact analysis of them, but considering the limitations of the implementation of gender perspective of the main international co-operation organizations, the characteristics of Decentralized Co-operation and the need of an evaluation framework for these policies. Afterwards, we apply this framework for evaluating co-operation policies of the major public institutions of the Basque Country.
B54|Who is happier: Housewife or working wife?|Earlier research found no difference in the happiness between a housewife and a working wife. However, there now is the expectation that a difference in their happiness exists today given the increase in the labor participation of women over the years. This paper revisits the debate using data from the 2000s. For the upper- and low-income economies, there is still no difference in the happiness between a housewife and a working wife. In contrast, results for the middle-income economies clearly show that a part-time working wife is happier than a housewife and that both part-time working wife and housewife are happier than a full-time working wife.
B54|Feminism today|Feminism has been noticed at various stages of time and still is unnoticed. The acts of sexism are apparently at large and only dialogues are delivered without any prompt action. This paper highlights the stage of feminism now and its prospects for the better. This topic talks about women from all walks of life and their thirst of justified identity. One has to develop in the conscious of mankind that women are equal to man and their suppleness to adapt to the environment does not give a sign for sexism.
B54|Sexual orientation and social exclusion in Italy|This work explores the role of discrimination in shaping individuals’ lives and opportunities, with specific respect to sexual orientation. The role of sexual orientation in explaining earning differences has been increasingly emphasized in empirical literature on discrimination mainly as a result of the growing availability of data sources on gays and lesbian populations. Available evidence predominantly converges on the one hand on the identification of discrimination treatments for gays and positive wage differential for lesbian women with respect to heterosexual counterparts. On the other hand, disagreement pervades interpretations of the predominant above-described labour market outcome. In trying to move beyond such conflicting views, we consider a holistic approach to social exclusion, defined as individuals’ ability to fully participate to social life by examining five domains: monetary poverty, labour market attachment, housing conditions, subjective well-being, and education. Three samples of different waves of the Banca d’Italia “Survey on household income and wealth” (SHIW - 2006, 2008 and 2010) were pooled in order to perform the empirical analysis on a reasonably sized sample of heterosexual couples identified according to a cohabitation criteria. Following the SHIW characteristics and definition of household, we are able to differentiate homosexual couples belonging to a sub-population of out same-sex couples from those who are not openly out about their homosexual relationship. We develop an understanding of social exclusion as a non-dichotomous concept (that is, one is not necessarily “included” or “excluded”, but a continuum of intermediate conditions exist) through fuzzy analysis techniques and develop a synthetic index of inclusion/exclusion as well as a number of partial indexes, composed of several variables pertaining to a certain domain. Overall indicators of social exclusion are examined for the full sample and for the sub-sample of workers only, comparing individuals cohabiting in same-sex couples with heterosexual counterparts. Our results point out that a significant and non-negligible portion of the social exclusion suffered by lesbian and gay couples cannot be accounted for by observable factors and may therefore be attributed to the impact of discrimination. Coherently with the existing literature, we find a differentiated impact on gay men and lesbian couples. However, and possibly more relevantly, we also find significant differences between the couples of “out” homosexual individuals and those composed of “closeted” individuals.
B54|Who is happier: The housewife or working wife?|The earlier studies that came out around the 1970s, as more and more women started to leave the homes, so to speak, and took paid work found no statistically significant difference in the happiness between the housewife and the working wife. This paper revisits the same issue using data from the 2000s but refining the focus of the analysis, namely: paid work is differentiated into full-time, part-time, or self-employment. The findings are still consistent with the earlier studies. What the paper finds more interesting, however, is that a disparity in the happiness between the housewife and the working wife is perhaps more because of idiosyncrasies shaped by culture and social context but less about the paid work status itself.
B54|From silence to voice: Examining the empowerment potential of mobile phones to women in Sri Lanka The case of dependent housewives|Over the past few decades, at an unprecedented rate, mobile phone has penetrated Sri Lanka, triggering much hype and investment as well as multiple socioeconomic implications. Yet, examining the developmental impact of mobile phones has, however, drawn surprisingly little attention in Sri Lanka with no studies focusing primarily on the impact of mobile phones on the empowerment of women. Therefore, this paper, applying primarily qualitative methodology, attempts an investigation of the empowering effect of mobile phones to dependent housewives in poor households in Sri Lanka. The study found that access to mobile phones was certainly empowering for the women: mobile phones unequivocally strengthened and expanded their social circle and support networks as an instrument of sociability; it led them domesticate technology, thus challenging negative societal attitudes towards women as technophobic luddites; it reduced their information poverty, enabling and facilitating access to information; and, opened them up a “newer”, non-traditional space of fun, something which demonstrated a clear manifestation of choice and power. However, the study unveiled that the women’s use of mobile phones was largely controlled within the household, mainly because they did not have their own income to maintain their phones, but to rely on the spouse, the conventional family provider, thus calling for the need for women’s financial autonomy. Those women who legally owned their mobile phones had control over them relative to those who lacked legal ownership. In conclusion, mobile phones can play a significant role in empowering women and thus, recommends considering it as a tool in the policy agenda for women’s empowerment in Sri Lanka.
B54|Socio economic gender inequality in Nigeria: A review of theory and measurements|The aim of this article is to synthesize the various views of gender inequality and various indicators used to measure it. It argues that women lag behind men in most indicators of socio-economic development and they constitute the majority of the poor, the unemployed and the socially disadvantaged. Productive differences as espoused by the traditional neoclassical as well as the institutions and markets advancement are not sufficient to explain gender inequality. The political economy view of power and self-interest enshrined at the household, community and government play relevant role in defining gender gaps. Growth models that are institutionally blind completely leaves out the impact that social institutions such as family, school, unions, government have in shaping inequalities. The collective self-interest and power within institutions motivate men and women to allocate the resource under their control to activities that best enable them to fulfill their obligations rather than to activities that are common
B54|The impact of economic policy and structural change on gender employment inequality in Latin America, 1990-2010|The main purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of economic policy and structural change on gender inequality in employment and economic opportunities for a set of 18 Latin American countries over the time period 1990-2010. We use three different methodologies to explore this question: 1) statistical description of changes in a range of gender inequality in economic opportunity variables in the 1990s versus the 2000s; 2) estimates of the growth elasticity of employment for women and for men; and 3) econometric analysis of the determinants of gendered employment and unemployment levels, as well as the determinants of gender inequality in these variables.
B54|Women Empowerment: An Epistemic Quest|The concept of women empowerment was the outcome of several important critiques and debates generated by the women’s movement throughout the world, and particularly in the developing countries. In essence, the 1980s saw the rise of stringent feminist critiques of development strategies and grassroots interventions: mainly for these strategies having generally failed to make any significant dent in the status of women. The failure was ascribed to the adaptation and the application of such approaches as welfare, anti¬poverty, and to some extent the efficiency approach. Presently, the users of the term ‘empowerment’ tend to assume an understanding of the meaning within some particular context. Often no clear explanation of empowerment is given. We believe that some of the confusion arises because the root concept – power –itself is disputed, and so is understood and experienced in different ways by different people. In fact, the underlying assumption of many interest groups or institutions (such as the World Bank and the UN) unfortunately is that economic empowerment automatically converts to women’s empowerment. As the following epistemic quest of empowerment unfolds in six sections, the major issue reflected upon is the concept of empowerment in its importance to women’s development. We begin in the next section by exploring the definitions of empowerment and then dissects the concept of power in section 3: the concept is discussed in the subsequent sections from different perspectives of power, feminism and personal autonomy and agency in the family framework. We consider three approaches here: theory of human needs, self-determination theory and capability approach. The last section concludes the paper.
B54|Measuring Women Empowerment: Dissecting the Methodological Discourse|As we move from the concept of empowerment to its measurement, it is natural that the complexity in the concept passes into its empirical expression in multiples. The problem is compounded as the concept is a multidimensional one. Several different efforts have been made in recent years to develop comprehensive frameworks delineating the various dimensions of women empowerment. The two types of indicators used almost universally in the empirical literature to operationalize empowerment at the individual or household level are those measuring domestic decision-making, and those measuring either access to, or control over resources. Often, these two aspects merge since indicators on domestic decision-making tend to focus heavily on financial and resource allocation matters. The emphasis on such measures in the empirical literature corresponds well with the emphasis on resources and agency in the conceptual literature, as well as with the frequent equation of empowerment with choice, control, and power. Certainly, there is an intuitive appeal to decision-making and control as signifying important aspects of agency. The present paper seeks to dissect this methodological discourse by listing the essential elements of the empowerment frameworks developed in selected studies and culling out the indicators frequently used to operationalize empowerment at the individual or household level in the empirical studies.

B54|â€œGender Troubleâ€|This paper explores the relationship between gender equality and economic democracy in worker cooperatives in the United States. A specific method for analyzing womenâ€™s status in worker cooperatives is proposed. Preliminary findings from a small-scale survey of U.S. worker cooperatives in 2001 are presented, showing that despite the egalitarian nature of cooperatives several gender inequalities persist.JEL classification: J54, B54, P13
B54|Economic Growth and Employment from 1990-2010|In this article we estimate the growth elasticity of employment by gender for 160 countries during 1990-2010. We then econometrically model these elasticities to draw out the structural contexts in which gendered employment outcomes respond differently to growth, including measures of economic structure, demographic change, macroeconomic stability, global stance and policy, and income distribution and institutional development. Our investigation shows that the relative size of the service sector and the ratio of female to male labor force participation are key determinants of differences in employment elasticities by gender, creating higher elasticities for women than men. We also find that the terms of global integration, as measured by the current account balance, growth in the terms of trade, and the share of foreign direct investment in investment, are important for both female and male employment elasticities.JEL Classification: O5, F4, B54
B54|The gendered nature of multidimensional poverty in the European Union|Recent economic literature on poverty may be broadly divided into two strands. One strand investigates the multidimensional nature of poverty. The other strand, employing the large availability of household surveys, investigates the micro and macro determinants of monetary poverty, analyzing the role played by individual and household characteristics and macro socio-economic factors. In this framework, a gender approach has often been limited to the analysis of the coefficient “woman” in standard regression analyses of the determinants of poverty. By contrast, feminist research has consistently stressed the importance of a more holistic conceptual and empirical approach to encapsulate gender deprivation. This paper aims at building a bridge between the two mentioned streams, by analyzing the gendered nature of multidimensional of poverty. Although gender mainstreaming is specified in the European Union policy framework as a key element of active inclusion policies, this approach to policy design and monitoring is still underdeveloped.
B54|Stakeholder theory and care management: An inquiry into social enterprises|This work aims to introduce care management from the moral viewpoint of stakeholder theory. It considers stakeholder theory a useful methodology for managerial descriptions, narratives and theorising of business ethics, and the feminist thought, especially the moral grounding of care, a valuable normative core to earn productive remarks and insights into stakeholder research in modern capitalism. Care leads researchers to meaningful conceptualizations of the firm as a relational entity, both in itself and as part of the network of stakeholders within which it is involved, paving the way for organisational analysis deeply entangled in the subjective and interpersonal aspects of specific business context. Of major importance for advancing the understanding of care as virtue ethics affecting the managerial decision-making is the problem of bordering organisation-stakeholder relationships. To this purpose, a quantitative measuring on managerial practices of stakeholder involvement in a sample of small Italian social enterprises has been carried out. Findings reveal that a fully Òcare for the otherÓ turns in favour of those stakeholders who are formally entitled to take part in the co-production of organisation's activities through the formal involvement in the governance structures.
B54|El compromiso social en los Principios de economía política y en la Sujeción de las mujeres de John Stuart Mill (con las contribuciones de Harriet Taylor Mill)|This paper consists of a re-reading of three works by John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor: the Principles of Political Economy (1848), The Subjection of Women (1869) both by J.S. Mill and Harriet Taylor’s essay, “The Emancipation of Women” (1851). The paper seeks to reinterpret these texts, seeing them as part of a joint pool of ideas and an explicit social and political programme set out by the two authors, a programme inspired by their wish to improve the lot in society, above all, of women and of the working classes. The ideas which underlie this programme have been classified under five headings: tradition and custom as stumbling blocks to social progress; education as a fundamental element in personal development; the right to vote and to be elected; freedom of access to the labour market; and finally the future advancement in the condition of the working classes.

B54|A Critique and Reframing of Personality in Labour Market Theory: Locus of Control and Labour Market Outcomes|This article critically examines the theoretical arguments that underlie the literature linking personality traits to economic outcomes and provides empirical evidence indicating that labour market outcomes influence personality outcomes. Based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we investigated the extent to which gender differences occur in the processes by which highly positive and negative labour market outcomes are determined and in the processes underlying the development of one particular aspect of personality, locus of control. Gender differences were more pronounced in the results for years in managerial/ leadership positions than for locus of control. Negative labour market states were also marked by gender differences. We conclude by arguing that an explicitly value-laden analysis of the rewards associated with personality within the labour market could expose areas where the gendered nature of rewards by personality serves to perpetuate power relationships within the labour market.
B54|Women Participation, Quality Of Government And Economic Development In Europe, 2000-2007|We analyze women participation, in economic and social activities, in Europe for the period 2000-2007, and the positive effects of education, quality of government and economic development on quality of life and female participation. We estimate some econometric models which have into account the positive impact of education in gender equality opportunities as well as the positive impact of gender equality on indicators of socio-economic well-being. In spite of some advancement in equality of opportunities for women in working activities, we find a marked stagnation of opportunities for highly prepared women in decision making and leadership, particularly in countries where voice of citizens do not find enough channels of communication with Government and where television, press media, and several social institutions, are under tight control of powerful political and business groups which show little concern about female equality of opportunities based on merit and capacity. We suggest policies addressed to increase equality of opportunities for women in European countries, particularly related with those problems denounced by the European Womenïs Lobby about difficulties for female leaders to reach an even participation in decision making and media. This would help to advance in quality of life for all the society.
B54|Women’s Participation to Self-employment and Informal Sector|Using comparable micro-level data from three countries, we ask what type of person works in the informal sector and whether informal workers earn lower wages than observationally equivalent workers in the formal sector. The characteristics of informal workers are similar across countries. Surprisingly, when we control for these personal characteristics, we find a significant wage premium associated with formal employment. A model of endogenous selection offers little help in explaining the differences in wage patterns. The research casts doubt on the received wisdom that the informal sector, always and everywhere, is a poorly-paid but easily-entered refuge for those who have no other employment opportunities.
B54|Female Entrepreneurship Theory: A Multidisciplinary Review of Resources|The author, a legal scholar, reviews academic literature regarding and otherwise relevant to the study of female entrepreneurship from across multiple disciplines. She reports that the legal academy has only minimally engaged in entrepreneurship scholarship and not at all as to female entrepreneurship. Author reviews the origins of female entrepreneurship literature and the compilations describing the emergence of female entrepreneurship as a business and social phenomenon, the women who undertook and led these endeavors, and changes in the characteristics of women entrepreneurs over time. She also presents materials in topical sections on business structure, strategy, and performance; culture, sex, and gender; diversity; economic and social development; essentialization and masculine norms; finance; identity issues; innovation and technology; motivation; personal and professional domains; psychology; social capital; and standpoint theory. Author points out the needs for a unified definitional taxonomy for entrepreneurship; for greater study of innovation-driven female entrepreneurship; for the legal academy to enter the field of entrepreneurship study, including as to female entrepreneurship; and for entrepreneurship scholars to approach their work with interdisciplinarity.
B54|New Schools for Entrepreneurs and Managers: Education for Female Entrepreneurship|Education and training help to build human capacity for both men and women. It is a key priority area for poverty reduction. The development of contemporary technologies, especially the Internet, on the one hand and changes in management practice, communication and work organization in companies on the other hand, have in recent years brought about changes in the kinds of knowledge and ways of acquiring it. In keeping with these, new educational programs, as well as new modes of studying, everywhere in the world the existing education system is being redefined and educational programs that have to closely relate to practice are being improved. For that sake, “new schools for entrepreneurs and managers” are founded, which are based on modern programs and courses meant for various groups of business people. In this article, the author tried to explain advantages and disadvantages of e-learning with a stress of special benefits for women.

For the study data has been collected data from few of the renowned Management institutes of Indore.
B54|A Methodological Problem Associated with Researching Women Entrepreneurs|This article highlights one of the most significant methodological problems of researching women entrepreneurs and understanding the female entrepreneurial experience, which is related to the definition of what is a women entrepreneur. The article outlines the state of research on women entrepreneurs, presents the diverse definitions used in research, conceptualizes the different aspects related to the definition of a woman entrepreneur, and proposes future directions for developing research on women as entrepreneurs.
B54|Factors for Motivating Women in Small Business and Micro Enterprises|The present study is an empirical in nature and examines the major motivational factor for business. The study has been conducted in Coimbatore District, India. The women entrepreneurs, who belong to Self Help Groups (SHG) are the sample respondents. A total of 450 sample respondents have been randomly selected and the analysis have been carried out across the field of activities of women entrepreneurs in small business and micro enterprises viz, Among the Ten motivational factors for choice, three emerged as high as than others. Some women deliberately have started the business as a means of supplementing income, whilst others eagerly anticipate for individual self achievement obtained from self employment. The women in small business and micro enterprises have become a strong driving force in today’s major concern of women empowerment. Many women entrepreneurs in the study have an average age of 40-60 as they are either settled as housewives or employees of business organisations. On the one hand their primary goal is to get monetary reward and on the other, they receive personal gratification as they are self-employed.
B54|Entrepreneurial Alertness and Spontaneous Learning in the Market Process: the Case of Mama Moon in China|Israel M. Kirzner’s theory of entrepreneurial alertness follows closely with Mises’ praxeology and argues that the entire role of entrepreneurs lies in their alertness to profit opportunity hitherto unnoticed in the market. In Kirzner’s subjectivist theory of knowledge, alertness to opportunity is subconscious learning. Once subconscious hunch is known, it becomes a resource (knowledge) for the entrepreneur to be utilized to exploit profit. Moreover, in Kirzner’s view, entrepreneurship means profit arbitrage and it is the continual profit exploitation in the market process that drives an economy towards a higher level of capitalist achievement. Kirzner’s theory of entrepreneurship will be illustrated by the case of Mama Moon, a female entrepreneur in tourism, catering and hotel industries in Guilin, China.
B54|Characteristics of Female Leaders and Their Position in the Business World|This paper points out the importance of the role of leaders in modern organizations in the context of achieving business success as well as gaining and maintaining competitive advantage in a dynamic and complex surrounding.

B54|Fecundidad en el Ecuador y su relación con el entorno social y evolutivo|Este documento analiza la evolución de la fecundidad en Ecuador desde el año 1990 al año 2007, período en el cual se dispone de datos reales. Luego, en base a la evolución (tendencia) detectada se pretende inferir el comportamiento de la fecundidad a corto y mediano plazo, para lo cual se utilizan las Estadísticas Vitales desde el año 1990 hasta el año 2007, la Encuesta de Empleo y Desempleo (ENEMDU) en el mismo período y los Censos de Población y Vivienda de 1990 y 2001. Los resultados muestran una tendencia decreciente de la tasa de fecundidad en el país, Esta tasa es explicada por la población femenina en edad fecunda, la población total y la tasa de natalidad. Además, se estudia el bono demográfico para el Ecuador, pues conocerlo permitirá que el gobierno tome las medidas adecuadas para su aprovechamiento. Finalmente, del estudio se desprende que el bono demográfico se encontrará situado entre el año 2013 y el año 2022.
B54|A Critique and Reframing of Personality in Labour Market Theory: Locus of Control and Labour Market Outcomes|This article critically examines the theoretical arguments that underlie the literature linking personality traits to economic outcomes and provides empirical evidence indicating that labour market outcomes influence personality outcomes. Based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we investigated the extent to which gender differences occur in the processes by which highly positive and negative labour market outcomes are determined and in the processes underlying the development of one particular aspect of personality, locus of control. Gender differences were more pronounced in the results for years in managerial/ leadership positions than for locus of control. Negative labour market states were also marked by gender differences. We conclude by arguing that an explicitly value-laden analysis of the rewards associated with personality within the labour market could expose areas where the gendered nature of rewards by personality serves to perpetuate power relationships within the labour market.
B54|Estimating the Impact of the Recent Economic Crisis on Work Time in Turkey|This paper provides estimates of the impact of the recent economic crisis on paid and unpaid work time in Turkey. The data used in this study come from the first and only time-use survey available at the national level. Infrequency of collection of time-use data in Turkey does not allow us to make a direct comparison of pre- versus postcrisis time-use patterns. We introduce a tractable way for estimating these possible effects by measuring the impact of an increase in unemployment risk on time-use patterns of women and men living in couple households. The method developed here can be applied to other developing-country cases where there is a lack of longitudinal data availability. Our findings support the argument that economic crises reinforce the preexisting gender inequalities in work time.
B54|The Measurement of Time and Income Poverty|Official poverty thresholds are based on the implicit assumption that the household with poverty-level income possesses sufficient time for household production to enable it to reproduce itself as a unit. Several authors have questioned the validity of the assumption and explored alternative methods to account for time deficits in the measurement of poverty. I critically review the alternative approaches within a unified framework to highlight the commonalities and relative merits of individual approaches. I also propose a two-dimensional, time-income poverty measure that accounts for intrahousehold disparities in the division of household labor and briefly discuss its uses in thinking about antipoverty policies.
B54|The Potential Of Female Entrepreneurship As A Regional Growth And Development Engine In The Western Romania|"Starting from the objectives, activities, and the results of the empirical, quantitative, and qualitative research carried out in the AntrES project (AntrES - Project acronym ""Entrepreneurship and Equal Opportunities.

B54|Reason and responsibility:?reading Rizal’s letter to his Maloleña compatriots using the capabilities approach|Rizal’s letter to the women of Malolos emphasized reason and supported the education of women so that they may be enlightened, religiousness required reason, without reason there was only religiosity. Rizal’s letter argued that women’s value was contingent on their contribution to the Filipino identity, stressing how the character of motherhood reflected the character of motherland. Sen and Nussbaum’s capabilities approach is a broad framework within the liberal tradition followed by Rizal that allows for a better appreciation of Rizal’s messages in the context of modern-day understandings of development. In particular, reason and affiliation are central to the capabilities approach, which regards women (and men) as bearers of intrinsic value, helping identify not only the potential but also the limits of Rizal’s arguments. Current debates pertaining to individual rights and choice, including those on reproductive rights, provide a platform on which the relevance of Rizal’s messages may be tested. It is shown that the capabilities approach enhances Rizal’s messages for human development.
B54|Anne P. Carter: a Biographical Presentation|As a case study on the status of women in the economics profession, this article analyzes the fascinating career of Anne P. Carter. Prior to 1966 there were no women in the economics faculty at Harvard. In 1966 Carter became the first assistant professor of the Harvard Economics Department but, while she was permitted to offer seminars on topics of her choice and to advise students, she was never given any teaching assignments. Before that, while a Research Fellow at Harvard (1951-1955), she lectured at Smith College (1951-1953) and at Wellesley College (1954-1955). However, the 1970s were clearly a turn in the sense that Carter’s research interest were extended to energy and economic development issues, and that she left HERP (Wassily Leontief’s Harvard Economic Research Project) and Harvard in 1971 to move to Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. The situation of women at Harvard was still not encouraging. In 1967 she was one of the first women to become assistant professor in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard but she felt unwelcome. Hence, after two decades of ambiguous settlement at Harvard, Carter went to Brandeis University as visiting professor and accepted a full professorship in 1972. HERP was closed officially in 1973 and the HERP library and research materials were shipped to Brandeis. In contrast with Harvard’s “stifling constraints on women” (Carter), Brandeis offered many welcome opportunities. Carter’s career at Brandeis is dazzling: between 1972 and 1979 she directed the Brandeis Economic Research Center; she became Fred C. Hecht Professor of Economics in 1976, served as dean of the Faculty from 1981 to 1986, chair of the Department of Economics between 1987 and 1993, and was Acting Dean of Arts and Sciences 1999-2000. Carter greatly developed the department of economics at Brandeis, and in this respect her work with Peter A. Petri was crucial (see Carter and Petri 1977, 1979, 1980, 1986, 1989).
B54|Gendered effects of work and participation in collective forest management|This paper reports the results of a statistical investigation of the relationship between labor time expended in rural livelihoods, social structure, and community forest management. The object is to understand the impact of labor constraints to collective action. There are three main results. First, increasing time burden of work has a negative impact on collective forest management. Second, the gendered nature of work imposes a high burden on women and hence impedes their ability to participate in collective management even if incentives exist. In addition, lower access to social infrastructure further increases work burdens and decreases ability to participate. Finally, high levels of wealth lead to lower individual participation but this not because of high opportunity of time worked.
B54|Market integration, competitiveness and efficiency in urban vs. rural markets: male and female flower trading farms in West Bengal|[This paper seeks to measure the magnitude of inter temporal and spatial variations in the prices of flower crop between same type of marketing institutions as well as different types of marketing institutions and to assess the competitiveness and efficiency of marketing in the rural and urban trade markets of flower crops in West Bengal in Indian context where female act as important marketing agents. This study suggests that trade market for most of flower crops are not efficient in the area we studied. However, price per unit for all flower crops is lower in village level markets, and female marketing agents offer lower price for all flower crops in all types of markets. Also, the marketing efficiency for some flower crops is somewhat higher for female marketing agents
B54|Falešná neutralita neoklasické teorie: feministická, antropologická, evoluční a ekologická kritika<BR>[The False Neutrality of the Neoclassical Theory: Feminist, Anthropological, Evolutionary and Ecological Critiques]|The article argues that many failures of economic policies, especially in the developing world, are accountable to the methodological biases of the underlying mainstream economic science. While the new institutional and development economics have substantially improved economic models, they still rely on the neoclassical assumptions of methodological individualism and utilitarism. Therefore, they cannot fully grasp the gender and cultural aspects of the societies living in developing countries, the dynamic character of their economies and their embedment in the natural, social and institutional environment. These scientific biases are analysed from the standpoint of four heterodox economic schools: those of feminist economics, evolutionary economics, ecological economics, and economic anthropology. The subsequent failure of the economic policies is documented by the cross-cutting example of the Structural Adjustment Programmes of the Bretton Woods institutions. The article concludes by emphasizing the common points of the heterodox schools and advocating for a methodological plurality in the Czech economic research and education.
B54|Value Theory in an Incomplete Capitalist System|The centrality of social labor to Marxist epistemology and the need to understand relations between capitalist production, strictly defined, and incompletely marketized forms of work require a relatively broad concept of value. Not simply a theory of price, the utility of the concept of value lies precisely in its ability to mediate between understanding the abstract truths of laborâ€™s centrality to social life and the complex concreteness of the real world economy. The logical necessity and practical utility of the proposed interpretation is illustrated in relation to state and domestic labor.JEL classification: B51, B54, J01
B54|The life cycle of scholars and papers in economics - the 'citation death tax'| The information content of academic citations is a subject to debate. This article views premature death as a tragic 'natural experiment', outlining a methodology identifying the 'citation death tax' - the impact of the death of productive economists on the patterns of their citations. We rely on a sample of 428 papers written by 16 well-known economists who died well before retirement, during the period 1975 to 1997. The news is mixed: for half of the sample, we identify a large and significant 'citation death tax' for the average paper written by these scholars. For these authors, the estimated average missing citations per paper attributed to premature death ranges from 40% to 140% (the overall average is about 90%), and the annual costs of lost citations per paper are in the range 3-14%. Hence, a paper written 10 years before the author's death avoids a citation cost that varies between 30% and 140%. For the other half of the sample, there is no citation death tax; and for two Nobel Prize-calibre scholars in this second group, Black and Tversky, citations took off over time, reflecting the growing recognitions of their seminal works.

B54|Knowledge and Job Opportunities in a Gender Perspective: Insights from Italy|The paper proposes an enlargement of the traditional notion of human capital, by conceptualising knowledge in a comprehensive and multidimensional way. In our empirical approach, knowledge encompasses several formal and informal skills, to complement the mainstream view narrowly concerned with education and on-the-job training. Our results for Italy point out that despite much rhetoric about the reduction (or even the reversal) of gender gaps in education, women often lack the main skills and competencies that can profitably be deployed in the labour market. Unsurprisingly, in Italy womenâ€™s accumulation of labour market experience is mostly hindered by unpaid housework burdens. However, when adopting an extensive definition of knowledge these activities may be regarded as a source of relevant knowledge. Yet, they do not seem to be positively valued by the market, either in terms of employability or in terms of wages, thus calling for a serious rethinking of the role of knowledge in shaping menâ€™s and womenâ€™s economic opportunities
B54|Pourquoi les politiques publiques sont-elles si peu suivies d'effets ?. Quelques interrogations|The integration of women into the labour market has gone through both upswings and downturns. In view of this ambivalent result, we can question the efficiency of public policies set up to overcome gender inequality and fight gender discrimination. Does a real will exist, and if so why is it so inefficient or so poorly implemented? What forms do individual and collective resistance take? Most of the time, public policies are defined in terms of compensation and correction. But they don?t deal with the actual causes of women?s underemployment resulting from labour market adjustments. It is therefore the definition of the public policies that we need to examine, going beyond a binary view that opposes economic issues, on the one hand, to social, juridical and cultural concerns on the other.

B54|Pandita Ramabai Saraswathi: Making of a Social Entrepreneur|After the ingress of imperialism through colonization, Indian society underwent transition. Transition to modernity though opened up new avenues for the middle class women by enabling them to opt for English education and selective participation in the public sphere, there was hardly any escape from the broader patriarchal and caste dominated social design. An exploration into the social history of the 19th century India unfolds the intricate designs within the nation’s social fabric. The process of modernization opened new opportunities to the educated Indian men especially drawn from the dominant castes. These opportunities were in the form of ascribed status created at the bottom of the pyramids of power structure. Changing positions of men in the process of modernization called for realignment in the role of women within the family and society. These new roles for women necessitated the acquisition of certain skills, which was readily provided to them through English education. This also opened up a little space for women, which was not available to them in the system that prevailed till then. Pandita Ramabai Saraswathi was able to appropriate this little space that was opened for women. She had an in depth knowledge of the Hindu Religion, the gap between the practice and its philosophy, as reflected by the condition of women in the Indian society. Ramabai stands apart from many of her contemporaries, in a number of ways. This is the reason why, we choose to consider her a social entrepreneur of the period in which she lived. Accordingly, the term social entrepreneur is used to signify the leadership taken by Ramabai, the courage she has shown to accept the challenge, the manner in which she organized her whole project, and addressed the social problems confronted by women of her caste. Therefore, it was thought necessary to contextualize the situation within which Ramabai was driven towards the achievement of a social goal. The term social entrepreneur is of recent origin but the spirit of social enterprise is not new. It is not easy to frame a definition that would encompass the varied entrepreneurial ventures undertaken to achieve a social goal all over the world. It has to be understood as a particular concept constructed within a particular context. Even though the concept of social entrepreneur is mostly in circulation in the capitalist economy, it embodies features that are quite distinct from the reformers and business entrepreneurs. The paper attempts to make a contextualized space-time study of Ramabai as a social entrepreneur.
B54|The Women in Science in the Countries of European Union|We live in a time, when few people concern of that, why is so few women in the science; although nowadays is coequality between men and women. We would not to forget the reality; that women could have to study on the universities only from the 19th century. That could be one of the reasons, why nowadays is so few women in science. Certainly, the other reason is the fact; that women in history didn´t signify more in the society. Their maximal success in their life was to perform the position of the mother and wife. Their role was the nascence children, so that the parentage would be well-preserved and would not threaten the decrease of population; and not last one reason was the care about the household. The resource to employ was the utopian soon. The man was the bread-winner. In 19th century were the women too, those attended the educational institutions, the private or the public too. They were the women; those had to perform the wife-position of some officer, higher positioned man, in the future. The thinkers of enlightenment performed the opinion, that women can´t study and to develop the science, because they are very emotional. This description belongs to antipoles in the science, those the scientists’ couldn´t have to know. The most important in the science is the rationality and the objectivity; and especially these descriptions have men better developed.
B54|Female Employment in Formal and Informal Sectors of the Serbian Economy|With the economic crisis acknowledged in 2008, unemployment strongly increased – mostly due to the fall in the industrial sector – which indicates the possible emergence of a new poor and extremely poor population, alongside the decrease of trade deficit and foreign direct investment. Serbia has a large informal sector estimated at 35 per cent of GDP in 2007, fuelled by a weak regulatory framework, inappropriate tax and expenditure policies, and weaknesses in law enforcement, including the fight against corruption. It remains an important challenge as it reduces the efficiency of economic policies. The government should now focus on the following three issues to attract entrepreneurs in the formal sector: (i) contract enforcement (especially the functioning of the courts); (ii) access to finance (particularly bank credits); and (iii) clear title to land real property.
B54|Public Support and Inter-firm Collaborations in Women-Owned Firms|This study goes beyond the descriptive analyses of women entrepreneur’s networks, and advances the idea of interdependency between the different types of relationships they build. It emphasizes that developing ties with support institutions can reinforce and legitimate them in the interactions with peers organisations. The results of the research on a sample of Spanish women-owned business reveal that as the level of support obtained through the relationships with public entities increases, the average social interaction with clients and collaborators and the quality of relationships with collaborators increases. Further, we suggest that purposeful management of inter-organisational relationships can represent a valid instrument for overcoming lack of legitimacy and gender barriers.

B54|Strategies on Women Entrepreneurship Survival: a Case Study of Women Entrepreneurs in Zimbabwe Between 2007-2009|Today's entrepreneurs require a comprehensive stock of knowledge and skills that are both related to their type of business and adaptable for change of their local and international environment .Rapid changes in the Southern African region in general and the country of Zimbabwe in particular, in the socio-economic structures are propelling entrepreneurs especially women towards the search for a competitive edge away from the “crowd”, in order to survive. The competitive edge strategies are essential for all visionary women entrepreneurs of the twenty-first century. This paper gives an insight on how various women entrepreneurs managed to adapt to the Zimbabwean unfamiliar business environment during 2007-2009. These women state the different challenges that they faced and the strategies they used to win over and be successful.
B54|Social Changes and Their Impact on Women in Turkey and Its Membership to the EU|The aim of this paper is to reflect Gender,Discrimination and Human Rights in Turkey, Most of the Women in Turkey face setbacks with regard to education, employment and public representation. The illiteracy rate for women in Turkey is nearly twenty percent, while female employment is under thirty percent. In addition, women are poorly represented in the political sector, and only four percent of parliamentary seats are occupied by women. On the other hand Gender discrimination and violence against women are a widespread problem throughout Turkey. In a recommendation on Turkey’s accession to the European Union, the European Commission noted that discrimination and violence against women, including honor killings, remains a major problem.On the Other hand, Honor killings are another widespread violation of women's human rights together with sexual assault which is a serious problem in the Country.
B54|Development of Women Education in India|Women constitute almost half of the population of the world. Education for women is the best way to improve the health, nutrition and economic status of a household that constitute a micro unit of a nation economy. In this context, it can be argued that lack of woman education can be an impediment to the country’s economic development. In India, women achieve far less education that of men. As per the Census report 2001, the literacy rate of women is 54.16 per cent and that of men is 65.38 per cent. There has been a sincere effort to improve the education attainment of women by both government and voluntary organizations. The changes in the policies and infrastructural supports on primary, secondary and higher education reflect the initiatives of the Government of India towards women education. This paper examined the trends in women education, the investments on education and infrastructural supports in India. The study revealed that there had been significant progress in the performance of women education revealed from female literacy levels and its change over time. It was also observed that the gaps between rural and urban female literacy rates are narrowing down. It was observed that rural poverty acts as a push factors for women’s education rather than as an obstacle to women’s education. The significant influence of urbanization on women’s education implied that urbanization had been playing a beneficial role in the attainment of women’s education in India. At the same time, the drop-out rate had a negative effect on women’s education. It revealed that that reduction of girl’s drop-out rates is necessary for achieving women’s education. The initiatives of the government through investment and infrastructure in developing education in India were examined. With regard to facilities in schools, it had improved significantly, but a lot more need to be done. In sum, the study revealed that there have been concerted efforts to encourage girls to attend schools, which would lead to higher literacy in future. The study also revealed that there are several infrastructural barriers to women education in India. The study calls for focused approach towards increasing women centred educational infrastructure so as to reduce the women drop-out rates and to improve female literacy levels in India.
B54|Impact of microcredit programmes on women empowerment: an empirical study in West Bengal|Based on an empirical study in West Bengal, this paper attempts to examine whether women‟s involvement in the microcredit programme through SHGs makes any positive change on women‟s empowerment that appears from the assessment on various indicators of power, autonomy and self-reliance, entitlement, participation , awareness and capacity-building. The study suggests that if women participating in the microcredit programme through SHGs sustain for some longer period (eight years or more), such a programme might contribute to higher level of women‟s empowerment than all types of control groups under study
B54|Women’s Development: The Indian Experience|Gone are the days when women had enjoyed equality of power and rights in the society. The persistence of the patriarchate with a sacrosanct support by the Scriptures had firmly contained within its hold the entire sphere of familial and social life in India and had in turn confined woman’s life to the family and that fate had continued for long during the static slumber of the Asiatic society. It was the big bang of the greedy European colonialism and its repercussions in the form of hot blooded nationalist feelings that gradually weakened the patriarchal chains on womanhood. Even though the principle of gender equality is firmly established in the Indian Constitution, translating de jure gender equality and the promise of social, economic and political justice, into de facto reality has been one of India’s major challenges over the years. There is still unfortunately a wide gap between the goals enunciated in the Constitution, legislation and policies and the current status of Indian women. Though for the first time, a separate section on `Gender Equity’ was included in the Draft Approach Paper to the 11th Five Year Plan, the paper has not given enough focus on women’s empowerment issues in the country. The present paper critically examines the Indian experience over time of women’s development.

B54|Pourquoi les politiques publiques sont-elles si peu suivies d’effets ?: Quelques interrogations|L’insertion des femmes sur le marché du travail a connu à la fois des avancées et des reculs. Si davantage de femmes accèdent à l’éducation supérieure et aux emplois qualifiés, d’autres sont touchées par la précarité et connaissent une dégradation de leurs conditions de travail et de vie. Face à ce constat ambivalent, on peut questionner la mise en œuvre et l’efficacité des politiques qui visent à promouvoir l’égalité entre les femmes et les hommes. Cet article a pour objectif de soulever quelques débats. Le plus souvent, les politiques publiques au sens large (y compris la protection sociale) sont définies en termes de compensation et de correction des inégalités et des discriminations. Mais elles ne concernent pas les causes effectives de l’extension du sous-emploi des femmes, qui relèvent du fonctionnement même du marché du travail. C’est donc la définition des politiques publiques qu’il faut interroger, en dépassant une vision binaire qui oppose d’une part un champ économique extérieur, d’autre part un champ social, juridique et culturel qui, seul, pourrait être l’objet d’inflexions. En réalité, le champ économique est aussi le produit des politiques publiques : la libre-concurrence et la prééminence du marché sont le résultat d’une action volontaire des États. Il faut donc réintégrer les politiques économiques dans le champ de la réflexion sur les moyens de combattre les discriminations à l’encontre des femmes.

B54|Selection wages and discrimination|Applicants for any given job are more or less suited to fill it, and the firm will select the best among them. Increasing the wage offer attracts more applicants and makes it possible to raise the hiring standard, thereby improving the productivity of the staff. Wages that optimize on the trade-off between the wage level and the productivity of the workforce are known as selection wages. As men react more strongly to wage differentials than females, the trade-off is more pronounced for men and a profit-maximizing firm will offer a higher wage for men than for women in equilibrium. The argument is not confined to issues of sex discrimination; rather it is of relevance for all labor markets where labor heterogeneity is important and supply elasticities vary systematically across occupations.
B54|Economistas liberales y cuestión femenina. El singular discurso de la domesticidad de la escuela economista española (1861-1909)|The texts by the Spanish Economist School (second half of the 19th century) –so called liberals- valued the role of women in the economy and the society in a way which strongly confronted the prevailing discourse that defended a unique and exclusive role for all women: housewife and mother. Most members of the Spanish liberal economic trend defended female work in the factories, arguing in terms of wages; they even asked for professional training for illiterate women (who in many cases could not even write and read for the fact of being a woman). The texts of those economists provided new ideas about the economic and social role of women in a Spain dominated by a discourse that denied the need for female work even for poor working class families

B54|Economic growth, gendered division of labour and unpaid domestic services in historical perspective|This paper discusses the issue of including unpaid domestic services in Swedish historical national accounts. The paper analyses the period 1964-2000, based on the time use studies for 1964 and 2000/2001. During this period, in Sweden, the proportion between hours worked in unpaid domestic services and paid work, respectively, did not change to any substantial degree. However, a fundamental change in the gendered division of labour took place. Men substantially increased their share in unpaid domestic services and women substantially increased their share in paid worked. The inclusion of unpaid domestic services in historical national accounts changes our perception of long-term economic growth and structural change. For example, the increase in the relative size of services during the second half of the 20th century can largely be explained by the increasing rate of participation of women in the labour market. The paper finds that Swedish economic growth in the post-war period would most likely be lowered if unpaid domestic services would be included in GDP, but probably not more than by 0.1-0.3 percentage points per year.
B54|The Position of Female Entrepreneurs in the European Union and Transition Countries|"In the European Union at the level of the European Commission the principle of gender equality, called gender mainstreaming, has been introduced in all areas of activities and policy. The term ""gender mainstreaming"" is the key and it has been accepted for the implementation of policies of gender equality in the EU Member States, that, according to the definition of the Council of Europe means reorganization, improvement, development and evaluation of political processes in a way that the perspective of gender equality is included in all policies at all levels and degrees, by the actors involved in political decision-making. Although women constitute the majority of the world's population, in the field of entrepreneurial activities they constitute the minority due to their socially, economically and politically inferior position with regard to men. Sex-related inequalities on the labor market and in entrepreneurial activities are connected to unequal educational and training opportunities which are further reflected to their choice of profession and possibilities for advancement. The change in social paradigms has radically altered the balance of powers between women and men in society at large, as well as in business. However, the fact is that there are fewer women entrepreneurs in relation to men. The aim of the paper is to identify the major obstacles encountered by women in a business. This paper also serves to support the entrepreneurship of women and to promote its development."
B54|Factors Affecting Performance of Women Entrepreneurs|Entrepreneurship is the assumption of risk and responsibility in designing and implementing a business strategy or starting a business. It is common in all societies and is usually embarked upon by choice or as a last resort in economic hardship. Entrepreneurship is usually part of the informal sector in both developed and developing countries and the success rate of gender in this arm of business is dependent on a variety of factors. There are similarities in gender performance between different economies but also stark differences in their cultural and socio-economic environment.

B54|Processes of Incubating African Female Entrepreneurs: Some Evidences from Senegal and Tanzania|This paper seeks to examine the processes of incubating African female entrepreneurs. It is observed that despite the growing interest and large volume of literature on business incubation and their role in local economic growth, theories have been silent on explaining the role(s) of “female incubatees” within this process. The particular focus of this paper is on our current understanding of the nature of the complex processes of providing business support services to female entrepreneurs in Africa, an analysis of how incubation might address those challenges, and some tentative lessons drawn from our empirical research and entrepreneurs` own experiences. Therefore, this paper includes information and analysis on a number of business incubation initiatives, but its goal is to provide an understanding of what might work in the incubation industry and, in particular, why in specific circumstances female-owned businesses fail or succeed in the competitive business environment, which is often dominated by men. Its focus, therefore, is on incubation as means, not ends, as policies that enable businesses to overcome barriers during both pre and post-establishment. The local policies, enterprises and institutions form a significant part of this paper. Although it has been well documented that African female entrepreneurs are constrained by structural, cultural and institutional barriers (Spring and MacDade, 2005; Kyaruzi and Hales, 2006), the solutions to overcoming such barriers remain problematic. Also, their roles in the incubation processes are rarely mentioned in most policies on entrepreneurship in Africa. In an attempt to understand the mysterious concepts behind this one sided view, this paper draws its conclusions from studies conducted in Senegal and Tanzania to examine the role(s) of female entrepreneurs within the incubation process. Data was drawn from 160 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania firms and 40 female-owned businesses in Dakar, Senegal. The findings suggest that in most cases, the theories appear to treat the incubators and the business incubation processes as unproblematic institutions or policy tools for creating businesses and stimulating local economic growth through employment creation and taxes generated from new ventures. The conclusions suggest a need for more empirical studies on incubation processes and calls for new ways of incubating female entrepreneurs to realise their potential contributions to local economic growth. Since they have social and economic roles to play in contributing to local economic growth, our paper suggests that it is of significant importance to understand the processes and policies that are directed towards nurturing and supporting their ventures. This, and other elements that have been mentioned in this paper will enable policymakers and bilateral institutions to direct resources where they are mostly needed i.e. training, empowerment, capacity building and backup support.
B54|Gender Equity in Nigeria’s Educational System: A Necessity for Socio-Economic Development|This paper is devoted to education of women as a key precondition for improving family health as well as the socio-economic status of the entire country. Education empowers women to participate in decision-making in the society and thus gives them the opportunity to make positive decision affecting their lives. Since the situation in the country is such that favours men as against women, efforts should be made by governments at all levels to educate and encourage the girl child through their parents on the need to go to school by introducing various policy measures. The authors suggested some of the measures that can be adopted to national education policy which should include free education for girls, lower grades for girls as against that of men, more hostels for girls to remove them from household chores, legislation against forced marriages as practiced in some parts of the Northern country, bursaries and scholarships should be given to girls especially those on science, technical and engineering programmes.
B54|Development and Survival Strategies in Jordan and the Contribution of Female-Owned Firms to Domestic Economic Growth in Turkey|This paper will help you to determine where to strive and in a way how to make changes to the cultures. Types of semi similar Cultures between two ethics - man and women have also been exemplified with diversity synthesis oriented on both Jordanian and Turkish local economic growth with a perspective on development, survival strategies and the role of woman owned firms/industries. The findings demonstrate that self-efficacy could represent an important individual trait for examining whistleblowing issues. Internal whistleblowing is becoming an important organizational consideration in many areas of survival strategy.
B54|Employer of Last Resort Policy and Feminist Economics: Social Provisioning and Socialization of Investment|The paper discusses the Employment of Last Resort (ELR) policy proposal that has emerged from Post Keynesian theory as an embodiment of what Keynes called “socialization of investment,” as well as an avenue for a social provisioning approach towards socialization of unpaid care labor. Intersections between Post Keynesian and feminist economics are delineated. The paper proposes avenues for input from feminist economics into formulation of an ELR policy, and raises questions about transformation of gender relations.
B54|Women’s Development and Development Discourse|The process of development in the developing countries had, by and large, marginalised women and deprived them of the control over resources and authority within the household, without lightening the heavy burden of their ‘traditional duties’. The last century was however marked by a remarkable though gradual shift in the way women were perceived within the development policy, namely from the stature of victims and passive objects to that of independent agents. This gradual shift in policy approaches was informed by changing perceptions about women and their relationship with development. A significant impetus to raising such an informed platform came with the adoption of development issues within the UN system, in the background of increasing activism of development practitioners. The present paper critically traces the contours and its possible shades of this awakening that rises from the less ‘threatening’ planning for Women in Development (WID) to the more ‘confrontational’ gender planning with its aspiring goal of empowerment and emancipation. These movements have occasioned an increasing space for policy initiatives and interventions in favour of poor women in the Third World. There has been a gradual shift in orientation of these policy approaches towards women from ‘welfare’, to equity’ to anti-poverty’ to ‘efficiency’ and finally to ‘empowerment’. The policy reorientation reflects the changes in the basic economic approaches of the time, from modernization policies of accelerated growth, to basic needs strategies of growth with redistribution, to the recent so-called ‘compensatory measures’ for the neo-liberal illfare. The paper argues, inter alia, that the compensatory measures imply a substitution of the agency of civil society for that of the state in development process, the original agenda of the neo-liberalism.
B54|Behind the negotiations: Financial decision-making processes in Spanish dual-income couples| This article focuses on how dual-income heterosexual couples make financial decisions. Dual-income households have increased considerably in the last three decades in most developed countries. The study was based in Spain and involved qualitative interviews with couples, with each couple interviewed together and separately. This innovative technique allows researchers to study financial decision-making processes and to detect gender inequalities that may appear during negotiations. Analysis of decision making among the couples in the sample provides evidence that, despite claims of equality, not all decisions are negotiated or made by consensus. On the contrary, decisions are often the consequence of established social norms, and, frequently, there are issues that couples exclude from negotiation.
B54|Feminist Economics of Inequality, Development, and Growth| This study examines connections between intergroup inequality and macroeconomic outcomes, considering various channels through which gender, growth, and development interact. It upholds the salience not only of equality in opportunities but also equality in outcomes. The contribution argues that inequalities based on gender, race, ethnicity, and class undermine the ability to provision and expand capabilities, and it examines the macroeconomic policies that are likely to promote broadly shared development. It explores how the macroeconomy acts as a structure of constraint in achieving gender equality and in turn how gender relations in areas like education and wage gaps can have macro-level impacts. Further, it underscores that the interaction of the macroeconomy and gender relations depends on the structure of the economy, the nature of job segregation, the particular measure of gender inequality, and a country's international relations. Finally, it outlines policies for promoting gender equality as both an intrinsic goal and a step toward improving well-being.
B54|Gender Equality and Economic Growth in the World Bank World Development Report 2006| This contribution examines how gender equality features in the World Bank's World Development Report 2006: Equity and Development, focusing on its conceptual framework, use of empirical evidence, and policy recommendations. It concludes that despite acknowledging that liberalization and privatization have been captured by elites for their own benefit, the report still clings to a neoclassical understanding of how markets and competition work. Moreover, although the report emphasizes gender inequality in opportunities as a trap that hinders economic growth, it shows no understanding of economic growth as a gendered process in which old forms of gender inequality are weakened but new forms of gender inequality emerge.
B54|Measuring the Quality of Employment in the Informal Sector|Our paper explores and measures the quality of employment among urban, low-income households in Ecuador. It hopes to contribute to the literature by raising attention to the diversity of job quality within the informal sector and by highlighting the importance of quality of employment in the context of poverty reduction and development strategies. Building on the previous work on decent work indicators, we propose a job quality index measure and apply this measure to men and women workers in urban poor communities of Ecuador using a 2002 sample survey. We also show that there are differentiated patterns on job quality among women and men in these households. In addressing the importance of employment quality, this paper hopes to provide a better understanding of the issue, especially as it relates to poverty alleviation and to illustrate a way of measuring employment quality.
B54|Feministická filozofia a pokračovanie diskurzu (po rokoch)|Herta Lagl-Docekal, profesorka na Viedenskej univerzite, je slovenskej a českej odbornej verejnosti známa zo svojich prednáškových aktivít, spolupráce s feministickými teoretičkami na Slovensku i v Čechách zo začiatku deväťdesiatych rokov. V publikácii Feministická filosofie - výsledky, problémy a perspektívy, v českom preklade Hany Havelkovej, pojednáva o problematike súčasného diskurzu vo feministickej filozofii. Táto oblasť je v širšom povedomí slovenskej odbornej verejnosti málo reflektovaná, preto je vydanie takejto publikácie vítaným krokom a môže sa stať podnetnou platformou pre rozsiahlejšiu diskusiu v slovenskom (i českom) myšlienkovom priestore.
B54|Future gender relations in global restructuring processes case study evidence from knowledge-intensive, manufacturing and service occupations|Global restructuring processes have not only strong implications for European working and living realities, but also have specific outcomes with regard to gender relations. The following contribution analyses in which way global restructuring shapes current gender relations in order to identify important trends and developments for future gender (in)equalities at the workplace. On the basis of a large qualitative study on global restructuring and impacts on different occupational groups it argues that occupational belonging in line with skill and qualification levels are crucial factors to assess the further development of gender relations at work. Whereas global restructuring in knowledge-based occupations may provide new opportunities for female employees, current restructuring is going to deteriorate female labour participation in service occupations. In contrast, manufacturing occupations can be characterised by persistent gender relations, which do not change in spite of major restructuring processes at the work place. Taking the institutional perspective into account, it seems to be crucial to integrate the occupational perspective in order to apply adequate policy regulations to prevent the reinforcement of gender related working patterns in the near future.
B54|The crisis of care, international migration, and public policy| Focusing on Europe's reconciliation policies, aimed to balance family and labor market work, this paper explores whether some of the legislative efforts introduced in Europe during the past decade could be applied to Latin American countries with important migrant populations, such as Bolivia and Ecuador. This paper argues that there are differences between Northern and Southern countries that would influence the effectiveness of these kinds of policies in the South. Three differences in particular - the availability of domestic service, the extent of the informal economy, and international migration - are taken into consideration. Using the capabilities approach framework, this paper outlines other lines of public policy action that can be useful in designing reconciliation policies for the South. Finally, the paper argues that there is an urgent need for re-thinking gender equity within the emerging gender order across countries.
B54|Safety First, Then Condoms: Commercial Sex, Risky Behavior, and the Spread of HIV/AIDS in Managua, Nicaragua| This study analyzes the commercial sex market in Managua, Nicaragua, to understand risky behavior among sex workers. While health risks are a major concern for sex workers, the risk of violence weighs more heavily in decision making, such that they more often take risks to their health than to their immediate, physical well-being. These concerns are reflected in the lower premiums sex workers charge for unprotected sex (39 percent more for vaginal sex without a condom) compared with risks of violence, such as accompanying a client to an unknown place (a 118 percent premium). Risk behaviors reflect a rational calculation of actual risk: while only 9 percent of the sample knew anyone diagnosed with HIV, nearly 44 percent of sex workers had been assaulted. These observations indicate the need to consider sex workers' physical safety in policies to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
B54|Institutions and Gender Empowerment in the Global Economy|Since women account for almost 50 percent of the world's population, the sustainability of development of the global economy can be greatly impaired if the state authorities in individual countries pay less attention to the improvement in the socio-economic status of women relative to men. Improvement in socio-economic status which facilitates empowerment of individuals is greatly dependent on conducive informal institutions and state institutions. This book is the first of its kind to critically examine the role of these institutions in women's empowerment in five continents in the world. The analysis of the role of institutions in individual countries is underpinned by a robust theoretical background presented in the first three chapters. The chapters on individual countries also include a section dealing with recommendations for changes in state policies affecting women's empowerment.
