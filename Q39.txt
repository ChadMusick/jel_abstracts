Q39|The foreign direct investment-institution nexus in oil-abundant countries|The present work reassesses the link between natural resources, institutional quality and foreign direct investment (FDI). In particular, we focus on the impact of good governance and democracy on foreign direct investment in oil-abundant countries. To this end, we estimate the effect of host countries’ institutions on the extensive margin (number of bilateral greenfield investment projects), using a gravity equation for a dataset that covers 182 countries during 2003-2012. Our findings confirm that compliance to rule of law, lack of corruption, political stability and democracy could boost new FDI links through the extensive margin. Our results could not rule out the “oil curse”, meaning that oil producers attract fewer new greenfield projects than similar countries without oil. Unlike other studies, we show that the impact of institutions is not necessarily undermined by the presence of natural resources.
Q39|Environmental perception of resident farmers in agroforestry yards|The objective of this study was to investigate aspects related to the perception of sustainable agriculture, especially on agroforestry yards, on rural properties of family farmers. Considering the proposed objectives, the present research is methodologically characterized as quantitative, exploratory and descriptive. The work was carried out on rural properties of the family farmers of the Rural region of Ponte Alta, Gama Administrative Region, in the city of Brasília, Federal District, Brazil. The questionnaire used was composed of five blocks of questions, structured according to the objectives to be reached, in order to identify the profile of the family farmers, use of the yard, and environmental perceptions. The data treatment was performed through descriptive statistical analysis, using the R² software. We interviewed 99 people aged between 18 and 83 years with an average age of 49 years. Family farmers in the Ponte Alta - Gama region have little education. About 40% of the interviewees did not finish high school. Most farmers plant for the purpose of feeding, amounting to 96.97%. Then, the main reason is the trade, with more than half of the respondents, 57.58%. Finally, the other reasons were not so relevant, leisure with 14.14%, landscaping with 13.13%, occupational therapy and others with 8.08%. 45% of the informants refer to water as the main factor of the environment, while 75% have the perception that deforestation is the main source of aggression to natural resources. The agroforestry yards, in addition to ensuring a rich and diverse diet, both for self-consumption or to market surpluses in the local marketing channels, allows the planting and conservation of forest species important for the conservation of nature and softens environmental impacts on small farms. The study of perception in ethnobotanical and socio-forest relations can favor a more sustainable use of environmental resources.
Q39|Mergers in nonrenewable resource oligopolies and environmental policies|We examine the profitability of horizontal mergers within nonrenewable resource industries, which account for a large proportion of merger activities worldwide. Each firm owns a private stock of the resource and uses open-loop strategies when choosing its extraction path. We analytically show that even a small merger (merger of 2 firms) is always profitable when the resource stock owned by each firm is small enough. In the case where pollution is generated by the industry’s activity, we show that an environmental policy that increases the firms’ production cost or reduces their selling price can deter a merger. This speeds up the industry’s extraction and thereby causes emissions to occur earlier than under a laissez-faire scenario.

Q39|Oil, Laws, and Female Labor Force Participation|Abstract Despite the rapid rise of women’s education and the fall of their fertility rates in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), female labor force participation (FLFP) rates remain low. This paper argues that oil and gas rents and Islamic family law jointly matter. Controlling for country and year fixed-effects in a long panel dataset, it shows that per capita oil and gas rents reduce FLFP rates in countries with Islamic family law more than others. The results are robust to econometric methodology and to controlling for the interaction of rents and all other time-constant factors that are common across the MENA region, such as culture, social norms, and institutions. Moreover, the results cannot be replicated by substituting historical plough use, a strong predictor of gender discrimination, in place of Islamic family law. Policy implications are discussed.
Q39|Optimal Production of Crude Oil Based on Buy Back Contract: Case Study of Foroozan Oil Field|In this paper, the optimal production of oil from Forzooan field is extracted Based on Buy Back contract governing it. With regard to the role of the National Iranian Oil Company in managing operating process of the field, this optimal production is estimated in according to maximization net present value of NIOC from oil production of the field. Thus, in this paper in according to mechanism and information of fiscal regime of Buy Back contract, revenue and cost functions of NIOC for period of the contract is estimated and then based on target function of this study and using optimal control method Generalize Reduced Gradient (GRG) is estimated optimal production in the framework three scenario and three expected price conditions. Finally, from this study concluded that optimal production level has direct relation with expectations of price and depletion rate of the field and it has reserve relation with discount factor. Also because of obligation of protective production principal, optimal production level is lower than contractual production level.
Q39|Investment and uncertainty with time to build: Evidence from entry into U.S. copper mining|The standard real-options model predicts that increased uncertainty discourages investment. When projects are large and take time to build, however, that prediction can be reversed. We investigate the investment/uncertainty relationship empirically using historical data on opening dates of new U.S. copper mines – large, irreversible projects with substantial construction lags. Both the timing of the decision to go forward and the price thresholds that trigger that decision are assessed. In particular, we build upon a reduced form analysis to construct a structural model of entry. We find that, in this market, greater uncertainty encourages investment and lowers the price thresholds for many mines.
Q39|¿Apropiación privada de renta de recursos naturales? El caso del cobre en Chile|Unexpected increases of natural resource prices can generate rents, value that should be recovered by the State to minimize inefficiencies, avoid arbitrary discrimination between citizens and keep a sustainable trajectory. As a case study about private appropriation of natural resource rent, this work explores the case of copper in Chile since 1990, empirically analyzing if the 12 main private mining companies have recovered in present value more than their investment during their life cycle. The results of this exercise, applicable to other natural resources, indicate that some actually have, capturing about US$40 billion up to 2012. Elaborating an adequate institutional framework for future deposits remain important challenges for Chile to plentifully take advantage its mining potential, as well as for any country with an abundant resource base to better enjoy its natural wealth. For that purpose, a concession known as Least Present Value Revenue (LPVR) is proposed.// Los aumentos de precio de un recurso natural pueden generar renta, cuyo valor debiese ser recuperado por el Estado para minimizar ineficiencias en la economía, evitar discriminaciones arbitrarias entre ciudadanos y mantener una trayectoria sostenible. Como tema de estudio sobre apropiación privada de renta de recursos naturales, este artículo explora el caso del cobre en Chile desde 1990, analizando empíricamente si las principales mineras privadas han recuperado en valor presente más que su inversión. Los resultados del ejercicio, aplicable a otros recursos naturales, indican que algunas mineras sí lo han hecho, captando unos 40?000 millones de dólares hasta 2012. Elaborar una institucionalidad idónea para futuros yacimientos es un importante desafío para que Chile aproveche su potencial minero, así como para que cualquier país con una abundante base de recursos goce plenamente de su riqueza natural. Para tal efecto, se propone la concesión conocida como Mínimo Valor Presente de Ingresos (MVPI)
Q39|Mineral exploration as a game of chance|Exploration is a costly activity that helps a business improve their understanding of a potential mineral deposit. Yet, even with strong exploration results, the business faces uncertainty over the value of the mine. I model this situation as a game of chance. The game starts by giving an agent an asset with random value and ends when the agent chooses to accept the random value or reject it and receive zero instead. The agent can pay to learn more about the asset’s value as many times as they like before they end the game, but no amount of exploration will remove all uncertainty. I provide a decision rule for the agent based on an interval estimate for the asset value and analyze performance of the decision rule in a simulation experiment.
Q39|Valoarea Economică A Ariilor Protejate<BR>[Economic value of protected area]|Protected Area help to sustain income, output and consumption across the economy. Also, generate employment and earn the government fiscal revenues. The economic specialists have been making increasing use of the concept of total economic evaluation to assess the value of protected areas. Many protected areas are managed on a multiple-use basis and tourism and recreation are among the very important uses of such areas. To determine the optimal use of such areas is an important problem for the community and for the managers of protected areas. These article provides core information about economic valuation of protected area and present, synthetically, the case study.
Q39|Accounting for the effect of exogenous non-Economic variables on natural gas demand in oil producing African countries|With less than 50% of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa having access to modern forms of energy and the desire to minimize the impact of energy consumption on the environment, there is a need to invest in an energy source that is affordable, available and environmentally clean. Natural gas is therefore the preferred choice of energy since it has minimum impact on the environment among the fossil fuels and is relatively affordable. In this study, the generalized methods of moments (GMM), a dynamic panel two stage least squares and the general unrestricted model (GUM) through AutometricsTM are employed to estimate the demand for natural gas in oil producing African countries. The GUM suggests that oil producing African countries have been consuming excessive natural gas that seems to offset improved technical efficiency of appliances. The study finds that both economic and technical factors are important drivers of natural gas consumption. In particular, output exerts a positive and significant influence on natural gas demand, whereas energy price and energy resource depletion have a negative and significant effect. It is recommended that energy efficiency measures should be implemented in these countries.

Q39|Effects of speculation and interest rates in a “carry trade” model of commodity prices|The paper presents and estimates a model of the prices of oil and other storable commodities, a model that can be characterized as reflecting the carry trade. It focuses on speculative factors, here defined as the trade-off between interest rates on the one hand and market participants' expectations of future price changes on the other hand. It goes beyond past research by bringing to bear new data sources: survey data to measure expectations of future changes in commodity prices and options data to measure perceptions of risk. Some evidence is found of a negative effect of interest rates on the demand for inventories and thereby on commodity prices and positive effects of expected future price gains on inventory demand and thereby on today's commodity prices.
Q39|Legislando minas. Breve recuento de la legislación minera en Colombia (1829 – 2001)|Este documento presenta un breve recuento de la legislación minera en el país durante su vida republicana, esto es, desde 1829, fecha en que Simón Bolívar expidió el decreto sobre minas o Ley minera, hasta 2001, cuando se expidió el Código de Minas que rige en la actualidad. El objetivo del texto consiste en describir cómo han cambiado, a lo largo del tiempo, el conjunto de reglas y los objetivos de la política minera a nivel nacional para así identificar sus rasgos centrales, principales cambios y continuidades. La descripción se estructura alrededor de los siguientes ejes temáticos: 1) propiedad del recurso minero; 2) sistemas legales o instrumentos jurídicos que regularon el proceso de su aprovechamiento; 3) relación entre minería y entorno (ambiente y comunidades); y 4) legalización y formalización. El documento hace un breve recuento de cerca de doscientos años de historia de la legislación minera y busca servir de herramienta académica de consulta general para nutrir e informar el debate actual, ubicándolo en su contexto histórico.
Q39|On Productivity: The Influence of Natural Resource Inputs|The production function underlying standard estimates of multifactor productivity (MFP)typically restricts the list of explicitly measured inputs to capital, labour and intermediate inputs (energy, materials and services). These inputs are measured in the national accounts, and in most industries are the most important or significant inputs to production. All other influences on output are captured by the MFP ‘residual.’ However in some industries – mining, agriculture, and utilities – output can also depend significantly on unmeasured inputs of natural resources. Rainfall in agriculture is an obvious example, but so too is the issue of mineral resource deposits in the mining sector, particularly where mining is a mature industry and the richest and most accessible deposits have already been developed. In this article we attribute a substantial part of recent large negative changes in MFP growth in the mining, agriculture and utilities industries in Australia to unmeasured natural resource input changes. As MFP growth estimates derived from the application of the usual production function are generally interpreted as measuring improvements in the ‘technology’ used to convert standard inputs into output, where there are significant changes in natural resource dependent industries this interpretation of MFP needs to be adjusted.
Q39|Access to electricity and socio-economic characteristics: panel data evidence from 31 countries|The case study literature on access to electricity highlighted a number of socio-economic variables linked to it. The purpose of our research is to check whether these variables also show up in panel data/cross-country regressions and to assess their relative strength. Our results support the widespread belief that electrification plans in developing countries should target rural areas and extensively rely on renewable energy sources. They should also be accompanied by measures fostering human capital accumulation and the involvement of local population. These general results need to be gauged within each country's specific context, carefully considering its own complexities. Therefore, our results complement, rather than substitute the available case study literature.
Q39|Linkages between spot and futures prices: Tests of the Fama-French-Samuelson hypotheses|This paper develops GARCH and VEC-MGARCH-based tests of four hypotheses from Fama and French (1988) involving linkages between spot and futures prices --- both their levels and variances. The tests are applied to monthly data for seven metals traded on the London Metal Exchange over the period 1988:11, where available, through 2008:07.
Q39|Infoenergy: Technology for Replacing Massive Degradation with Speedier (Cleaner) Energy|This paper provides an information technology perspective of energy that can help explain and promote more environmentally friendly energy sources. Following the equation energy equals mass times velocity squared (E = m * v2), a source 10 times more massive will produce 10 times more energy, but a source 10 times faster will produce 100 times more energy. Since chemical sources such as oil combustion are about ten times faster than mechanical sources such as waterfalls and winds, getting the same quantity of energy out of wind would require 10 times more mass (steel and concrete for wind towers), than getting it out of burning oil (CO2 and oil plants materials). A nuclear source is one million times faster than chemical, thus its mass requirement is negligible but technology (mainly information technology) is needed to safely drive its speed allowing us to substitute mass -i.e. future debris- with information.
Q39|Determination of the effect of operating cost uncertainty on mining project evaluation|Mining projects are complex businesses that demand constant risk assessment. This is because several kinds of uncertainties influence the value of a mine project, typically. These uncertainties may be classified as exploration uncertainties, economic uncertainties and engineering uncertainties. The evaluation of a mine project under these uncertainties is a complicated job, which may lead to making a wrong decision by managers and stockholders. Therefore, at first, the engineers must recognize the mining uncertainties before carrying out the project evaluation. The economic uncertainties are the most important factors, which may affect the project evaluation. Among the mentioned uncertainties, the operating cost uncertainty is an important and effective factor, which is ignored to a certain extent.
Q39|The Asymmetric Long-Run Relationship Between Crude Oil And Gold Futures|This study employs the momentum threshold error-correction model with generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity to investigate asymmetric cointegration and causal relationships between West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil and gold prices in the futures market. The paper examines data from May 1, 1994 to November 20, 2008. The empirical results show that an asymmetric long-run adjustment exists between gold and oil. Furthermore, the causality relationship shows that West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil plays a dominant role. The findings should prove valuable to individual investors and financial institutions who can use the findings here to gold prices based on oil prices.
Q39|Some observations on copper yields and ore grades|The paper examines trends in the average copper content of mined ores over the years. It has tended to decline over the long term, but by no means evenly. US averages are not typical of global averages, at least in the past four decades. Those have been both higher, and less volatile than in the US. One reason for falling averages is a change in the type of deposit mined, with a rise in the share of relatively low grade porphyry deposits. The different nature of their deposits is reflected in marked differences in grades between the different continents. African and Australian average grades are higher than the global average, and changes in the share of Central Africa in global output have affected the global average grade. Yields are have been consistently lower in North America than elsewhere, and Latin American average grades have trended downwards, reflecting both the ageing of mines and the rising share of production from porphyry deposits. Typically the yield of mines declines over time as mining proceeds. The average copper content of ore deposits is usually below the average yield of the ore accessed in the early years of production. The initial grades of new mines have not declined over the past forty years, and there has been no perceptible tendency for the average grade of porphyry deposits brought into production to decline over time. There is no apparent correlation between average grade and deposit size, but mine operators tend to exploit economies of scale to offset low grades. The relationship between the annual percentage yields (the head grade) and the reserve grades of deposits is not static. In recent years head grades have fallen closer to reserve grades. The relationship may be affected by movements in metal prices. Although the evidence about the influence of prices is not clear-cut, it does suggest that prices and cut-off grades may be inversely related. As many ores contain other valuable metals besides copper, copper yields will sometimes be subordinated to the extraction of these other metals. Copper equivalent grades have not moved in the same way as copper grades alone.
Q39|Sustainability and the measurement of wealth|We develop and apply a consistent and comprehensive theoretical framework for assessing whether economic growth is compatible with sustaining wellbeing over time. Our approach differs from earlier approaches by concentrating on wealth rather than income. Sustainability is demonstrated by showing that a properly defined comprehensive measure of wealth is maintained through time. Our wealth measure is unusually comprehensive, capturing not only reproducible and human capital but also natural capital, health improvements and technological change. We apply the framework to five countries: the United States, China, Brazil, India and Venezuela. We show that the often-neglected contributors to wealth – technological change, natural capital and health capital – fundamentally affect the conclusions one draws about whether given nations are achieving sustainability. Indeed, even countries that display sustainability differ considerably in the kinds of capital that contribute to it.
Q39|Three Key Elements of a Post-2012 International Climate Policy Architecture| This article describes three essential elements of an effective post-2012 international climate policy architecture: a framework to ensure that key industrialized and developing nations are involved in differentiated but meaningful ways, an emphasis on an extended time path for emissions targets, and the inclusion of flexible market-based policy instruments to keep costs down and facilitate international equity. This overall architecture is consistent with fundamental aspects of the science, economics, and politics of global climate change; addresses specific shortcomings of the Kyoto Protocol; and builds on the foundation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Q39|Messung von Materialeffizienz in Unternehmen|Der effiziente Umgang mit knappen Rohstoffen stellt einen Wettbewerbsvorteil für Unternehmen dar. Um hier gezielt weitere Verbesserungen zu erreichen, muss die Materialeffizienz operationalisiert werden. Unterschiedliche Materialien und Verfahren in den Unternehmen ebenso wie unterschiedliche Strategien für Effizienzsteigerungen erschweren es, die Materialeffizienz mit einem einheitlichen Indikator auszudrücken. Keiner der bislang diskutierten Indikatoren erfüllt die Anforderungen an eine angemessene Bewertung der Materialeffizienz im Unternehmen vollständig. Die Materialeffizienz kann deshalb nur mit einem unternehmensspezifischen Ansatz gemessen werden. Standardisierte Messkonzepte sind nicht zielführend.
Q39|Finance and Oil. Is there a Resource Curse in Financial Development?|This paper shows that the finance and growth relationship is as important in resource-based economies as in other economies. This paper also documents less developed financial systems in resource-based economies and banks that are more liquid, better capitalized and more profitable, but give fewer loans to firms. Firms in resource-based economies use less external finance and a smaller share of them uses bank loans, although there is the same level of demand as in other countries, thus pointing to supply constraints. Overall, there is some indication of a natural resource curse in financial development, which falls more on enterprises than on households. This calls for intensified efforts in resource-based economies to deepen and broaden financial systems.

Q39|Applying Hubbert Curves and Linearization to Rock Phosphate|Rock phosphate is a critical, nonrenewable resource for which there is no known substitute in agriculture. Cordell, Drangert, and White (2009) use Hubbert methodology (1956) to estimate the peak--the year after which production will monotonically decline--of world rock phosphate production at 2033-34. This note assesses the applicability of Hubbert's (1949) peak methodology to world rock phosphate production, based on (a) the ability of the model to produce accurate in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts and stable estimates of ultimately recoverable reserves, and (b) the degree to which the rock phosphate market approximates the theoretical conditions underpinning the Hubbert model. In both respects, the application of Hubbert methodology to rock phosphate is found to be problematic.
Q39|Shadow vs. market prices in explaining land allocation: Subsistence maize cultivation in rural Mexico|"Prices may fail to explain farmers' land allocation if the relevant decision prices are ""shadow prices"" that deviate from market prices. This may be the case for farmers who attach significant non-market values to their crops. I theoretically explain why land allocation may not respond to market signals even if transaction costs are not binding. I use nationally representative rural household data from Mexico to show that shadow prices better explain the land subsistence farmers allocate to traditional maize in this center of maize diversity. I discuss the importance of non-market values in understanding supply response and on-farm conservation of traditional crops."

Q39|El flujo de materiales y el desarrollo económico en España: un análisis sobre desmaterialización (1980-2004)|El análisis de los flujos de materiales que circulan a través de un sistema económico es una forma de medir la dimensión física del consumo y la apropiación de recursos por parte de una sociedad y, en consecuencia, es una manera indirecta de medir su impacto ambiental. De esta manera, los indicadores de flujos de materiales pueden ser considerados como indicadores indirectos de sostenibilidad, y por tanto, pueden ser de utilidad para comprobar la hipótesis de la desmaterialización; es decir, la idea de que el progreso tecnológico conlleva una disminución del total de materiales usados (desmaterialización fuerte) o de los materiales usados por unidad de producción (desmaterialización débil). Este artículo presenta la contabilidad de flujos de materiales para España entre 1980 y 2004. Asimismo, analiza la hipótesis de la curva de Kuznets ambiental usando el consumo de materiales como indicador de impacto ambiental. El análisis revela que durante el periodo analizado no tuvo lugar ningún proceso de desmaterialización, ni fuerte ni débil. Aunque la población no se incrementó considerablemente, los materiales movilizados por la economía española (las entradas directas de materiales, EDM) se duplicaron, creciendo a tasas anuales por encima del PIB. Además, se constata que en términos físicos España pasó a ser más dependiente del comercio exterior. De hecho, las importaciones netas medidas en toneladas se duplicaron durante el periodo.
Q39|Determinants of Agricultural and Mineral Commodity Prices|Prices of most agricultural and mineral commodities rose strongly in the past decade, peaking sharply in 2008. Popular explanations included strong global growth (especially from China and India), easy monetary policy (as reflected in low real interest rates or expected inflation), a speculative bubble (resulting from bandwagon expectations) and risk (possibly resulting from geopolitical uncertainties). Motivated in part by this episode, this paper presents a theory that allows a role for macroeconomic determinants of real commodity prices, along the lines of the â€œovershootingâ€ model: the resulting model includes global GDP and the real interest rate as macroeconomic factors. Our model also includes microeconomic determinants; we include inventory levels, measures of uncertainty, and the spot-forward spread. We estimate the equation in a variety of different ways, for eleven individual commodities. Although two macroeconomic fundamentals â€“ global output and inflation â€“ both have positive effects on real commodity prices, the fundamentals that seem to have the most consistent and strongest effects are microeconomic variables: volatility, inventories, and the spot-forward spread. There is also some evidence of a bandwagon effect.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q39|Farmers' Subjective Valuation of Subsistence Crops: The Case of Traditional Maize in Mexico| Shadow prices guide farmers' resource allocations, but for subsistence farmers growing traditional crops, shadow prices may bear little relationship with market prices. We econometrically estimate shadow prices of maize using data from a nationally representative survey of rural households in Mexico. Shadow prices are significantly higher than the market price for traditional but not improved maize varieties. They are particularly high in the indigenous areas of southern and southeastern Mexico, indicating large de facto incentives to maintain traditional maize there.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q39|Farmers’ Subjective Valuation of Subsistence Crops: The Case of Traditional Maize in Mexico| Shadow prices guide farmers’ resource allocations, but for subsistence farmers who grow traditional crops they may bear little relationship with market prices.

Q39|The Effect of Oil and Diamonds on Democracy: Is there really a resource curse?|This paper examines the effect of natural resources on the level of democracy in a set of countries. The main model is a fixed effects regression model, where the focus is on within-country variation over time. The effect of different resources is investigated, namely the effect of oil, diamonds and agriculture. Furthermore, a distinction is made between two broad types of resources, diffuse and point resources, to explore whether the effect on democracy is similar or different. Criticism in existing literature on the presence of the resource curse is taken into account. Production data on natural resources is used and not the common variable ‘resource exports-over-GDP’, the latter being flawed. A possible endogeneity problem is taken into account, as well as the persistence of democracy over time. I find evidence for a resource curse of oil on democracy. It is present in different model specifications, such as models with either fixed effects or a lagged dependent variable. There only seems to be very weak evidence for a negative effect of point resources on democracy, compared to the effect of diffuse resources. It is argued that this might be due to the geographic concentration of these types of resources, which enables governments and elite groups to capture resource rents.

Q39|Evaluación del impacto del SENA en el capital social de los egresados|Evaluamos la incidencia que tiene el Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje (SENA) sobre las personas que han asistido a cursos largos en variables indirectas y directas que capturan la acumulación de capital social. En líneas generales, la acción del SENA es benéﬁca. Las personas egresadas de cursos largos de la institución mejoran su probabilidad de estar empleados, su ingreso y su capital social. Estos resultados contrastan con aquellos de otros estudios que proponen debilitar el SENA, con el argumento de que su rentabilidad social es muy baja e, incluso, inferior a la de las instituciones públicas y privadas que realizan una actividad similar. En lugar de marchitar al SENA, la política pública debería contribuir a su fortalecimiento. Indudablemente, en este proceso el SENA debe mejorar su eﬁciencia.

Q39|Los profesionales del agro en la difusión de innovaciones agrícolas sustentables en la región oriental de Colombia|La participación de los profesionales de diversas disciplinas del agro en los procesos de reconversión sustentable de los agroecosistemas en Colombia, es factor clave para el desarrollo de la nueva agricultura que el país necesita frente a los problemas ocasionados por las inadecuadas prácticas de manejo de la agricultura convencional. En el presente trabajo se hace una exploración sobre la actuación de un importante grupo de profesionales vinculados a la reconversión agropecuaria de la región oriental colombiana. Los resultados encontrados y analizados con sistema estadístico multivariado indican que los profesionales participan en una amplia gama de actividades en las tres zonas climáticas de la región (frío, templado y cálido) y que las preferencias a ciertos sistemas de innovación tienen relación directa con la formación académica recibida por ellos. Asimismo se refleja un debilitamiento en el ejercicio profesional del ingeniero agrónomo, que ha sido capitalizado por otras profesiones y que amerita un proceso de renovación curricular en los programas académicos de esta profesión en el país
Q39|Another Pass-Through Bites the Dust? Oil Prices and Inflation|This paper presents evidence of an important decline during recent decades in the pass-through from the price of oil to the general price level. We find that this decline is a generalized fact for a large set of countries. After documenting correlations between the consumer price index and oil prices, we use two estimation strategies in an attempt to properly identify the effect of oil shocks on inflation. First, we estimate the traditional Phillips curve augmented to include oil and test for structural breaks in 34 countries. This methodology shows a fall in the average estimated pass-through for industrial economies and, to a lesser degree, for emerging economies. Second, we estimate rolling vector autoregressions for a subsample of countries for which we have sufficient data. We derive impulse response functions of inflation to oil shocks and interpret the integrals as estimates of pass-through. We find that the effect of oil shocks on inflation has weakened for most of the 12 countries in the sample. Among the factors that might help to explain this decline, we argue that the most important are a reduction in the oil intensity of economies around the world, a reduction in the exchange rate pass-through, a more favorable inflation environment, and the fact that the current oil price shock is largely the result of strong world demand. These factors help to explain not only why the current shock has had limited inflationary effects, but also why it has had limited consequences for output.
Q39|Reinforcing economic incentives for carbon credits for forests|Afforestation is a cost-effective way for some countries to meet part of their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and its eventual extensions. Credits for carbon sequestration can be mediated through markets for emissions permits. Both new and old forests are subject to pestilence and fire, which are events that could release substantial, discrete quantities of carbon at irregular intervals. Permits markets, the use of green accounting, and insurance markets for sudden emmisions could increase the efficiency of the scheme and its attractiveness to potential participants. La plantation de forêts est une manière peu coûteuse pour certains pays de remplir leurs engagements à l'égard du Protocole de Kyoto et de ses extensions éventuelles. Les marchés pour les permis d'émissions peuvent s'assortir de crédits pour la séquestration de carbone. Tant les nouvelles que les anciennes forêts sont exposées aux incendies et aux invasions de parasites, qui peuvent se donner lieu à l'émission d'importantes quantités de gaz carbonique à intervalles irréguliers. Les marchés des permis et les marchés d'assurance, mis en ?uvre dans un cadre de comptabilité verte, peuvent rendre plus efficace et plus attrayant un système de crédits pour séquestration du carbone.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
Q39|Can an Effective Global Climate Treaty Be Based on Sound Science, Rational Economics, and Pragmatic Politics| The Kyoto Protocol (1997) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (1992) may come into force without U.S. participation, but its effects on climate change will be trivial. At the same time, the economic and scientific consensus points to the need for a credible international approach. A reasonable starting point is the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC), which was signed by 161 nations and ratified by 50, including the United States, and entered into force in 1994. In this paper, I remain agnostic on the question of the Kyoto Protocol's viability. Some analysts see the agreement as deeply flawed, while others see it as an acceptable or even excellent first step. But virtually everyone agrees that the Protocol is not sufficient to the overall challenge, and that further, subsequent steps will be required. This is my starting point for proposing a three-part policy architecture: first, all nations would be involved through the use of economic trigger mechanisms, such as growth targets; second, long-term targets would be required - in the short-term, firm, but moderate targets, and in the long-term, flexible, but much more stringent targets; and third, market-based policy instruments would be part of the package - emissions trading, carbon taxes, or hybrids of the two. This overall approach can be made to be scientifically sound, economically rational, and politically pragmatic.

Q39|Inequality, Too Much of a Good Thing|As the title of this essay suggests, I believe there are both positive and negative effects of inequality. On the positive side, differential rewards provide incentives for individuals to work hard, invest and innovate. On the negative side, differences in rewards that are unrelated to productivity -- due to racial discrimination, for example -- are corrosive to civil society and cause resources to be misallocated. Even if discrimination did not exist, however, income inequality would be problematic in a democratic society if those who are privileged use their economic muscle to curry favor in the political arena and thereby secure monopoly rents or other advantages. Moreover, for several reasons discussed in the next section, poverty and income inequality create negative externalities. Consequently, it can be in the interest of the wealthy as well as the poor to raise the incomes of the poor, especially by using education and training as a means for redistribution.
Q39|Carbon Credits for Forests and Forest Products|It is possible to make a current valuation of the effects of carbon dioxide which tracks a valuation done under the metric of expected present value and also tracks realized values. The implementation of a carbon credit scheme based on green accounting could go as follows: L'évaluation des effets de verrouillage du gaz carbonique par la forêt et les produits forestiers fait intervenir des espérances mathématiques de valeurs futures. Pourtant nous montrons qu'on peut en faire la mesure à partir de valeurs courantes, ce qui suggère le système suivant d'attribution de crédits carbone:
Q39|La gestion optimale d’une forêt exploitée pour son potentiel de diminution des gaz à effet de serre et son bois|This papers aims to determine the optimal rotation and the best alternative use of a forest stand when wood price is assumed to follow a Geometrical Brownian Motion and the externality generated by the forest capacity to reduce the level of carbon dioxide in the air is adequately taken into account. It is shown that the decision-making of cutting the trees depends heavily of the use which will be made of the harvested wood. The results of the model indicate what follows: Cet article cherche à déterminer les âges optimaux de coupe d’un peuplement forestier lorsque le prix du bois suit, par hypothèse, un processus de mouvement brownien géométrique et l’externalité qu’engendre une forêt, par sa capacité à réduire le niveau du dioxyde de carbone de l’air et donc l’effet de serre, est adéquatement prise en compte. L’utilisation qui sera faite du bois récolté se révèle déterminante dans la prise de décision de coupe des arbres. Les résultats du modèle indiquent ce qui suit :
Q39|Carbon Credits for Forests and Forest Products|It is possible to make a current valuation of the effects of carbon dioxide which tracks a valuation done under the metric of expected present value and also tracks realized values. The implementation of a carbon credit scheme based on green accounting could go as follows: 1) At dates strictly between planned harvests, impute a credit of the value of carbon fixing through forest growth; it is possible to subtract from that credit a premium corresponding to an insurance against fire. 2) At dates when a fire occurs, do not make any debit if an insurance has been charged; otherwise impose a debit corresponding to the carbon value of the forest lost through fire. 3) At all dates, for each past harvest, impute a debit for the value of the current decay of forest products. 4) At the time of harvest, impute a discrete debit for the value of waste. L'évaluation des effets de verrouillage du gaz carbonique par la forêt et les produits forestiers fait intervenir des espérances mathématiques de valeurs futures. Pourtant nous montrons qu'on peut en faire la mesure à partir de valeurs courantes, ce qui suggère le système suivant d'attribution de crédits carbone. 1) Entre les dates des coupes, imputer un crédit correspondant à la valeur du carbone immobilisé par la croissance des arbres; éventuellement en soustraire un montant correspondant à une assurance contre les incendies. 2) Lorsque se produit un incendie, n'imputer aucun débit si la prime d'assurance a été déduite en 1); sinon déduire la valeur carbone de la forêt brûlée. 3) En toute date déduire la valeur des produits forestiers anciens dont le carbone est restitué à l'atmosphère. 4) Au moment des coupes imputer un débit correspondant aux déchets.
Q39|Material Accounting in a Macroeconomic Framework Forecast of waste generated in manufacturing industries in Norway|This paper analyses the generation of waste in production processes, based on the physical law of conservation of mass. By this law, mass going into a production process must equal the mass coming out of the same process. The paper uses this mass balance perspective to refine a previously developed technique for forecasting waste amounts. A macro economic model predicts the use of intermediate inputs and production in monetary units, and by multiplying these variables with weight conversion factors we estimate physical amounts going in and out of production. The difference between input and output, the residual, consists of discharges to land, water and air. We predict a growth in the residuals for manufacturing industries of 83 per cent from 1993 to 2010. The growth is partly explained by an anticipated growth in material intensity.
Q39|A Positive Model of Growth and Pollution Controls|"This paper describes a growth model in which pollutants are internal to a jurisdiction. To this end we develop a model of the joint determination of the rate of development of the economy through market interactions and the extent of pollution regulation through collective decision making. We show that depending on the collective decision making mechanism in place, the time path of pollution can display an inverted U shape, a ""sideways mirrored"" S, or an increasing (but bounded) level over time.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
Q39|Future Waste Generation - Forecasts Based on a Macroeconomic Model|Generation of solid waste is closely associated with the use of tangible factor inputs and production levels in the economy. In this paper, we present projections of waste generated in the Norwegian manufacturing industry based on the development in these factors as simulated by a computable general equilibrium model. Over the simulation period, material input becomes relatively cheaper than labour and energy, thereby making it profitable to substitute materials for other factor inputs. This substitution effect is a general equilibrium effect mainly due to technological change. It dominates the direct material saving impact of technological progress in most production sectors. Thus, generated solid waste rises over the simulation period, both in terms of unit produced and per capita. The analysis predicts an increase in generated waste over the period from 1993 to 2010 in the range of 45 - 110 per cent, depending on the type of waste.
Q39|Elephants|Existing models of open-access resources are applicable to non-storable resources, such as fish. Many open-access resources, however, are used to produce storable goods. Elephants, rhinos, and tigers are three prominent examples. Anticipated future scarcity of these resources will increase current prices, and current poaching. This implies that, for given initial conditions, there may be rational expectations equilibria leading both to extinction and to survival. Governments may be able to eliminate extinction equilibria by promising to implement tough anti-poaching measures if the population falls below a threshold. Alternatively, they, or private agents, may be able to eliminate extinction equilibria by accumulating a sufficient stockpile of the storable good.

Q39|Economic Implications of Greenhouse Gas Policy|This paper summarizes the debate on the costs and benefits of regional and global action to reduce future emissions of greenhouse gases. The paper also presents new evidence on possible future global emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels where these emissions are disaggregated by major developed and developing country regions. The basis of the projections is a global simulation model called the G-Cubed model. Given these projections of future emissions, the model is used to estimate the size of carbon taxes necessary to stabilize emissions within each region in the year 2000 at the levels of emissions in 1990. It is shown that the costs of stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions vary across countries when each country stabilizes its own emissions at a 1990 level. These differences in costs reflect differences in the energy intensity of production, differences in the source of energy generation, differences in projections of population growth and different projections of productivity growth.
Q39|The environmental drag on long- term economic performance: Evidence from Norway|The environmental drag is the cost to society of environmental constraints. This paper estimates the long-run environmental drag on the Norwegian economy. We employ a model called DREAM (dynamic resource / environmental applied model). This is an applied general equilibrium model extended to include important environmental linkages. After having explained the structure of our model, the paper presents macroeconomic effects, and impacts on growth and welfare of environmental constraints. To check robustness we perform a number of sensitivity analyses. Most of our results are remarkably robust to alternative assumptions. Contrary to widespread opinion, a low discount rate increases the environmental drag on welfare. Reducing the rate of technological progress will have similar effects.
Q39|A Positive Model of Growth and Pollution Controls|The most recent addition to the economics of gloom concerns the interplay between income and environmental degradation. The main question raised is whether or not continued environmental degradation is a necessary part of the process of industrialization. Will pollution continue to increase without bound as more and more countries pass through the development phase or will it be controlled? Intuitively, if 'clean air' is a normal good, we would expect that societies might be 'self-regulating' in the sense that as income increases, pollution controls also increase. However, this intuition is somewhat misleading as the presence of external effects is an essential feature of environmental regulation. This paper describes a growth model in which pollutants are internal to a jurisdiction. To this end we develop a model of the joint determination of the rate of development of the economy through market interactions and the extent of pollution regulation through collective decision making. We show that depending on the collective decision making mechanism in place, the time path of pollution can display an inverted U shape, a 'sideways mirrored' S, or an increasing (but bounded) level over time. This paper contributes to the literature on both the large differences in income per capita across countries as well as the discrepancies in their growth rates. It shows that by relying on collective decision making mechanisms to choose policies, the dynamics of convex models can resemble those usually ascribed to models of multiple equilibria.
