N24|The Consumer Credit Act 1974 and the emergence of the APR as a consumer protection policy tool|The ‘Crowther Committee’, in their report of 1971, proposed a fundamental change in consumer credit regulation in the UK. Among many aspects, they campaigned for the calculation and publication of the true cost of lending, i.e. the annualized percentage rate (APR), of all consumer credit products. The APR was introduced to reduce information asymmetries, thus improving consumers' rights and incentivizing competition among credit grantors. This report resulted in the enactment of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (CCA74). This paper studies the effects of the CCA74 on the British economy, through the introduction of the APR. Moreover, it tests the presence of a structural break in the relationship between the price and volume of consumer credit. Furthermore, the paper analyses the effects of shocks to consumer credit on inflation and households’ savings. This article contributes to extending the data availability for consumer credit before 1975, and to debating the understanding of the role of consumer credit during a high-inflation period. There was evidence of a significant effect of the CCA74 on consumer credit, driven by the introduction of the APR. VAR models suggest that this law did not cause inflationary pressures, nor motivated households to dis-save, contrary to previous beliefs.
N24|Overcoming History through International Organizations - Historical Roots of EU Support and Euroscepticism|There is little causal evidence about deep-rooted sources of support for shifting power from nation-states to international organizations. Focusing on the European Union, this paper develops the hypothesis that citizens appreciate the role of international organizations in constraining member state’s the more, the more negatively their region was historically affected by the actions of nation-states. For identification, I use the historically homogeneous regions of Alsace and Lorraine in France as a natural experiment. A municipal level geographical regression discontinuity design documents that more negative exposure led to persistently higher EU support in three important referenda and less success of Eurosceptic parties in parliamentary elections. This effect is not driven by linguistic differences, migration, socioeconomic factors or public good provision, but linked to a stronger European identity. This stronger identity is neither explained by perceived economic benefits, nor comes at the expense of a weaker national or regional identity.
N24|Before the Cult of Equity: New Monthly Indices of the British Share Market, 1829-1929|This paper presents new monthly capital gains, dividend yield, and total return indices for common equities quoted on British stock exchanges from 1829 to 1929. As well as creating an all-share index, we create a blue-chip index of the 30 largest companies, which we splice to the Financial Times 30 index to create a near-two-century-long (1829-2018) monthly share index. We use the new indices to examine the timing of British business cycles and compare the returns on home and foreign UK investment. We also construct indices for 22 domestic sectors, and calculate CAPM betas for each sector.
N24|Funding the Great War and the beginning of the end for British hegemony|Britain was the richest country in the world at the outbreak of the Great War, benefitting from all the resources of an industrialised country and a large empire. Funding the war contributed to the beginning of the end for British hegemony. Financiers in London extracted a high price for lending their money to the government to pay for the supplies and munitions needed to win the war. The US extracted a similarly high price for lending to Britain during the war. Russia never paid its war debts to Britain; France, Italy and Belgium got off lightly; but for a long time the US insisted on Britain repaying in full.
N24|Did Spillovers From Europe Indeed Contribute to the 2010 U.S. Flash Crash?|Using intraday data, we study spillovers from European stock markets to the U.S. in the hours before the flash crash on 6 May 2010. Many commentators have pointed to negative market sentiment and high volatility during the European trading session before the Flash Crash. However, based on a range of vector autoregressive models, we find no robust evidence that spillovers increased at that time. On the contrary, spillovers on 6 May were mostly smaller than in the preceding days, during which there was great uncertainty surrounding the Greek sovereign debt crisis. The absence of evidence for spillovers underscores the difficulties in understanding the nature of flash events in financial markets.
N24|Luxury relying on banking and finance (19th-21st centuries)|Luxury-specific production systems have expanded through upstream-downstream integration, from commodities (silk, precious metals, etc.) to processing industries and luxury houses themselves. Banks financed companies, trade, foreign exchange and flows of means of payment. Starting in the 1980s, business bankers supported companies building a capitalism of luxury firms: they helped them to integrate the game of financial markets. For managers of companies in the luxury sector, the challenge has always been to create strong self-financing capacities in order to be able to distribute dividends ensuring the loyalty of family shareholders, finance investments (workshops, shop networks), and contain indebtedness. When tensions were encountered, the dependence on bankers and investors, in the event of a stock exchange listing, often led to the takeover of control by leading groups.
N24|Quantification and Revolution: An Investigation of German Capital Flight after the First|It is well known that after the First World War there was a massive flight of capital from the major European countries to foreign financial centres. It is surprising, however, to note that no historian to date has actually taken the trouble to make a detailed study of the phenomenon. The aim of this article is to go beyond the impressionism that characterises the historical approach to the study of capital flight following the First World War. In order to show what can and cannot be established, the subject of study will be Germany. After presenting the main difficulties encountered in quantifying the flight of German capital, the article will go on to provide a new estimate of it. A wide range of sources were referred to for the survey: national archives, expert reports, bank statistics, and balances of payments. The application of rigorous historical method, with crosschecking and critical analysis of documents, have made it possible to establish new relevant facts regarding the flight of German capital following the First World War. The final figure obtained is greater than those generally accepted.
N24|Dirty float or clean intervention? The Bank of England in the foreign exchange market|The effectiveness of central bank intervention is debated and despite literature showing mixed results, central banks regularly intervene in the foreign exchange market, both in developing and developed economies. Does foreign exchange intervention work? Using over 60,000 new daily observations on intervention and exchange rates, this paper is the first study of the Bank of England’s foreign exchange intervention between 1952 and 1972. The main finding is that the Bank of England was unsuccessful in managing a credible exchange rate over that period. Running an event study, I demonstrate that betting systematically against the Bank of England would have been a profitable trading strategy. The Bank of England failed to maintain credibility in offshore markets and eventually manipulated the publication of its reserve figures to avoid a run on sterling.
N24|The Financial Instability Hypothesis and the Financial Crisis in Eastern European Emerging Economies|The present paper applies the financial instability hypothesis in order to explain the financial crises of 2008-2010 in eleven emerging Eastern European economies Also, it seeks to map if institutional frameworks of these countries enabled them to stand against the factors leading into the financial crisis. The paper maps cycles of three macroeconomic indicators representing the real economy, and four indicators representing financial markets. A cycle analysis is conducted with the help of a Hoderick-Prescott filter, made to isolate cycles from trends in time series. The paper concludes that there were substantial positive financial cycles previous to the financial crisis mirrored by similar cycles in the real economy. Similarly, the results show negative cycles in the same parameters during the years of crisis. It seems as an uncontrolled increase in money and credit caused the economy to overheat and thereafter contract in both substantial financial and real economy crises. Also, the paper compiles twelve different indices of institutional development. These are standardized and presented in an institutional development matrix, showing that the institutional framework for the eleven economies was weak previous to and under the melt down of the economy. The construction of an integrated institutional development index on the basis of the same twelve parameters confirm institutional shortcomings, which may have made the economies less able to guard themselves from a crisis initiated by both domestically and internationally financial instability.
N24|Cash is King - Effects of ECB's Conventional and Unconventional Measures|In this paper we distinguish the responses of conventional and unconventional monetary policy measures on macroeconomic variables, using a high frequency data set which measures the impact of the ECB's monetary policy decisions. For the period 2002:01 to 2019:06 we show that unconventional and conventional monetary policy measures dffer considerably with respect to inflation. While conventional measures show the expected response, i.e. an interest rate cut increases inflation and vice versa, unconventional measure appear to have no signicant influence. But this holds not for QE, which is found to have similar influence on inflation as conventional interest rate changes.
N24|Stable Money and Central Bank Independence: Implementing Monetary Institutions in Postwar Germany|Germany prides itself in having one of the most successful central banks and currencies with respect to independence and stability. I show that not only were both imposed on the country after 1945 but that there was also initial resistance to both among German experts and officials. This was then a rare case of successful imposition of institutions from abroad. Events are discussed in light of Peter Bernholz’s requirements for stable money and a successful central bank.
N24|Deuss’ demise: an oil trader’s struggle to keep up with the market, 1970s-1990s|In contrast to many other commodities, crude oil trading is a relatively new phenomenon. The end of the concession system in the 1970s caused the oil value chain to disintegrate and a spot market for crude oil to emerge. Oil traders, in particularly the infamous US oil trader Marc Rich, have been credited with creating this spot market and its subsequent development into the global locus of oil price formation. As such traders can be viewed as the little known but vital agents of globalization. Although traders certainly did contribute in the first formative years of the spot market in the late 1970s and early 1980s, their business models were fundamentally challenged by the subsequent evolution of the market in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Whereas globalization is about market integration, traders were typically geared toward profiting from large market distortions and opaque prices. As the spot market matured and gained global acceptance for price formation, the original oil traders were either forced out of the market or fundamentally transformed their businesses. One particular example is Dutch oil trader John Deuss. During the 1980s among the top 3 global oil traders, Deuss’ company languished in the 1990s after a failed corner of the Brent market and competition from firms that were both more sophisticated and better financed. Using Deuss as an example, this paper raises two questions: On the one hand, how did independent oil trading firms contribute to the formation of the modern oil market since the 1970s? On the other hand, how did the subsequent evolution of the market affect the business model of independent oil trading firms from the mid-1980s onwards? The core aim of the paper is to question the relationship between the economics of the trading firm and the economics of the market. The paper combines quantitative data on the development of the spot market using a deals database compiled by Argus Media since 1975 with secondary material ranging from scholarly, trade and news publications.

As well as creating an all-share index, we create a blue-chip index of the 30 largest companies, which we splice to the Financial Times 30 index to create a near-two-century-long (1829-2018) monthly share index.

We also construct indices for 22 domestic sectors, and calculate CAPM betas for each sector.
N24|Credit constraints and the propagation of the Great Depression in Germany|We evaluate the role played by loan supply shocks in the decline of investment and industrial production during the Great Depression in Germany from 1927 to 1932. We identify loan supply shocks in the context of a time varying parameter vector autoregression with stochastic volatility. Our results indicate that credit constraints were a significant driver of industrial production between 1927 and 1932, supporting the view that a structurally weak banking sector was an important contributor to the German Great Depression. We find further that loan supply shocks were an important driver of investment in the early phase of the depression, between 1927 and 1929, but not between 1930 and 1932. We suggest possible explanations for this puzzle and directions for future research.

N24|Public credit and Economic cycle yn Spain: 1971-2015|Public credit in Spain was organized around the Official Credit Institute (ICO) from 1971 onwards. The importance of the public credit as part of the total credit has been decreasing from 1971 until 2015. Considering that public credit is an economic policy instrument, the role it played during expansions and recessions may be of major significance to stabilize the economy. This paper analyzes the behavior of the credit in relation to the economic cycle during the last forty years through the application of the à la Bry and Boschan algorithm that allows to date the peaks and troughs during the cycle. This helps us observe whether the public credit has been procyclical or countercyclical with respect to the private credit cycle and the GDP cycle as well, thus offering a meaningful explanation linked to the ICO history. Besides, there is evidence of a certain degree of synchronization between the credit cycle -both public and private- and the economic cycle, with the private credit showing the largest synchronization, both in the economic upswing and downswing. The public credit behaviour, on the contrary, tends to be more countercyclical during the recessive part of the cycle, thus exerting a buffer function of the economic situation.
N24|The investments of the Spanish insurance Companies, 1984-2015|The goal of this research is to analyse how the Spanish insurance companies have managed their investments from the moment the liberalization of the sector begins in view of the future integration in the EEC until the implementation of the Solvency II regime (1984 -2015). The structure of the investment portfolio has been characterized by instruments of conservative risk profile. The main conclusions are summarized as follows: The main asset in the period under review is Spanish public debt, accounting for 27% of the sector's investments. The performance of the portfolio has performed very similar to the average interest rate on Treasury debt. Contrary to what might be expected, the recent sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone has had no impact on credit risk management, as the deterioration in the credit rating of the Kingdom of Spain has not led to a decline in investment in Spanish public bonds. The sector has redoubled its commitment to this asset, leaving out the dire economic consequences of a degradation of the rating of Spanish public debt to the category of junk bonds.
N24|Are managerial capitalism and crony capitalism incompatible? The adaptation of the Spanish corporate elite to the capitalist system in the last century|"In the last century, Spanish economic and society have experienced remarkable transformations, as the consolidation of a democratic State of law, and the access to the reduced club of developed countries. Such transformations have also reached the corporate elite. Nevertheless, has the professionalization of the managers of large companies represented a break with the old practices of crony capitalism? To answer this question, the paper analyzes the profiles of the presidents and CEO of the largest Spanish corporations, between 1917 and today. The application of prosopographic method to different aspects of the social capital of managers, on nine selected dates, will allow to understand better the evolution process of the Spanish corporate elite. This process includes an increase in managerial capabilities, due to the formation and cosmopolitan capital; but despite the advance of managerial capitalism, this has not meant the end of the so-called crony capitalism, —characteristic of both the Restoration and the Franco dictatorship—, and in the last decades it seems that there is again an ""entrenchment"" movement by the new business elite to defend their own interest to the detriment of those of the country."
N24|Bank capital, lending booms, and busts. Evidence from Spain in the last 150 years|In this paper we analyze the effect of bank capital on lending expansion and contraction for nearly 150 years in Spain. We fi rst build up thoroughly a measure of bank leverage (i.e. the capital to assets ratio) for the Spanish banking sector starting in year 1880. Then, we run a proper econometric test to analyze the impact that bank capital levels have on lending cycles, controlling for other determinants of credit growth. We do fi nd robust empirical evidence of an asymmetric relationship between bank capital and credit cycle. In particular, an increase in the bank capital before expansions reduces credit growth while it increases credit growth when the recession arrives. Conversely, a too depleted level of bank capital when entering in a recession has a severe impact on lending (i.e. may bring about a deep credit crunch) with quite negative and lasting effects in the economy and the wellbeing of the society as a whole. The paper is particularly useful to support macroprudential policies (dynamic provisions and the countercyclical capital buffer) that have been very recently put in place as they will help to smooth the credit cycle. The experience of Spain over more than a century, with very marked lending cycles, provides a fertile ground for analyzing and supporting them, not only based on the last lending cycle, but also on those occurred in the more distant past.
N24|Flight-to-safety and the Credit Crunch: A new history of the banking crisis in France during the Great Depression|Despite France's importance in the interwar world economy, the scale and consequences of the French banking crises of 1930-1931 were never assessed quantitatively due to lack of data in the absence of banking regulation. Using a new dataset of individual balance sheets from more than 400 banks, we show that the crisis was more severe and occurred earlier than previously thought, and it was very asymmetric, without affecting main commercial banks. The primary transmission channel was a flight-to-safety of deposits from banks to savings institutions and the central bank, leading to a major, persistent disruption in business lending. In line with the gold standard mentality, cash deposited with savings institutions and the central bank was used to decrease marketable public debt and increase gold reserves, rather than pursue countercyclical policies. Despite massive capital inflows, France suffered from a severe, persistent credit crunch.
N24|Did the Basel Process of Capital Regulation Enhance the Resiliency of European Banks?|This paper analyses the evolution of the resiliency of the European banking sector after the implementation of the Basel Capital Accord. In particular, by analysing SRISK and CoVaR we trace systemic risk and measures of systematic risk as the Basel process unfolds. We observe that, though systematic risk for European banks have been decreasing over the last three decades, systemic risk has heightened especially for the largest systemic banks. While the Basel process has succeeded in containing systemic risk of small banks, it has been less successful for the larger institutions. The latter ones opportunistically exploited the option of self-regulation by employing internal models and effectively increasing SRISK. Hence, the sub-prime crisis found the largest and more systemic banks ill-prepared and lacking resiliency. This condition was even aggravated during the European sovereign crisis.
N24|Emigration during the French Revolution: Consequences in the Short and Longue Durée|During the French Revolution, more than 100,000 individuals, predominantly supporters of the Old Regime, fled France. As a result, some areas experienced a significant change in the composition of the local elites whereas in others the pre-revolutionary social structure remained virtually intact. In this study, we trace the consequences of the émigrés' flight on economic performance at the local level. We instrument emigration intensity with local temperature shocks during an inflection point of the Revolution, the summer of 1792, marked by the abolition of the constitutional monarchy and bouts of local violence. Our findings suggest that émigrés have a non monotonic effect on comparative development. During the 19th century, there is a significant negative impact on income per capita, which becomes positive from the second half of the 20th century onward. This pattern can be partially attributed to the reduction in the share of the landed elites in high-emigration regions. We show that the resulting fragmentation of agricultural holdings reduced labor productivity, depressing overall income levels in the short run; however, it facilitated the rise in human capital investments, eventually leading to a reversal in the pattern of regional comparative development.
N24|"Discrimination, Managers, and Firm Performance: Evidence from ""Aryanizations"" in Nazi Germany"|We study whether antisemitic discrimination in Nazi Germany had economic effects. Specifically, we investigate how the forced removal of Jewish managers affected large German firms. We collect new data from historical sources on the characteristics of senior managers, stock prices, dividends, and returns on assets for firms listed on the Berlin Stock Exchange. After the removal of the Jewish managers, the senior managers at affected firms had fewer university degrees, less experience, and fewer connections to other firms. The loss of Jewish managers significantly and persistently reduced the stock prices of affected firms for at least 10 years after the Nazis came to power. We find particularly strong reductions for firms where the removal of the Jewish managers led to large decreases in managerial connections to other firms and in the number of university-educated managers. Dividend payments and returns on assets also declined. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the aggregate market valuation of firms listed in Berlin fell by 1.78 percent of German GNP. These findings imply that discrimination can lead to significant economic losses and that individual managers can be key to the success of firms.
N24|The Other Way: A Narrative History of the Bank of France|This paper offers a comprehensive (short) history of central banking in France, starting in the 18th century and finishing with the creation of the Euro in 2001. We first discuss how the French experience with central banking in the 18th century shaped the drafting of the charter and the governance of the Bank of France in 1800. We then single out how the Bank implements its monetary policy in the 19th century and assess the bank achievement in terms of monetary and financial stability. Finally we discuss how the sovereign debt overhang triggered by World War I and the reconstruction subverted the model of central banking previously implemented, and how the reluctance of the Bank to be implicated in the management of the sovereign yield ultimately leads to the loss of its independence vis-a-vis the state. Against this background the use of financial repression under the guidance of the state allowed a smoother management of the debt overhang during the post WW II period, but created its own issues that were addressed effectively only with the creation of the Euro.

I focus on three themes running through his narrative. First, for much of that time the Bank was a private company playing a public role; how did it manage to do this and why was it eventually brought into public ownership? Second, I examine the various attempts to constrain the Bank's monetary policy to follow a simple rule; these almost invariably proved unsustainable unless the rule provided enough room for discretion. Finally, I cover the Bank's journey to becoming the lender of last resort, together with its evolving attitude to the associated risk of moral hazard.
N24|The Austrian banking crisis of 1931: one bad apple spoils the whole bunch|The current literature is inconclusive on the relative importance of foreign and domestic factors in bringing about the Austrian financial crisis in 1931. This paper offers new data to bring further clarity to this issue and emphasises the importance of a domestic factor: universal banks’ exposure to industrial enterprises. Industrial enterprises were the universal banks’ main borrowers and creditors. During the 1920s they did not perform well, and made the universal banks insolvent. The Credit-Anstalt, which became an ‘acquirer of last resort’ for weak universal banks during the 1920s, may have avoided its own demise had it been spared of one bank’s, the Unionbank’s assets.
N24|Financial Impact of Regulatory Sanctions on French Listed Companies|This paper assesses the information content of sanctions of listed companies pronounced by the French Financial Market Authority, through reactions from financial markets over the period 2004 to 2016. We answer whether, for a listed company, being named in a sanction report, as an offender, an acquitted, or a victim of others’ financial misconduct conveys information to the market using an event-study methodology, complemented with cross-sectional regression analysis: do investors react to such news, and if so, at which stage of the procedure, to what extent, and why? We find that the markets do react accordingly to the information content of the sanctions. Guilty listed companies experience significant negative abnormal returns after both the sanction decision, and its publication (respectively -0.9% and -1.1% from the day preceding the event until 3 days after), though to a limited extent in absolute and relative terms. Some factors will contribute to stronger underperformances such as being investigated, longer procedures, being a smaller company possibly from financial or technological sectors, stronger media coverage of the sanctions, and better economic activity. The markets also incorporate the information content of the decision: no statistically significant abnormal reaction follows the publication of anonymized sanctions; market reactions vary depending on the regulatory breaches, being stronger for third party offenses; and, to some extent, the severity of the decision influences the magnitude of abnormal returns. Settlements do not convey information to the market, being a lighter and shorter procedure, associated with lower sanctions. Being sentenced non-guilty implies a mixed correction on the market, depending on the step of the procedure. Finally, companies named in a sanction report as victims of others’ regulatory breaches also suffer negative abnormal returns after the sanction, suggesting double punishment.
N24|From Financial to Managerial Capitalism. The slow adaptation of Spanish corporate elite|In the last century, Spanish society and economy have endured considerable social and economic transformations which have also affected the corporate elite. Has the professionalization of managers of large companies broke away from old practices of crony capitalism? We have analysed the profiles of managers and executives of the biggest limited liability companies in Spain from 1917 to present day in order to answer this question. Prosoprographic method applied to different social capital fields of managers allows for a better understanding of how the Spanish corporate elite evolved. The latter entails an increase of managerial skills, through training and cosmopolitan capital; nonetheless, progress in managerial capitalism has not put an end to typical aspects of crony capitalism, which was attributed to most of the twentieth century and the new business elite has uplifted a new “entrenchment” in the last decades to put their interests before those of the country as a whole.
N24|The Rise of Private Foundations as Owners of Swedish Industry: The Role of Tax Incentives 1862–2018|The tax system has at times favoured firm control through private foundations, which has been argued to inhibit high-impact entrepreneurship and economic growth. However, research has been hampered due to a lack of systematic historical tax data. The purpose of this study is threefold. First, we describe the evolution of tax rules for private foundations in Sweden between 1862 and 2018. Second, we calculate the marginal effective tax rate on capital income. Third, we examine the incentives to use private foundations as a means for corporate control by comparing the taxation of private foundations and of high-impact entrepreneurs. Tax incentives help explain why economically significant private foundations were founded between World War I and the 1960s.
N24|A continuous consumer price index for Norway 1492-2017|This manuscript presents a new combined annual cost of living and consumer price index for Norway covering the period 1492-2017. When previous Norwegian historical consumer price indices partly were constructed on the basis of very limited data, the new historical index is constructed on a significantly richer data material. This is made possible by the compilation of quantitative data from numerous sources, mostly originating from the eighteenth, nineteenth and early twentieth century.The new index makes it possible to follow annual living costs in Norway for 525 years. When comparing to existing price indices the new series reveals that it is needed to make some major revisions of Norwegian price history.

With the new structure of the Hungarian Central Bank (MNB) and unorthodox macroeconomic policy, Hungary uses the global trends in the financial sector to deviate from the European treaties. The complex European structure is not able to face the new challenges with its tools and is more than ever obliged to counter such behaviors to preserve the credibility and the values of the European project.
N24|Financial Constraints and Self-Employment in France, 1945-2014|This paper studies the evolution over time of the effects on entry and survival into self-employment of inheritance receipt and real estate price variations. We focus on France over the period 1945-2014, and we estimate these effects by comparing (i) current inheritors with future inheritors and (ii) homeowners without a mortgage outstanding to renters or to those with a mortgage outstanding, for whom home equity extraction is not possible in France. Our main finding is that the effect of both wealth shocks on men’s entry into self-employment has decreased over time; we find no significant effect of either wealth shock since the mid-2000s. We discuss potential causes for this trend, including changes in the financial regulation and in the sectoral composition of the economy. We also find no evidence of an effect of wealth shocks on women’s entry into self-employment, at any point in time.
N24|New Frontiers in the Euro Debate in Iceland|The debate on currency arrangements and monetary policy frameworks in lceland has been motivated by developments in lceland and internationally in recent decades. Historically, lcelanders' colonial experience and struggle to retain control of vital natural resources made them hesitant participants in the European integration process. While sidestepping direct participation in the process leading to EU and EMU membership, they joined EFTA, the EEA and Schengen. Economic growth and development have been rapid, but the modernisation and liberalisation of the economy have been attended by signi:ficant volatility in nominal and real variables. At the same time, the European integration process has continued with its own set of challenges. It is in this context that a vibrant debate has taken place on the choice of currency and associated policies. The main emphasis has been on whether to adopt the euro (through EU membership) or retain the Icelandic króna with the most efficacious monetary policy framework possible. This article offers a review of salient contributions to the debate and the main lessons drawn from it. The key themes of the debate involve the impact currency choice would have on economic growth and resilience to shocks. While the early debate was mostly concerned with trade-theoretic issues, institutional factors have become increasingly important. A new theory concerning a heretofore overlooked policy variable, the evolution of inequality as measured by the wage-productivity gap, is discussed. It is shown to be potentially important for economic and financial outcomes, with implications for the debate.
N24|Evoluția capitalului în România în secolul 1918-2018 de la Marea Unire la tranziția la economia de piață<BR>[Romania’s capital developments during 1918-2018 century from the Great Union to the market economy transition]|The paper focuses on the evolution of the capital in Romania, in three extremely different periods during the last century, under the changes of internal / international context and political regimes, with special emphasis on the relationship with the country economic development. In the years 1918-1945, the share of foreign capital in the capital of joint-stock companies was higher compared to domestic capital, which is explained by the interest of foreign investors to seek relatively cheap resources and production factors in Romania. A certain role of foreign investments in this period to the development of several industrial sectors is broadly recognized in the special literature. In the socialist period, 1948-1989, characterized by the insignificant size of foreign capital in Romania (excepting some few failed joint venture companies), the accelerated accumulation of capital and the fast increase of fixed assets led to an excessive development of production overcapacities, with relatively low efficiency, energy-intensive and polluting, what created severe economic and financial imbalances, ended with the collapse of the system. During the transition period to the market economy, 1990-2018, marked, in the first decade, by a certain degradation of the domestic capital due to the bankruptcy and/or unsuccesful privatization of state-owned companies, after the year 2000, at the same time with the gradual integration in the euro-atlantic structures, the foreign investors have increased significantly their presence in Romania, entering in a competitive relationship with the domestic capital and production.

N24|The big bang and the City of London|Brexit poses an existential challenge the City of London as a European and global financial centre. The withdrawal of 'passporting' threatens the ability of financial institutions in London to sell services to customers in the EU, and this has prompted many predictions of London's financial demise. Banks are considering relocating staff and activities to other European centres such as Frankfurt, Dublin or Paris. Reflecting on London's history offers some insights into how The City might respond to this new challenge.

N24|Share trading activity and the rise of the rentier in the UK before 1920|Using a hand-collected dataset, we examine share trading activity over the period 1882 to 1920 for the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company, one of the largest UK companies of the time. Our main finding is that the steady flow of rentiers into the shareholding constituency of this company stymied share trading activity. Another important finding is that share trading still occurred during the closure of the Stock Exchange in 1914, but on a much-reduced scale. We also find that there was a substantial boom in share trading and in insurance stock prices after World War I.
N24|Prices and informed trading: Evidence from an early stock market|Using a novel dataset where all traders are identifiable, we examine trading in the shares of a major company on the London Stock Exchange before 1920. Our main finding is that bid-ask spreads increased in the presence of informed trades. However, we also find that spreads narrowed during periods of informed trading when such trades were timed to periods of large uninformed volume and that professional traders consistently timed larger volume to such periods. We also find that spreads increased during the 1914 closure of the Stock Exchange. Our results provide support for the classical microstructure theories of informed trading.
N24|That's classified! Inventing a new patent taxonomy|Patent studies inform our understanding of innovation. Any study of patenting involves classifying patent data according to a chosen taxonomy. The literature has produced numerous taxonomies, which means patents are being classified differently across studies. This potential inconsistency is compounded by a lack of documentation provided on existing taxonomies, making them diffcult to replicate. Because of this, we develop a new patent taxonomy using machine learning techniques, and propose a new methodology to automate patent classification. We contrast existing taxonomies with our own upon a widely used patent dataset. In a regression analysis of patent classes upon patent characteristics, we show that classification bias exists: the size, statistical significance, and direction of association of coefficients depend upon how a patent dataset has been classified. We recommend investigators adopt our approach to ensure future studies are comparable and replicable.
N24|Las sociedades con valores pignorables por el Banco de España y la Gran Depresión|This article examines the physiognomy of the large non-financial Spanish companies during the crisis of 1929 using an original source, consisting of a compilation of accounting material from companies that had their values pledged by the Bank of Spain. The international literature teaches us that the crisis underpinned the flourishing of great companies; while the weakest ones disappeared, the modern companies survived. The large Spanish companies resembled and behaved similarly to European companies during the Depression. However, a duality may be observed in Spain between stable companies and other larger but more fragile ones. The obsolescence of some sectors, the volatility of international demand, the discretionary behaviour of public demand, and its own organisational performance, explain most of these differences.

N24|Withdrawal of Italy from the Eurozone: stochastic simulations of a structural macroeconometric model|This paper assesses the impact on the Italian economy of withdrawal of Italy from the Eurozone, by means of the stochastic simulation of a macroeconometric model. The model considers the contractionary effects of devaluation, the evolution of sovereign debt spread and the development of bilateral economic relations between Italy and its major trade partners. The simulation results are consistent with the findings of recent applied research: the Italian economy would follow the V-shaped pattern observed in most currency crises. After an initial period of stress, it would recover and resume growth at a reasonable pace.
N24|The Nature of the Eurocrisis. A Reply to Febrero, Uxò and Bermejo|Febrero et al. (2017) criticise the balance of payments (BOP) view of the EMU crisis. I have no major objections to most of the single aspects of the crisis pointed out by these authors, except that they appear to underline specific sides of the EMU crisis, while missing a unifying and realistic explanation. Specific semi-automatic mechanisms differentiate a BOP crisis in a currency union from a traditional one. Unfortunately, these mechanisms give Febrero et al. the illusion that a BOP crisis in a currency union is impossible. My conclusion is that an interpretation of the Eurozone troubles as a balance of payments (BOP) crisis provides a more consistent framework. The debate has some relevance for the policy prescriptions to solve the eurocrisis. Given the costs that all sides would incur if the currency union were to break up, austerity policies are still seen by European politicians as a tolerable price to pay to keep foreign imbalances at bay - with the sweetener of some ECB support, for as long as Berlin allows the ECB to provide it.
N24|The Failure of a Clearinghouse: Empirical Evidence|We provide the first empirical description of the failure of a derivatives clearinghouse. We use novel, hand-collected, archive data to study risk management incentives by the Paris commodity futures clearinghouse around its failure in 1974. We do not find evidence of lenient risk management during the commodity price boom of 1973-1974. However, we show strong distortions of risk management incentives, akin to risk-shifting, as soon as prices collapsed and a large clearing member approached distress. Distortions persist during the recovery/resolution phase. Theoretically, these distortions suggest that capitalization and governance were weak, but do not imply that moral hazard was significant before the failure. Our findings have implications for the design of clearing institutions, including their default management schemes.
N24|Stocks for the Long Run: New Monthly Indices of British Equities, 1869-1929|This paper presents new monthly capital gain, dividend yield, and total return indices for common equities quoted on British exchanges during 1869-1929. I construct indices for 25 domestic sectors, calculate capital asset pricing model betas for each sector, and construct a 30-stock blue chip index. I splice the new broad market index to Turner et al.’s (2009) pre-1870 index to create a century-long (1825-1929) monthly equity index. I use the new indices to examine the timing of British business cycles and compare the returns on home and foreign UK investment during 1870-1929.
N24|Explaining a Paradox of Democracy: The Role of Institutions in Female Enfranchisement|Switzerland is known for its highly developed direct democracy. However, Swiss women were enfranchised at the federal level only in 1971 and in many cantons even later. We analyze the role of direct democracy in the delayed Swiss enfranchising process by investigating a novel dataset covering referenda among males about enfranchising women. Applying a difference-in-differences approach, we shed light on the conditions under which strong local direct democracy becomes a barrier to women’s suffrage. Our results are consistent with direct democracy having two effects: it boosts men’s demand to enfranchise women, but it also increases the price for men to do so. Depending on the specific conditions of the vote, the former or the latter effect dominates.
N24|El microcrédito antes de las cooperativas. Pósitos y crédito público agrario en España en vísperas de la Gran Guerra|Los pósitos rurales eran instituciones de crédito gestionadas por los propios municipios que ofrecían préstamos a corto plazo (la duración de una cosecha) a sus miembros a un interés inferior al que ofrecían los prestamistas privados. Como en el caso de otros bienes públicos su éxito dependía crucialmente de la gestión realizada, dado que el volumen de capital prestable dependía esencialmente de la capacidad para recuperar los granos o el dinero distribuidos el año anterior. Aunque gestionados por la autoridad municipal, los 3.500 pósitos (en 1900) estaban regulados por una agencia gubernamental que no tuvo éxito en convertirlos en una red pública de crédito agrario. Cuatro son los objetivos de este trabajo: primero, destacar la insólita pervivencia y buen funcionamiento de miles de pósitos antes de la Gran Guerra en contraste con el diagnóstico pesimista del gobierno; segundo, mostrar que los pósitos eran instituciones de acción colectiva no muy diferentes a otros bienes comunales; tercero, que el diseño de los pósitos no era muy diferente al de otras instituciones de microcrédito como las cooperativas existentes en este momento; por último, si bien los factores locales desempeñaron un papel importante en su supervivencia a largo plazo, la agricultura moderna exigió ya en el siglo XX instituciones de crédito que permitieran obtener fondos procedentes de áreas geográficas más amplias que la aldea. Con el fin de estudiar las diferencias municipales usamos las memorias de la Delegación Regia de Pósitos entre 1911 y 1913.
N24|Explaining the presence and absence of Spanish farm cooperatives before 1936: a political economy approach|Spanish farm cooperatives were limited in number and performed poorly before the Civil War. Rather than a lack of trust and social capital, this paper advances two alternative arguments. First, cooperatives often failed to offer the optimal level of scale to farmers for their day-to-day activities. In some case cooperatives were too large, which encouraged more informal forms of organization. When they were too small, greater scale could only be obtained by integrating cooperatives into federations. These required top-down support, which was provided in many European countries by landowners and the Church, as a result of competitive politics, that required them to build mass parties and organize small farmers politically. By contrast in Spain this was not forthcoming, as the Restoration political settlement (1876-1923) removed the need for party competition, and consequently left the needs of small farmers unattended. Only in Cataluña, and to a lesser extent Valencia, did regional party politics create these necessary conditions.
N24|The London Stock Exchange 1869-1929: new bloody statistics for old?|Newly-assembled datasets on the size and composition of the London Stock Exchange present some results contradicting conventional wisdom. A forensic examination of one study of corporate equities in the Investor’s Monthly Manual between 1869 and 1929 suggests both idiosyncratic mistakes and generic biases which users of this source need to consider.
N24|Averting defaults in turbulent times: controversies over the League of Nations preferred creditor status|Loans by the IMF are considered to have “preferred creditor status”. However, given the potential distortions for the allocation of resources in IMF lending, the current debt crisis in Greece has raised new questions about the need for such treatment. This paper brings a historical dimension to the debate and analyzes the link between a multilateral’s preferred creditor status and its capacity to support countries in financial distress. During the early 1930s, the League of Nations attempted to secure a preferred status for the loans it promoted. At the onset of the Great Depression, while these loans were not legally senior, governments granted the League loans a de facto preferred status under the assumption that averting default would foster renewed support from the League. However, when support did not materialize, the loans’ exceptional treatment vanished, further weakening the position of the League to secure emergency lending.
N24|The macroeconomic effects of banking crises: Evidence from the United Kingdom, 1750-1938|This paper investigates the macroeconomic effects of UK banking crises over the period 1750 to 1938. We construct a new annual banking crisis series using bank failure rate data, which suggests that the incidence of banking crises was every 32 years. Using our new series and a narrative approach to identify exogenous banking crises, we find that industrial production contracts by 8.2 per cent in the year following a crisis. This finding is robust to a battery of checks, including different VAR specifications, different thresholds for the crisis indicator, and the use of a capital-weighted bank failure rate.
N24|Russia’s Informal Economic Growth: 1960–1990|This paper studies the historical GDP of Russia from perspective informal economy. We re-estimate nominal and real informal GDP in the period 1960–1990, using the expenditure approach and declassified archival materials of household budget surveys. The main findings are as follows. First, previously estimated values of Russia’s nominal GDP were underestimated, on average, by about 12.6% for 1960–1990, due to ignoring informal GDP. Second, after including informal GDP, we find that economic growth is 15–39 percentage points lower during this period, which corresponds to differences in the annual growth rate in the range of 0.24–0.38 percentage points.
N24|Financial Supervision in Hungary between the Two World Wars|This paper examines the practice of financial supervision in Hungary between the two World Wars, focusing on the period of the Great Depression and the supervisory practice that was employed prior to the crisis and that was transformed as a result. The author would like to establish how the role of the Pénzintézeti Központ as a supervisory body changed after its establishment on 1 June 1916, whether there were other institutions with functions related to the supervisory tasks, and which supervisory tools were used in Hungary during the Great Depression. The paper endeavours to present the contemporary economic conditions and the situation of the financial architecture primarily in line with contemporary thinking, on the basis of the relevant opinions of the experts from the given era.

N24|Alternative Financial Regimes and Development Banks in Greece 1963-2002: What Have We Learned?|The recent global financial crisis spurred a renewed interest in development banking because of the countercyclical role many of these banks assumed during the crisis. However, there is no agreement in the literature concerning the nature and efficiency of development banks. This paper focuses on their role as agents of institutional change and the concomitant need for their internal transformation as institutional development goes on. The question posed is how development banksï¿½ internal transformation from the traditional development banking model to a modern investment banking model is affected by the political decision on the prevailing financial regime. The paper addresses this question by examining the relationship between development banks and alternative financial regimes in Greece during the period 1963-2002. Useful insights concerning the role of government policy in development banking are drawn.
N24|Exchange Control in Italy and Bulgaria in the Interwar Period: History and Perspectives|This paper analyses exchange control in Italy and Bulgaria during the interwar period. Starting with the chronology of events, the study provides a detailed account of the institutional and economic framework in which these measures were enforced and interprets them by exploring various sources of information and data. Moreover, it suggests a theoretical interpretation of exchange control measures stressing that these policies were a serious interference in market mechanisms. A further point is that exchange control in both countries was an eloquent example of how serious the balance of payments constraint was at that time and how difficult it was to circumvent it. Subject to discussion, the paper derives some lessons for todayï¿½s economies.
N24|Problems of Stamp Duty Levying in Bulgaria between the two World Wars|The Stamp duty representing a specific tax levied on a wide range of written documents is known to the specialists in economic history mainly thanks to its central role in the revolutionary movement of the American colonies against the British Empire. The analogous application of the tax in the period between the two World Wars and the problems that it creates in Bulgaria are poorly known and not sufficiently studied by our economic historians. The negative aspects and the problems associated with this type of tax in British and world history are mostly purely political in nature while in the specific study the main focus for the author will be to prove the thesis that in Bulgaria they relate to fiscal fanaticism, the inadequacy, the complexity, the defects of the legislation itself along with the tax policy of the state as a whole. Through analysis of the tax legislation, the negative impact of Stamp duty laws is revealed in several different directions. Aspects of the law expressing and leading to extreme fiscalism, imbalance, complexity and poor performance. Aspects that have a negative impact on the money supply, credit, savings deposits and the economy as a whole. Aspects which are immoral, irrational and disproportionate in nature.
N24|Iceland’s response to economic crises: A success story?|The economic crisis that burst in 2007 was one of the harshest-if not the harshest- in the recent history. Companies, households and whole economies were affected. Starting from the USA and later expanding to the western countries, the consequences of the crisis were severe for some countries even within the European Union. Iceland is one of first the countries in Europe that experienced the crisis and its consequences. On October 2008, the country saw the financial system collapsing. Iceland experienced an economic bubble which can be related and compared to the one that took place in the USA. The great difference, though, was that the enormity of the Icelandic crisis could not be compared to its small size. In a short period of time, Icelanders, as well as British and Dutch, lost their money. No signs were taken seriously in the previous years, leading to a complete disaster of the economy. The purpose of this article is to examine the factors that caused the 2007 crisis and why Iceland was so badly affected. Were there any signs of the forthcoming disaster? Could it all have been prevented and, if so, in what price? These are the questions that we would like to answer in order to understand this crisis and prevent a future one.
N24|Inequality, Foreign Investment, and Imperialism|We present an empirical restatement of the classical economic theory of imperialism and the origins of World War I. Using recent data, we show 1) inequality was at historical highs in all the advanced belligerent countries at the turn of the century, 2) rich wealth holders invested more of their assets abroad, 3) risk-adjusted foreign returns were higher than risk-adjusted domestic returns, 4) establishing direct political control decreased the riskiness of foreign assets, 5) increased inequality was associated with higher share of foreign assets in GDP, and 6) increased share of foreign assets was correlated with higher levels of military mobilization. Together, these facts suggest that the classic theory of imperialism may have some empirical support.
N24|Rise and fall in the Third Reich: Social mobility and Nazi membership|This paper explores the relationship between Nazi membership and social mobility using a unique and highly detailed dataset of military conscripts and volunteers during the Third Reich. We find that membership of a Nazi organisation is positively related to social mobility when measured by the difference between fathers' and sons' occupations. This relationship is stronger for the more 'elite' NS organisations, the NSDAP and the SS. However, we find that this observed difference in upward mobility is driven by individuals with different characteristics self-selecting into these organisations, rather than from a direct reward to membership. These results are confirmed by a series of robustness tests. In addition, we employ our highly-detailed dataset to explore the determinants of Nazi membership. We find that NS membership is associated with higher socio-economic background and human capital levels.

N24|"Sparen in der ""Nullzinsphase"". Privatanleger und der Kapitalmarkt in Deutschland im Ersten Weltkrieg"|"Saving in the ""Zero Interest Period"". Private Investors and the Capital Market in Germany in the First World War: This paper offers a look back at the period of zero interest and even negative interest during the First World War. In contrast to the current period of low interest rates, during the war there was an illusion of interest: while savers did receive nominal interest on their deposits, however, the savings deposits lost value due to the war inflation such that it was effectively negative interest. Even at the end of the war only very few savers were aware that they had experienced a period of declining interest. Rather, they assumed that the purchasing power of the mark and the exchange rate would soon settle down at the pre-war level. The full scope of the dilemma for private investors during the zero interest period became apparent only in the post-war inflation. Although various options between inflation and deflation were still discussed during the revolution and at the beginning of the Weimar Republic, the monetary and fiscal path subsequently taken resulted in the uncontrolled inflation that had significantly greater effects on private investors and the capital market than the war inflation that directly preceded it."
N24|Die Beziehungen der Norddeutschen Wollkämmerei und Kammgarnspinnerei zu den Banken|The Relationship of the Norddeutsche Wollkämmerei und Kammgarnspinnerei (Nordwolle Group) with the Banks: Research into the relationship between banking and industry has long held the view that banks had dominated their clientele from industry, trade and retailing and they had established a position of power that was almost impossible to reign in. More recent studies question this assessment and deliver impressive evidence that the relationship between industry and banks was often characterized by information asymmetries. For example, major companies often withheld information about their earnings performance during credit negotiations so that the banks had to make large risk provisions which reduced their profitability. This was also true for the Nordwolle textile group, which had financed the expansion of its business during the Weimar Republic primarily from outside capital, first and foremost using loans from various banks. In obtaining these loans, the Group's management succeeded repeatedly in playing competing banks against one another. Even major banks such as Danat-Bank, Berliner Handelsgesellschaft, and probably Dresdner Bank as well, placed major bets on getting Nordwolle to commit itself as a client. As long as the banks could be talked into believing that company was profitable and continually expanding, the banks were ready to grant new loans. Not until the spring of 1931, after indications about the Group's actual situation had made the rounds did the banks push through extensive audits of the company's financial statements. That the efforts to rescue Nordwolle ultimately remained fruitless was not least a result of the new-found caution in awarding additional loans.
N24|Die Genossenschaftliche Institutssicherung – ein notwendiges Instrument zur Stärkung des Kundenvertrauens und des Risikomanagements im dezentralen Bankenverbund|Cooperative Institutional Protection – a Necessary Instrument for Strengthening Customer Trust and Risk Management in Local Banking Groups: The protection scheme of the cooperative financial network goes back to the guarantee funds of the German ‹Volksbanken›, the world's oldest privately-financed protection system for banks. The core task of institutional protection is to protect the cooperative banks and hence the protection of the member's and customers' deposits, investments and savings. The local roots of the credit cooperatives rest in the 19th century. During the so-called formative phase, protection schemes were established for the newly-created cooperative lending networks of ‹Volksbanken› and rural cooperative banks, which have been a joint cooperative financial network since 1972. Since that time, the cooperative banks' combined protection scheme has developed into a unique protection system with complex tools for risk management.
N24|Hamburg als Standort der privaten Universal-/Großbanken im 19. und frühen 20. Jahrhundert|Hamburg as a Site of Private Full-service/ Major Banks in the 19th and Early 20th Centuries: The Hamburg banking sector experienced considerable structural changes in the period from 1850 until into the 1930s. Around 1856 and 1870, a large number of new banks were founded, mostly in the form of stock corporations. Starting in the 1890s, the banking center saw a consolidation with foreign banks locating there and the commencement of foundings of branches. What is striking is the bilateral integration of Hamburg with Berlin, the financial center. While the banking relationships with the imperial capital meant a relative loss of importance for the local Hamburg banks, it also brought a considerable overall benefit to Hamburg as a financial center. Typical for the Hamburg financial center was the major and long-standing significance of the merchant banker, whose business was rooted primarily in the mercantile trade. Also striking was the large number of small private banking businesses in the 1920s.

N24|How does the public perceive alliances? The Central and Allied Powers in World War I|World War I was fought by numerous countries siding together as the Central Powers and, respectively, the Allied Powers. The former established around the German Empire and Austria-Hungary and grew to four allies when the Ottoman Empire in late 1914 and Bulgaria in late 1915 entered the scene; the latter centered on the alliance between England, France, and Russia and was informally extended to many more countries as they entered into the war ad-hoc by signaling common interests with the core Allied Powers. This article addresses an oft-neglected dimension of the alliance formation phenomenon, namely how alliances were perceived by the public, in contrast to military leaders' perceptions of each other. Were the Central and Allied Powers perceived as credible alliances - monolithic blocks - right at the time? We seek to determine the degree of 'alliance integration' among pairs of countries by applying cointegration analysis based on securities prices. It is assumed that prices of countries perceived as 'integrated' should show signs of co-movement. More specifically, we focus on the Amsterdam market for foreign government bonds providing us with a neutral's view on that matter. Our analysis is based on the yields for 13 belligerent countries' representative bonds traded during the war, but also before and after. Among other things, we cannot corroborate that investors recognized two monolithic blocks simply fighting the war.

Results suggest that cooperatively-owned Raiffeisen banks for both Catholic and Protestant minority groups could limit their exposure to a debt-deflation crisis, despite operating more precarious balance sheets than banks for majorities. Business histories demonstrate how strict membership criteria and personal guarantors acted as screening and monitoring devices. Banks serving minorities functioned as club goods, managing their exposure to the crisis by exploiting the confessionalized nature of Dutch society.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

We use a broad mix of reporting from the Financial Times as our proxy for investor sentiment. The main contribution of this paper is threefold. First, newspaper commentary, which was sentiment-laden, but information-light, in the Financial Times affects returns. Second, we find evidence that sentiment plays a role in propagating price movements, particularly during bull markets. Third, we find little evidence that the effect of sentiment on the market differs in bear versus bull markets.
N24|The Palmer Rule and the convertibility of bank notes in Spain|Research on banking systems has token as a frame of reference the English banking system. Precisely because the English banking system was early, it had opportunities to explore certain control mechanisms that favored the extension of the bill of bank. One such mechanism was known as Palmer Rule, a rule stating that a well-managed bank should keep in its cash box one third of its responsibilities. This rule allowed maintaining the convertibility of notes, giving confidence to customers and encouraging the spread paper money. In Spain it has been discussed about the convertibility of the note in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. This work includes to the discussion the Palmer rule, crucial to understanding why the ticket of the Bank of Spain ceased to be convertible de facto in the late nineteenth century, although the inconvertibility is not legally established until 1946.
N24|Las presiones políticas y empresariales en el marco del proceso de negociación para la entrada de España en la Comunidad Económica Europea (c. 1962-1968)|The admission of Spain as a member of the European Union was a long process of 24 years. During this time, our country used all kind of tools at its disposal (diplomatic, ecomomic, political) to avoid the fact that Spain was not a democracy but a dictatorial regime. In this article, one particular way of forcing the European Union to accept Spain's application is examined. The idea was to put pressure on the managers of the main European companies working in Spain, in order to ease the political negotiation with their respective countries. Attention is mainly focused on Dutch and Italian firms (and managers) with interests in Spain. There are few studies addressing this peculiar lobbying of countries directed at specific companies. Ways are shown on how to measure the real impact of these economic pressures. KEY Classification-JEL: F15. F52. N24
N24|Historical Archive of Credit in Italy|This paper presents the Archivio Storico del Credito in Italia (ASCI), a comprehensive database of balance sheet data for nearly 2,600 Italian banks on an annual basis for the period 1890-1973. The work draws on earlier work carried out by the Bank of Italy for the period 1890-1936 (published in 1996) and incorporates information collected by the Bank of Italy as part of its banking supervision activity from 1936 onwards. ASCI is suitable for analyzing a variety of credit phenomena, given the high representativeness of the banking system and the large amount of balance sheet data available. Based on this new dataset, we provide a sketch of the evolution of the Italian banking system between 1890 and 1973, exploring the composition of the balance sheets across bank categories, the regional distribution of banks and the degree of concentration.
N24|Eurobonds Past and Present: A Comparative Review on Debt Mutualization in Europe|This paper reviews the economic and historical literature on debt mutualization in Europe with reference to pre-1914 guaranteed bonds and the current Eurobonds debate. We argue that, notwithstanding the differences in scale and nature, debt mutualization solutions similar to Eurobonds were tried before, and the closest historical examples to the present debate are the pre-1914 guaranteed bonds. We highlight three key characteristics of debt mutualization, which are apparent both in the current debate and in history: moral hazard, debt dilution and conditionality. We show that the fears about short-run dilution and moral hazard were not unknown to pre-1914 market participants. These problems were partly addressed by mechanisms of conditionality such as international financial control. The historical evidence suggests that the dilution of outstanding obligations may be overplayed in the current debate. On the contrary, creditors’ moral hazard (ignored in current debt mutualization proposals) was as problematic as the usual debtor’s moral hazard –especially when the groups of countries guaranteeing the bonds and the creditor nations did not overlap entirely.
N24|Les taux d’intérêt en France : une perspective historique|This article builds and studies long-term series of French interest rates since the early 19th century: the central bank leading interest rate; the rate of the 3-month paper on the interbank market, the regulated deposit rate of saving institutions (livret A), the yield on long-term safe assets (government securities). Comparisons are made with similar series in the UK and US. In a historical perspective, the current situation (low real and nominal interest rates) seems exceptional and very different from previous periods of interest rate stability (in the 19th century) or low real rates (during times of high inflation). The current level of interest rates does not look like the consequence of a sudden break caused by the crisis; it continues a downward trend that started in the early 1980s.

N24|Learning Capitalism the Hard Way--Evidence from German Reunification|We develop a model of firm learning in volatile markets with noisy signals and test its predictions using historical data from the Ifo Institute's Business Climate Survey. We find that firms' forecasts improve as they age. We also exploit German Reunification as a natural experiment where firms in the East are treated with ignorance about the distribution of market states. As theoretically predicted, Eastern firms make larger forecast errors than Western ones, but this gap gradually closes over the decade following Reunification. The slow convergence rate stems from differences in expectations rather than market conditions. We also find evidence for the model's predictions that improvements from learning are faster where market signals are noisier.
N24|The Rise and Fall of the German Stock Market, 1870-1938|The prior literature has advanced differing views on whether Germany during the late 19th and early 20th centuries was an economy supported by an equity-based as well as a bank-oriented financial system. Primarily by deploying a new IPO dataset for the Berlin Stock Exchange encompassing 1870 to 1938, we show German equity markets were well-developed as the 19th century drew to a close and remained so through the 1920s. Our analysis indicates regulation helped to foster development before 1913 but had a deleterious impact during the 1930s and suggests that there was a fruitful coexistence between large banks and markets until the Nazi era.
N24|Using probate data to determine historical male occupational structures|Leigh Shaw-Taylor and Sir E.A. Wrigley recently published new estimates for the male occupational structure of England and Wales. Their pre-census figures are based on parish register data, but before Rose's Act of 1812, parish registers offer occupational information only in a sample of parishes, and are virtually silent about employments before 1690. This paper examines how the gaps in the parish register data can be filled using a data source which offer more universal coverage and goes back much further in time: probate records. It demonstrates how an, at first sight, critical deficiency of probate data, namely their severe bias towards capital-intensive and/or relatively well-paying occupations, can be overcome by using parish register data for calibration.
N24|The Emergence of the Corporate Form|We describe how, during the 17th century, the business corporation gradually emerged in response to the need to lock in long-term capital to profit from trade opportunities with Asia. Since contractual commitments to lock in capital were not fully enforceable in partnerships, this evolution required a legal innovation, essentially granting the corporation a property right over capital. Locked-in capital exposed investors to a significant loss of control, and could only emerge where and when political institutions limited the risk of expropriation. The Dutch East India Company (VOC, chartered in 1602) benefited from the restrained executive power of the Dutch Republic and was the first business corporation with permanent capital. The English East India Company (EIC, chartered in 1600) kept the traditional cycle of liquidation and refinancing until, in 1657, the English Civil War put the crown under strong parliamentary control. We show how the time advantage in the organizational form had a profound effect on the ability of the two companies to make long-term investments and consequently on their relative performance, ensuring a Dutch head start in Asian trade that persisted for two centuries. We also show how other features of the corporate form emerged progressively once the capital became permanent. (JEL: G30, K22, N24).
N24|International banking and transmission of the 1931 financial crisis|In May to July 1931, a series of financial panics shook central Europe before spreading to the rest of the world. This article explores the role of cross‐border banking linkages in propagating the central European crisis to Britain and the US. Using archival bank‐level data, the article documents US and British banks’ exposure to central European frozen credits in 1931. Central European lending was mostly done by large and diversified commercial banks in the US and by small and geographically specialized merchant banks/acceptance houses in Britain. Differences in the organization of international bank lending explain why the central European crisis disturbed few US banks but endangered many British financial institutions.
N24|Capitalising on the Irish land question: land reform and state banking in Ireland, 1891–1938|Land reform and its financial arrangements are central elements of modern Irish history. Yet to date, the financial mechanisms underpinning Irish land reform have been overlooked. The paper outlines the mechanisms of land reform in Ireland and the importance of land bonds to the process. The paper introduces a new database on Irish land bonds listed on the Dublin Stock Exchange from 1891 to 1938. It illustrates the nature of these b onds and presents data on their size, liquidity and market returns. The paper finds a high level of state banking in Ireland: large issues of land bonds were held by state owned savings banks.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N24|If You're So Smart: John Maynard Keynes and Currency Speculation in the Interwar Years|This article explores the risks and returns to currency speculation during the 1920s and 1930s. We study the performance of two well-known technical trading strategies (carry and momentum) and compare them with that of a fundamentals-based trader: John Maynard Keynes. Technical strategies were highly profitable during the 1920s and even outperformed Keynes. In the 1930s, however, both technical strategies and Keynes performed relatively poorly. While our results reveal the existence of profitable opportunities for currency traders in the interwar years, they suggest that such profits were necessary compensation for enduring the substantial risks that all strategies entailed.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N24|Sovereign debt guarantees and default: Lessons from the UK and Ireland, 1920–1938|We study the daily yields on Irish land bonds listed on the Dublin Stock Exchange during the years 1920–1938. We exploit Irish events during the period and structural differences in land bonds to tease out a measure of investors׳ credibility in a UK sovereign guarantee. Using Ireland׳s default on intergovernmental payments in 1932, we find a premium of about 43 basis points associated with uncertainty about the UK government guarantee. We discuss the economic and political forces behind the Irish and UK governments׳ decisions pertaining to the default. Our finding has implications for modern-day proposals to issue jointly-guaranteed sovereign debt.
N24|This time is different: Causes and consequences of British banking instability over the long run|This paper addresses three questions: (1) How severe were the episodes of banking instability experienced by the UK over the past two centuries? (2) What have been the macroeconomic indicators of UK banking instability? and (3) What have been the consequences of UK banking instability for the cost of credit? Using a unique dataset of bank share prices from 1830 to 2010 to assess the stability of the UK banking system, we find that banking instability has grown more severe since the 1970s. We also find that interest rates, inflation, lending growth, and equity prices are consistent macroeconomic indicators of UK banking instability over the long run. Furthermore, utilising a unique dataset of corporate-bond yields for the period 1860 to 2010, we find that there is a significant long-run relationship between banking instability and the credit-risk premium faced by businesses.
N24|Feeling the blues Moral hazard and debt dilution in Eurobonds before 1914|Debt mutualisation through Eurobonds has been proposed as a solution to the Euro crisis. Although this proposal found some support, it also attracted strong criticisms as it risks raising the spreads for strong countries, diluting legacy debt and promoting moral hazard by weak countries. Because Eurobonds are a new addition to the policy toolkit, there are many untested hypotheses in the literature about the counterfactual behaviour of markets and sovereigns. This paper offers some tests of the issues by drawing from the closest historical parallel – five guaranteed bonds issued in Europe between 1833 and 1913. The empirical evidence suggests that contemporary concerns about fiscal transfers and debt dilution may be overblown, and creditors' moral hazard may be as much of a problem as debtors'.
N24|Any lessons for today? Exchange-rate stabilisation in Greece and South-East Europe between economic and political objectives and fiscal reality, 1841-1939|"""We add a historical and regional dimension to the debate on the Greek debt crisis. Analysing Greece, Romania, Serbia/Yugoslavia and Bulgaria from political independence to WW II, we find surprising parallels to the present: repeated cycles of entry to and exit from monetary unions, government debt build-up and default, and financial supervision by West European countries. Gold standard membership was more short-lived than in any other part of Europe due to fiscal dominance. Granger causality tests and money growth accounting show that the prevailing pattern of fiscal dominance was only broken under international financial control, when strict conditionality scaled back the treasury’s influence; only then were central banks able to conduct a rule-bound monetary policy and stabilize their exchange-rates. The long- run record of Greece suggests that the perennial economic and political objective of monetary union membership can only be achieved if both monetary and fiscal policy is effectively delegated abroad."""
N24|A Kalecki fable on debt and the monetary transmission mechanism|Kalecki explained debt resolution by means of a fable about monetary circulation between mutually indebted individuals. This note explains the context and some of the theoretical implications of the fable. These point to an asymmetry in monetary policy in which excessively tight monetary policy may restrict economic activity and force the resort to informal debt.
N24|A Sustainable Euro Area with Exit Options|All explorations of the future of the Euro show serious risks for its survival in the present form. The road map of the Five EU Presidents presented in 2015 is far from sufficient to reduce the risks of the Euro zone falling apart by Brexit type developments or new economic shocks. The EU Presidents rely too much on high international economic growth smoothing the convergence in labor productivity between EU member states, while the more likely low growth scenario shows a serious risk of the Euro‐area falling apart in a chaotic way, through further divergence in labor productivity, through new Banking crises or through the popular vote in response to fiscal and labor market reform. The Presidents argue for strengthening the Banking union with an independent watchdog, with a single resolution mechanism for Bank defaults and for a European credit deposit insurance system. The support for these proposals is overwhelming. They also argue for more transfer of sovereignty on financial policy and for debt mutualisation (sharing of the risks of country debt among all EU countries). This is unlikely to happen, while at the same time the urgency for dealing with the drag imposed by the high debt levels of many EU countries on economic growth is high. We propose that the EU negotiates a New Deal between the highly indebted Euro countries and the other Euro countries. In this deal the trust is built that the richer countries agree on debt mutualization against the assurance of an automatic exit from the Euro area at non‐compliance with the agreed (and simplified) rules.
N24|The History of European Infrastructure Finance: An Analytical Framework|How can socio-economic resources be mobilized to pay for works that offer beneﬁts only in the future, often in the distant future? We discuss what we understand by infrastructure, a term that can have different meanings/semantic contents, and whose deﬁnition issues reveal some recurrent conceptual problems. Finance is here understood in the very broad sense of a set of mechanisms bringing to investment, and future beneﬁts, the resources needed in advance to pay for it. We offer a brief discussion of technological and organizational change, as several of our examples and other literature that we cite show that investment and ﬁnance decisions are deeply interwoven with knowledge, management, and technical progress. The paper analyses government involvement on both sides of our theme: investment and ﬁnancing decisions, but also on the wider issue of service provision in the context of emerging widespread social needs. In fact, the social demand for infrastructures often manifests itself as only mediated by governments or a small group of players, while the services offered by the infrastructure have subsequently created general interest, sometimes unexpectedly. We mention the tension between the national and the international dimensions and suggest a taxonomy of the macrotypes of infrastructure ﬁnancing we have identiﬁed, and sums up their spread and evolution over the long term.
N24|The European Payments Union and the origins of Triffin’s regional approach towards international monetary integration|Robert Triffin (1911-1993) played an important role in the international monetary debates in the postwar period. He was known as one of the main advocates of a multipolar international monetary system. In this paper we analyse the origins of riffin’s “regional” approach towards international monetary integration. We argue that Triffin’s experience with the European Payments Union (EPU)played hereby a crucial role. Triffin was not only an “architect” of the EPU, but the EPU also led to an important shift in Triffin’s view of the geography of the international monetary system. Before his work on the EPU, Triffin thought of the international economy as composed of two geographical entities: national economies and the world economy. With his work on the EPU he introduced a third geographical entity: the region. The EPU would so be at the basis of Triffin’s advocacy of a regional approach towards international monetary integration. Moreover, while Triffin was initially quite positive on the IMF, he became, through his EPU experience, more critical of the IMF and its worldwide approach.
N24|The response of euro area sovereign spreads to the ECB unconventional monetary policies|We analyse variations in sovereign bond yields and spreads following unconventional monetary policy announcements by the European Central Bank. Using a two-country, arbitrage-free, shadow-rate dynamic term structure model (SR-DTSM), we decompose countries'yields into expectation and risk premium components. By means of an event study analysis, we show that the ECB's announcements reduced both the average expected instantaneous spread and risk repricing components of Italian and Spanish spreads. For countries such as Belgium and France, the ECB announcements impacted primarily the risk repricing component of the spread.
N24|The Interdependence of Monetary and Macroprudential Policy under the Zero Lower Bound|This paper considers the interdependence of monetary and macroprudential policy in a New Keynesian business cycle model under the zero lower bound constraint. Entrepreneurs borrow in nominal terms from banks and are subject to idiosyncratic default risk. The realized loan return to the bank varies with aggregate risk, such that bank balance sheets are affected by higher-than-expected rm defaults. Monetary and macroprudential policies are given by an interest rate rule and a capital requirement rule, respectively. We first characterize the model's stability properties under different steady state policies. We then analyze the transmission of a risk shock under the zero lower bound and different macroprudential policies. We finally investigate whether these policies are indeed optimal.
N24|A Model of the International Monetary System|We propose a simple model of the international monetary system. We study the world supply and demand for reserve assets denominated in different currencies under a variety of scenarios: a hegemon versus a multipolar world; abundant versus scarce reserve assets; and a gold exchange standard versus a floating rate system. We rationalize the Triffin dilemma, which posits the fundamental instability of the system, as well as the common prediction regarding the natural and beneficial emergence of a multipolar world, the Nurkse warning that a multipolar world is more unstable than a hegemon world, and the Keynesian argument that a scarcity of reserve assets under a gold standard or at the zero lower bound is recessionary. Our analysis is both positive and normative.
N24|Two centuries of currency policy in Austria|This paper is devoted to currency policies in Austria over the last 200 years, attempting to sketch historical developments and uncover regularities and interconnections with macroeconomic variables. While during the 19th century the exchange rate resembled a kind of technical relation, since World War I (WW I) it has evolved as a policy instrument with the main objectives of controlling inflation and fostering productivity. During most of the 200-year period, Austrian currencies were subject to fixed exchange rates, in the form of silver and Gold standards in the 19th century, as a gold-exchange standard and hard currency policy in much of the 20th century, and with the euro as the single currency in the early 21st century. Given Austria’s euro area membership, national exchange rate policy has been relinquished in favor of a common currency which itself is floating vis-à-vis third currencies. Austria’s predilection for keeping exchange rates stable is due not least to the country’s transformation from one of Europe’s few great powers (up to WW I) to a small open economy closely tied to the large German economy.
N24|The changing role of macroprudential policy in Austria after World War II|The need for and implementation of macroprudential supervision was a key lesson from the global financial crisis of 2008. However, historical protocols, legislation, policy agreements as well as the literature bear witness of a longer history of macroprudential policy in Austria: it predates the crisis by about 60 years during which it gradually evolved. We argue that careful analysis of this history provides interesting insights for current policymakers. We identify the following key lessons from analyzing the changing legal nature, motivation and effectiveness of macroprudential policy in Austria: first, macroprudential policy requires a sound legal basis; second, measures have to be quite intrusive to effectively curtail the build-up of systemic risk. Less intrusive measures become effective above all by increasing the shock-absorbing capacity of the financial system, once systemic risks materialize.
N24|Greek Sovereign Defaults in Retrospect and Prospect|This article focuses on and critically reviews the four Greek sovereign defaults (1827, 1843, 1893 and 1932) and puts them into historical perspective. The argument is that each and every one of the defaults was not an isolated episode in the turbulent economic history of capitalism, but, rather, a manifestation of the internal weaknesses of the Greek economy magnified during the downturn phases of the 1815-1848, 1873-1896, and 1921-1940 long waves. Crucial for understanding the conditions that triggered these defaults were the short-sighted and often opportunistic policies adopted by the Greek governments of the time, which were eager to increase public spending based on borrowed money, thus contributing to a mounting public debt. As a consequence, Greek sovereign defaults of the past are worth studying in an effort to derive useful lessons and draw economic policy conclusions.
N24|Девизна Политика Југославије 1945–1990: Искуства И Поуке<BR>[Yugoslav Foreign Currency Policy in 1945–1990: Experiences and Lessons]|Serbian Abstract. У раду се разматра девизна политика Југославије у периоду социјалистичке изградње (1945–1990). Приказан је њен развој од строге централизације и монопола целе спољне трговине, с Егализационим фондом и централизацијом девиза у Централном девизном фонду, до почетка 1950-их, у правцу децентрализације и примене разноврсних инструмената монетарне, спољнотрговинске и девизне политике. Упоредо са стицањем пословне самосталности привредни субјекти су добијали и самосталност у спољнотрговинском пословању и у стицању и располагању девизним средствима. У оквиру тога, међутим, одвијали су се и процеси преношења значајних овлашћења федералних на републике и покрајине, укључујући и увођење њихових девизних и платнобилансних пројекција. Заједно са сличним процесима у другим сегментима привредног система и економске политике, све је то допринело развлашћивању федералне државе и припремало терен за њен распад. Сама спољнотрговинска и девизна политика заснивала се, уз то, нарочито током деценије 1980–1990 на погрешним концептима (теорија паритета куповних снага) и игнорисала је налазе економске науке (Дугорочни програм економске стабилизације). English Abstract. This paper deals with the foreign currency policy of Yugoslavia during its socialist construction period between 1945 and 1990. It presents its development from the strict centralization and state monopoly over the totality of foreign trade, marked by the Equalization Fund and the centralization of foreign currency in the Central Foreign Currency Fund, which were applied until the beginning of the 1950-ies, to a decentralization and application of a new set of different monetary, foreign trade and currency policies. Along with gaining business independence, enterprises were also gaining independence in foreign trade and in gaining and management of foreign currency assets. However, these processes brought about a transferal of important responsibilities from federal to republic and provincial levels, including the introduction of republic and provincial foreign currency projections and projections regarding the balance of payments. Together with similar processes taking place in other segments of industry and economic politics, it all contributed to depriving the federal state of responsibilities, thus providing a basis for its future disintegration. Moreover, the Yugoslav foreign trade and foreign currency policies were based on wrong concepts, such as the theory of purchasing power parity, and they ignored the findings of the economic science, such as the long-term program of economic stabilization, especially during the decade of the 1980-ies.
N24|The Impact of Stop-Go Demand Management Policy on Britain's Consumer Durables Industries, 1952-1965|We examine the impacts of British government stop-go policy on domestic sales of consumer durables over 1952 - 1965, via hire purchase restrictions and punitive Purchase Tax rates. Our analysis includes a general review of contemporary evidence regarding the impacts of these measures, a more detailed study of the television sector, and time-series econometric analysis for both televisions and a representative high-ticket labour-saving consumer durable washing machines. We find that the restrictions had devastating impacts on Britain's consumer durables industries, preventing firms from fully exploiting economies of scale, reducing output growth and international competitiveness, and eroding industrial relations. Government officials were aware of these problems, but considered them a price worth paying to facilitate moves towards sterling convertibility and the re-establishment of the City as a leading financial and trading centre.
N24|Securitisation, loan growth and bank funding: the Swiss experience since 1932|This paper empirically analyses securitisation in Switzerland from a macroeconomic and bank balance sheet perspective based on a novel and near-comprehensive data set on a specific form of securitisation over the sample period from 1932 to 2014. The Swiss Pfandbrief is a distinct covered bond with a similar institutional framework as the U.S. Federal Home Loan Bank System.
N24|Growth, deregulation and rent seeking in post-war British economy| Post-war political consensus about the need for government action to rectify market failure began to unravel in the 1970s, and even the need for prudential control of banking and finance began to be challenged by the start of the 1980s. Regulatory oversight was relaxed in the belief that emerging techniques in financial engineering would render irrelevant fears of sharp periodic downturns that have historically been the consequence of lightly regulated finance. The outcome of this new policy, embracing the idea of unregulated markets to deliver greater prosperity, is disappointing. We find that the average growth rate of UK GDP and output per person employed for three decades from the start of liberalization was no greater than that in the previous three post-war decades. Cyclical fluctuations were deeper. A remarkable feature of the second period is the sharp rise in income inequality in favour of the very top earners. An illusion of greater prosperity for a wider segment may have been created in the second period due to asset price bubbles and housing inflation.
N24|Financial supervision to fight fiscal dominance? The gold standard in Greece and South-East Europe between economic and political objectives and fiscal reality, 1841-1939|We add a historical and regional dimension to the debate on the Greek debt crisis.

N24|The rise and decline of the UK's provincial stock markets, 1869-1929|The London Stock Exchange was the largest capital market in the world at the beginning of the twentieth century, but Britain also had numerous other stock markets based in provincial cities and towns. This paper provides the first in-depth quantitative assessment of these markets. We find that they were an important source of financing for regional companies up until circa 1900 and our evidence suggests that their post-1900 decline was largely due to the changing characteristics of publicly-listed firms. We also find that the provincial and London markets became increasingly integrated over time.
N24|Long-run stock returns: evidence from Belgium 1838–2010|We investigate monthly returns of Belgian stocks listed on the Brussels stock exchange in the period 1838–2010. Our dataset is based on official quotation lists of the stock exchange, and it takes into account all common stocks that were ever listed on the stock exchange during the period considered. This allows us to investigate the performance of the market as a whole in a consistent way over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We find that stock returns strongly depend on dividend income. While real capital appreciation tends to be negative, the dividend yield is remarkably stable over time. Stocks were less risky in the nineteenth century than in the twentieth century. While the equity premium is overall positive, the reward for equity risk is very volatile over time. Even in the long-run equity investors frequently earned a negative return. There are no consistent differences between returns on small stocks and large stocks.
N24|La crisis de un gran banco industrial: El Banco Urquijo, 1970-1988|El Banco Urquijo ha sido el banco industrial español por antonomasia durante el siglo XX. Desde su constitución en 1918, su estrategia fue impulsar la industrialización y el desarrollo del país promoviendo, gestionando y financiando un amplio número de empresas en casi todos los sectores económicos, especialmente en sectores estratégicos para la industrialización (minería, energía, siderometalurgia, bienes de equipo, química, servicios financieros, etc.). El Urquijo y su grupo de empresas alcanzaron su mayor tamaño en los primeros años setenta, justo al final del periodo desarrollista. La crisis económica posterior representó un gran desafío para el mantenimiento de su estrategia de banco industrial. A finales de 1982, el Banco de España diseñó una operación de salvamento de la entidad mediante su toma de control por el principal accionista, el Banco Hispano Americano. En 1os años siguientes, éste creó el Banco Urquijo Unión como resultado de la fusión del Urquijo con Bankunión. Planteamos nuestro trabajo en dos partes. En la primera, aportamos elementos –tanto internos al Urquijo (cambios corporativos y de estrategia) como externos (regulatorios, de política económica y de coyuntura)— para explicar las dificultades por las que atravesó entre 1974 y 1982 y las razones que justificarían la necesidad de su salvamento por el regulador bancario. En la segunda, además de explicar el proceso de salvamento mismo, damos cuenta de la estrategia que aplicaron los responsables del Urquijo Unión para sanear y reflotar la nueva entidad entre 1983 y 1988.
N24|Stature and Sibship: Historical Evidence|This paper examines historical evidence for a quality-quantity trade-off between sibship size and height as an indicator of health. The existing literature has focused more on education than on health and has it produced mixed results. Historical evidence is limited by the lack of household level data with which to link an individual’s height with his or her childhood circumstances. Nevertheless a few recent studies have shed light in this issue. Evidence for children in interwar Britain and for soldiers born in the 1890s who enlisted in the British army at the time of WW1 is reviewed in detail. Both studies support the idea of a significant trade-off, partly due to income dilution and partly because, in these settings, large families were a conduit for infection. Evidence from country-level time series is consistent with this view. The fertility decline that began in the late nineteenth century made a modest but nevertheless important contribution to the overall increase in heights during the following century.
N24|Corporate ownership and control in Victorian Britain|" type=""main""> Using ownership and control data for 890 firm-years, this article examines the concentration of capital and voting rights in British companies in the second half of the nineteenth century. We find that both capital and voting rights were diffuse by modern-day standards. However, this does not necessarily mean that there was a modern-style separation of ownership from control in Victorian Britain. One major implication of our findings is that diffuse ownership was present in the UK much earlier than previously thought, and given that it occurred in an era with weak shareholder protection law, it somewhat undermines the influential law and finance hypothesis. We also find that diffuse ownership is correlated with large boards, a London head office, non-linear voting rights, and shares traded on multiple markets."

N24|"The four unions ""PIE"" on the Monetary Union ""CHERRY"": a new index of European Institutional Integration"|This paper presents a European Index of Regional Institutional Integration (EURII), which maps developments in European integration from 1958 to 2014 on the basis of a monthly dataset. EURII captures what we call: (i) the “Common Market Era”, which lasted from 1958 until 1993; and (ii) the first twenty years of the “Union Era” that started in 1994, but gained new impetus in response to the euro area crisis. The paper complements the economic narratives of the crisis with an institutional approach highlighting the remedies to the flaws in the initial design of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). In fact, since 2010, EMU’s institutional framework has been substantially reformed. While work on EMU’s new governance is still in progress, the broad contours of a “genuine union” have been outlined in the Four Presidents’ Report of December 2012. The report envisages a more effective economic union, a fiscal union, a financial union, and a commensurate political union. The aim of the EURII index is threefold: (i) to provide a tool to synthesise and monitor the process of European institutional integration since 1958 and, in particular, track institutional reforms since 2010; (ii) to expand a previous integration index by showing that monetary unification – which was initially understood as “the cherry on the Internal Market pie” – implied a major discontinuity in the process and nature of European integration, that is, a new “pie on the cherry”; and (iii) to offer a tool for further research, policy analysis and communication.

N24|Financial regulation and IPOs: Evidence from the history of the Italian stock market|This paper studies the impact of regulation on IPO markets using historical data. Regulatory interventions have different effects on the development of public equity markets under different conditions. Studying the whole population of 879 Italian IPOs from the unification of Italy (1861) through the present, we find that tightening regulatory changes improve IPO survival rates. In contrast, easing of regulations tends to harm IPO survival rates, without increasing the number of IPOs.
N24|Predicting the past: Understanding the causes of bank distress in the Netherlands in the 1920s|Why do some banks fail in financial crises while others survive? This article answers this question by analysing the effect of the Dutch financial crisis of the 1920s on 142 banks, of which 33 failed. We find that choices of balance sheet composition and product market strategy made in the lead-up to the crisis had a significant impact on banks' subsequent chances of experiencing distress. We document that high-risk banks – those operating highly-leveraged portfolios and attracting large quantities of deposits – were more likely to fail. Branching and international activities also increased banks' default probabilities. We measure the effects of board interlocks, which have been characterized in the extant literature as contributing to the Dutch crisis. We find that boards mattered: failing banks had smaller boards, shared directors with smaller and very profitable banks and had a lower concentration of interlocking directorates in non-financial firms.
N24|Individual investors and local bias in the UK, 1870-1935|"""The paper examines the long run evolution of local bias by UK investors over almost seven decades between the 1870s and the 1930s. It uses a very large sample of nearly 30,000 shareholders based on 197 sets of share records, a large and representative database of the investor population across sectors and time. It investigates the structure and the evolution of local investment preference between shareholders and the companies in which they invested as measured by geographical distance between where investors lived and the firm’s registered office, or the nearest stock exchange. The paper also examines how geographical proximity, which can be viewed as a proxy for informal trust, was affected by corporate governance and corporate performance. The main findings highlight the importance of informal trust relationships for the development of capital markets and the critical role of London, as both economic and financial centre, on investor decision-making. The size of the firm, the size of individual shareholdings and the number of stock exchanges that the security was listed on seem to have an influence on local bias. On the other hand, investors were relatively risk averse only in relation to debentures, and saw high dividend yield as compensation for parting with local bias for public and listed securities."""

The paper refers to the case of the Romanian Economy for the period 1859-1918. Romaniaâ€™s modernization and development are the result of the contribution brought by the thinkers of that time, especially by the radical liberal thinkers. At the same time, we should not neglect the participation, more modest however, of the conservative thinkers and their contribution in the economic development of the country.

N24|Investment Under Financial Liberalization: Post 1980 Turkey Case|In the history of the modern state of Turkey many policies have been developed and applied in order to transform ineffective economy to a dynamic and steady one. The liberal policies have been effectively applied except for war periods. The main activity of liberal policies in Turkey s economy was conducted on January 24, 1980 with some important structural adjustment decisions. These decisions aimed to integrate the economy with the global system by applying global economic order that widely adopted all over the world. The decisions aimed also to activate a financial liberalization in the country. Financial liberalization generally includes the principles related to the removing the pressure on the interest rate, currency control and investment mobility. More liberalization steps came in 1989 aiming to increase the investment and growth. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) was seen important for that purposes. However, short term capital flows, having been more effective in real investments than FDI, have led to several negative effects in this period. In the study some of the drawbacks of that process of financial liberalization have been discussed. The relation between FDI and Gross Domestic Product in the financial liberalization process has been tested with econometric implementation. Econometric estimation has been applied for this purpose to test this relationship for post 1980 era for Turkey as a developing country.
N24|The international contagion of short-run interest rates during the Great Depression|The aim of this article is to clearly identify the mechanisms of the money market spillovers between the United States, the United Kingdom and France during the interwar period. To describe these mechanisms in detail, a BEKK model, in which we introduce a structural break, is adopted. Our analysis sheds new light on key historical issues: Was the crisis imported into the US? Did France set off interest rate volatility in the rest of the world during the thirties? Does the propagation process of interest rate volatility corroborate the “Golden Fetters” hypothesis?
N24|Correlation of exchange rates and gold standard regime during World War 1 (In French)|We analyze the phenomenon of contagion between the main European currencies quoted against US dollar during World War 1 (WW1). The studied period goes from the start of WW1 to March 1917, before the entry of the United States into the war (April 1917). Our analysis of exchange rate correlations shows that that Gold Standard Regime has not survived the beginning of WW1.
N24|Any lessons for today? Exchange-rate stabilisation in Greece and South-East Europe between economic and political objectives and fiscal reality, 1841-1939|We add a historical and regional dimension to the debate on the Greek debt crisis. Analysing the 1841-1939 exchange-rate experience of Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia/Yugoslavia, we find surprising parallels to the present: repeated cycles of entry to and exit from gold, government debt build-up and default, and financial supervision by West European countries. Periods of stable exchange-rates were more short-lived than in any other part of Europe as a result of “fiscal dominance”, i.e., a monetary policy subjugated to the treasury’s needs. Granger causality tests show that patterns of fiscal dominance were only broken under financial supervision, when strict conditionality scaled back the influence of treasury; only then were central banks able to pursue a rule-bound monetary policy and, in turn, stabilize their exchange-rates. Fiscal institutions have remained weak in the case of Greece and are at the heart of the current crisis. A lesson for today might be that the EU-IMF programmes – with their focus on improving fiscal capacity and made effective by conditionality similar to the earlier South-East European experience – remain the best guarantor of continued Greek EMU membership. Understandable public resentment against “foreign intrusion” needs to be weighed against their potential to secure the long-term political and economic objective of exchange-rate stabilisation.
N24|Keynes, Trouton and the Hector Whaling Company. A personal and professional relationship|John Maynard Keynes’ activities on the stock market are well known. One company in which he bought stocks was the Hector Whaling Company Ltd., London – a comparatively small and little known company founded in 1928. The director of this company was Rupert Trouton. He had worked with Keynes for the Government during the First World War, was his student at Cambridge, and became a close partner in the City from the 1920s and onwards. The reason why Keynes invested in Hector was obviously his association with Rupert Trouton. The first part of this paper explores briefly the development of the Hector Whaling Company and its origins in Norway. The main part analyses the relationship between Trouton and Keynes. The focus is on their co-operation relating to Hector Whaling, but their relationship regarding various other businesses, as well as on the personal level, is also described. The paper is based on studies of the Keynes archives in Cambridge as well as newly available archives of the Hector company. The analysis provides new insights to the more general question on the motivations and decisions behind Keynes’ stock market investments as well as the internationalization of the whaling industry in the 1920s and 30s.
N24|The Great Depression and the Great Recession in Interwar Greece and Today: A comparison|The past Greek crisis experience is more or less terra incognita. In all historical empirical studies Greece is systematically neglected or included only sporadically in their cross-country samples. In the national literature too there is little on this topic. In this paper we use the 1930s crisis as a useful testing ground to compare the two crises episodes, ‘then’ and ‘now’; to detect differences and similarities and discuss the policy facts with the ultimate aim to draw some ‘policy lessons’ from history. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study the Greek crisis experience across the two historical episodes. Comparisons with the interwar period show that the recent economic downturn was faster, larger and more severe than during the early 1930s. More importantly, analysing the determinants of the two crises, we conclude that Greece’s problems arose from its inability to credibly adhere to a nominal anchor.
N24|Micro- and macroprudential regulatory instruments compared across the European Union|The study investigates how active Hungarian micro- and macroprudential regulation is in an international comparison. Based on national regulatory notifications, our analysis summarises the types of national derogation and the reasons for their application, and presents the forms in which they are applied in individual Member States. Additionally, it provides an overview of the relationship of regulatory activity with the risk profile of each state. As a consequence it is stated that Hungary has shown outstanding activity in terms of both micro- and macroprudential regulation, due to the significant number of systemic risks.
N24|Bankválságok és sokkok: a lett bankrendszer fejlõdése|Lettország földrajzi elhelyezkedésébõl adódóan a rendszerváltást követõen a bankok a kereskedelem finanszírozására jöttek létre, s részben ennek köszönhetõen kezdetben nem voltak érdekeltek a hosszú lejáratú hitelek kihelyezésében. A devizahitelezés a kezdetektõl fogva jellemzõ volt a lett bankrendszerre, aminek oka egyrészt, hogy a rögzített árfolyamrendszer mellett kisebb árfolyamkockázat terhelte a belföldi hitelfelvevõket, másrészt a lett bankok egy része nem a belföldi ügyfelekkel, hanem külföldi vállalatokkal állt szoros kapcsolatban. A lett bankrendszer viszonylag sérülékeny volt az elmúlt két évtizedben, ezt bizonyítja, hogy az ország több bankválságot, bankcsõdöt és bankmentést is megélt. Az 1995-ös bankválság a bankközi piac fejletlensége miatt nem tudott tovagyûrûzni, az ezt követõen kialakult sokkok pedig jellemzõen egy-egy bankot érintettek, nem a bankrendszer egészét. A kilencvenesek évektõl a lett bankrendszert dinamikus bõvülés jellemezte, a hitel/betét mutató a válság elõtt a 150 százalékot is meghaladta. A 2008-ban kezdõdõ globális pénzügyi válság Lettországot különösen erõteljesen érintette, azonban 2011-tõl a bankrendszer kezdte visszanyerni stabilitását.
N24|A német bankrendszer három pillére|A német bankrendszer felépítése és mûködése sajátosnak nevezhetõ több aspektusában is. Erõs társadalmi beágyazottsággal bír, jelentõs szerepet kapnak a közösségi tulajdonban álló intézmények, mindez azonban helyi szinten, rendkívül diverzifikált struktúrát képezve jelenik meg, amelyben nem dominál központi irányítás. Az adott régióra szabott helyi stratégia némileg antikvitásnak tûnhet, de a válságban kifejezett ellenálló képességet biztosított az egész német bankszektor számára, míg a nemzetközi jelenléttel bíró nagy bankok közül a Commerzbanknak jelentõs állami segítségre szorult. Ennek a relatív stabilitásnak alacsonyabb versenyképesség és alacsonyabb jövedelmezõség az ára, ami gazdasági fellendülés idején hátrányosnak bizonyulhat. Ez a két egymással szemben álló mozgatóerõ – konzervatív, helyi szintre koncentráló vs. globális stratégiával mûködõ, innovatív és kockázatvállaló stratégiák – alakította a bankszektort az elmúlt évtizedben (pl. a konszolidációs hullám) és alakítja várhatóan a jövõben is.

A tulajdonosi megoszlást tekintve jelentõs az orosz állami tulajdon, a külföldi bankok aránya nem éri el a 20 százalékot. A piacon jelen van egy magyar szereplõ is, az OTP leányvállalata, amely fõként a lakosságnak és a kisvállalatoknak nyújt pénzügyi szolgáltatásokat. Az orosz bankrendszert az utóbbi két évtizedben két nagy válság is megrázta, melyeket csak jelentõs állami segítséggel tudott átvészelni a pénzügyi szektor.
N24|Az ukrán bankrendszer evolúciója és felépítése|Az ukrán bankrendszer elmúlt másfél évtizedét a klasszikus fellendülési-visszaesési ciklussal lehet jellemezni. A 2008-as válság bekövetkeztéig, a késõbb fenntarthatatlannak bizonyult növekedés csúcspontjáig a szektor GDP-arányos mérlegfõösszege a 2000-es évek eleji 30 százalékról 100 százalék fölé emelkedett, amit elsõsorban a rendkívül dinamikus hitelkiáramlás hajtott. A válság hatására drasztikusan visszaesõ jövedelmezõség, valamint a kedvezõtlen makrogazdasági kilátások következtében az állami bankmentések mellett megindult a külföldi tulajdonú bankok ukrán kitettségének leépítése, ami az aktuális krízis hatására felgyorsult. A sokszereplõs és alacsony koncentráltsággal leírható szektor válságot követõ konszolidációja még mindig várat magára, amit a részben devizában denominált, rendkívül magas nemteljesítõ hitelállománnyal rendelkezõ portfóliók lassú értékesítése is nehezít. A bankrendszer jelenlegi tulajdonosi struktúráját – a külföldi szereplõk válságot megelõzõ intenzív térnyerését, majd a 2008-at követõ mérlegösszehúzódását követõen – a hazai kereskedelmi bankok dominanciája jellemzi.
N24|Az Egyesült Királyság bankrendszerének története: univerzális bankok létrejötte|Az Egyesült Királyság bankszektora jelentõs változáson ment keresztül a 20. század második felétõl kezdõdõen. Ennek eredményeként a legnagyobb bankok tevékenységi köre kiszélesedett, nemzetközileg is jelentõs univerzális bankokká váltak. Hatalmas intézmények és ezzel együtt hatalmas, de igen koncentrált bankszektor jött létre, London pedig a világ egyik nemzetközi pénzügyi központjává emelkedett. A pénzügyi válság során ez jelentõs terhet jelentett a brit gazdaság számára, több bank esetében is állami közbelépésre került sor. A válság a hitelezési folyamatokban is meghatározó fordulatot hozott, az addig folyamatosan növekvõ hitelállomány számottevõen visszaesett. A válság a fióktelep formájában mûködõ hitelintézeteket jobban, a takarékszövetkezeteket kevésbé érintette. A kilábalás hangsúlyosabb jelei csak 2013 második felétõl kezdõdõen mutatkoznak, de a hitelezés az ösztönzõ program ellenére is még mindig jóval elmarad a válság elõtt tapasztalttól.
N24|Six myths and few facts, Recovery of the Icelandic economy post October 2008|The relative success of the Icelandic road to recovery in the wake of the 2008 Financial Crisis has been a source of some myth-making. This paper discusses to which extent Iceland refused to bail out bankers and sheltered the sovereign from financial losses. I also argue that Iceland responded to the crisis by Keynesian expansionary policy rather than austerity. Furthermore, I argue that the debt-relief program that the government initiated also was a key factor in cushioning the effect of the collapse of the Icelandic financial system.
N24|Bank on steel? Joint-stock banks and the rationalization of the British interwar steel industry|This study investigates the impact of joint-stock banks on the rationalization of the British interwar steel industry. A new panel data set of steel firm characteristics covering 1920–1938 is used to document rationalization and bank involvement, including interlocking directorships, with both found to be more extensive than previously thought. A set of all potential amalgamation pairs is created and used in a logit analysis of the determinants of mergers. Bank involvement with firms increased the probability that a particular merger occurred. Furthermore, mergers with bank involvement differed in their impact on profitability from those without.
N24|Financial Globalisation and the Spatial Limitations of the Financial-monetary Integration in the Euro Area|As countries of the world used large amounts of public funds to manage the 2008 financial crisis, public debt has risen to a critical level in many of them. Due to the drop in real economy, several countries faced unemployment and economic fallback that are still unresolved to this day. After the crisis, many were concerned how to restore the confidence in financial institutions and how banks can better contribute to sustainable social and economic growth. This paper discusses corporate social responsibility (CSR), an attitude putting ethical norms in the spotlight. The CSR pyramid distinguishes various layers of responsibilities. The first at the bottom is economic responsibility, serving as the foundation for the pyramid, however, companies also need to comply with legal norms. Ethical responsibility is the obligation to conduct in a fair way and to do the right thing. After the crisis, central banks in many countries became responsible for sustaining financial stability. To this end, central banks have developed their own corporate social responsibility strategies. This activity is studied from the view of how CSR can contribute to financial stability.
N24|Fraud and Financial Scandals: A Historical Analysis of Opportunity and Impediment|The paper presents a conceptual framework of financial fraud based on the historical interaction of opportunity and impediment. In the long run the character of opportunity is determined by the technical characteristics of assets and their unique, unknowable or unverifiable features. Impediment is promoted by consensus about the real value of assets, such that through active governance processes, fraudulent deviations from real value can be easily monitored. Active governance requires individuals in positions of responsibility to exercise a duty of care beyond merely being honest themselves. Taking a long run historical perspective and reviewing a selection of British financial frauds and scandals, from the South Sea Bubble to the Global Financial Crisis, the paper notes the periodic occurrence of waves of opportunity and the evolutionary response of passive governance mechanisms.

N24|Financial Market Regulation in Germany - Capital Requirements of Financial Institutions|This paper examines capital adequacy regulation in Germany. The first part reviews capital adequacy regulation from the 1930s up to the financial crisis and identifies two main trends: a gradual softening of the eligibility criteria for equity and increasing reliance on internal risk models. While the first trend has been reversed following the financial crisis, internal risk models still play a central role. Therefore, the second part discusses the problems with the use of internal risk models and discusses the potentials of Basel 2.5 and Basel III to alleviate the identified problems. It is concluded that the relevant problems are not resolved. Therefore, in the final part some suggestions of how the problems could be addressed properly are given.
N24|Corporate Motives For Public Shares Offering During The Financial Crisis|Despite greater constraints for obtaining bank loans, public shares’ offerings ceased in the SEE region since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008. With scarce IPOs and SEOs as well as debt offerings, Croatian capital market stands as prime example of mandatory shares’ listing rule application. Surveys of CFOs on going-public vs staying-private decisions are rare even in developed countries and are mostly conducted during the hot IPO markets. In this paper the motives of shares’ issuance are compared between publicly- and privately-held companies during the financial crisis. Research results showed that companies would not issue shares to the public to raise funds for their investments and growth.
N24|Historical Aspects, Traditions and Statistical Gaps. The German Economy versus the Romanian Economy|This paper reveals some historical aspects and some common traditions of German and Romanian economies, justifying some of the trends of contemporary decades underlying the statistical gap. The specific method used in this article is a statistical confrontation based on historical variables and statistical data, graphs emphasizing the abnormalities in evolution, etc. After a brief introduction, inside the major part of the structure of this paper some selected economic and social evolutions are presented together for both German and Romanian economies, somehow becoming the limits of the European Union construction. Few general gaps of the two economic marginal models as performance and cohesion are detailed during the historical and statistical investigation and the conclusions anticipates some expectations in the medium term dynamics of these economies. At the same time the article discusses Berlin’s position within EU and argues that Germany remains a selective continental hegemon, bent on securing national primacy and profit more than generating win-win solutions for its neighbours.

When the Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, Polish entrepreneurs realized that financing their companies’ operations only with the use of credit, even if contracted from different sources, might not be the best idea. Consequently, Polish business turned to debt instruments – said Piotr Kowalski, one of the keynote speakers during the mBank - CASE Seminar no. 136. In the publication, which is an extended and authorized version of presentations delivered during the abovementioned seminar, the authors discuss various aspects of the corporate debt securities market in Poland. Piotr Kowalski gives a synthetic presentation of the subject of the analysis, Agieszka Gontarek presents selected domestic regulations and factors, and Tomasz Ga³ka writes about selected consequences of excessive burdens.
N24|An Assessment of Direct and Indirect Liabilities of Polish Banks Ad 2015 (Bezpoœrednie I Poœrednie Obci¹¿enia Polskich Banków Ad 2015. Próba Inwentaryzacji I Pomiaru Niektórych Z Nich)|The present document is an attempt at a comprehensive analysis of direct and indirect burdens imposed upon banks in 2015. The idea to present such factors — which are often extremely varied in nature — in a single study was born out of the fact that these factors are often considered separately, on the basis of various criteria, which causes them to be split into different groups. This approach results in a fairly common tendency for fragmentary assessment of their impact and, more importantly, in the adoption of piecemeal regulations which fail to take into account the full impact of the actions taken in different areas. This applies in equal measures to supervisory authorities, regulators, analysts, policymakers and the media, which means that, in a somewhat oversimplified sense, the above statement is applicable to the public at large. This situation can be most succinctly characterised in the manner presented below. In the aftermath of the crisis, banks require a new set of instruments to regulate the functioning thereof. This is because they are to become more stable, safe, less risk-prone and more customer-friendly. Each of these areas requires a separate set of regulatory instruments, along with the respective subgroups thereof. Oftentimes they are not synchronised with each other and are usually aimed at the implementation of a specific, particular goal to an excessive extent. In addition, there are also “special tasks” such as the reform of the Credit and Saving Unions (SKOK).
N24|La producción oleícola del Aljarafe según el diezmo del almojarifazgo de Sevilla (siglo XV)|This article reconstructs olive oil production in the main olive-growing region of Seville (Aljarafe) during the fifteenth century, using the olive oil tithe records. This particular tax belonged to the Castilian Crown, even though it was established during the Islamic period. The sources for this study include tax data from the Crown Treasury of Castile (at the Archivo General de Simancas) and original tax collection files from the Municipal Archives of Seville. The article questions the supposed increase in olive oil production that other scholars hold to be the cause of tax revenue increases. To test this increase, oil tithes and other taxes have been compared here. This leads to the conclusion that the rising oil tax revenues were not due to an increase in oil production, but to an improvement in tax administration and the Monarchy’s efforts to reduce fiscal fraud, when the political conflicts that hampered tax-collection and favoured the latter were over.

To assess informational efficiency, this paper performs weak-form efficiency tests on the most liquid bond traded in Italy during the war. Surprisingly, the bond market is informationally efficient even in this repressed environment. In this regard, econometrical techniques aimed at signalling important historical events and the beliefs of contemporaries regarding the outcome of war may provide correct insights even in highly controlled markets.
N24|What makes banking crisis resolution difficult? Lessons from Japan and the Nordic Countries|Banking crisis resolution is often a long-lasting process with large fiscal and social costs. We ask which difficulties authorities face when choosing and implementing resolution packages. We survey the literature analyzing the impact of single resolution instruments on moral hazard and fiscal costs. We argue that no best-practice resolution package exists and that the implementation of a package is subject to coordination failures. Since crisis resolution packages are country-specific, we follow a case-study approach and describe how regulators in Japan and the Nordic countries during the 1990s solved their financial crises. We identify several obstacles the authorities in these countries were faced with and analyse their crisis resolution in the context of moral hazard and fiscal costs. Finally, we use these lessons to reassess the policy reactions in the US and in Europe during the recent financial crisis. Copyright Eurasia Business and Economics Society 2015

They re-examine cash flows and challenge our interpretation of this particular contractâ€™s profitability. A closer look reveals that the alleged differences between their and our calculations simply reflect the use of conservative assumptions on our part, which systematically biased estimates of profitability downwards â€“ as good scholarship requires if one is to argue that high profits were one of the main reasons why people lent to Philip II. We also question their use and reading of archival documents, as well as their use of basic financial economics. Finally, we document a continuing pattern of academic misconduct, including plagiarism, the misrepresentation of our findings, and the complete fabrication of a quote in order to discredit our work.

N24|South-Eastern European monetary and economic statistics from the nineteenth century to WWII|This paper introduces the Data Collection Task Force of the South-East European Monetary History Network (SEEMHN DCTF) and its first result. Good policy making should be grounded on good data. To this end, the SEEMHN DCTF works since 2006 towards establishing a SEE macro history database of 19th and 20th century key financial and monetary statistics. All task force members acknowledge that this goal could only be achieved by joining forces and through the exchange of knowledge and experience. Therefore, the SEEMHN DCTF involved cooperation between representatives from all SEE national central banks and scholars who specialise in different fields, geographical regions and time periods. Its first result concerns a new statistics publication entitled South-Eastern European Monetary and Economic Statistics from the Nineteenth Century to World War II. It contains a newly compiled, built and harmonised dataset of long-run key monetary and macroeconomic time series. The aim of this paper is threefold. First, we briefly present this new statistical database. Second, we discuss techniques and technology followed in the data compilation and building process, as well as archives and published sources used. Third, we briefly present the new data project on which the SEEMHN will keep working in the near future.

N24|Equity premium in Finland and long-term performance of the Finnish equity and money markets|Using new monthly series collected together for the first time for Finland, this paper analyses the performance and development of the Finnish equity and money markets as well as the equity premium and inflation from 1912 to 2009. The series are analyzed and compared to similar series from Sweden and USA. Continuously compounded nominal returns in Finland have been high, 12.91 and 6.44 % per annum for the stock and money markets, respectively. However, taking into account the high annual average inflation rate of 7.77, the Finnish market has provided clearly lower real returns than the US market. On the other hand, the equity premium, 10.14 % per annum, is found to be comparable to that of the United States (9.35 %) and higher than that in Sweden (6.01 %) using an approach similar to Mehra and Prescott (Handbook of the economics of finance, vol 1B. Financial Markets and Asset Pricing, North Holland, 2003). Finally, our empirical evidence suggests that as the Finnish stock market has matured, it shows an increasing degree of informational efficiency while at the same time becoming more intertwined with international markets.
N24|The Savings Banks crises in Spain: When and How?|The present financial crisis has severely hit the Spanish savings banks sector. Of 45 savings banks in 2007 by the end of 2012 the number had dropped to only thirteen. Most of the institutions that have disappeared, have been consolidated into major groups, either by outright purchase by banks or as a result of merging operations among individual savings banks. The Bank of Spain and the Fund for Ordely Restructuring of the Banking Sector (FROB) have bailout seven savings banks or group of savings banks, and four of them have been nationalized. Moreover, nearly all merging operations have required the consumption of public resources, which in turn have increased the already large government budget deficit. First, the paper presents a short history of the savings banks crises, and shows that until very recently the sector has surmounted major crisis affecting the financial system. Their limited scope and scale, the principle of territoriality, and a prudent and conservative management avoided saving banks the financial turbulences suffered by the commercial and investment banks. Second, the paper reviews the causes of the current savings banks crisis and which have been the procedure and the cost of its resolution, which has required the astonishing figure of 60,000 million euros provided by the European Stability Mechanism.
N24|Empresariado, Iglesia y ahorro popular: las cajas de ahorro y Montes de Piedad de Castilla y León, 1841-2013|This paper makes an effort to analyze the evolution of the Castilla Leon savings banks from their founding up to the 2008 crisis. It is an attempt to precisely identify the historical causes that led these institutions to a situation of complete insolvency. The text argues that their submission to public authorities, who forced their profits to be used to meet the social investment needs of the State itself, excessive exposure to the real estate business and the war waged from 1990 onwards to capture deposits, all led these institutions to bankruptcy. Furthermore, the article shows the very different conception these entities had in the eyes of the Church and civil society, an aspect neglected in the Economic History of Spain.

N24|Descriptive analysis of the Finnish stock market : Part II|This paper continues the data collection procedure and analysis set forth in Nyberg and Vaihekoski (2009). A number of new time series that are commonly used in finance literature are collected, created, and analyzed for the first time. These series include, among others, monthly dividend yields and market capitalization values. The series are also compared with GDP to evaluate the overall role of the stock market in the Finnish economy. The value-weighted average dividend yield from 1912 to 1988 is 4.98%. The average stock market capitalization to GDP ratio is found to be 15.14%.

N24|Deja vu? The Greek crisis experience, the 2010s versus the 1930s. Lessons from history| The past Greek crisis experience is more or less terra incognita. In all historical empirical studies Greece is systematically neglected or included only sporadically in their cross-country samples. In the national literature too there is little on this topic. In this paper we focus on the Greek experience of the Great Depression and use it as a benchmark against which to assess the policy choices and constraints that Greece faces today, with the ultimate aim to draw policy lessons from history and warn against a repeat of the same outcome. The 1930s crisis episode is used as a useful testing ground to compare the two crises episodes, ‘then’ and ‘now’; detect differences and similarities, discuss the policy facts and assess the impact of policy pursued on output. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to study the Greek crisis experience over the two historical episodes and detect similarities and differences. Comparisons with the interwar period show that the current crisis of the Greek economy should be classified a great depression rather than a great recession and that the inability of the national authorities to credibly adhere to their commitment to a nominal anchor was at the root of the country’s failure.
N24|La construction progressive de l'avantage compétitif financier suisse (1914-1936)|This article aims at explaining how Switzerland succeeded in building a major competitive advantage in the financial sector. From a historical perspective, we show that the period 1914-1936 was decisive in Swiss monetary history, Switzerland moving from a status of minor international financial centre to a major place, with the development of very powerful actors like banks. Hence we highlight that if the banking and financial industry played an important role in this process, such a competitive advantage solidified durably only thanks to a national coalition around the conservation of the value of the Swiss franc. In particular, the industry of goods was at the core of such a coalition. The fetishism of the Swiss franc during this period appears to have been a decisive factor for the financial specialisation of Switzerland. Classification JEL: E58, E65, G21, N14, N24.
N24|Designing a Genuine EMU: Which “Unions” for EU and Eurozone?|The initial ‘framing’ (in the summer of 2012) of the ‘genuine EMU’ for the wider public suggested to design an entire series of ‘unions’. So many ‘unions’ are neither necessary nor desirable – only some are and their design matters. The paper critically discusses first the negative fall-out of the crisis for EMU, and subsequently assesses the fiscal and the banking unions as accomplished so far, without going into highly specific technical details. The assessment is moderately positive, although there is ample scope for further improvement and a risk for short-term turbulence once the ECB has finished its tests and reviews. What about the parade of other ’unions’ such as economic union, social union and political union? The macro-economic imbalances procedure (MIP) and possibly the ESRB have overcome the pre-crisis disregard of macro competitiveness. The three components of ‘economic union’ (single market, economic policy coordination and budgetary disciplines) have all been strengthened. The last two ‘unions’, on the other hand, would imply a fundamental change in the conferral of powers to the EU/ Eurozone, with drastic and possibly very serious long-run implications, including a break-up of the Union, if such proposals would be pushed through. The cure is worse than the disease. Whereas social union is perhaps easier to dismiss as a ‘misfit’ in the EU, the recent popularity of suggesting a ‘political union’ is seen as worrisome. Probably, nobody knows what a ‘political union’ is, or, at best, it is a highly elastic notion: it might be thought necessary for reasons of domestic economic reforms in EU countries, for a larger common budget, for some EU tax power, for (greater) risk pooling, for ‘symmetric’ macro-economic adjustment and for some ultimate control of the ECB in times of crisis. Taking each one of these arguments separately, a range of more typical EU solutions might be found without suggesting a ‘political union’. Just as ‘fiscal capacity’ was long an all-or-nothing taboo for shifting bank resolution to the EU level, now solved with a modest common Fund and carefully confined but centralised powers, the author suggests that other carefully targeted responses can be designed for the various aspects where seen as indispensable, including the political say of a lender-of-last-resort function of the ECB. Hence, neither a social nor a political union worthy of the name ought to be pursued. Yet, political legitimacy matters, both with national parliaments and the grassroots. National parliaments will have to play a larger role.
N24|Empleo y carreras laborales en el servicio de Correos de España, 1890-1935|This paper studies the organization of the internal labour market of postal services in Spain from 1890 to 1935. The paper discusses the evolution of total employment in relation to postal traffic and average nominal and real wages. The paper then analyses the operation of the internal labour market for civil servants. There is an unsurprising steep wage-age gradient, in line with theories of deferred compensation in large, service firms. Voluntary or disciplinary separations were extremely rare. A career in the postal services offered higher entry wages, a growing wage over the life cycle and a secure job until retirement. There were two downsides to pursuing a career in the postal services. Firstly, entry and promotion depended crucially on the expansion of total employment for administrative personnel, which in turn depended on the fiscal position of the state. Secondly, nominal wages were upward rigid in the event of inflationary episodes, leading to substantial deterioration of real wages during the years of WW1.
N24|The Price of Media Capture and the Debasement of the French Newspaper Industry During the Interwar|This paper develops a new insight enabling the empirical study of media capture: minority shareholders of newspapers and readers face similar risks. Both are adversely affected when corrupt insiders use the newspaper for personal profit and receive invisible revenues. This means that relevant data on influence and exploitation of newspaper has been hiding in plain sight in stock exchange or over-the-counter prices, since stock transactions reflect the value of this capture. Empirical data is consistent with increasing levels of looting in France during the 1930s. We provide a comparison with Britain and argue that Britain managed to protect its newspapers better.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N24|Financing utilities: How the role of the European Investment Bank shifted from regional development to making markets|In the face of continuing financial and economic crises, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has been criticized for being overly-conservative in its loans to Europe. Critics in particular have called on the EIB to vastly increase its investment in utilities as a counter-cyclical measure. To take stock and, in order to evaluate the role of the EIB in financing utilities over time, we compile and analyze an original database of all EIB utilities project loans from 1958 to 2004. We find the EIB started out by functioning as a regional development bank, prioritizing utilities finance in its members' poorer zones; however, energy crises in the 1970s marked a shift whereby the logic of EIB finance to utilities became more politically-oriented. By the 1980s, utilities projects supported by the EIB were intimately related to those required for the Single Market. The origins of the EIB's current conservative approach to utilities loans was born in the 1970s and fully consolidated by the 1990s.
N24|The Swedish Financial System|This study investigates the evolution of the Swedish financial system since the 1980s. The concept of financialisation, with its different elements and perspectives, is used as a lens through which the key historical developments are analysed. The aim of the study is two-fold. First, by highlighting some unique country-specific features, it addresses the profound changes that have taken place in the Swedish financial system during the last decades in relation to the ‘rise and fall’ of the so-called ‘Swedish model’. Second, in doing so, the study considers the appropriateness and applicability of standard attempts to categorise financial systems according to the weight of banks versus markets, states versus markets and so forth. The picture that emerges from the Swedish example in particular shows the need to go deeper and beyond these classifications in order to obtain or more nuanced understanding of the increasing role of financial markets in developed countries.
N24|Financialisation and the Financial and Economic Crises: The Case of Sweden|This study on Sweden examines the Swedish financialisation process through the lens of the global financial crisis and the subsequent Eurozone sovereign debt crisis. The emphasis of the study is twofold. First, by acknowledging the rapid and widespread Swedish financialisation process, it traces the transformation of Sweden from a ‘debt-led consumption boom’ country towards an ‘export-led mercantilist’ regime. Second, by highlighting the country’s unique characteristics within such a classification, the study considers its ability to shield itself from some of the turbulence in the international financial markets following the recent crises. The outline of the report is as follows. Sections 1 and 2 provide a summary of key characteristics of the Swedish financialisation process since the 1980s. Section 3 studies the effects of the Swedish financialisation process in more detail by examining four channels in particular: investment, distribution, household consumption and the current account. Section 4 analyses the transmission mechanism of the global financial crisis and the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis vis-a-vis Sweden. Section 5 concludes.
N24|Financial Market Regulation in Germany - Capital Requirements of Financial Institutions|This paper examines capital adequacy regulation in Germany. After a general overview of financial regulation in Germany, the paper focuses on the most important development in the area of capital adequacy regulation from the 1930s up to the financial crisis. Two main trends are identified: a gradual softening of the eligibility criteria for regulatory equity and the increasing reliance on banks’ internal risk models for the determination of risk weights. The first trend has been reversed with the regulatory reforms following the financial crisis. Internal risk models still play a central role. The rest of the paper focuses on the problems with the use of internal risk models for regulatory purposes. The discussion includes the moral hazard problem, the technical problems with the models, the difference between economically and socially optimal capital requirements, the procyclicality of the models and the problem occurring due to the existence of fundamental uncertainty. The regulatory reforms due to Basel 2.5 and Basel III and their potential to alleviate the identified problems are then examined. It is concluded that those cannot solve the most relevant problems and that currently the use of models for financial regulation is problematic. Finally, some suggestions of how the problems could be addressed are given.
N24|Role and impact of different types of financial institutions on economic performance and stability of the real sector in selected EU member states|The purpose of this report is to analyse the impact of the financial sector on the real sector of the economy in the selected old (France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom) and new (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland) EU member states. The specific objectives are: 1. Analysis of the influence of financial institutions on financing the real economy. 2. Identification of sectoral and national differences in the financial sectors and consequences of these divergences for the real sectors in analysed countries. In order to accomplish this target, extensive research is undertaken. It encompasses the analysis of types of financial institutions functioning in the selected EU member states. Linkages between different types of financial institutions and the real sector of the economy are identified and described, and differences in impact of the financial sector on the real sector of the economy in the analysed EU member states are recognized. Finally, comparative analysis of evolution of structure of financial sector and driving forces in the process of its evolution in selected countries and group of countries is presented. Conducted analysis allowed formulating many remarks. Among them, the most important appears to be that the proper regulatory environment is crucial to prevent negative influence of financialisation on the real sector of the economy. Public authorities should be more proactive in creating a financial sector able to reconcile the private financial institutions striving for profit with interests of the real sector and of general public ones. To achieve this target public authorities should, on the one hand, effectively regulate and supervise all financial institutions, and, on the other, create favourable conditions for development of other than private-owned profit-oriented financial institutions. Policy goals should include promoting both competition and plurality. Competition is necessary for efficient functioning of financial institutions. Plurality, by protecting diversity of financial sectors, builds up systemic trust and helps maintaining the stability of this sector. Efficient, but less oligopolistic market structures within the framework of prudential regulation should enforce financial sectors’ stability in the analysed countries. Therefore, optimum regulatory structures should be aimed at the protection of the diversity within the framework of harmonization of financial sectors within the EU.
N24|Financial Regulation in Hungary|The paper aims to study the evolution of the financial regulation and supervision in Hungary from 1987, the year when the foundations of the two-tier banking system were laid. After a brief overview of the history of the Hungarian financial system we turn our attention to the history of the financial regulation. We investigate systematically the main areas of the national financial regulation and discuss the implementation of the financial directives of the European Union in Hungary. Our analysis on the development of the Hungarian legal system concludes that it is almost fully harmonized with the European legislation.
N24|Pierre Quesnay (1895-1937) from the League of Nations to the Franc Poincaré: Financial Discipline and Monetary Pragmatism|In a 1958 article, Pierre Dieterlen refers to a 'triumvirate' in order to qualify the team formed in France during the Poincaré stabilization by Emile Moreau, Governor of the Banque de France (BDF), Charles Rist, Professor at La Sorbonne and Deputy-Governor and Pierre Quesnay, his former PhD student, Head of the Department of the Economic Studies and Chief Adviser of the BDF. Pierre Quesnay is the youngest of the trio and has been quite neglected by the historians until the recent paper of Olivier Feiertag (2009) on the Monetary Internationalism during the Inter-War period. From the end of the war in 1918 until 1937, the short life of Pierre Quesnay is fully concerned by the monetary disorders generated by the suspension of the Gold Standard, the difficulties to find alternative monetary solutions, and the management of the monetary consequences of the Great Depression. Building mainly on the Quesnay's papers of the Archives Nationales, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effective contribution of the young money doctor to the monetary stabilization process of the interwar period.

N24|How did the capital market evaluate Germany’s prospects for winning World War I? Evidence from the Amsterdam market for government bonds|This study uses prices for the German 3 percent imperial loan issued in several tranches since 1890 and still traded during World War I to measure capital market players’ real-time perceptions of the prospects for Germany as the war proceeded. Price data are gathered from the Amsterdam market for government bonds; the Netherlands remained neutral throughout war. Focusing on the window from August 24th 1915 to August 11th 1919, ten (twelve) turning points are identified in a baseline (extended) model. Each implies a significant adjustment of lenders’ confidence in Germany being able, or willing, to service its debts in the future. Two turning points stand out. In early January 1916, the price plummeted by 14.3 percent between the first and eleventh of the month, which was most likely due to the Military Service Act discussed in the British parliament. On September 19th 1918, the price dropped by 17.5 percent compared to the last available price quote from the end of July. This coincides with the Allied Powers’ revival on all fronts since the summer, leading to the ultimate collapse of the German lines.
N24|State dissolution, sovereign debt and default: Lessons from the UK and Ireland, 1920-1938|"We study Ireland´s inheritance of debt following its secession from the United Kingdom at the beginning of the twentieth century. Exploiting structural differences in bonds guaranteed by the UK and Irish governments, we can identify perceived uncertainty about fiscal responsibility in the aftermath of the sovereign breakup. We document that Ireland´s default on intergovernmental payments was an important event. Although payments from the Irish government ceased, the UK government instructed its Treasury to continue making interest and principal repayments. As a result, the risk premium on the bonds the UK government had guaranteed fell to about zero. Our findings are consistent with persistent ambiguity about fiscal responsibility far-beyond sovereign breakup. We discuss the political and economic forces behind the Irish and UK governments´ decisions, and suggest lessons for modern-day states that are eyeing dissolution. ""Further, in view of all the historical circumstances, it is not equitable that the Irish people should be obliged to pay away these moneys"" - Eamon De Valera, 12 October 1932"
N24|Swedish stock and bond returns, 1856–2012|This chapter presents historical evidence about Swedish stock prices, dividends, and yields on government fixed-interest securities. Monthly returns are presented since 1901 for stocks, since 1874 for government long-term bonds and since 1856 for short-term Treasury bills or central bank discount rates. Annual stock price and returns indices from 1870 are also presented. Altogether, these series comprise the longest financial asset price database for Sweden to date. An important ambition is to provide information about the quality of the financial data, how they are constructed and how they are modified so as to ensure consistency across time. The chapter also outlines the basic institutional and economic framework of the Swedish stock and money markets. Research has shown that asset prices are influenced by the extent of trading activity as well as by the legal setting and microstructural characteristics. Finally, the chapter offers some initial analysis of the new evidence: calculation of returns for different periods, examination of trends and trend breaks in returns, dividends, volatility and cross-country returns correlations, and computation of equity risk premia across holding periods and historical eras.
N24|Growth in public finances as tool for control: Norwegian development 1850-1950|By drawing on information from public accounts from the nineteenth and twentieth century the present paper aims at mapping the development of key financial indicators for the Norwegian central government sector. It concludes that growth in the size of this sector often, but clearly not always, reflects political economy regimes. The paper concludes that persistant growth in public finances as tool for control over the economy did not take place before the introduction of the social-democratic regime in 1935.

N24|Las crisis bancarias en España: Una perspectiva histórica/Banking Crisis in Spain: A Historical Perspective|Este artículo analiza tres de las mayores crisis bancarias españolas de los siglos XIX y XX con el objetivo detectar posibles elementos específicos de la inestabilidad bancaria en España. Los resultados muestran que las características específicas de las crisis españolas están más relacionadas con la peculiar política monetaria seguida por España y con su distintiva dinámica histórica general que con factores propiamente financieros. La experiencia histórica sugiere la necesidad de ampliar y mejorar los mecanismos de supervisión financiera como la única forma de prevenir las crisis y, en todo caso, de minimizar sus consecuencias. This article discusses three of the largest Spanish banking crisis in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in order to detect possible specific elements of banking instability in Spain. The results show that the specific characteristics of the Spanish crisis are more related to the peculiar monetary policy followed by Spain and its distinctive historical dynamics than to financial factors. Historical experience suggests the need to expand and improve financial oversight mechanisms as the only way to prevent crisis and in any event to minimize its consequences.
N24|Contractual Freedom and the Evolution of Corporate Control in Britain, 1862 to 1929|British general incorporation law granted companies an extraordinary degree of contractual freedom to craft their own governance rules. It provided companies with a default set of articles of association, but incorporators were free to reject any part or all of the model and write their own rules instead. We study the uses to which incorporators put this flexibility by examining the articles of association filed by random samples of companies from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as well as by a sample of companies whose securities traded publicly. One might expect that companies that aimed to raise capital from external investors would adopt shareholder-friendly corporate governance rules. We find, however, that regardless of size or whether their securities traded on the market, most companies wrote articles that shifted power from shareholders to directors. We also find that there was little pressure—from the government, the financial press, shareholders, or the market—to adopt governance structures that afforded minority investors greater protection. Although there were certainly abuses, it seems that incorporators made an implicit bargain with investors that offered them the chance to earn high returns in exchange for their passivity. These findings have implications for the literature on corporate control, for the “law-and-finance” argument that corporate governance in common-law countries was more shareholder friendly than in civil-law countries, and for the debate about entrepreneurial failure in Britain during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
N24|Dodd-Frank and the Great Debate: Regulation vs. Growth|The history of regulation in America is as old as the republic itself. Since colonial times, Americans have struggled with the conflict between the desire for individual freedom and economic growth, and the need for rules and structure in a civil society. The evolution of the United States from a largely agrarian, libertarian society to one with strong industrial and consumer components that are regulated by the federal government has been greatly influenced by Progressive ideas, not only in financial services but in all aspects of economic life. The swing of public policy from periods of strict regulation to eras of greater permissiveness has enormous implications for economic growth. This paper examines the development of regulation in the US from the 19th century up to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) in 2010, from both a political and economic perspective.
N24|The EU’s Reformed Institutional Framework and the Way Forward|This article focuses on measures taken in 2012 and 2013 to reform the EU’s institutional framework. These measures, which were largely based on provisions included in the Treaty of Lisbon, have increased the role of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments. Stronger parliamentary involvement and interinstitutional agreements on democratic accountability seem to counter the theory of a lack of democratic legitimacy; legitimacy would appear to be jeopardized more severely by an emerging “social deficit.” At the same time, governance has become more complex, as the Community method of decision making was mixed with intergovernmental decision making in crisis management and prevention measures, and as variable membership patterns have evolved. By establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) for euro area countries and a facility for providing balance of payments assistance to non-euro area countries, the EU has set up permanent financial crisis management mechanisms. Fiscal governance reforms replicate the precrisis structure, and – as before – success depends on the commitment of Member States to implement reform measures. With more detailed reporting requirements and more ambitious timelines in the European Semester, economic governance has become more extensive. Yet European and Monetary Union (EMU) remains incomplete: By establishing a banking union, the EU Member States have transferred national sovereignty to the supranational level, but the reforms stop short of a fiscal union, for which the Treaty of Lisbon would need to be changed.
N24|A monthly stock exchange index for Ireland, 1864–1930|"This paper constructs new monthly Irish stock market price indices for 1864–1930. In addition to a total market index covering 118 equity securities issued by ninety-four companies, sectoral indices are presented for railways, financial services companies, and ""other"" companies. Nominal equity prices doubled between 1864 and 1898. Between the turn of the century and 1914, prices fell by 25 percent, in contrast to the price increases experienced on the London exchange. Overall, the average annual gain in equity prices over the period was just 0.9 percent. We speculate about the respective roles of Irish politics and international shocks in driving these trends."
N24|How have Europeans grown so tall?|Increases in human stature are a key indicator of improvements in the average health of populations. In this article I present and analyse a new data set for the average height of adult male birth cohorts, from the mid-nineteenth century to 1980, in 15 European countries. In little more than a century average height increased by 11 cm—representing a dramatic improvement in health. Interestingly, there was some acceleration in the period spanning the two world wars and the Great Depression. The evidence suggests that the most important proximate source of increasing height was the improving disease environment as reflected by the fall in infant mortality. Rising income and education and falling family size had more modest effects. Improvements in health care are hard to identify, and the effects of welfare state spending seem to have been small.
N24|Conflict and Social and Political Preferences: Evidence from World War II and Civil Conflict in 35 European Countries|This paper uses new micro-level evidence from a nationally representative survey of 39,500 individuals in 35 countries to shed light on how individual experiences of conflict shape political and social preferences. The investigation covers World War II and recent civil conflict. Overwhelmingly, the results point to the negative and enduring legacy of war-related violence on political trust and perceived effectiveness of national institutions, although the effects are heterogeneous across different types (external versus internal) and outcomes (victory versus defeat) of conflict. Conflict spurs collective action, but of a dark nature, one associated with further erosion of social and political trust.
N24|ICT the Nordic Way and European Savings Banks|This paper discusses the world industry of savings banks, a genuine world collaborative consortium, through which, from the 1950s, the International Savings Banks Institute (nowadays, the World Savings Banks Institute and European Savings Banks Group) was highly active in introducing ICT to retail banking. In this environment, Nordic savings banks, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, their Central Savings Banks and their industry associations occupied a separate place in European movements around developments of computerization and automation in retail financial services. The synergies in Nordic countries were superior to the rest of Europe and collaboration was intense. This paper highlights the leadership and the influence that the ICT development models of Nordic savings banks had on their European retail banking associates.
N24|Warfare at sea and profit: Corsairs, institutions and partnership companies|In the present paper we propose that in states with relatively weak central authorities, decision makers had to develop market oriented organisation solutions to successfully face a grave external threat, and these solutions proved to be efficient. Using an interdisciplinary approach that combines institutional theory, history and strategy, we analyse a case study, the use of corsairs (privateers) by England and the United Provinces (Dutch Republic) in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. We have found that the development of partnership companies went hand in hand for commercial and military purposes. English and Dutch privateers proved to be economically efficient and superior to the centrally planned war operations of the Spanish empire.
N24|Empirická analýza obchodování s opcemi na akcie Škodových závodů 1928-1938<BR>[An Empirical Analysis of Škoda Co. Equity Options Trading 1928-1938]|Recent findings have shown that the Prague Exchange featured a very active and developed stock options market right until its pre-war closure in September 1938. This paper follows up on extensive research into fragmentary archival resources, aggregating a unique collection of options quotations on the shares of Škoda, the dominant industrial firm and stock in Czechoslovakia. A rigorous review of contemporary literature has been complemented with an empirical analysis including implied volatility measurements, resulting in a detailed appraisal of the market. Even though statistical option-valuation models have already been available and generally known, these were not used by practitioners. Instead, a heuristic approach based on perfect familiarity with intrinsic valuation and hedging as well as time-value drivers, effectively used since the 19th century, has resulted in surprisingly efficient pricing, constrained - rather than by information assymmetries - primarily by transaction costs and, over a relatively brief period in 1932-33, by crisis-related liquidity issues in the market.
N24|Genetically Engineered Crops’ Authorizations in the US and the EU: a Struggle Against the Clock|The regulation of genetically engineered crops is important for society: ensuring their safety for humans and the environment.

N24|Is Art Really a Safe Haven? Evidence from the French Art Market During WWI|During crisis art is often considered as a safe haven both by the scientific literature and the financial advisors. For example, during WWII art markets encountered a massive boom in occupied countries This paper questions this vision of art as a safe investment providing evidence that art has not always supplied a safe investing way during crisis. To do so it constructs, on basis of an original database of 22,000 entries, an art price index for the French art market during WWI and the postwar period in France (1911-1925). The results show that the WWII boom mostly reflected the specificities of the occupation economy imposed by the Nazis. Indeed during WWI artworks underperformed gold, real-estate, bonds and stocks in terms of risk-return performances. This underperformance can be explained by several peculiarities of the market. Investors tended to prefer cheap artworks and old masters during WWI as these were less volatile at the time.

This large commercial bank adopted a new German-style universal banking business model from the early 1910s, sharing directors with the firms it financed as a means of controlling its interests. Then, in 1924, it required assistance from the Dutch state in order to survive a bank run brought on by public concerns over its close ties with Müller & Co., a trading conglomerate that suffered badly in the economic downturn of the early 1920s. Using a new narrative history combined with an interpretive model, this article shows how the interlocking directorates between the bank and this major client, and in particular the direction of influence of these interlocks, resulted in a conflict of interest that could not be easily overcome.
N24|Irish Land Bonds: 1891-1938| This paper introduces a new database on Irish land bonds listed on the Dublin Stock Exchange from 1891 to 1938: it outlines the nature of these bonds and presents data on their size, liquidity and market returns. These government-guaranteed bonds arose during a period when the possibility of Irish secession from the United Kingdom appeared ever more likely, and were used to finance the transfer of land ownership from landlords to tenants in Ireland (North & South). Movements in the prices of these bonds can help to understand how financial markets responded to events in the early economic and political history of the Irish Free State, including Irish partition, Independence, Civil War and de facto default. Understanding these issues has contemporary relevance for regions in Spain (Catalonia, Euskadi), Great Britain (Scotland) and Belgium (Flanders).
N24|Financial market regulation in Germany under the special focus of capital requirements of financial institutions|This paper examines capital adequacy regulation in Germany. After a short overview about financial regulation in Germany in general, the paper focuses on the most important development in the area of capital adequacy regulation from the 1930s up to the financial crisis. Two main trends are identified: a gradual softening of the eligibility criteria for regulatory equity and the increasing reliance on banks' internal risk models for the determination of risk weights. The first trend has been reversed with the regulatory reforms following the financial crisis. Internal risk models will still play a central role. The rest of the paper focuses on the problems with the use of internal risk models for regulatory purposes. The discussion includes the moral hazard problem, the technical problems with the models, the difference between economically and socially optimal capital requirements, the pro-cyclicality of the models and the problem occurring due to the existence of fundamental uncertainty. The regulatory reforms due to Basel 2.5 and Basel III and their potential to alleviate the identified problems are then examined. It is concluded that those cannot solve the most relevant problems and that currently the use of models for financial regulation is problematic. Finally, some suggestions of how the problems could be addressed are given.
N24|Financial mobilisation in Germany 1914-1918|The First World War was not only a military conflict, but also an economic war. In all belligerent countries labour and material resources were shifted from civilian production to war-related purposes, and a central planning system was established to organise production and distribution. In this context, financial mobilisation played an important role. In Germany, preparations for financial mobilisation began at the end of the nineteenth century. Since 1891 fiscal and monetary policies were designed for the eventuality of a war and became, with few modifications, the basis for the financial mobilisation implemented in August 1914. In accordance with the strategic planning of the time, fiscal and monetary policies were prepared for a short war. However, the fiscal and monetary instruments remained essentially unchanged when the conflict turned at the end of September 1914 into a long, grim war of attrition. The accumulated government debt and the suppressed inflation left a heavy burden to the post-war world. From March 1918 onwards plans for fiscal and monetary stabilization following the war were discussed, but they remained inconclusive. After the armistice of 11 November 1918 they were soon forgotten as the republican governments embarked on an inflationary reconstruction policy.
N24|The Balkan and Baltic experience of financial services privatization|The financial services sectors of Romania and Estonia moved towards privatization in sharply contrasting manners. For a long time Romania's enthusiasm for its 1998 promise to the IMF to privatize its leading banks was only a commitment on paper; few steps were made towards its fulfillment. By contrast, Estonia's experience of privatization was generally a positive one, based on norms and structures often comparable to those in advanced industrial economies.
N24|State dissolution, sovereign debt and default:Lessons from the UK and Ireland, 1920-1938|We study IrelandÕs inheritance of debt following its secession from the United Kingdom at the beginning of the twentieth century. Exploiting structural differences in bonds guaranteed by the UK and Irish governments, we can identify perceived uncertainty about fiscal responsibility in the aftermath of the sovereign breakup. We document that IrelandÕs default on intergovernmental payments was an important event. Although payments from the Irish government ceased, the UK government instructed its Treasury to continue making interest and principal repayments. As a result, the risk premium on the bonds the UK government had guaranteed fell to about zero. Our findings are consistent with persistent ambiguity about fiscal responsibility far-beyond sovereign breakup. We discuss the political and economic forces behind the Irish and UK governmentsÕ decisions, and suggest lessons for modern-day states that are eyeing dissolution.
N24|La opción tecnológica de las cajas de ahorro españolas antes de Internet, circa 1950-1995|La tecnología en la banca minorista ha tenido profundas repercusiones en su competitividad como empresa y en el conjunto del sector. Se plantean 2 objetivos: por un lado, analizar el papel desempeñado por la tecnología con relación al cambio organizativo y a los productos y servicios ofertados por las cajas; por otro, investigar la influencia recíproca entre la tecnología y su uso en la banca minorista. Las cajas constituyen un excelente caso de estudio debido a que incorporaron intensivamente tecnología, especialmente a partir de los años 60. La mecanización de las operaciones, la informatización de la gestión y el establecimiento de redes de transferencia de datos tuvieron un excepcional desarrollo. Fue la industria bancaria, antes que otros sectores, quien estimuló la demanda de algunas tecnologías informáticas, lo que constituye un factor idiosincrásico respecto a otros países.

N24|Dzialalnosc Panstwowego Banku Rolnego w Generalnej Guberni/The Activity of the National Bank of Agriculture in the General Government|In this article we try to estimate the activity of the banking institution in the General Government which used the pre-war apparatus of The National Bank of Agriculture. The bank was one of the largest banks realising the aim delineated by the government of the Second Polish Republic, such as the support of agricultural reform in the mid-war period. German authorities in the General Government used assets of the bank for other tasks. They were eager to use The National Bank of Agriculture and the Polish staff employed in the bank in order to liquidate fast and effectively the mid-war assets of the bank. Leaving The National Bank of Agriculture was also good for Polish staff in the bank. Raising pre-war debts was the only way to guarantee salary and pensions for the employees of the National Bank of Agriculture and taking care of them in the hard life of occupation. The activity of the National Bank of Agriculture in the General Government was also profitable for a part of debtors as they could pay the pre-war credits earlier. One reason for agriculture farms becoming poorer and even ruined was war actions and the occupation. However, the farmers could save money and gather capital more easily. When they often sold food in secret, they got a large amount of money. In many cases, paying back the pre-war debt was the only reasonable way of getting rid of almost valueless money, although it did not mean that it was done without doubts. In the beginning, many people claimed that they would give it back to whom they had borrowed from. However, after a while the patriotism of farmers who were debtors was overcome by the willingness to have no debts and leave children in a new condition. The period of German occupation and increasing inflation was used for paying back the debt in valueless money, not only by farmers but also by owners of the large mansions such as Earl Adam Branicki.
