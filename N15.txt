N15|Trade in the Shadow of Power: Japanese Industrial Exports in the Interwar years|During the interwar years, Japanese industrialisation accelerated alongside the expansion of industrial exports to regional markets. Trade blocs in the interwar years were used as an instrument of imperial power to foster exports and as a substitute for productivity to encourage industrial production. The historiography on Japanese industrialisation in the interwar years describes heavy industries’ interests in obtaining access to wider markets to increase economies of scale and reduce unit costs. However, this literature provides no quantitative evidence that proves the success of those mechanisms in expanding exports. In this paper we scrutinise how Japan—a relatively poor country—used colonial as well as informal power interventions to expand regional markets for its exports, especially for the most intensive human capital sector of the industrializing economy.
N15|Productivity, structural change and skills dynamics: Evidence from a half century analysis in Tunisia and Turkey|This article explores the contribution of structural change and the skill upgrading of the labor force to productivity in Tunisia and Turkey in the institutional context of the post-World War II period. Our growth decomposition shows that productivity is mainly explained by intra-industry changes for both countries during the import substitution period. Structural change played an important role in Turkey for a longer period of time than in Tunisia. Based on an instrumental variable regression setting, we find evidence that overall, the change in the share of high-educated workers had a causal impact on productivity levels in Turkey, but no such relation was found in Tunisia. Secondly, we show that this productivity increase has mainly been driven by the reallocation of higher educated labor between sectors rather than the absorption of highly educated workers within sectors. In Tunisia we do not find evidence of links between education demand and productivity. Moreover, the evidence from the instrumental variable regressions show that when we exclude the government sector in Tunisia, the overall skills upgrading is negatively associated with productivity growth, suggesting a downward return to educated labor demand over time.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N15|Economic experiences of Japanese civilian repatriates in Hiroshima prefecture, 1945-1956|After World War II, more than six million people returned to Japan from various parts of the former Japanese empire. Most studies of Japanese postwar repatriation have focused on the repatriation policies of the Allied powers and the Japanese government, the repatriation process between 1945 and 1956, and postwar memories of repatriates. In contrast, the economic experiences of repatriates in the postwar era have yet to be studied. This paper uses a large-scale national survey of repatriates’ postwar lives conducted by the Japanese government in 1956, focussing more specifically on approximately 110,000 civilian repatriates living in Hiroshima prefecture in 1956. The findings of this research contrast with prevailing suggestions that repatriates were totally neglected by the Japanese government and society. Instead, this research demonstrates that in Hiroshima prefecture, repatriates’ postwar job placement was facilitated by employment in agriculture, public sector employment, and the transferable skills possessed by some repatriates. The information from the 1956 government survey shows that approximately 60 per cent of repatriates fell in these categories, while the remaining 40 per cent found employment in new areas or became unemployed. Research on repatriates in other prefectures (Ibaraki, Osaka, and Kanagawa) shows a similar trend. As a result, despite the scale of the repatriation, the settlement was broadly successful. It can be argued that this type of transition helped to bring political and economic stability, which became a foundation of Japan’s postwar economic recovery.

N15|Japan and the Asian Divergence: Market Integration, Climate Anomalies and Famines during the 18th and 19th Centuries|This paper asks whether better integration of rice markets in Japan during the 19th and 20th centuries compared to China and India explains the ‘Little Divergence’ in Asia and Japan’s role in the ‘Great Divergence’. It analyses rice prices for 13 markets across Japan during 1720-1857 and finds that Japan had relatively well-integrated rice markets, particularly western Japan. In eastern Japan market integration was partially impeded by distance to Osaka, which was the core market, and the greater ecological vulnerability of rice in northeast Japan to lower temperatures during the ‘little ice age’ that lasted until the mid-19th century. Relatively well-integrated markets did not prevent major famines during 1732-1733, 1783-1786, and 1833-1838, because stocks and supplies were insufficient to withstand the consequences of sequences of crop failures. Better integration of rice markets is indicative of higher allocative efficiency of markets in Japan which is a likely reason that ‘shrinking’ episodes caused fewer setbacks in long-term economic growth compared to in China and India.
N15|Long-term Trends in Gross Domestic Expenditure in Indonesia: Provisional Estimates|This paper seeks to overcome the fact that historical estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Indonesia are currently only available in constant prices. Using the expenditure approach it offers new estimates of Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE), the equivalent of GDP, in current prices. The paper anchors the estimates on Indonesia’s Input-Output (I-O) Tables available for benchmark years between 1969 and 2010, which reveal that until 1995 Indonesia’s official national accounts underestimated GDP and GDE. The paper combines corrections based on the I-O Tables with additional sources to present provisional new estimates of GDE in current prices for 1870-1941 and 1948-1995. It then analyses the composition of GDE, noting the generally modest proportions of discretionary public expenditure and capital formation, particularly during 1870-1913 and 1948-1966.
N15|Tax Incentives for Investment: Evidence from Japan's High-Growth Era|Tax devices have occasionally been adopted as policy tools to promote economic growth in major industrialized countries after the Second World War. In Japan, various accelerated depreciation schemes under the name 'special depreciation' were employed as major devices to stimulate investments. In this paper, we manually collect firm-level data series in the heyday of the device from the mid-1950s to the early 1970s. The findings from firm-level data are as follows: the aggregated special depreciation hit two peaks when the schemes were expanded, applying special depreciation tax incentives prevailed among listed companies, and the actual amounts varied across firms with strong upward biases. A detailed examination of each firm's financial statements indicates that each firm retained its discretion when applying the scheme and sometimes chose not to enjoy the full benefits. An empirical analysis reveals that firms with relatively less capital to labor tended to use larger special depreciation, hinting at the probability of intended effects of policy devices. Increases in the number of designated machines for the scheme- once considered to represent its inefficiency-actually activated the usage of schemes by firms.

N15|The Biological Standard of Living in China during the 20th Century: Evidence from the Age at Menarche|This paper uses the mean age at menarche as an indicator of changes in the standard of living in China during the tumultuous 20th century. It discusses the difficulties of using this indicator in terms of the quality of the available data, the processing the basic data, and the interpretation of the results. The paper finds that the mean age at menarche in China stagnated at 16 to 17 years for women born during the 1880s-1930s, although it also finds decreases in some urban areas, such as Beijing and Shanghai, indicative of an improving standard of living. The mean age at menarche increased for 1940s birth cohorts, in part due the negative effects of the China-Japan war and the civil war in the 1940s, but also the famine of 1959-1962 that affected these cohorts during puberty. The mean age at menarche decreased in a sustained way for women born during the 1950s to the early 2000s, to a level of 12.1 in 2000-03. This decrease preceded the acceleration of economic growth in the 1980s. Increased educational attainment since the 1940s explains much of the decrease in the age at menarche, ahead of improvements in nutrition, hygiene and healthcare.
N15|What Drives China's Growth? Evidence from Micro-level Data|This paper discusses the sustainability of China fs rapid growth mainly based on the estimation of the corporate-level total factor productivity of Chinese listed firms. Since the 1980s, both capital accumulation and rapid technological progress -- measured as total factor productivity (TFP) -- have contributed to the high growth of the Chinese aggregate output. Should the prediction of the standard growth theory be correct, however, economic growth led by capital accumulation is not likely to be long lasting, hence we mainly focus on firm level TFP growth. As a result, we identify four channels that would continue to promote the TFP growth of the Chinese corporate sector at an aggregate level: (i) declining proportion of low-productivity state-owned enterprises, (ii) continuous influx of highly competent new start-ups, (iii) broad catching up trend among the laggards in the firm distribution, and (iv) innovation spawning R&D activities. These four channels would underpin the medium-term economic growth of the Chinese economy.
N15|Assessing monetary policy targeting regimes for small open economies|This paper quantifies the performance of five monetary policy regimes in controlling macroeconomic volatility triggered by a variety of supply, demand and external shocks in small open economies. While the proposed macroeconomic model is generic, the application is to the case of Sri Lanka. The investigated regimes separately target the exchange rate, a monetary aggregate, nominal GDP, the CPI inflation rate and a Taylor composite of output gaps and inflation. The results suggest that inflation targeting offers the least macro-economic volatility overall. Consistent with earlier research and Mundell’s financial trilemma, its stabilising power is greatest under demand and external shocks, which have grown more prominent as product and financial markets have opened.
N15|Inequality in colonial India|A view popular in Indian economic history scholarship claims that the institutional and commercial policy of British India made the rich Indians richer and the poor poorer during colonial rule. The paper shows that the evidence to support the conjecture is weak. Missing data on peasant income makes it hard to generalize on aggregate trends in inequality. But the evidence does question the role of state policy behind trends in inequality. An alternative account starts from the distinction between land-dependent and trade-dependent occupations. The open economy of the nineteenth century affected these two spheres differently. Low and stagnant land-productivity limited the average return that accrued to land-dependent occupations. Occupations directly or indirectly dependent on trading could escape the constraint partially.
N15|The Silver Standard as a discipline on money over-issuance: The mechanism of paper money in Yuan China|"""The Yuan was the first dynasty both in Chinese and world history to use paper money as its sole medium of circulation, and also established the earliest silver standard. This paper explores the impact of paper money in Yuan China. We find that: (1) At the beginning of its regime, due to the strict constraints of the silver standard on money issuances, the value of paper money was stable. (2) Since the middle stage of the dynasty, the central government had to finance fiscal deficits by issuing more paper money, and inflation was thus unavoidable. Our empirical results also demonstrate that fiscal pressure from multiple provincial rebellions was the most important factor driving the government to issue more paper money; however, the emperor’s largesse, which had been viewed as another source of fiscal deficits by most traditional historians, had no significant effect on the over-issuance of paper money. (3) When the monetary standard switched from silver to paper money, the impact of fiscal deficits, which were driving more paper money issuances, became much more severe. Based on these findings, we argue that the experience of Yuan China verified that metal standards could serve as a discipline on paper money over-issuances. This episode in Yuan China predates the money over-issuances observed during the era of the classic gold standard found in western countries by six centuries."""
N15|Circle of Fortune: The Long Term Impact of Western Customs Institutions in China|This paper studies the persistent impact of good institutions on economic development in China. By exploiting a British-driven institutional switch in part of China's customs stations in 1902, I find that counties that were more affected by the British customs institutions are also better developed today. Moreover, I show that the institutional switch was exogenous to the pre-colonial development, and I provide different estima- tion models to reveal a robust and causal relationship between good institutions and economic development.
N15|Comment Israël a évité l’hyperinflation ? Le succès du plan de stabilisation (1985) à la lumière de la théorie post-keynésienne|Adoptant un cadre post-keynésien, l’article analyse le processus inflationniste à l’œuvre de 1948 jusqu’aux années 1980 pour, d’une part, comprendre les origines de la quasi hyperinflation du 1er semestre 1985 et, d’autre part, saisir la réussite du plan de stabilisation intervenu lors de l’été de cette même année. En 1985 le shekel semble devoir être complètement rejeté par ses utilisateurs au profit du dollar, ce qui, dans le contexte fortement inflationniste d’alors, aurait dû engendrer une hyperinflation. Ce résultat est provoqué par la conjonction de plusieurs facteurs : la virulence historique du conflit de répartition, la présence de mécanismes d’indexation et la fragilité des comptes extérieurs marqués par un déficit courant structurel. Le plan de stabilisation, soutenu par l’aide financière importante des États-Unis, permet d’atténuer immédiatement la contrainte de financement externe et parvient à affaiblir durablement la virulence du conflit de répartition, écartant ainsi les risques hyperinflationnistes. L’analyse de cette trajectoire historique confirme la cohérence théorique de l’analyse post-keynésienne de l’hyperinflation.
N15|Le mode de production asiatique et la Chine. Retour sur la pertinence d'un concept biaisé|Proposed in 1859 by Karl Marx in onder to characterize India, the concept of an Asiatic mode of production was widened to explain the whole Asia stagnation in the 19th century. Severely criticized for political reasons during the 20th century, its economic relevance was rarely put into question. Indeed, in China's case, economic growth is frequently impeded by local governments actions, what could, at least in part, rehabilitate Marx's analysis.
N15|The Biological Standard of Living in Indonesia during the 20th Century: Evidence from the Age at Menarche|This paper analyses long-term changes in the mean age at menarche (MAM) as a biological indicator of changes in the standard of living in Indonesia. It finds that MAM was about 15.5 for birth cohorts in the late-19th century, decreasing to 14.5 by the 1930s, at which level it stagnated until the gradual decrease resumed since the early 1960s to around 12.5 in the mid-2000s. The paper considers that long-term improvements in nutrition, educational attainment and health care explain these trends. An international comparison of long-term changes finds that MAM in Indonesia was much lower than in Korea and China until respectively 1970 and 1990, but comparable to Japan until 1950 and to Malaysia until 1930. The paper presents reasons why these differences are unlikely to be related to dissimilarities in climate and ethnicity, and concludes that they are indicative of relative standards of living.
N15|The boundaries of central bank independence: Lessons from unconventional times|What institutional arrangements for an independent central bank with a price stability mandate promote good policy outcomes when unconventional policies become necessary? Unconventional monetary policy poses challenges. The large scale asset purchases needed to counteract the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates have uncomfortable fiscal and distributional consequences and require central banks to assume greater risks on their balance sheets. Lack of clarity on the precise definition of price stability, coupled with concerns about the legitimacy of large balance sheet expansions, hinders policy: It encourages the central bank to eschew the decisive quantitative easing needed to reflate the economy and instead to accommodate too-low inflation. The experience of the Bank of Japan's encounter with the zero lower bound suggests important benefits from a clear definition of price stability as a symmetric 2% goal for inflation, which the Bank adopted in 2013.
N15|Black Market Prices during World War II in Japan: An Estimate Using the Hedonic Approach|This paper constructs a time series of data related to black- market prices of five goods (rice, sweet potatoes, potatoes, chicken eggs and sugar) during World War II (WWII) in Japan. It is the first attempt to capture the actual price fluctuation trends for individual products throughout the period during and after WWII. To this end, I have employed the hedonic approach, which is a methodology used to adjust for the quality of goods including the characteristics of counterparties and places of transaction in constructing the price data, to obtain estimates that are as unbiased as possible. The data reveals that 1) black-market prices of these goods soared during WWII to post 40-80 percent inflation on a quarterly basis toward the end of the war, 2) by the end of the war, black-market prices had already increased by over 50 times (in the case of sweet potatoes) or 700 times (in the case of sugar) compared with 1934 levels, prior to wartime inflation, indicating more severe inflation during the war than after the war, 3) the most severe period of inflation varied by product, peaking during the war for rice and sugar and after the war for sweet potatoes, potatoes and chicken eggs, and 4) black- market prices were generally higher in urban areas than in rural areas.
N15|The Impact of Government Spending on GDP in a Remitting Country|The literature on remittances is large and growing. However, its focus has mainly been on the effects of remittance inflows on the receiving economies. Little has been done on the sending economies. In this paper, we use data from Saudi Arabia, one of the top remitting countries in the world, to identify the impact of government spending on Saudi Arabia's real output considering the role of remittance outflows. The results suggest that remittance outflows have a weak effect, if at all, on government spending, which, in turn, has an insignificant impact on GDP. The paper discusses some policy implications.
N15|Social Capital and Innovation - Can Social Trust Explain the Technological Innovation of the High-performing East Asian Economies?|The economic success and innovative outcomes of the high performing East Asian countries, albeit often characterized as low-trust societies, suggests reexamination of the presumed positive relationship between social trust and innovation. Multi-level analyses conducted in this paper reveal that the role of social capital in innovation is different in East Asia. Shared social norms such as growth primacy and reciprocity and values of accepting competition and performance-based incentives are the most essential driving-force of innovation in the East Asian countries, whereas social trust does not play a positive role there. The importance of the shared social norms and collective goals can be explained by the prominent role of the state in the East Asian development.
N15|Southeast Asia in the global economy: a selective analytical survey|This paper selectively surveys Southeast Asian economic development over the past half-century and anticipates some of the region’s challenges if it is to progress to the ranks of developed countries. In the long sweep of development, three key features stand out. First, the region’s “initial conditions” in the early post-independence period appeared to be quite unfavorable. The literature at this time reflected the resulting pessimism. But, second, several countries belong to the very small group to have achieved historically unprecedented growth since the 1960s. The drivers of rapid growth remain contested. But the common feature has been a strong commitment to reasonably broad-based economic growth. Moreover, third, the propensity for growth in the region has spread as countries have progressively joined the regional and global mainstream. Policy regimes that favored outward orientation and prudent macroeconomic management have generally resulted in faster growth. The accurate forecasting of crises and growth decelerations has proven to be elusive, reinforcing the view that an eclectic, historical, and multi-disciplinary framework is necessary to understand the region’s long-term development dynamics.
N15|Asia's Third Giant: A Survey of the Indonesian Economy|This paper surveys the Indonesian economy and the drivers of socioeconomic development over the past half‐century. It highlights the country's rapid economic development in the face of unfavourable ‘initial conditions’. We examine episodes in economic development, in particular comparing and contrasting the two main sub‐periods, of high economic growth during the authoritarian Suharto era, 1966–98, and moderate economic growth during the democratic era since 1999. The paper emphasises the importance of sound macroeconomic management, economic openness, inclusive social progress and institutional development. For all the challenges that Indonesia faces, and its unfinished reform agenda, the major conclusion is one of development success, broadly defined.
N15|Monetary System of Georgia in XI-XII centuries and its Effect on Economic Activity|This works covers peculiarities of formation of Georgian monetary system in XI-XII centuries and their effect on the international financial and economic relations. In this works we have researched the matters of formation of monetary policy of feudal age and their effect on development of foreign trade, methods of money formation important for the present world, which correct choice may provide increase of production volume and economic activity. Currency policy, geopolitical and geostrategic localization proved the country to turn into one of the economically strong economic states with high standard of life, developed system of socioeconomic relations approached to the international standards and democratic institutions.
N15|Global silver: bullion or specie? Supply and demand in the making of the early modern global economy|In the early modern period the world economy gravitated around the expansion of long distance commerce. Together with navigation improvements silver was the prime commodity which moved the sails of such trade. The disparate availability of, and the particular demand for silver across the globe determined the participation of producers, consumers and intermediaries in a growing global economy. American endowments of silver are a known feature of this process; however, the fact that the supply of silver was in the form of specie is a less known aspect of the integration of the global economy. This chapter surveys the production and export of silver specie out of Spanish America, its intermediation by Europeans and the re-export to Asia. It describes how the sheer volume produced and the quality and consistency of the coin provided familiarity with, and reliability to the Spanish American peso which made it current in most world markets. By the 18th century it has become a currency standard for the international economy which grew together with the production and coinage of silver. Implications varied according to the institutional settings to deal with specie and foreign exchange in each intervening economy. Generalized warfare in late 18th century Europe brought down governance in Spanish America and coinage fragmented along with the political fragmentation of the empire. The emergence of new sovereign republics and the end of minting as known meant the cessation of the silver standard that had contributed to the early modern globalization.
N15|Vietnam's Low National Competitiveness: Causes, Implications and Suggestions for Improvement|The World Economic Forum's (WEF) annual assessment using the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) since 2006 shows that Vietnam’s national competitiveness has been relatively low. Globally, Vietnam has been in the middle of economies surveyed. Regionally, Vietnam has been in the middle of ASEAN countries. Regarding level of development, before 2015 Vietnam was in stage 1 (factor-driven), which includes ASEAN's less developed countries (Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar). Since 2015 Vietnam has shifted to a transition toward stage 2 (efficiency-driven), which includes Brunei and the Philippines. The country has lagged behind Indonesia and Thailand (in stage 2), Malaysia (in transition to stage 3) and Singapore (in stage 3, innovation-driven). To complement the WEF’s assessment, this study provides some in-depth analyses of main causes of Vietnam's low competitiveness. These are structural problems due to its factor-based growth model, expansionary policies to aid growth, slowly improved business environment, low R&D expenditure, low-quality higher education and under-developed infrastructure. The research also examines implications of these shortcomings for Vietnam. These are low productivity, diminishing GDP growth, middle income trap, macroeconomic instability, low business competitiveness, low technology level, low human capital quality and environmental degradation. Based on the analyses, policy measures are proposed to improve Vietnam’s competitiveness. Major suggestions include structural reforms to change the growth model from factor-based to productivity-based, raising technology level, enhancing human capital quality, improving business environment, ensuring macroeconomic stability, upgrading infrastructure and learning from advanced economies such as Korea.
N15|American Radical Economists in Maoâ€™s China: From Hopes to Disillusionment|American radical economists in the 1960s perceived China under Maoism as an important experiment in creating a new society, aspects of which they hoped could serve as a model for the developing world. But the knowledge of â€˜actually existing Maoismâ€™ was very limited due to the mutual isolation between China and the US. This paper analyses the First Friendship Delegation of American Radical Political Economists (FFDARPE) to the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China in 1972, consisting mainly of Union for Radical Political Economics (URPE) members, which was the first visit of a group of American economists to China since 1949. Based on interviews with trip participants as well as archival and published material, this paper studies what we can learn about the engagement with Maoism by American radical economists from their dialogues with Chinese hosts, from their on-the-ground observations, and their reflection upon return. We show how the visitorsâ€™ own ideas conflicted and intersected with their perception of the Maoist practice on gender relations; workersâ€™ management and life in the communes. We also shed light on the diverging conceptions of the role for economic expertise between URPE and late Maoism. As the first in-depth study on the FFDARPE we provide rich empirical insights into an ice-breaking event in the larger process of normalization in the Sino- U.S relations, that ultimately led to the disillusionment of the Left with China.

N15|The Samurai Bond: Credit Supply And Economic Growth In Pre-War Japan|While credit supply growth is associated with exacerbating financial crises, its impact on general economic activity and long run development are unclear. To identify a causal impact, we use bond payments to samurai in nineteenth century Japan as a quasi-natural experiment and exploit variation between regions. Our proxy for credit supply, samurai population shares, is positively associated with per capita levels of firm establishment and capital investment and average firm capital. Initial samurai population share affects output per capita in the short and long run only in regions with early access to railways, mainly through the tertiary sector. Our interpretation is that increased credit supply may have a positive and persistent impact on output if a region has productivity-enhancing investment opportunities.
N15|War, Migration and the Origins of the Thai Sex Industry|This paper analyzes the determinants behind the spatial distribution of the sex industry in Thailand. We relate the development of the sex industry to an early temporary demand shock, that is, US military presence during the Vietnam War. Comparing the surroundings of Thai military bases used by the US army to districts close to unused Thai bases, we find that there are currently five times more commercial sex workers in districts near former US bases. The development of the sex industry is also explained by a high price elasticity of supply due to female migration from regions affected by an agricultural crisis. Finally, we study a consequence induced by the large numbers of sex workers in few red-light districts: the HIV outbreak in the early 1990s.
N15|The Rise of a Financial Revolution in Republican China in 1900-1937: an Institutional Narrative|This paper surveys the phenomenal transformation of banking and finance, public debt and monetary regimes during 1900-1937, a period of great political instability in Chinese history. To understand why sectors which are often most vulnerable to the security of property rights and contract enforcement, have become the vanguard of growth in such an era of uncertainty, I highlight the role of institutions as seen in the form of a business dominated quasi-political structure that grew outside the formal political sphere. This structure rested on the institutional nexus of Western treaty ports (with Shanghai being the most important) and China Maritime Customs service, a relatively autonomous tax bureaucracy. By ensuring the credibility of repayment of government bonds, this financial-fiscal mechanism laid the institutional foundation for the rise of modern Chinese banks, a viable market for public debt and increasing supply of reputable convertible bank notes. My survey sheds new light on some of the most important and controversial issues related to Chinese and global economic history.
N15|Some Doubts about the Economic Analysis of the Flow of Silver to China in 1550–1820|Abstract The paper takes issue with the mainstream economic analysis of the enormous flow of silver into China in 1550–1820. First, I challenge the view that arbitrage between gold and silver in European trade with China was important except for one twenty-year spell. Next, I argue that had China imported gold, its history would have been much the same. I also dispute the idea that the persistence of the silver inflows from 1550 to 1820 implies any persistent disequilibrium, and I maintain that economic theory can easily accommodate the view that the inflow of silver into China sponsored growth in China.
N15|Philippine Inequality across the Twentieth Century: Slim Evidence but Fat Questions|In spite of persistent debates about income inequality and pro-poor policy in the Philippines, its history over the past century has been ignored, at least by economists. This is surprising given that the Philippines already had its first Census in 1903, long before its neighbors, augmented by other relevant evidence embedded in official documents generated by the American insular government. It is also surprising given that we know that income distributions change only very slowly and must be examined over the long run to identify its drivers. This essay reviews the (thin) historical evidence and proposes explanations. There is no Kuznets Curve, and no Marxian, Pikettian or other grand endogenous inequality theory at work, but there are dramatic episodes of change. It appears that there was an inequality rise up to World War 1, a fall between the World Wars, a rise to high levels by the 1950s, and an almost certain rise up to the end of the century which, due to mismeasurement, looks instead like stasis . We need to collect better evidence to confirm these narratives and to assess competing hypotheses.
N15|Malaria suitability, urbanization and persistence: Evidence from China over more than 2000 years|We show that the climatic potential for Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission constituted a locational fundamental that influenced the spatial distribution of urbanization since the early start of the southward expansion of the Han Chinese around 200 BCE. This effect is still detectable in today's distribution of urbanization and economic activity even though the risk of malaria falciparum has been successfully eliminated. We do not find any indication of convergence between high- and low malaria potential regions after eradication. Our identification strategy relies on a climate-based measure of Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission intensity which is fitted to experimental data on mosquito and parasite development from laboratory studies. This measure is exogenous with respect to human population densities.
N15|The biological standard of living in pre-modern Korea: Determinants of height of militia recruits during the Chosŏn dynasty|This paper extends the research on the biological standard of living in the Korean peninsula back to pre-modern times. Drawing on militia rosters of the Chosŏn Dynasty from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, we tentatively conclude that the final height of Korean men during this period was 166cm and thus slightly above that of modern North Korean men (165cm). On the other hand, the average height of modern South Korean men is 172cm, 6cm more than what we tentatively estimate for pre-modern Korean men. Regression analysis of the height of pre-modern Korean men finds that un-free Koreans (“slaves”) were significantly shorter by about 0.6–0.7cm than commoners, whereas the average height of recruits suffering from smallpox did not differ significantly from that of other recruits. Moreover, regional, as opposed to birth-dummy, variables account, and to a significant degree, for most of the differences in height. Whether or not this is a result of socioeconomic differences across provinces or a result of other regionally-varying factors remains an open question.
N15|Teaching to the tests: An economic analysis of traditional and modern education in late imperial and republican China|A traditional education system, based on the Confucian classics, was a pillar of imperial China's social structure for centuries, preparing elites for a series of highly competitive exams conferring gentry status and civil service positions. Reformers in late imperial China called for the modernization of educational institutions, seeing in Western education the skills necessary to develop China's economy. In the late 19th century, the traditional education system was joined by a “modern”, Western track, which offered teaching in science, math, social science, law, and engineering. In this paper, early 20th century employee records from the Tianjin-Pukou Railroad are analyzed to identify differences in labor market outcomes associated with study in the traditional and modern educational systems. The employee records reveal that modern and traditional education were both associated with wage premiums, but that these were significantly larger for individuals trained at high levels in the modern system, especially those trained in engineering. Individuals trained in the traditional system worked disproportionately in the clerical department of the railroad, while those with modern education were more often in managerial and technical roles. Qualitative and quantitative evidence suggests that these results are not driven by sorting into educational institutions according to ability. These findings indicate that beyond years of schooling, the content of schooling can play an important role in the process of economic development.
N15|Partnership as Experimentation: Business Organization and Survival in Egypt, 1910-1949|The relationship between legal forms of firm organization and economic development remains poorly understood. Recent research disputes the view that the joint-stock corporation played a crucial role in historical economic development, but retains the view that the costless firm dissolution implicit in non-corporate forms is detrimental to investment. We demonstrate the benefits of costless dissolution in an environment where potential business partners are not fully-informed. Using a multi-armed bandit model, we show that an experimentation mechanism creates a spike in dissolution rates early in firms’ lives, as less productive matches break down and agents look for better matches. We test the model’s predictions using a novel firm-level dataset comprising more than 12,000 enterprises established in Egypt between 1910 and 1949. Most partnerships dissolved within two years; afterwards, the risk of dissolution dropped to a lower, steady level. Corporations had much more uniform and lower attrition rates. Companies made up of partners who had been in business before also had flatter dissolution rates, confirming the link between learning and the early break-up of partnerships. The partnership reflected a trade-off between committing to a partner and sorting into potentially better matches.

N15|Trade Effects of Silver Price Fluctuations in 19th Century China: A Macro Approach|We assess the role of silver price fluctuations on Chinese trade and GDP during the late Qing dynasty, when China still had a bimetallic monetary system where silver was mostly used for trade. Using a structural VAR with a newly proposed small sample bias correction and blockwise recursive identification, we identify the impact of silver price shocks o the Chinese economy from 1867 to 1910. We find that silver price changes have substantial impact on trade, but barely affect GDP. Our results can partly be applied to the analysis of the role of vehicle currencies in today's emerging economies.
N15|China's Growing Ties with Middle East: Goals and Objectives|"""Objective –This study evaluates China's rapid growth of economic, trade and investment ties with key Middle Eastern countries and its long term economic, geo-political and strategic goals and objectives, as well as opportunities and limitations in the light of the relative decline of US power and influence in the region. Methodology/Technique – A qualitative research methodology is applied in the study and wide range of secondary sources including articles, papers and online resources are used, analyzed and consulted. Data on trade and investment statistics between China and major Middle Eastern countries are also tabulated and used. Findings – The study concludes that economic and trade interests as well as stable and regular oil and gas supply are the primary consideration in this burgeoning relationship. The study also finds that strategic factors like geopolitical locations, large territories with huge natural resources, rising consumer markets and potential areas of military cooperation and arms sales make the Middle East a more lucrative and attractive partner to China. Novelty –The study looks at the relationship between China and the Middle East."""
N15|Coercive state, resisting society, political and economic development in Iran|In my studies, I have explored the political economy of Iran and particularly the relationship between the state and socio-economic development in this country. The importance of the oil revenue in economic development of contemporary Iran has been underlined since the early seventies and a vast literature on the rentier state and authoritarian modernization has scrutinized the specificities of the political and economic natural resource ‘curse’ in Iran. A new critical social history of the oil industry has recently endeavored to reconsider the spread effects of this industry on the emergence of new cities and labor activities. In this sense, the impact of oil revenue on economic development should be mitigated: it has not been only a ‘curse’ but also a ‘blessing’. The precious results of natural resource curse or blessing notwithstanding, this approach is insufficient to explain why some predatory states reliant on natural resources could contribute to economic development while others hinder such development. Two recent examples provide a salient illustration: why did the Shah’s regime which was dependent on oil revenues enhance economic development during 1962-1974, while Ahmadinjead’s two terms presidency (2005-2013) imped economic growth despite the quadrupling of oil revenues? In this essay, I will first introduce my theoretical framework and distinguish two types of predatory states, i.e. inclusive and exclusive (section 1). I will then apply this framework to explain oil and economic development (section 2). Section 3 will be devoted to the Shah’s regime as an inclusive predatory state, and section 4 to Ahmadinjead’s presidency as an illustration of an exclusive predatory state. A short conclusion will follow.
N15|The Road to a Market-Oriented Monetary Policy and the “New Normal” Monetary Policy Regime in China|Over the past decades, China has implemented a series of economic reforms, as a result of which it progressed in successive stages from a centrally planned economy system to a market economy system. As part of this process, both the framework and the toolbox of monetary policy changed in line with the prevailing economic systems. Our paper describes this evolution from the emergence of the two-tier banking system onwards, with particular focus on the post-2008 reform process, which involved the establishment of the current framework operating within the “New Normal”. This new framework copies a number of monetary policy elements commonly occurring in developed market economies, while it also has unique characteristics that reflect the specific features of the country. On the one hand, these bear the marks of earlier monetary policy regimes, while on the other hand, they may also be conceived of as means of adapting to new challenges: certain tools which previously were of a purely monetary policy nature have taken on a new meaning within China’s new economic system as tools of macroprudential policy, a new area emerging in the aftermath of the crisis of 2007–2008.
N15|"Aging population in Asian countries |Lessons from Japanese experiences |"|Many Asian countries are facing a rapidly aging population. An aging population will cause social security expenditures in national budget to rise. Currently, fiscal conditions in Asian countries are relatively stable, but governments will be required to control social security expenditures to maintain fiscal soundness. Japan established universal health insurance and pension insurance systems in 1961. In 1973, the so called gfirst year of high-level social welfare h, free medical services for the elderly and the indexlinked pension system were started. Currently, in Japan, the aging rate, which measures the share of the population aged 65 years old or over, has reached 27%, while the country continues to face fiscal deficits and government debt has been accumulating. Other Asian countries have started to develop their countries f social security systems, so it is time to review the lessons that can be drawn from Japanese experiences relating to social security expenditures and national budget conditions. In this paper, we focused on Japanese social insurance systems, especially health insurance and pension insurance systems, and addressed some lessons to Asian countries. Lessons from health insurance system are: (1) It is important to determine public contributions f share of medical expenses not by patients f age, but based on their income and assets, (2) To establish universal health insurance system, it is important to ensure the stable financial revenues of insurers with subscribers who are unable to enroll with other insurers. Lessons from the pension insurance system are: (1) It is important for the government to manage sharp acceleration of inflation in such a way as to not increase pension benefits, thereby preventing the financial burdening of future generations, (2) The pension system should be designed based on the long-term projections of the population aging rate and total fertility rate, and policies should be adapted accordingly, (3) It would be preferable that the government take a gMacro-economic slide h pension system which is a fixed contribution schedule coupled with a mechanism to rebalance pension finances through automatic adjustment of benefits.
N15|The Historical State, Local Collective Action, and Economic Development in Vietnam|This study examines how the historical state conditions long‐run development, using Vietnam as a laboratory. Northern Vietnam (Dai Viet) was ruled by a strong, centralized state in which the village was the fundamental administrative unit. Southern Vietnam was a peripheral tributary of the Khmer (Cambodian) Empire, which followed a patron‐client model with more informal, personalized power relations and no village intermediation. Using a regression discontinuity design, the study shows that areas exposed to Dai Viet administrative institutions for a longer period prior to French colonization have experienced better economic outcomes over the past 150 years. Rich historical data document that in Dai Viet villages, citizens have been better able to organize for public goods and redistribution through civil society and local government. We argue that institutionalized village governance crowded in local cooperation and that these norms persisted long after the original institutions disappeared.
N15|Trade, Merchants and Lost Cities of the Bronze Age|We analyze a large dataset of commercial records produced by Assyrian merchants in the 19th Century BCE. Using the information collected from these records, we estimate a structural gravity model of long-distance trade in the Bronze Age. We use our structural gravity model to locate lost ancient cities. In many instances, our structural estimates confirm the conjectures of historians who follow different methodologies. In some instances, our estimates confirm one conjecture against others. Confronting our structural estimates for ancient city sizes to modern data on population, income, and regional trade, we document persistent patterns in the distribution of city sizes across four millennia, even after controlling for time-invariant geographic attributes such as agricultural suitability. Finally, we offer evidence in support of the hypothesis that large cities tend to emerge at the intersections of natural transport routes, as dictated by topography.
N15|Internal Rebellions and External Threats: A Model of Government Organizational Forms in Ancient China|In ancient China, a ruler needed to handle both internal rebellions and external threats. To decrease the possibility of internal rebellions, a ruler could organize the government to establish the division of power among ministers. While effective in preventing internal rebellions, this approach could make the defense of the country against external threats less effective. The trade-off between preventing internal rebellions and dealing with external threats in a ruler's choice of government organizational form is affected by factors such as the size of the population, the level of coordination efficiency, and the degree of increasing returns to the military sector. If the magnitude of external threats increases, regardless of the type of equilibrium organizational form, the equilibrium level of the concentration of power among division heads increases.
N15|Towards Regional Monetary Unions through Blockchain Networks|The concept of political and economic integration has not progressed beyond the concept of a Nation-state. The primary reason is the trust deficit among citizens in a supra-national entity. We can use Blockchain systems-which are trustless networks-to resolve this issue. We can float a Regional Cryptocurrency (RCC) which can bring about a successful Regional Monetary Unions (RMU) amongst a group of nations in a transparent manner. This paper deals with the idea of realizing a monetary union through Blockchain networks. Firstly I describe the basics of cryptocurrencies and RSBCs. Then we shall evaluate how RMUs have failed due trust deficit among citizens of members of RMU. We then analyse as to how Blockchain networks can be a solution to these problems. The paper concludes by summarizing the difficulties and solutions regarding successful formation of Regional Monetary Unions.

N15|Pipe Dreams and Tunnel Visions: Economists and Australian Population Debates before the Baby Boom|Australia is notably, if not notoriously, a land of much space but few people. Its population density is, correspondingly, almost the lowest of any country in the world: only Namibia and Mongolia record a lower figure. Australia's extreme divergence from the common human experience has been a magnet for strong reactions; and Australia's small population has frequently judged either being a failing or a blessing. Economists, however, have in the past two generations tended to keep their silence on this issue. But for about 20 years prior to the post-War baby boom economists did have some confidence that simple economic theory could constitute a guide to population policy, under the rubric of 'optimal population' theory. This paper reviews Australian explorations of 'optimal population' in the period, and concludes the episode provides a moral on the frustrations that may meet hopes that simple economic theory can provide answers to large questions.
N15|A tale of two SICs: Japanese and American industrialisation in historical perspective|Late developing countries are able to adopt best practice technologies pioneered abroad, allowing more rapid convergence toward leading economies. Meiji Japan (1868-­-1912) is considered a successful example of industrial convergence, but much of the evidence relies on national aggregates or selected industries. Using historical industry data, this paper examines whether Japan adopted new technologies faster compared to the United States. Contrary to conventional wisdom, duration analysis indicates that new sectors did not appear relatively sooner in Japan; however, they did grow to economic significance faster. Higher firm capitalization and capital intensity are also associated with earlier entry for Japanese sectors.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N15|A Tacit Monetary Policy of the Gulf Countries: Is There a Remittances Channel?|The strong economic ties between the GCC economies and the U.S. are manifested in three ways: currency peg, coupling of monetary policy, and the adoption of the U.S. dollar as the trading currency for oil. This paper examines how these dynamics result in a misalignment of the U.S. monetary policy with the business cycles of the GCC economies. The study shows how the staggering amount of remittances outflow of the GCC economies plays a stabilizing role as a tacit monetary policy tool. Incorporating remittances in the money demand equation results in a more robust model than otherwise. We further find that the effect of the Federal Funds rate on money demand in these countries diminishes in significance during the period of oil boom between 2002 and 2009. However, the transmission effect of the recession periods in the U.S. into the demand for money in the GCC countries is not statistically significant.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N15|Economic Analysis and Forecasting in the Global Economy and in Emerging and Developing Regions Including Africa: How Informative is the Ifo World Economic Survey (WES)?|Economists around the world rely in addition to official statistics on business (and consumer) surveys, which are more up-to-date. However, for many emerging and developing countries there is a lack of such surveys. This gap can, at least partly, be filled by the Ifo World Economic Survey (WES). In this paper we first describe this survey and also examine how helpful it is for macroeconomic analysis and short-term forecasting. We find that this survey provides important up-to-date information about the cyclical stage of the global economy and of major emerging and developing regions including Africa. Increasing the number of participating experts could further improve its usefulness for macroeconomic analysis in these regions.
N15|Assessing the effects of Japanese industrial policy change during the 1960s|This paper provides a systematic analysis of the effects of the industrial policy change in the 1960s in Japan. We utilize a panel of 227 manufacturing industries between 1960 and 1969. We find that on the one hand, the removal of de facto import quotas had significantly negative effects on real output, real output per establishment, and employment. On the other hand, for those industries where import quotas were removed, tariff protection was effective in maintaining real output and employment. However, this does not necessarily mean the success of industrial policy change because neither tariff protection nor the removal of quotas contributed to productivity growth. In that sense, the industrial policy change had limited effects.
N15|China: la reconstrucción de una potencia|Se indaga por las razones culturales del pasado que han facilitado el ascenso pacífico de China al rango de una potencia de primer nivel en los planos económico, político y militar en los comienzos del siglo XXI. Se destaca tanto la velocidad como la originalidad de su proceso económico y se advierten por su estilo de desarrollo, desbalances críticos en la brecha de ingresos, con aumentos en su endeudamiento y en las desigualdades económicas y sociales con severa afectación del medio ambiente por contaminación (del aire, del agua y del suelo) de un remanente de plantas de producción tecnológicamente obsoletas. En China coexisten y se potencian tecnologías de la primera y segunda revolución industrial (siglos XVIII y XIX) con las de la tercera revolución tecnológica (finales del siglo XX y comienzos del XXI).
N15|Foreigners Knocking on the Door: Trade in China During the Treaty Port Era|Uneven development within countries suggests that domestic trade frictions are important. Trade flows within a country, however, are rarely observed. We employ a new dataset on trade between fifteen Chinese treaty ports to examine the importance of domestic frictions around the year 1900. The distribution of welfare effects depends on each port's productivity and factor costs, China's economic geography as it influences trade costs, as well as the degree of regional diversity in production, which increases the potential gains from trade. We utilize this framework to quantify the size and distribution of welfare effects resulting from new technology and lower trade costs. Domestic trade frictions turn out to be substantial, far from the frictionless world that is commonly assumed. Moreover, geographic barriers loom large in shaping the welfare gains from technology improvements and trade cost reductions. We find, however, that an important explanation for why there was a limit to what could be gained through increased domes- tic trade was that the differences in productivity across regions of China in the 19th century were relatively low.
N15|Scientific Potential as the Basis of Innovation Development of Kazakhstan|The article describes the development of market mechanisms of high-tech sector of innovation system of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The structure of domestic expenditure on research and development of different countries is analyzed. The article revealed that the main problem for Kazakhstan science is the low level of development of innovation system, i.e., research and development are still not getting the production application. The results of the research activities and the estimation of the impact of research are considered. The relationship between the structure of domestic expenditure on research and development and the number of patent applications was investigated. Positive correlation between the number of patent applications and the financing of science business sector was revealed.
N15|Modeling the Impact of the Oil Sector on the Economy of Sultanate of Oman|This study constructs and analyses a simple macroeconomic model that specifically tailored to model the impact of oil sector on the economy of Sultanate of Oman. The constructed model of the study measures the impact of oil sector on the Oman economy for the last three decades and also provides some forecasting for the major macroeconomics indicators related to the Oman economy. Model simulations indicate that the oil sector has large and positive impact on Oman gross domestic product and its influence spills over to all other non-oil sectors of Oman economy. The study found that largest influence of oil was on the gas sector and the least economic sector influenced by oil was agricultural sector. The findings of the study suggest that Oman economy is far from being diversified and that the proposed model helps the policy makers in Oman to identify and forecast the impact of oil on other components of the Oman economy
N15|How Japan remained on the Gold Standard despite unsustainable external debt|In the period of the classic gold standard, most peripheral countries were frequently affected by so-called sudden stops as well as by financial and currency crises. Yet pre-War Japan was an outlier. Though its level of external debt was not sustainable, Japan issued many government foreign loans to cover its current account deficits, was never affected by currency crises, and was never forced to suspend convertibility. We argue that, from the late nineteenth century until just before World War I, Japan and Britain engaged in a politico-economic exchange: Japan offered to protect Britain's economic and political interests in the Far East provided that Britain gave the rising Asian power access to financial markets—namely, in the City of London.
N15|From global factory to global mall? East Asia’s changing trade composition and orientation|This paper examines East Asia’s changing trade composition and geographical orientation from 1999 to 2014 and draws implications for the region and beyond. Over the last two decades, East Asia has been one of the most successful regions in the world to build and connect cross-border supply chains. Introducing a new and simple analytical tool, we show that since 1999, East Asia has been successful in consolidating its role as a global manufacturing hub and is sourcing an increasing share of intermediate and capital goods directly from the region. Being a thriving manufacturing hub has also triggered rising demand for consumption goods. All East Asian countries, except the PRC, are selling an increasing share of their consumption goods within the region. Furthermore, more consumption goods from outside the region are also being attracted to East Asia. If these trends were to continue, East Asia has the potential to transform into one of the world’s largest “malls”.
N15|Diversity of firm sizes, complexity, and industry structure in the Chinese economy|Among the phenomena in economics that are not yet well-understood is the fat-tailed (power-law) distribution of firm sizes in the world's economies. In the present paper we discuss different mechanisms suggested in the literature to explain this distribution of firm sizes. The paper uses the China Industrial Enterprises Database to study the distribution (firm size in terms of the number of employees, capital, and gross profit) for the provinces of China for the years 1998–2008. We estimate the power-law distribution and confirm its plausibility using the KS test and the log-likelihood ratio vs. lognormal and exponential distributions. The analysis on regional levels allows an assessment of regional effects on differences in the distribution; we discuss possible explanations for the observed patterns in the light of the recent regional economic development and the economic reforms in the PRC.
N15|Post-GFC external shocks and Indonesian economic performance|The post-GFC era sees slower global growth and a substantial Chinese slowdown, unusually combined with lower investment financing costs, and with the eventual prospect of a US-led re-tightening of global financial markets. For Indonesia in the medium term, these developments imply a slowing of export growth and a temporary surge in net inward investment incentives. These changes are examined here using a numerical macro model. The results suggest that recent fiscal reform is long-run beneficial and that it will moderate the negative effects of expectations linked to these global events, the formation of which is shown to be an important determinant of performance. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted, mainly on parameters indicating Indonesian openness to trade and finance. Liberal product markets and home investment are shown to offer unambiguous gains in the face of negative external shocks, while openness to external financial flows does not.
N15|To get the prices right for food: a “Gerschenkron state” versus the market in reforming China, 1979–2006|This article provides an empirical assessment of China’s state price policies and strategies in relation to (1) market-rebuilding for the agricultural sector and (2) food security for China.1 It traces main changes in government grain pricing, urban food subsidies, grain procurement and the administrative control over food circulation from 1979 to 2006 in a bid to transfer a non-market economy to a market one, commonly known as the post-Mao reforms.
N15|The rise of a financial revolution in Republican China in 1900-1937: an institutional narrative|This paper surveys the phenomenal transformation of banking and finance, public debt and monetary regimes during 1900-1937, a period of great political instability in Chinese history. To understand why sectors which are often most vulnerable to the security of property rights and contract enforcement, have become the vanguard of growth in such an era of uncertainty, I highlight the role of institutions as seen in the form of a business dominated quasi-political structure that grew outside the formal political sphere. This structure rested on the institutional nexus of Western treaty ports (with Shanghai being the important) and China Maritime Customs service, a relatively autonomous tax bureaucracy. By ensuring the credibility of repayment of government bonds, this financial-fiscal mechanism laid the institutional foundation for the rise of modern Chinese banks, a viable market for public debt and increasing supply of reputable convertible bank notes during this era of national dis-integration. Our narrative carries far-reaching implications on the ongoing great divergence debate.
N15|Price shocks in disaster: the Great Kantō Earthquake in Japan,1923|This paper tests the operation of markets in the wake of a sudden exogenous shock in prewar Japan, the Great Kantō Earthquake of 1923. Using a unique monthly wholesale price dataset of provincial cities, we found that the earthquake had a positive impact on the price of rice and timber in the sample cities. Our results also indicate that the wholesale price of rice in cities in the northeast of Japan, which were more closely integrated with the affected region, experienced more significant price rises than those in western Japan. Nevertheless, although further research using retail as opposed to wholesale prices of goods is needed, these preliminary findings suggest that the diffusion of price instability outwards from the affected region was on a lesser scale than might have been expected.
N15|Japanese colonialism in comparative perspective|The paper examines the economic consequences of Japanese colonialism in Taiwan, Korea and Manchuria in the years from 1910 to 1945, and compares Japanese policies with those implemented by other colonial powers in Southeast Asia. In particular it addresses the writings of an influential group of American scholars who have published widely on Japanese colonial policies over the last fifty years. Their work has been used to support the argument that Japanese colonial policy was more developmental than that of other colonial powers, and laid the foundations for the stellar economic performance of Taiwan and the Republic of Korea in the decades after 1950. The paper challenges this argument by comparing a number of economic and social indicators in Korea, Taiwan and Manchuria with those from other Asian colonies and also from Thailand. The main conclusion is that while the Japanese colonies, especially Taiwan, score well on some indicators, they do less well on others. The idea of Japanese exceptionalism cannot be accepted uncritically.
N15|Asia's 'Little Divergence' in the 20th Century: Evidence from PPP-based direct estimates of GDP per capita, 1913-1969|This paper uses expenditure-based PPPs to create direct estimates of GDP per capita for 12 Asian countries in comparable prices for six benchmark years during 1913-1969. The paper finds that levels of real GDP per capita were in several countries comparable to those in Japan in 1913. GDP per capita of Japan and other Asian countries diverged during and after World War I. The paper questions whether Asia's 'little divergence' between Japan and other Asian countries dates back to the late-18th century. It draws attention to the different resource endowments of Japan, China and India compared to other Asian countries, and their implications for the development trajectories of Asian countries. The paper also demonstrates that using historical PPP estimates yields estimates of GDP per capita that diverge from those based on retropolations of the single 1990 PPP-converted benchmark year. It concludes that historical estimates of PPPs are needed to confirm analyses of comparative economic performance based on GDP per capita data.
N15|Unfolding the Turbulent Century: A Reconstruction of China's Economic Development, 1840-1912|This paper reconstructs China's economic development between 1840 and 1912 with an estimation of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It provides for the first time a time series of GDP (per capita) for the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), based on sectoral output and value added, in current as well as in constant prices. The present estimation of per capita GDP in the late Qing period comes out higher than previous estimations, but it still suggests low average levels of Chinese living standards. The economy during the late Qing Empire was characterised by a large and growing agricultural sector and displayed only minor structural changes. Only in the beginning of the twentieth century did the economy start to show signs of growth.
N15|The Effects of Barriers to Technology Adoption on Japanese Prewar and Postwar Economic Growth|Following the start of modern economic growth around the mid- 1880s, Japan fs economy continued to substantially lag behind leading economies before World War II, but achieved rapid catch-up after the war. To explain the patterns, we build a dynamic model and examine the role of barriers to technology adoption. We find such barriers hampered catch-up in the prewar period and explain about 40 percent of the postwar miracle. Taking a historical perspective, we argue that factors that acted as barriers include low capacity to absorb technology, economic and political frictions with the outside world, and a lack of competition.
N15|La croissance économique entre ouverture, qualité institutionnelle et dépendance énergétique : quelle évidence pour l’économie algérienne ?|Auteurs : Mr MAAMRI Moussa & IFOURAH Hocine Résumé :Ce papier présente une analyse théorique et empirique des effets de la dépendance des exportations des hydrocarbures combinée avec le niveau de la qualité des institutions, l’ouverture économique et l’investissement dans le capital physique sur la croissance de l’économie algérienne. Pour ce faire, la recherche a tenté d’expliquer la relation entre la variation des facteurs explicatifs suscités sur la variation du PIB par habitant en Algérie à travers une modélisation économétrique en adoptant l’approche VAR (Modélisation vectorielle autorégressif) pour des séries allants de 1995 à 2014. Les résultats de la recherche ont montré que seuls le poids des exportations des hydrocarbures dans le total des exportations et l’investissement dans le capital fixe ont un effet positif et significatif sur la croissance de l’économie algérienne. Par ailleurs, la recherche n’a pas révélé d’effets significatifs des autres variables (ouverture économique et qualité des institutions) sur le PIB par habitant en Algérie Mots clefs : Qualité des Institutions, Ouverture, Croissance Economique, Algérie.
N15|Does government promote or hinder capital accumulation? Evidence from Japan' s high-growth era|Governments occasionally intervene in private sector economic activities to promote specific industries and enhance economic growth. During Japan's high-growth era, the government used various policy tools to intervene in private sector capital investments. We examine the effects of these policy tools on capital accumulation. We employ firm-level data sets, identify policy actions using historical records and find that they were applied intensively to specific sectors and firms and that government intervention partially affected those firms f capital investment decisions. For some industries, such as steel, chemicals and textiles, investment-promoting policy tools resulted in accelerating capital investments or relatively higher resource allocations of capital to labour. There were also cases in which policy actions aimed at curbing investments resulted in slower investments or lower allocations of capital to labour, but the effects were weak and small. Discouraging policy tools had contradictory effects on some industries and enhanced capital investments. The latter phenomenon was observed when the government attempted to control private sector capital investments based on the current share of production or production capacities.
N15|Controlling SO2 emissions in China: A panel data analysis of the 11th Five-Year Plan|We investigate the impact of policy measures to reduce SO2 emissions during 11th Five-Year Plan of China (2006-2010). By using a provincial-level panel data set, we find that installation of the flue-gas desulfurization equipment and closure of small coal- fired power plants contributed to a statistically significant reduction in SO2 emissions. While estimation results suggest that these two policy measures played an important role in reducing SO 2 emissions in China during this period, the size of the estimated coefficients shows that the effects might have been weaker than those predicted by ex-ante cost-benefit analysis.
N15|An empirical contribution to Minsky’s financial fragility:Evidence from non-financial sectors in Japan|This study presents an empirical analysis to detect Minsky’s financial fragility and its determinants in the non- financial sectors in Japan, with particular attention paid to differences between sectors and sizes. While Minsky developed theoretical analyses of financial fragility for use in economic growth models, its empirical application is limited. Based on the financial fragility indices derived from a cash flow accounting framework and Minsky’s margins of safety, I detect the overall configuration and evolution of financial fragility (hedge, speculative, and Ponzi) in Japan. Then, the factors that determine the probability of being Ponzi finance are detected by using panel logistic regression. In doing so, this study reveals that although speculative finance is dominant in many sectors, the evolution of financial fragility is diversified and its determinants differ according to sector and size in Japan.
N15|Foreigners Knocking on the Door: Trade in China During the Treaty Port Era|Uneven development within countries suggests that domestic trade frictions are important. Trade flows within a country, however, are rarely observed. We employ a new dataset on trade between fifteen Chinese treaty ports to examine the importance of domestic frictions around the year 1900. The distribution of welfare effects depends on each port's productivity and factor costs, China's economic geography as it influences trade costs, as well as the degree of regional diversity in production, which increases the potential gains from trade. We utilize this framework to quantify the size and distribution of welfare effects resulting from new technology and lower trade costs. Domestic trade frictions turn out to be substantial, far from the frictionless world that is commonly assumed. Moreover, geographic barriers loom large in shaping the welfare gains from technology improvements and trade cost reductions. We find, however, that an important explanation for why there was a limit to what could be gained through increased domestic trade was that the differences in productivity across regions ofChina in the 19th century were relatively low.
N15|Economic Growth in Southeastern Europe and Eastern Mediterranean, 1820-1914|This article brings together and analyzes data and other evidence from a variety of sources to provide an overview of the growth record of southeastern Europe and the Middle East from 1820 until the First World War. Average incomes in these two regions increased at long term rates between a half and one percent per year during the nineteenth century. Institutional changes and development of export oriented agriculture are seen as the main reasons for the increases in per capita incomes. However, the income gap between these two regions and the industrializing countries of western Europe and the United States steadily widened until 1914.
N15|Money doctors and their reform proposals for China reconsidered, 1903–29|In this paper we provide a quantitative evaluation of foreign financial advising, taking China’s currency reform proposals as an example. Between 1903 and 1929, three Western financial experts proposed a gold (‐exchange) standard to China, which at that time was on a silver standard. Using counterfactual simulation, we find that: (1) a gold (‐exchange) standard would not have brought price stability to China; (2) and it could have even worsened global deflation during the beginning years of the Great Depression.
N15|Biased Technical Change and Economic Growth: The Case of Korea, 1970–2013|Abstract This paper explores the pattern of technical change in the Korean economy from 1970 to 2013 and investigates its determinants. We use the Classical growth-distribution schedule to show that the labor-saving and capital-using pattern has predominated. For the rationale behind this Marx-biased technical change, we focus on the relationship between technical change and real wage growth via the evolution of labor and capital productivity, and verify the historical direction of technical change against the rise and fall of the working class. Furthermore, we find that the deviation during the post-crisis period from the long-run trend of Marx-biased technical change is not attributable to the vitality of new technological innovations, but rather the reflection of class dynamics over extracting productivity under weaker capital deepening. The results suggest that the recent deterioration of labor share and labor unions in Korea is closely associated with low incentive for technological progress, which contributes to prolonged stagnation.
N15|Electricity Consumption and Economic Growth in South Asia|This study investigates the effect of electricity consumption on economic growth of four South Asian countries, namely, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, by employing time series annual data from 1980 to 2010. Pedroniâ€™s panel cointegration results confirm that there exists valid long-run relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth in South Asia. Results of random effects model suggest the positive and significant impact of electricity consumption on economic growth of South Asian countries. Robustness of the initial findings of positive and significant relationship is confirmed by four different sensitivity analyses. Results of panel Granger causality test confirm the unidirectional causal relationship runs from electricity consumption to economic growth. It is therefore recommended that the South Asian countries should consider the development initiative and low-cost mode to produce electricity to enhance economic growth in the region.
N15|Trade and income growth in the Ottoman Empire: assessing the role of volatility and trend growth in terms of trade|Abstract This paper focuses on the Ottoman economy from the beginning of the nineteenth century until the early twentieth century when the first wave of economic globalization coupled with the sweeping forces of rapid industrialization in the West led to major structural changes that are deemed to be responsible for the Great Divergence in income levels. An important part of this process for the Ottoman economy and the rest of the Periphery was secular improvements and increased volatility in the relative price of exports compared to imports, i.e., the terms of trade (ToT). A large body of literature suggests that both the changes in and the volatility of ToT may affect economic development in different ways. We present empirical predictions for Ottoman income growth under various counterfactual ToT scenarios to offer a perspective on the absolute and relative importance of ToT volatility and ToT growth for the Ottoman economy. According to our findings, Ottoman GDP per capita could have grown about 0.63–0.80 $$\text{percentage}$$ percentage points faster on average per year over the period 1800–1870, if the Empire faced only half the decadal ToT volatility it actually experienced over the same period.
N15|Bubble Economics How Big a Shock to China’s Real Estate Sector Will Throw the Country into Recession, and Why Does It Matter?|How far do China’s property prices need to drop in order to send the country into a recession? What does this question tell us about the way Bubble Economies work? In this paper, we develop a theory of Bubble Economics – non-linear and often “systemic” (in the mathematical sense of the word) forces which cause significant misallocations of resources. Our theory draws on the standard elements of most stories of Bubble Economics, looking at the way banking, construction, savings/investment, local government and equities sectors interact. We find that Bubble Economies’ GDP growth can depend on property prices changes differently at different times -- depending on risks building up in the economy. We argue that a tacit, implicit Bubble Risk Factor might provide a way of understanding a key variable academics and practitioners omit when they try to explain how economies (mis)allocate resources during bubbles. A 15%-20% property price drop could cause recession, if China’s economy resembles other large economies having already experienced property-related asset crises. However, a 40% decline would not be out of the question.
N15|Macroeconomic trade effects of vehicle currencies: Evidence from 19th century China|We use the Chinese experience between 1867 and 1910 to illustrate how the volatility of vehicle currencies affects trade. Today's widespread vehicle currency is the dollar. However, the macroeconomic effects of this use of the dollar have rarely been addressed. This is partly due to identification problems caused by its international importance. China had adopted a system, where silver was used almost exclusively for trade, similar to a vehicle currency. While being important for China, the global role of silver was marginal, alleviating said identification problems. We develop a bias corrected structural VAR showing that silver price fluctuations significantly affected trade.
N15|Od Mao Zedonga do Xi Jinpinga. Cechy, cele, kierunki i narzędzia zagranicznej polityki gospodarczej Chińskiej Republiki Ludowej / From Mao Zedong to Xi Jinping. The foreign economic policy of the PRC – characteristics, objectives, directions and tools|The aim of the paper is to evaluate the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) foreign economic policy and to indicate the consequences of that policy for China’s position on the international scene. The paper presents the characteristics, objectives, directions and tools of its foreign policy, with special emphasis on economic aspects. The most important conclusion from the analysis is that in the last 65 years, since the establishment of the PRC, a unique style of Chinese foreign policy was formed, which is based on money, not arms. China has experienced significant economic and social development, but is still facing opportunities as well as challenges and threats.
N15|Capital Markets in China and Britain, 18th and 19th Century: Evidence from Grain Prices|Based on the most comprehensive grain prices available, we employ a storage model to estimate consistent interest rates and compare capital market development in Britain and China. Interest rates for Britain were lower than China’s on average by about three percentage points from 1770 to 1860. Regional capital market integration in the Yangzi Delta comes close to the British average at distances below 200 kilometers, but at larger distances interest rate correlations in Britain are twice those of the Delta, and three or more times as high as elsewhere in China. Overall, our results suggest capital market divergence at an early date.
N15|Growth, Growth Accelerations, and the Poor: Lessons from Indonesia|We study the impact of growth and growth accelerations on poverty and inequality in Indonesia using a new panel dataset covering 26 provinces over the period 1977–2010. This dataset allows us to distinguish between mining and non-mining in Indonesia. Growth in non-mining significantly reduces poverty and inequality. In contrast, overall growth and growth in mining appears to have no effect on the same. Growth acceleration in non-mining reduces poverty and inequality whereas the same in mining increases poverty. We expect that the degree of forward and backward linkages of mining and non-mining sectors explains the asymmetric result.
N15|Locating a chronology for the great divergence: a critical survey of published data deployed for the measurement of nominal wages for Ming and Qing China|Since the publication of Kenneth Pomeranz’s seminal book The Great Divergence, the landscape of world and global history has changed dramatically. For the first time, living standards, instead of labour, land and capital productivities, have become the prime concern among historians in various parts of the world. The key to this decade-long debate hinges on quantity and quality of information for transnational and cross-regional comparisons. But due to the obvious constraints we historians constantly face, genuinely good data are frustratingly hard to obtain and thus set the upper limits for what we can possibly achieve. The task of the present study is to put some currently circulated nominal wages for the Ming-Qing Period (1368-1911) under the microscope to check their feasibility. Our main findings from Chinese sources suggest that published cash wages did not reflect the actual living wages needed in reality to support a worker and his family of the average size. This means that we may have been barking at the wrong tree.
N15|Land equalisation, social mobility, and the rise of the Civil Service exam system|"""The Civil Service Exam System in Imperial China, which is the earliest Official Selection System in the world, and also is foundation of the Civil Servant System of western countries, appeared in replace of the Hereditary System in Tang Dynasty (618-907). This paper seeks for the economic driving force behind this political institutions transformation. We find that the implementation of Land Equalization policy could explain why the rise of Civil Service Exam System happened in Tang China. The long-term enforcement of Land Equalization policy impaired economic base of aristocrat groups as well as their monopoly political power; therefore, social structure became more horizontal than in the aristocrat and hereditary system. For this reason, the aristocrat groups had to share political power with elites selected from the populace by means of examination, which induced the rise of Civil Service Exam System. Probit regression using a newly-constructed dataset from first-hand biographies provided solid empirical evidence for our conjectures, and IV estimation verifies that the relationship is causal. Our finding suggests that only if economic factor changed social structure thoroughly, it could lead to momentous political institution transition."""
N15|Interest rate in Oman: is it fair?|Purpose - – The purpose of this study is to try to answer whether the banking system in Oman is fair for both depositors and entrepreneurs. Design/methodology/approach - – The interest margin decomposition is based on the methodology proposed in Randall (1998). The income statement of banks defines profits before taxes (P) as interest income (II), plus non-interest income (NII), minus interest expense (IP), minus operating costs (OC) and minus provision for loan losses (Prov). After rearranging this identity, the net interest revenue can be expressed as follows: II – IP = OC + Prov + P – NII. The above expression decomposes the margin into the following cost and profit components: reserve requirement costs, operational costs, loan loss provision costs, profitability and non-interest income (with a negative sign). Findings - – A trend analysis of commercial banks’ interest rate spreads in Oman exposes the following facts: First, the implicit interest margin is relatively small (in the neighborhood of 1 percentage point); second, profits constitute a substantial proportion of the margin; third, the share of operating costs in the margin has been broadly constant over time; fourth, reserve requirement costs have been reduced following the decline of the reserve requirement ratio; and fifth, the weighted average interest rate on deposits base is lower than the rate of inflation. Originality/value - – This work is original.
N15|East Asian Economies in a Globalizing World|The countries of East Asia are linked by strong cultural and historical threads, but there are also wide differences in their economies and income levels. By 2013 the three major East Asian economies, those of China, Japan, and South Korea, had reached distinctly different levels on the ladder of economic development. This paper presents both an economic history and a current evaluation of the major economies of Asia.
N15|Bank of Japan fs Monetary Policy in the 1980s: A View Perceived from Archived and Other Materials|This monographic paper summarizes views held by the Bank of Japan (hereafter BOJ or the Bank) in the 1980s regarding economic conditions and monetary policy formulation, perceived from the BOJ archives and other materials from the period. From a historical viewpoint, the authors see the 1980s as a watershed time for the Bank fs policy formulation, because the Bank acquired lessons for monetary policy formulation under a large fluctuation in economic and financial conditions and innovated new approaches for monetary policy formulation and money market management as stated below. First, during the 1980s the BOJ had to largely consider the external imbalance in formulating policy, and attention began to shift towards price stability in the medium or long term by the end of the decade. Second, the large fluctuations in asset prices, money supply, and commercial bank lending were closely monitored during this period, but the Bank fs assessment about their impacts on macroeconomic consequences in the medium to long term was insufficient. A reflection of these lessons appears to evolve into a perspective on the Bank fs monetary policy formulation that financial imbalances should be examined as a risk for achieving price stability in the medium to long term. Third, in light of ongoing financial deregulation during this period, the Bank started to change monetary policy measures from those based on a regulated interest rate framework to those based on market operation with good use of money markets and flexible interest rates.
N15|The mature limited access order at the doorstep: Imperial Germany and contemporary China in transition|A basic premise of the limited/open access orders framework of North, Wallis, Webb and Weingast is a variant of the Hayek–Friedman hypothesis that economic and political freedom sustain each other. Keys to this framework are the specific “doorstep” conditions that enable a transition from limited to open access, which the authors draw from the historical experience of Britain, France and the United States. This essay analyzes the transition process of Imperial Germany to reveal that maintaining economic competition did not depend on democracy and that the middle classes became stakeholders in authoritarianism. It then explores the specific challenges posed by this large, mature limited access order as it was integrated into an international system sustained by a declining liberal hegemon, Great Britain. The refinements of the framework suggested by the case of Imperial Germany allow for a better understanding of some of the parallel transition processes in present-day China and its evolving relationship to both the United States and the current international order.

N15|Gross Domestic Product and its Components in India. Trends and Issues|In this paper focus on the trends of Indian growth in terms of Gross domestic Product and its components. And furthermore analyse the growth are accelerate or decelerate. This paper covers growth performance in India for period 1951-2012. The average annual trend growth of GDP and Its components is higher during the reform phase as compare to the pre-reform phase except Mining and Quarrying and Electricity, Gas and Water Supply. The GDP shows the positive trend with acceleration in overall and sub periods but in case of its components all are positive with acceleration trend except the Electricity, Gas and Water Supply is positive but trend deceleration in overall period. And in case of Mining and Quarrying the results are statistically insignificant. However the structure of GDP and its components in terms of intercepts and slopes are different in post reform phase as compare to the pre reform phase.
N15|Economic Development and Land Issues in Liechtenstein: Historical Dynamics, Current Challenges and Suggested Fiscal Remedies|Despite its miniscule size and lack of exportable natural resources, in the course of the last century Liechtenstein has become one of the wealthiest countries (per capita) in the world. The rapid growth has resulted in a very significant increase in land values throughout the Principality. However, contrary to the experience of many larger economies, the socioeconomic effects of the increasing land values in Liechtenstein have so far been relatively benign. This paper explores some of the key reasons behind the country’s economic success, highlighting in particular the advantages of Liechtenstein’s size for its foreign policy, domestic institutions and private enterprises. It also demonstrates that Liechtenstein’s geographical location, favourable agreements with neighbours, type and pace of growth, as well as various elements of legislation have all helped to mitigate the development of landrelated socioeconomic issues. There has been a growing realization that these factors might be insufficient in preventing unsustainable urban sprawl, environmental degradation, decreasing economic opportunities, worsening housing affordability and increasing inequalities. As a potential remedy to these problems, the authors suggest a reform aimed at shifting at least some of the fiscal burdens from labour and businesses to the unimproved land values that are created by public investments and community’s efforts.
N15|Egyptian and Syrian commodity markets after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire: a Bayesian structural VECM analysis|The disruption of the Ottoman Empire caused dramatic changes to the economic and political structure of the Middle East. The newly established nations, incorporated into British and French formal and informal empires, actively implemented a range of protectionist policies, thus disrupting the regions traditional trade flows and patterns. This paper investigates the impact of this new economic setting on commodity market integration in Syria and Egypt, using Bayesian inference. After testing for co-integration through the calculation of Bayes factors and computing impulse response functions, our results point to the absence of cross border market integration.
N15|Grasp the Large, Let Go of the Small: The Transformation of the State Sector in China|Starting in the late 1990s, China undertook a dramatic transformation of the large number of firms under state control. Small state-owned firms were privatized or closed. Large state-owned firms were corporatized and merged into large industrial groups under the control of the Chinese state. The state also created many new and large firms. We use detailed firm-level data to show that from 1998 to 2007, (i) state-owned firms that were closed were smaller and had low labor and capital productivity; (ii) the labor productivity of state-owned firms converged to that of private firms; (iii) the capital productivity of state-owned firms remained significantly lower than that of private firms; and (iv) total factor productivity (TFP) growth of state-owned firms was faster than that of private firms. We find the reforms of the state sector were responsible for 20 percent of aggregate TFP growth from 1998 to 2007.
N15|Economic Cycles in Ancient China|We discuss business cycles in ancient China. Data on Ancient China business cycles are sparse and incomplete and so our discussion is qualitative rather than quantitative. Essentially, ancient debates focused on two types of cycles: long run political or dynastic cycles of many decades, and short run nature induced cycles. Discussion of the latter show strong parallels to Jevons’ conception of sun spot cycles. The former has no clear contemporary analogue, were often deep in impact and of long duration. The discussion of both focused on agricultural economies. Ancient discussion on intervention focused on counter cyclical measures, including stockpiling, and predated Keynes and the discussion in the 1930s by centuries. Also, a strongly held belief emerged that cycles create their own cycles to follow, and that cycles are part of the inevitable economic order, a view consistent with Mitchell’s view of the business cycle in the 1940s. Current debates on how best to respond to the ongoing global financial crisis draw in part on historical precedents, but these are largely limited to the last 150 years for OECD countries and with major focus on the 1990’s. Here we also probe material on Ancient China to see what is relevant.
N15|Extent Of Exchange Rate Coordination In Asia|High level of intra-regional trade and negative spillovers from competitive devaluation make exchange rate coordination extremely desirable in Asia. Employing a hypothetical Asian Currency Unit we evaluate the degree of coordination among Asian currencies. Traditional empirical tests yield little evidence of coordination among real and nominal exchange rates. However, introducing endogenously determined structural breaks to account for changes in exchange rate regimes provides more mixed evidence. While there is still little evidence for coordination in nominal terms, some degree of coordination among real rates emerges. The limited evidence for exchange rate coordination can be explained by the diverse exchange rate regimes prevailing in these economies, signaling differences in policy objectives.
N15|Malaysia NAP: More Shadows than Lights|After World War II, and in particular during the 1960s and the 1970s, many developing countries began their industrial revolution path. In particular, most of them followed a path of government-led industrial development, with central planning at the heart of the industrial policy. Such a model is not new in economic history and it is typical of many ‘second-comers’ in the industrialization process. The most famous one is the case of Prussia/Germany: with the Zollverein (1833-34) and after the unification in 1870, it was the government which stimulated the development of a powerful heavy industrial system, following what was preached at the time by Friedrich List. In particular, the key point of List preaching was that second-comers countries need to protect their industrialization process (characterized by infant industries) from foreign competition. According to List, once the protected industries reach an adequate competitive level, protection should be removed and the national companies should face competition in the market, in order to stimulate further technological development. Many second-comers countries embraced this model; however, in most cases they failed to follow the second part of List’s recommendations: opening to the market in a second stage.
N15|Chinese National Income, ca. 1661–1933|This paper pulls together many primary and secondary sources to arrive at consistent estimates of national income for china between the 17th and 20th centuries. We find, in line with much of the literature, that GDP per capita declined between the mid-17th and 19th centuries. This trend reversed during the 19th century, mainly due to a shift into services and, for the late 19th century onwards, also in industry. Since these sectors exhibited higher labour productivity, this fostered economic growth. This pattern of decreasing share of services and industry from the 17th century and increasing shares in the 19th century is common in many Asian countries except Japan. The reasons for this development, however, are unclear. The standard ultimate factors of growth such as institutions (low marriage age for women, exclusive society) and geography apply to almost all Asian countries. Hence, more research is necessary.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N15|Making the most of high inflation| This article examines the relationship between the real effects of inflation and its level in countries with frequent episodes of high inflation. The real effects are computed as asymmetric impulse responses of output to inflation separately in the regimes with different signs of the differences between the expected inflation and the predicted output-neutral inflation. It is found that, with the increase in inflation, such effects increase in the regime with the positive sign, relatively to the effects in the regime with the negative sign. It is also shown that this finding is valid for most countries with high inflation episodes, where inflation is greater than 4.8% for at least 25% of quarterly observations. This leads to a simple policy prescription that, in economies with frequent high inflation episodes, anti-inflationary monetary decisions are least damaging for output if undertaken in the periods when the difference between the expected and output-neutral inflation is negative.
N15|Human capital in Qing China: economic determinism or a history of failed opportunities?|The traditional education system in Qing China has been widely debated over the past decades. Some have argued it was efficient and furthered economic growth, while others have stressed its inefficient nature, which led to the introduction of the modern education system in the closing decades of the 19th century, followed by its total collapse in 1905. In this paper we make a first try to quantify above debate. Starting from the observation that below the well-known civil examination system there existed a whole system of popular and vocational education, we find that years of education in the population were still lower than in many European countries. More interestingly, whereas in European countries years of education increased strongly in the 19th century, our estimates of average years of education and the ABCC indices show that the level of education remained stable well into the 1920s when it accelerated. However, the main rise only occurred during the late 20th century. This finding leads to an interesting question since per capita income only started to grow significantly since the 1950s. This means that the rise of education since the mid-1920s was not as such driven by per capita income. Apparently this was the same for both the traditional and modern education since the latter had already started to transform Chinese education from the 1890s onwards. Hence, we have to look at the question why persons decided to follow education, i.e. was it individually profitable to follow education (positive private returns)? However, testing for this latter hypothesis shows that, after correction for foregone earnings, life expectancy, and probability of passing the exams, only the below shengyuan level students actually had positive returns. For an ordinary person it was therefore uneconomical to join in the civil examination system. Apparently this did not change, not even after the introduction of the modern education system, until the 1950s.
N15|The Trade-off between Fertility and Education: Evidence from the Korean Development Path|Unified Growth Theory suggests the demographic transition and the associated rise in human capital formation were critical forces in the transition from Malthusian stagnation to modern economic growth. This paper provides empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis based on the development process in Korea. Exploiting variations in fertility in human capital formation across regions in Korea over the period 1970 to 2010, the study establishes that the process of development in Korea was associated with a reduction in child quantity and increase child quality.
N15|A 'Trojan Horse' in Daoguang China?: Explaining the flows of silver (and opium) in and out of China|Economic historians have offered several explanations for China’s cycles of silverisation and de-silverisation in the 18th and 19th centuries focusing either on exogenous supply shortages in world silver markets or an outflow of silver as a consequence of opium imports. This paper challenges both existing “supply-side” and “demand-side” explanations. Section two shows that the supply side change was not a decline in the quantity of silver but in the quality of imported silver coins after the 1820s. Section three shows that this led to a decline in demand because China did not perform as a classic bi-metallic system as usually assumed. Because China lacked monetary sovereignty, the Chinese adopted a foreign coin, the Spanish American peso as the preferred means of payment in some areas of southern China, and increasingly further into the interior. Section four presents evidence for the exchange rate premium of the Spanish American silver coin over other coins and, more importantly, over silver sycee in China after the 1790s. This allowed for large-scale arbitrage by means of acquiring silver sycee in China for export, while bringing coined silver to China. Underlying this sort of 'dollarization' in China was opium. Hence section five shows that opium imports did not trigger the outflow of silver. Instead the flight of silver in fact seems to be the cause for large opium imports.
N15|Türkiye'nin Gayrisafi Yurtiçi Hasılası 2002-2012'de Ne Kadar Büyüdü?<BR>[How much has Turkey's GDP grown between 2002 and 2012?]|"In The Economist dated June 8, 2013, it was stated that ""Turkey's GDP per person had tripled in the past ten years"". In the following issue, however, the editors corrected this information and wrote that ""this was true only in nominal terms. In real terms, GDP per person has risen by just 43%."" This statement of correction triggered a hot and long-lasting debate in the social media between Dr. Dani Rodrik, a world-wide known Turkish professor of economics, and Mr. Mehmet Şimşek, Minister of Finance of the Republic of Turkey, about the selection of most suitable indicator in evaluation of economic growth performance of Turkey between 2002 and 2012. This study firstly documents the details of the two countering arguments and development of the debate between an academic economist and a politician. It then reviews (and discusses the appropriateness of) various indicators of real and nominal (per-capita) economic growth in economic(s) discussions. For non-economists, this piece will helpful in understanding whether Rodrik, who uses the ""real (per-capita) GDP growth"", or Şimşek, who prefers to consider the ""nominal GDP, in US dollar terms"", in evaluating Turkey’s growth performance, is right, and to what extent."
N15|GDP Fluctuations and Private Investment: A Macro Panel Analysis of Selected South Asian Countries|The current study examines the relationship between GDP fluctuations and private investment by using macro panel approach in a panel of five selected South Asian countries (SSAC) including Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka for the period of 1980-2010. The study applies modern non-stationary panel techniques such as cross section dependence test, unit root test under cross sectional dependence, panel cointegration and Group Mean Fully Modified OLS (GM-FMOLS) estimation. The study finds a long-run co-integrating relationship between GDP fluctuations and private investment in the SSAC. GM-FMOLS estimates show that this link is negative. Thus, the results indicate that GDP fluctuations have a significant negative impact on private investment in SSAC as GDP volatility gives a negative signal to private investors. The study also suggests that GDP volatility may be harmful for private investment in developing countries and negative effect on private investment will also be transferred to growth as the investment is a key determinant of growth. So, the governments of developing countries should equally focus on managing the volatility of GDP to increase private investment along with other measures for creating an investment-friendly environment. Additionally, an increase in private investment will further help in maintenance of stability.
N15|Dynamic relationships between oil revenues, government spending and economic growth in an oil-dependent economy|The aim of this paper is to empirically examine the dynamic relationships between oil revenues, government spending and economic growth in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Oil revenues are the main source of financing government expenditures and imports of good and services. Increasing oil prices in the recent years have boosted public expenditures on social and economic infrastructure. In this paper, we investigate whether the huge government spending has enhanced the pace of economic growth or not. To this end, we use a multivariate cointegration analysis and error-correction model and data for 1960–2010. Overall results suggest that oil revenues remain the principal source for growth and the main channel which finance the government spending.
N15|Are Investment and Savings Cointegrated? Evidence from Middle East and North African Countries|The aim of this paper is to empirically examine the relationship between saving and investment for 6 Middle East and North African Countries for the period 1980-2008. To this end, we use panel cointegration analysis and Error Correction Model. The long run estimation reveals causality between investment and saving for the entire sample. The Granger causality tests confirm this result and validate the presence of bidirectional causal relationship between investment and saving. However, the short run estimation shows no causality between the two variables for the entire sample. At the individual level, saving Granger cause investment for Bahrain and Saudi Arabia only.
N15|Japanese Economy in 2007-2010|This article focuses on the Japanese economy and its development in 2007-2010. It pays special attention to the deep economic crisis in 2008-2009 (the biggest economic slump in Japan after World War II). Factors of this crisis were mostly external (strong decline in Japanese exports and foreign inward investment due to the falling external demand, instability and strong uncertainty in the world economy during the financial crisis in the USA and other developed countries). Nevertheless, the economic slump in Japan was fuelled by low domestic demand and investment as well. The aim of this study is to remind of and analyse the most important trends, achievements and problems of the Japanese economy in 2007-2010. It focuses especially on the economic crisis in 2008- 2009, development of Japanese external trade during the crisis and the governmental countermeasures, both fiscal and monetary. The study outlines the development of the Japanese economy both before and after the crisis.
N15|Japanese Economy After the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011|After a sharp contraction in the economic activity in 2008-2009 (the biggest economic slump in Japan after World War II), the Japanese economy started to recover in 2010. The Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami of March 2011 brought Japan´s recovery to a halt. It ruined vast parts of Japan´s north-eastern coastal areas and damaged key infrastructure. It was one of the most destructive earthquakes in all of the Japanese history. This article focuses on the Japanese economy and its development in 2010-2012. It pays special attention to the economic impact of the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011 (damage to private capital and public infrastructure, electricity shortages, supply chain disruptions, decline in production and exports, etc.). The aim of this study is to recapitulate and analyse the development of the Japanese economy in 2010-2012 and to analyse both the immediate and long-term impacts of the Great East Japan Earthquake on the Japanese economy. It focuses on the government countermeasures and new economic strategies with respect to the latest natural disaster.
N15|Implications for the Australian Economy of Strong Growth in Asia|Strong growth in Asia, particularly in China, has had a profound impact on the Australian economy over the past decade. Most notable so far has been the boom in the resource sector, with commodity prices and hence Australia's terms of trade rising to historically high levels over a number of years. This has been accompanied by a sizeable appreciation of the exchange rate. While the terms of trade have passed their peak, the substantial investment in productive capacity of the resource sector in recent years is expected to provide a large boost to the production and exports of resources in coming years. In this paper we describe how the pattern of structural adjustment to the positive terms of trade shock has, to date, proceeded broadly in line with that suggested by a simple theoretical model that distinguishes between three broadly defined sectors: the resource sector, the 'other tradable' sector and the non-tradable sector. In particular, relative wages and prices adjusted in a way that facilitated the reallocation of factors of production towards the resource sector. While not all parts of the economy have benefited, the process of adjustment thus far has occurred relatively smoothly in a macroeconomic sense; inflation has remained within the target range, or not too far from it, unemployment has remained relatively low and output has grown at close to trend rates. This stands in stark contrast to some earlier episodes of terms of trade booms in Australia. We argue that macroeconomic adjustment to the current terms of trade shock has been facilitated by the appreciation of the exchange rate, the anchoring of inflation expectations and labour market dynamics whereby wage pressures in industries or regions experiencing strong conditions associated with the boom in resource investment have not spilled over to parts of the economy experiencing weaker conditions.
N15|Economic and Financial Crises in Fifteenth-Century Egypt: Lessons From the History|The present paper attempts to study the economic and financial crises of 15th century Egypt, which was ruled by Mamluk dynasty. Two social thinkers of the time – al-Maqrizi at the beginning of the century and al-Asadi at the middle – addressed the situation. To the former, deterioration of Egypt’s monetary system was the single most important cause of its economic and financial difficulties. As a panacea, he prescribed a return to gold and silver standard and restricting copper coinage to petty transactions. The latter divided the factors responsible for economic and financial crises into socioeconomic factor and monetary factor. He advocated for an overall reform and strict management of the whole economy. The main financial problem, in his opinion, was debasement of currency leading to unrestricted supply of money, not the issue of copper coins. The paper concludes with an appraisal of their diagnosis of the problem, the solution suggested by them and the lessons learned from them.
N15|Are Asian Business Cycles Different?| This paper studies the unusual features of emerging economy business cycles in Asia. When we assess whether approaches from the previous literature can explain Asian business cycles, we conclude that standard models based on permanent growth shocks do not replicate key features of Asian business cycles. The evidence suggests that different transmission mechanisms explain the connections between consumption, net exports, and export or import in Latin America and Asia. For evidence of a special transmission mechanism, we study durable goods business cycles in Asia (Korea), noting that strong pro-cyclical durable goods consumption may be explained by the export-income channel coupled with market laddering by which firms have expanded the variety and quality of their durable goods production. © 2013 The Earth Institute at Columbia University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
N15|Understanding China's Growth: Past, Present, and Future|The pace and scale of China's economic transformation have no historical precedent. In 1978, China was one of the poorest countries in the world. The real per capita GDP in China was only one-fortieth of the U.S. level and one-tenth the Brazilian level. Since then, China's real per capita GDP has grown at an average rate exceeding 8 percent per year. As a result, China's real per capita GDP is now almost one-fifth the U.S. level and at the same level as Brazil. This rapid and sustained improvement in average living standard has occurred in a country with more than 20 percent of the worldâ€™s population so that China is now the second-largest economy in the world. I will begin by discussing briefly China's historical growth performance from 1800 to 1950. I then present growth accounting results for the period from 1952 to 1978 and the period since 1978, decomposing the sources of growth into capital deepening, labor deepening, and productivity growth. But the main focus of this paper will be to examine the sources of growth since 1978, the year when China started economic reform. Perhaps surprisingly, given China's well-documented sky-high rates of saving and investment, I will argue that Chinaâ€™s rapid growth over the last three decades has been driven by productivity growth rather than by capital investment. I also examine the contributions of sector-level productivity growth, and of resource reallocation across sectors and across firms within a sector, to aggregate productivity growth. Overall, gradual and persistent institutional change and policy reforms that have reduced distortions and improved economic incentives are the main reasons for the productivity growth.
N15|Japan´s lost decade: on the development of the Japanese economy in the 1990s|The objective of this article is to describe and analyse the economic development and to summarize and explain the most important factors that have caused the long-term stagnation and instability of the Japanese economy in the 1990s (so called „lost decade“). The asset price bubble collapse at the beginning of the 1990s has probably activated and amplified impacts of other complicated processes in the economy, especially of the protracted deflation and insufficient final domestic consumption. The burst of the bubble has negatively affected both Japanese financial sector, production and investment activity of Japanese companies etc. It is also possible to identify some important structural deficiencies and rigidities that limit both the effectiveness of government anti-stagnation measures and development of the supply side of the Japanese economy.

N15|La inversión extranjera directa, las exportaciones, el producto interno bruto y el mercado laboral en Puerto Rico|En este trabajo se utiliza un modelo de vectores autorregresivos (VAR) para examinar la interrelación entre la entrada de flujos de inversión extranjera directa (EFIED), las exportaciones, el producto interno bruto (PIB), la tasa de desempleo (TD) y la tasa de participación laboral (TPL) en Puerto Rico. Los datos utilizados incluyen los años fisca- les de 1980 al 2010. Se encontraron cuatro vectores cointegrados en el sistema, que evidencian la existencia de una relación de largo plazo entre las variables. Los hallazgos sugieren que aumentos consecutivos en la EFIED podrían reducir significativamente la TD e incrementar el interés de los puertorriqueños por ingresar en la fuerza laboral. El mismo resultado se refleja con relación a los incrementos en el nivel de exportaciones. Las variaciones en el PIB se explican principalmente en el largo plazo por la TD.
N15|Las opciones reales como metodología alternativa en la evaluación de proyectos de inversión|Este trabajo busca ampliar la aplicabilidad de la metodología de valoración de proyectos de inversión por medio de opciones reales como un elemento fundamental al momento de tomar una decisión de si se debe invertir o no. Se hace un recorrido por las técnicas tradicionales para valorar un proyecto de inversión y se plantean los vacíos que estos dejan, con respecto a proyectos en los que su principal característica es la incertidumbre. Se realiza un paralelo entre las opciones financieras y las opciones reales que permita valorar, utilizando la metodología de los árboles binomiales. Por último, se elabora un caso del que se plantea valorar una opción de espera y una opción de expandir de manera conjunta en el sector de la construcción.
N15|China's economic fluctuations and consumption smoothing: Is consumption more volatile than output in China?|This paper provides a fundamental study of China's consumption and output fluctuations. The most recent literature reports that, in the post-1978 period, detrended consumption is significantly more volatile than detrended output in China. This indicates the inability to impose consumption smoothing. However, in those previous studies, consumption of durables, which has some features of capital, as discussed in the real business cycle literature, was not separated from private consumption. This paper is the first to estimate consumer durables for China and their service values following the method introduced in Cooley and Prescott (1995). We adjust the consumption measure to make it consistent with the real business cycle literature, and find that consumption of durables is much more volatile than output, but non-durable consumption is less volatile than, and less correlated with, output that provides evidence that supports consumption smoothing in China.
N15|Property rights and institutions in biblical society: The purchase of the Cave of the Patriarchs|A market economy and civil society require specification and certification of property rights. Where property rights are recognized, allowable transactions are also institutionally specified. In this paper we describe and analyze the earliest documented transfer of property rights to land, in Hebron in the 17th century BCE when Abraham purchased the Cave of the Patriarchs from Ephron the Hittite. We show how a property right perspective with institutional constraint on permissible transactions resolves the puzzles that have been previously noted in the bargaining between the buyer and seller.
N15|Contesting the indigenous development of “Chinese double-entry bookkeeping” and its significance in China’s economic institutions and business organization before c.1850|The recent rapid growth of China’s economy has reopened historical debate about the extent to which it prospered during the Míng and Qīng dynasties (1368-1911) through developing a significant market orientation on the base of its underlying agricultural bureaucratic feudalism. As a contribution to this debate, we question here the extent to which there is justification for claims concerning the development of a concomitant and indigenous Chinese form of double-entry bookkeeping (CDEB)—seen as having developed among bankers, merchants and proto-industrialists—and for its significance within such a market economy. Given that discussion on post-medieval European accounting history indicates that there is not necessarily a direct and positive connection between the development of Italian double-entry bookkeeping (DEB) and associated practices of entity accounting, and the development from the sixteenth century of Western capitalism, we argue that caution should be exercised in drawing any analogous connection in the Chinese context. But equally we wish to raise a more foundational issue concerning the similarities and differences between the knowledge worlds within which DEB and CDEB emerged, as a means to better reading the specific historical practices and discourses of each. We therefore review the invention and dissemination of western DEB as a technology emerging within a textually and semiotically changing knowledge world in the Latin West from the twelfth century AD, and consider how the evidence for the development and use of CDEB may then be reviewed in the context of the Chinese knowledge world. As part of such a reading, we focus on tracing possible intercultural linkages between the Western and Chinese developments across the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries. In this way we seek to problematise conventional formulations of the respective significance of both DEB and CDEB, while acknowledging that, at the current moment of such transcultural historical study, the mechanisms of translation and diffusion of practices and discourses generally remain obscure and inconclusive until the era of the transformation of China’s modern economy in recent decades. There remains a clear need for further research utilising primary archival sources to test the arguments developed in the existing research literatures, and here.
N15|From Divergence to Convergence: Reevaluating the History behind China's Economic Boom|China's long-term economic dynamics pose a formidable challenge to economic historians. The Qing Empire (1644-1911), the world's largest national economy before 1800, experienced a tripling of population during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries with no signs of diminishing per capita income. While the timing remains in dispute, a vast gap emerged between newly rich industrial nations and China's lagging economy in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. Only with an unprecedented growth spurt beginning in the late 1970s did this great divergence separating China from the global leaders substantially diminish, allowing China to regain its former standing among the world's largest economies. This essay develops an integrated framework for understanding that entire history, including both the divergence and the recent convergent trend. We explain how deeply embedded political and economic institutions that contributed to a long process of extensive growth before 1800 subsequently prevented China from capturing the benefits associated with the Industrial Revolution. During the twentieth century, the gradual erosion of these historic constraints and of new obstacles erected by socialist planning eventually opened the door to China's current boom. Our analysis links China's recent development to important elements of its past, while using recent success to provide fresh perspectives on the critical obstacles undermining earlier modernization efforts, and their eventual removal.
N15|Money and monetary system in China in the 19th-20th century: an overview|This article provides an historical overview on the development of Chinese money and monetary regimes between about 1800 and 1950. It develops a simple conceptual framework based on the relative costs of assessing the inherent value of the currencies of different denomination. Based on this framework, I develop a historical narrative that ties important political and institutional changes with the evolving structural changes in the Chinese monetary regime marked by the vicissitudes in the use of copper, silver currencies and paper money in both the private and public financial sectors from the Opium War in mid-19th century to the end of the Civil War in the 1950s.

N15|Nonlinear investigations of China's agricultural transformation based on the structural break regime switching model|Purpose - Investigating the characteristics of the transformation of China's agricultural growth and the institutional reforms during the whole transition period in the 1980s will help to understand China's economic and agricultural reform and offer some successful experiences to other developing countries. The purpose of this paper is to answer the following questions: Has China's agricultural output experienced a structural break toward a more stable state? When did the break point happen? What factors did play key roles during the transformation? Design/methodology/approach - This study applies the nonlinear structural break regime switching analysis which includes two different models: one with the structural break only in the variance and one with the structural break in both shift parameters and the variance. Findings - The empirical results showed that it took five years for agricultural development in China to finish the reform that began in 1980. The agricultural growth had become more stable after the break point which was around 1985-1986. Both the primary industry and agricultural sector had transformed from a “low growth rate, high volatility” state to a “high growth rate, low volatility” state. Among the different driving factors, the Household Responsibility System (HRS) and preferential policies for agricultural products played the most important roles in the early stage of the economic reform. Originality/value - The authors first study the structural break of China's agricultural output by the regime switching model. From the empirical results, the structural break point was determined to be around 1985-1986, after which China's agricultural output had become more stable.
N15|Pays émergents : fin de la surchauffe|Le retournement du commerce international, la crise de confiance et les politiques monétaires restrictives mises en place en 2010 et 2011 ont eu raison de la vigueur de la croissance en Asie et en Amérique latine. Les écarts de production étaient refermés depuis plus d’un an et les signes de surchauffe inflationniste apparaissaient. Le ralentissement a donc permis d’éloigner ce risque. Le ralentissement des exportations a commencé à mordre sur l’investissement mais la demande intérieure a plutôt bien résisté. Dans l’hypothèse d’un atterrissage brutal de la croissance en 2012, des marges de manoeuvre existent. Le ralentissement des pressions inflationnistes a déjà permis d’engager la détente monétaire ou de mettre fin à la hausse. Parallèlement, bénéficiant de situations budgétaires relativement saines, les pays d’Asie mettent en place des politiques de soutien à la croissance. En Amérique latine, la relance budgétaire n’est pas à l’ordre du jour, à l’exception du Brésil qui y a déjà recourue. À l’inverse, le diagnostic est beaucoup plus sombre dans les pays d’Europe de l’Est. Le choc est d’autant plus difficile à absorber que leur dépendance commerciale et financière à l’égard de la zone euro est plus importante et que leur écart de production n’a cessé de se creuser depuis 2008. La demande intérieure demeure paralysée par l’insolvabilité de nombre d’agents privés endettés en devises, alors que chaque secousse produite par la crise de la dette conduit à de nouvelles dépréciations de change. La politique monétaire ne s’assouplira qu’à la marge. Dans un contexte de contrainte budgétaire extrêmement forte, les marges de manoeuvre apparaissent donc faibles, et l’Europe de l’Est semble aujourd’hui condamnée à attendre le retour de la croissance à ses frontières

N15|By a Silken Thread: Regional banking integration and pathways to financial development in Japan's Great Recession|We examine the impact of cross-prefectural differences in financial integration on the regional spread of Japan's Great Recession in the early 1990s. In prefectures with many small manufacturing firms, post-1990 growth was significantly lower if low levels of banking integration with the rest of the country before 1990 existed. The least financially integrated and most credit-dependent prefectures also saw the largest declines in lending by major banks operating nationwide. This suggests that financing frictions were more severe in less financially integrated regions. We then show that cross-prefectural differences in financial integration in the late 20th century can be explained by regionally different pathways to financial development after Japan's opening in the late 19th century. Silk reeling emerged as Japan's main export industry after 1868. The silk industry was heavily dependent on credit for working capital, but silk reelers in the mountainous regions of central Japan generally could not borrow from the large banks in Yokohama or the other major cities. Instead, they either formed local credit cooperatives or local banks were founded with the help of Yokohama silk merchants who then effectively provided the silk reelers with trade credit. The silk regions therefore embarked on a path to financial development in which banking remained centered on a largely mutual or cooperative model and in which banks borrow and lend mainly regionally. Thus, the banking system of the late 19th-century silk-exporting regions was effectively less financially integrated with the rest of the country at the onset of the Great Recession of the 1990s. Using the number of silk filatures per capita at prefecture level in 1895 as an instrumental variable, we corroborate our result that the post-1990 decline was worse in prefectures with low levels of banking integration and high credit dependence.
N15|Gateway Cities and Urbanisation in Southeast Asia Before World War II|Between the 1870s and World War II, falls in world shipping costs and Western industrialisation gave rise to export-led Southeast Asian growth and specialization in a narrow range of primary commodity exports. A linked development was the emergence of a few dominant Southeast Asian urban centres, typically primate and always ports. Drawing on historical census data, this paper uses rank-size distributions and transition matrices to investigate the influence of commodity specialisation and exports on urban systems development in the region. It is argued that different commodities produced different spread effects, resulting in variation in degrees of urban concentration in the region. However, geography, path dependence and infrastructrue also shaped urban systems development. The main cities that emerged during this period became the 'gateways' that connected frontier Southeast Asia to the Global economy.
N15|Financing Japan's World War II Occupation of Southeast Asia|This paper analyzes how Japan financed its World War II occupation of Southeast Asia, the transfer of resources to Japan, and the monetary and inflation consequences of Japanese policies. In Malaya, Burma, Indonesia and the Philippines, the issue of military scrip to pay for resources and occupying armies greatly increased money supply. Despite high inflation, hyperinflation hardly occurred because of a sustained transactions demand for money, because of Japan's strong enforcement of monetary monopoly, and because of declining Japanese military capability to ship resources home. In Thailand and Indochina, occupation costs and bilateral clearing arrangements created near open-ended Japanese purchasing power and allowed the transfer to Japan of as much as a third of Indochina's annual GDP. Although the Thai and Indochinese governments financed Japanese demands mainly by printing large quantities of money, inflation rose only in line with monetary expansion due to money's continued use as a store of value in rice-surplus areas.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N15|An Exploratory Research Over The Chinese Products On The Romanian Market|In this paper we studied the influence on the Asian products over the consumer decision making. We observed that because of the economic crisis most of the people are buying products made in China, although they now that the quality and the price are lower. The factors that change the habits and the consumer behavior decision making are: the lower wage, the small number of work places and the prices of the products. Regarding the low price of Chinese products quality, some times arouses suspicions. Romania is a parts of the European Union and on the market there are various products made in European countries but also products made in China. People with low wages from the last step of social classes are prone to buy lower prices products. Other consumers on the contrary became more sensitive and they prefer to pay more than to buy products made in China. The quality prevails over the price and sometimes over the quantity although the money to spend are dwindled. The crisis affected consumer behavior, consumers have become more attentive to the country of origin and the disposable income for shopping. In order to validate some of the ideas the authors undertook a quantitative online research. The research had as purpose to identify the main influences of the decision making when the consumer buys Chinese products. The chosen investigation was the selective survey, the research technique was the exploratory interrogation and the research instrument -structured in online questionnaire. After research we found that the economic crisis caused consumer behavior change as a result of diminishing the income buyers, the consumer is placed in a position to buy products of questionable quality at low prices, mostly from China. Lower purchase price often makes Chinese goods represent an attractive option for consumers. On the other hand, the quality of Chinese products has proven to not comply with the quality expectations of the consumers, based on the use of products manufactured in other countries. Romanian consumer has been shifted his chooses because of the very low income and at the same time the culture purchasing pattern. For this reason, this research focuses on the changing buying behaviour in the period of economic crisis.
N15|Japanese Monopolist Companies Instruments Of The 'National Policy'|As the title suggests, this article discusses the problem of monopolistic Japanese companies, unique features among advanced countries, and perhaps worldwide. The japanese most ardent desire was always to reach and to overcome the Western, and, as a balanced development of all companies would have taken a long time, japanese policy makers decided to support only those with good performances, around them being concentrated all energies in the east Asian archipelago. Following these important efforts (from the State, small and medium companies, people, etc.), as it is well known, Japan has succeeded, precisely by those holdings, to become a tough opponent for developed countries and even to overcome them, becoming the second global power behind the United States. The importance of this article derives precisely from the fact that these companies (Zaibatsu and later hondings) were the driving force behind Japan\'s economic development, whether we talk about the period preceding the Second World War or the next one. Even if after the American occupation, it was wanted with at all costs their liquidation, holdings being considered as close to prewar militaristic power, after the American withdrawal from the archipelago, they were rebuilt as a Japanese principle, the foundation of Japanese reconstruction.The paper aims to embody the main dimensions on which these companies have arrived, as well as their structure, the relations between them, their organization.On the topic discussed, the literature contains more general issue of the Japanese economy, without being paid (at least in the contemporary period) consideration to these main pillars of Japanese capitalism development. The main work in which they are giving increased attention is written at the end of the Second World War, thus the need for the additions concerning the next period is important. The authors'(tm) contribution lies precisely in the synthesis of information that he provides, from the appearance of Zaibatsu in the mid-Meiji era, until the Great Depression of the 1990s.

N15|Our Ancestors, Our Heroes: Saudi Tribal Campaigns to Suppress Historical Docudramas|"Scholars of Arab media have explored key aspects of Gulf-Levant media integration in the wake of the privatization of Arab media over the past several decades. Their studies tend to characterize the controversies that arise from this integration in terms of the relative influence of Islamist or religious values on producers and consumers. Yet behind these Gulf-Levant tensions, this paper will argue, there is also a different cultural logic at work, one that engages other dimensions of culture apart from the religious, and concerns the relationship between documentation and authority in a once predominantly nomadic society. This logic was brought to the fore in the controversy over the Syrian-produced, Gulf-financed, Ramadan television series Finjan al-Damm (""Cup of Blood""). The Finjan al-Damm controversy speaks to a number of concerns that are crucial for understanding social and political life in the Arabian Peninsula today. These include the nature of censorship in Saudi Arabia; the nature of citizen activism in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf monarchies; and the Saudi state?s attitude toward tribalism. Underlying these concerns, the Finjan al-Damm story underscores a new consciousness about the relationship between documentation and authority in societies transitioning from predominantly oral to textual cultures."
N15|Does Government Debt Promote Economic Growth? An Empirical Analysis with Structural Breaks for the Economy of China|This paper investigates the relationship between economic growth and government debt for one of the biggest economies in the world, the economy of China. The data were fitted into a regression equation using econometric techniques such as unit root tests and Granger causality. Regarding unit root tests we are using three kind of tests: i) The conventional unit tests, which do not take into account structural breaks, ii) the unit root tests that take into account one structural break and iii) tests that take into account multiple structural breaks. The analysis is based on data over the period 1984 to 2011 for China. The results reveal that there are structural breaks in the economy of China but no Granger causality between the variables.
N15|The Five-Phases of Economic Development and Institutional Evolution in China and Japan|ï»¿Based on the variable rate of gross domestic product per capita growth and its sources, this paper first identifies five phases of economic development that are common to China, Japan, and Korea : M (Malthusian), G (government-led), K (Ã la Kuznets), H (human capital based) and PD (post demographic-transition). But there are also marked differences in the onset, duration, and institutional forms of these phases across these economies. In order to understand these differences, this paper explores the agrarian origins of institutions in Qing China and Tokugawa Japan (and briefly ChosÅ n Korea) and their path-dependent transformations over those phases. In doing so, the paper employs game-theoretic reasoning and interpretations of divergent institutional evolution between China and Japan, which also clarifies the simplicity of prevailing arguments that identify East Asian developmental and institutional features with authoritarianism, collectivism, kinship-dominance, Confucianism and the like. Finally, the paper examines the relevance of the foregoing developmental discussions to the institutional agendas faced by China and Japan in their respective emergent phase-transitions. In what way can China avoid the â€œmiddle income trapâ€ ? What institutional shortcomings become evident from the Fukushima catastrophe and how can they be overcome in an aging Japan?

N15|China's Inflation: Demand-Pull or Cost-Push?| This paper studies the determinants of China's inflation and finds that demand-pull factors have been more important than cost-push factors in driving the inflation in the past decade. Because China's economic growth will gradually moderate and because the adjustment of the prices of the factors of production is also underway, the cost-push factors may soon play a more significant role in driving future inflation. Thus the Keynesian-style demand-side policy will not be enough to control inflation. More attention must now be given to supply-side management—such as dismantling monopolies, boosting private investment, encouraging innovation, and improving productivity—to mitigate the medium- to long-term inflation pressure. © 2012 The Earth Institute at Columbia University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
N15|Globalisation and the Ottoman Empire: A study of integration between Ottoman and world cotton markets|The Ottoman Empire underwent a process of integration with the global economy during the second half of the Nineteenth Century. This paper explores one aspect of this process, examining the linkages established between the cotton industries in Egypt and Western Anatolia, which we consider as part of the Empire, and the international cotton market during the first wave of globalisation. We undertake a quantitative exploration of the pattern of price transmission between the Ottoman and the international cotton markets over this period, connecting changes in the nature of spatial market integration to major economic and political developments.

N15|How Vulnerable are Arab Countries to Global Food Price Shocks?| We estimate pass-through effects of international food price movements into domestic food prices for 18 countries in the Middle East and North Africa, using threshold regressions. International price movements transmit to various degrees into domestic prices. Transmission is mostly asymmetric, pushing domestic price levels up as increases in international food prices are typically passed through, but declines are rarely transmitted. This situation is indicative of policy and market distortions, notably the presence of food subsidies in the context of fiscal constraints. Hence, both international prices and their volatility matter for domestic inflation, yet domestic factors also play a role.
N15|'By a Silken Thread': regional banking integration and credit reallocation during Japan’s Lost Decade|During Japan’s ‘Lost Decade’, reallocation of credit through the internal capital markets of country-wide banks mitigated the real effects from the bank liqudity shock in prefectures with many bank-dependent SMEs. We document that the regional fragmentation of banking markets in Japan goes back to the institutions set up for silk export finance in the late 19th century. Using silk as an instrument for modern-day regional banking integration, we find even stronger evidence of credit reallocation than in our baseline OLS-specifications. The sign of this OLS-bias is consistent with the underlying heterogeneity in bank-firm matches implied by the theory.
N15|Le renminbi doit-il être réévalué ? Les leçons de l'expérience japonaise|There is a similarity of pattern between the present international pressures for RMB revaluation and those which were exerted on Japan in the ?80s for the Yen revaluation. This paper aims at clarifying certain issues of the RMB revaluation debate in the light of Japan?s experience. Two lessons may be drawn from this experience. First the massive revaluation of the Yen against the USD after the 1985 Plaza Agreement did not reduce the US trade deficit, as Japan?s competitiveness was due primarily to the technological quality of its products. The second lesson is that the steep and massive revaluation of the Yen had devastating effects on the Japanese economy, which went through the ?lost decade? during the ?90s. Mutatis mutandis, these lessons may apply today in the case of China. Its currency is indeed undervalued, possibly by 20-25% on a REER basis. However a revaluation of the RMB of such size would not reduce US and European trade deficits as much as expected, because China?s competitiveness is primarily due to its very low cost of labor. Furthermore, the appreciation should be gradual, although sustained, in order to avoid major economic disruptions. But a steady appreciation of the RMB would be in China?s best interest, all the more as it has presently to adjust its model of development. Classification JEL: E2, E5, F10, F31, N15, N25.
N15|Exchange Rate Policy and Regional Integration in Asia|"Asian foreign exchange markets are under pressure. Since 2007, good macroeconomic fundamentals, favourable growth prospects and high interest rates have made the emerging countries a favourite destination for capital. Though the crisis interrupted these flows at the end of 2008, the American monetary policy of ""Quantitative Easing"" accelerated the inflows of capital because it forced the emerging countries to raise their interest rates to combat inflation. Now, due to its increasingly integrated trade, price competitiveness and stable bilateral exchange rates are important factors in Asia's economic good health. The countries in the area intervene on the foreign exchange markets to prevent their currencies from appreciating. It is not just China that is resorting to this strategy; other countries have been much more active in bearing down on the exchange rate. How can the countries in the area maintain the stability of their exchange rates? As China is obviously the magnet for trade flows within the area, what role does the renminbi play in the exchange rate policies of the other Asian emerging countries? When we look empirically at these questions, we have to ask ourselves whether a de facto monetary area is forming and therefore whether there now exists a process of decoupling from the dollar. Can a loose monetary area form implicitly, without the coordination of regional monetary rules?"
N15|The determinants of east asian regionalism|ABSTRACTEast Asia has been experiencing an epic progress of regionalism overthe last decade with China, Japan, and Korea (CJK) as the most prominentactors. Regionally speaking, East Asia has been nurtured by a market-drivenexpansion of trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) that leads the bottomupregionalism process. However, this paper argues that the bottom-up processalone is not enough since a more institutionalized approach is needed. From astatic panel data simulation, it is found that sound transportation infrastructure,good governance, competitive taxation policies, sizeable markets, goodeducation, democracy and the trend towards industrialization are the mainfactors that serve as building blocks for East Asian regionalism.___________RESUMENAsia oriental ha experimentado un progreso épico del regionalismo enla última década, con China, Japón y Corea (CJK), como los actores más destacados.Regionalmente hablando, Asia oriental ha sido alimentado por unaexpansión impulsada por el mercado del comercio y la inversión extranjeradirecta (IED) que lidera el proceso de regionalismo, de abajo hacia arriba. Sinembargo, este trabajo sostiene que el proceso de abajo hacia arriba por sí solono es suficiente, ya que se necesita un enfoque más institucional. Desde unpanel de simulación estática de datos, se comprueba que la infraestructurade transporte, el buen gobierno, políticas de competencia fiscal, los mercadosde gran envergadura, buena educación, la democracia y la tendencia haciala industrialización son los principales factores que sirven como bloques deconstrucción para el regionalismo de asia oriental.
N15|Long-run patterns in market efficiency and the genesis of the market economy: Markets around the Mediterranean from Nebuchadnezzar to Napoleon (580 BC and 1800AD)|Price volatility, reflecting the ability to absorb exogenous supply- or demand shocks, is an important dimension of market performance. In this paper we present a model to study the factors determining the price volatility of markets of basic foodstuffs in pre industrial societies. This model is used to explain the development of price volatility on markets in countries around the Mediterranean between 580 BC and 1800 AD. This is the region for which we have the oldest evidence of functioning markets (from Mesopotamia), so that we can track their development in time over a period of more than 2000 years. We find a break in market performance: medieval markets had a much lower level of volatility than ancient markets--a fact we try to explain within our model. Moreover, we suggest that this reduction in price volatility may have had important consequences for the economic behavior of farmers: price variability had to be reduced to the level that we find for the post-1000 period to induce farmers to specialize.
N15|Has China's Economy Become More Stable and Inertial? Nonlinear Investigations Based on Structural Break and Duration Dependent Regime Switching Models|"In this study we use both the structural break model and duration dependent transition model to study the characteristics of China's GDP growth from 1953 to 2009. The empirical results show that China's economic growth had become more stable since the economic reform in the end of the 1970s, and had transformed from a ""low growth rate, high volatility"" state to a ""high growth rate, low volatility"" state. In contrast to other transitional countries, China's structural break did not happen immediately, but rather it experienced a long transition period (1977-1992) which shows that China's economic development has a strong ""growth inertia""."

N15|Why Was China Trapped in an Agrarian Society? An Economic Geographical Approach to the Needham Puzzle|This paper argues that before the world started to globalize, the differences in the geographical endowments that different population faced were the most important constraints to their long-term production and consumption. The paper uses this central hypothesis to explain the sharp contrast between the flourishing Song and the stagnant Ming and Qing. During the Song dynasty, despite the fact that China lost a significant amount of arable land to invading nomads as its population peaked, China witnessed a higher urbanization level, more prosperous commerce and international trade, and an explosion of technical inventions and institutional innovations. However, after having significantly improved its man-to-land ratio in the period after the Song China only found itself induced deeper into the agrarian trap, resulting in reduced urbanization, withering foreign trade, a declining division of labor, and stagnant in technology.
N15|The Japanese Financial Sector's Transition from High Growth to the 'Lost Decades': A Market Economy Perspective|"This paper looks at Japan's experience in transforming its financial system. While the country is considered a model of successful Asian economic development, it has encountered many difficulties as introducing market economy. During the 1960s and 1970s, Japan experienced high economic growth, contributed by its regulated financial sector. Cooperation among the government, banks and corporations created a strong system, in which main banks played an important role. They supported companies and, sometimes, in addition to their role in the corporate governance of client enterprises, they also rescued troubled companies. In addition, banks extended loans to businesses in promising sectors, thereby assuming risks similar to those taken by venture capitalists. However, during the 1970s and 1980s, Japan's financial system, under pressure from the changing economic environment, was compelled to adjust. Economic growth led to changes in the money flow, as Japanese big business began to lose its appetite for borrowing. Instead, there developed circumvented financing outside the domestic market that, with the growing bond market and accumulation of other financial assets, led to financial liberalization.In the late 1980s, this liberalization resulted in a combination of loose monetary conditions after the Plaza Agreement, an economic boom, and the bursting of the asset bubble. Then, between 1991 and 2000, Japan experienced a ""lost decade."" Now, in order to pull itself out of its economic malaise, Japan continues to focus on market orientation in a bid to achieve economic reform but, so far, this has been little benefit. One of the main challenges Japan still faces is developing a new set of institutional complementarities."
N15|Can India Achieve Double-digit growth ?|In recent years, India has enjoyed one of the highest growth rates worldwide, weathering the global financial crisis better than many other countries. Prudent macroeconomic policies will be critical to prolonging the current expansion, given the risks associated with high inflation and volatile capital flows. A steadfast commitment to fiscal consolidation is needed to continue to reduce the large deficit that emerged in the aftermath of the slowdown and avoid crowding out private investment. Stepping up structural reforms will also be necessary if double-digit growth rates are to be achievable over the coming decade or so. Indeed, the operating environment for private business remains challenging. While infrastructure is improving in key sectors, partly thanks to greater private investment, bottlenecks endure and efforts to intensify competition and ensure continued strong investment are required. Labour market reforms are also required to promote job creation. Rapid economic development has boosted living standards and reduced poverty but poverty remains high. There is a need to strengthen social welfare systems and access to health and education to ensure widespread benefits from continued high growth. This Working Paper relates to the 2011 OECD Economic Survey of India (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/india) L'Inde peut-elle réaliser un taux de croissance à deux chiffres ? L'Inde a connu, ces dernieres annees, l'un des taux de croissance les plus eleves au monde, et a su mieux que bien d'autres pays traverser la crise financiere mondiale.

N15|Global financial crisis and return of South Asian Gulf migrants: patterns and determinants of their integration to local labour markets|Studies record that a large number of South Asian migrant workers in the Middle–East had to return to their home countries owing to the global financial crisis and loss of jobs. However, their distress of loss of job in the gulf is compounded by the fact that in their own home countries the rehabilitation and reintegration of these workers is tedious and often the returnees are thrust with forced choices. This paper, based on a primary survey conducted in five south Asian countries, namely; Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan and India, concludes that on return, the employment status of REMs were in general worse off than in their host country with high share of casualisation, self employment and unemployment in the crisis year and a decline in their average monthly earnings. The analysis suggests that those who found employment on return was in fact driven by economic compulsions to reduce their job search period and cost.
N15|Middle East and North Africa Countries' Vulnerability to Commodity Price Increases|New estimates of pass-through coefficients for the Middle East and North Africa indicate that a rise of global food prices is transmitted to a significant degree into domestic food prices. Over the past decade, transmission from international to domestic prices has been particularly high for Egypt, Iraq, Djibouti, United Arab Emirates and West Bank and Gaza, while being particularly low in Tunisia and Algeria. Where international food price increases translate into domestic prices, overall inflation tends to be higher.
N15|Identifying the Signs of Currency Speculation in Hong Kong's Linked exchange Rate|This paper identifies the ex ante factors of currency speculation based on the experience of Hong Kong’s three episodes in 1988, 1998 and 2007. The dynamic conditional correlation models are used to study the inter-temporal interactions among the Hang Seng Index, Hang Seng Index futures and exchange rate difference. The logistic model is applied to study the probability of currency speculation. The empirical results indicate that unusual movements in the exchange rate difference, Hang Seng Index premium and open interest of futures contracts can be found in the period prior to and during currency speculations. In addition, the conditional correlation between stock market and exchange rate market declined sharply during the periods of currency speculation. The paper traces the disposition of the speculators.
N15|Tourismuspolitik in Marokko: ein großer Wurf für wirtschaftliche Entwicklung?<BR>[Tourism policy in Morocco: a great effort for economic development?]|Recent political transformations in Arab countries suggest that solutions have to be found for the problem of lacking economic prospects and particularly of high youth unemployment. Such solutions have to consist of economic growth that unfolds widespread employment effects. A tourism policy that opens up perspectives for employment to people in many parts of a country can contribute to such a solution. This is even more the case because of tourism's high labour intensity and the physical assets of Arab countries and in particular of the northern African mediterranean countries. Morocco can serve as an example as to what degree tourism policy can live up to these high expectations.
N15|Regional human capital in Republican and New China: Its spread, quality and effects on economic growth|In recent decades there has been increasing attention for Chinese economic development. There has been a big debate though if its growth is caused by capital accumulation (perspiration factors) or driven by Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth (inspiration factors). The difference between both stances is quite substantial since, if the perspiration theory is correct, one expects the growth of the Chinese economy to slow down over time as the capital accumulation grows increasingly less efficient. However, so far this question is difficult to analyse for China since we lack information on one of the factors of production, human capital. To analyse this question, in this paper we develop a new dataset on human capital for the provinces of China between 1922 and 2010. Using our new dataset, together with physical capital and per capita GDP, allows us to do a TFP analysis for sub periods. We find a continuously negative TFP growth suggesting that reduction in productivity was a structural feature of the Chinese economy. If true, this was to lend support to the perspiration theory and would suggest a slowdown of the Chinese economy in the future. However, standard growth accounting allocates both technical efficiency of the factors of production and the general technical development to TFP. Subtracting technical efficiency from TFP growth, we find that general technological development turns increasingly positive in the 1990s and 2000s. This suggests that, whereas until the reform period China was largely driven by capital accumulation, afterwards general technical development got an increasingly prominent place giving hope for continued economic development in the future.
N15|Economic Planning in China|This paper provides an up-to-date study of economic planning in China as it affects the economic development, growth and fluctuations of the Chinese economy. Although economic planning has been practiced in China since 1953 when the first Five-Year Plan began, its nature has changed after economic reform started in 1978. Market reform reduced the importance of central planning, but more recently the global economic recession and China?s active macro-economic policy interventions have increased the importance of economic planning. Our discussion is divided into the following sections: 1. Role of planning in the Chinese economy. 2. Scope of planning. 3. Numerical targets of the Plan and the degree to which the targets are met. 4. Organization of the NCDR. 5. How a plan is implemented. 6. Effects of planning on China?s economic development.

Several key topics are elaborated on, including the development of Asia and implications for Australia, policy frameworks, and the opportunities and challenges facing the Australian economy, with a particular focus on the expansion of household balance sheets and the rapid growth in the mining economy.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N15|Infrastructure and Growth in Developing Asia|This paper applies two distinct approaches—growth regressions and growth accounting—to analyze the link between infrastructure, growth, and productivity in developing Asian countries. The main conclusion is that a number of countries in developing Asia have significantly improved their basic infrastructure endowments in the recent past. This improvement appears to correlate significantly with good growth performances. However, the evidence seems to indicate that this is mostly the result of factor accumulation, a direct effect, and that the impact on productivity is rather inconclusive.

N15|The Impact of Mining and Services Industries on the Structural Change of Australia|Both services and mining industries gained relatively more importance in the structural changes occurring, particularly in recent years, where the rate of structural change has increased. The study aims at defragmenting the mining and services industries, and analyses their impacts on structural change. VAR model, where activity is measured in terms of output, shows social and business services to have more forecasting abilities than other variables. On the hand, VAR model where activity is measured in terms of investment shows the mining industry to have relatively less Mean Absolute Errors forecasts. Results deteriorate as one moves from one step ahead to twelve step ahead forecasts, suggesting longer periods of one step ahead forecasting should be used to avoid cyclical fluctuations in activity variables such as output or investment for industries.
N15|The Dynamics of Relationship between exports and economic growth in India|In this era of open economy, nations are concerned with increasing the quality of life of their citizens. And, the quality of life mainly comes from the macro-economic prosperity. Thus, fast growth of gross domestic Product has become the most important objective of any economy. There are various approaches to achieve this target of which one strategy is to promote exports of the country. At this juncture, an important issue immediately breaks the minds of economists and researchers, that is, whether export promotion leads to higher economic growth or economic growth promotes exports. Thus, this paper is an attempt to reinvestigate the dynamics of the relationship between exports and economic growth for India over the period 1970 to 2009. Applying popular time series econometric techniques of cointegration and vector error correction estimation, the study provides the evidence of stationarity of time series variables, existence of long-run equilibrium relation between them, and finally, the rejection of exportled growth hypothesis for India by the Granger causality test based on vector error correction model estimation.
N15|TRAPS EMBRACED OR ESCAPED:Elites in the Economic Development of Modern Japan and China|Countries commencing industrialization with relatively low levels of agricultural productivity, hence low wages, enjoy advantages that can also prove host to daunting challenges. The chief advantage is a relatively elastic supply of labor for manufacturing; the chief challenge is how to free up farm labor for factory employment through the raising of labor productivity in farming. Key to raising agricultural labor productivity is providing incentives to increase effort levels including hours worked â€” access to markets being crucial â€” and improving the quality of labor as measured by health indicators and educational attainment. The willingness of elites to promote improvements in infrastructure â€” physical infrastructure in the form of roads and railroads and hydroelectric systems; human capital enhancing infrastructure augmenting the educational attainment and health of populations in rural areas; and financial infrastructure â€” and to invest directly in factories is crucial to the process by which labor is transferred from farming to manufacturing activities. During the period 1850 to 1935 elites in China tended to resist the requisite changes while elites in Japan did not. This legacy played a crucial role in shaping the nature of post-1950 economic development in the two countries.
N15|ECONOMIC GROWTH OF SINGAPORE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY:Historical GDP Estimates and Empirical Investigations|Research on Singapore's economic history has been complicated by the absence of economic data on pre-independence Singapore.

What kinds of problems has this war brought about, and what is needed to remedy these problems, so as to reconstruct an order in Iraq and beyond? The present volume is a collection of essays exploring these issues, written by leading scholars in their respective fields. Importantly, the Iraq War has caused numerous long-term security and economic problems in Iraq (Chapter 1) and in the Middle East (Chapter 2). In addition, this war represents a failure of the Western liberals' project of establishing a liberal market democracy, and these liberals are likely to repeat the same error elsewhere in the future (Chapter 3). Moreover, the war underlines the crisis in global governance today, but the idea of reforming the United Nations has some serious limitations (Chapter 4). With regard to the issue of terrorism, ¡°Al-Qaeda in Iraq¡± has been operating in the field for some time, and thus Iraq will likely remain an important global center of terrorism in the foreseeable future (Chapter 5).

N15|The Determinants of Internal Migration in a Developing Country: Quantitative Evidence for Indonesia, 1930-200|This study specifies and estimates a gravity model for inter-provincial migration in Indonesia. Using panel data for Indonesia’s 26 provinces for 5 survey years between 1930 and 2000 we show that throughout the twentieth century economic factors were more important in the explanation of inter-provincial migration patterns in Indonesia than planned migration policy aimed at the redistribution of the population. In addition, our regression analysis demonstrates that the urban primacy of Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, had a strong effect on the direction and size of migration flows as well. Our findings thus suggest that the costly government-supported migration is not very successful and that a strongly centralized government induces migration flows to the capital. These findings have policy implications for other developing countries.

Con el fin de evaluar si dicho impacto ha sido diferente en cada región, se plantea la estimación por medio de un modelo VEC y un Panel VEC, que permiten concluir que los choques externos han afectado a América Latina, como era de esperarse, pero en igual medida han afectado a Asia del Este. Dicho resultado plantea una alteración de la hipótesis inicial, que suponía que las economías de Asia del Este eran menos vulnerables ante choques externos que los países pertenecientes a la región latinoamericana. La bondad del presente estudio radica entonces en el hallazgo de los choques que impactan a las dos regiones de manera significativa, surgiendo así un nuevo interrogante a la literatura: ¿ Por qué Asia del Este continuó creciendo más que América Latina pese a que los choques externos también la afectan?

N15|Why did Countries Adopt the Gold Standard? Lessons from Japan|Why did policymakers adopt the gold standard? Although previous research has identified ex post effects of gold standard adoption on trade and bond yields, few studies have sought to understand whether these were the actual outcomes of interest to policymakers at the time of adoption. We examine the political economy of Japan's adoption of the gold standard in 1897 by exploring the ex ante motives of policymakers as well as how the legislative decision to adopt gold won approval. We then link the beliefs of contemporaneous policymakers to data so that we can test the economic effects of adoption. In contrast to previous studies examining bond yields, we find little evidence that joining the gold standard reduced Japan's country risk or investors anticipated a dramatic decline in borrowing rates for the government. Moreover, we find no evidence of a domestic investment boom or that investors anticipated one and bid it into stock prices. However, as some policymakers suggested, we find that membership in the gold standard increased Japan's exports by lowering transactions costs and because the price of gold fell relative to silver, making exports to silver standard countries more competitive. While Japan also received a boost in exports to its regional trading partners when it switched from paper to silver, going onto gold allowed Japan to tap into the growing share of global trade that was centered on the gold standard: by the late 1890s nearly 60 percent of Japanese exports and total trade were with members of the gold club.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N15|Intra-provincial inequalities and economic growth in China|This paper approaches the problem of inequalities in China. It is specifically focused on analyzing the effects of intra-provincial disparities on the development of the 28 mainland provinces in China. Intra-provincial inequalities, as measured by the Theil index, seem positively related to growth, albeit the results are only convincing for the coastal provinces. A case-by-case analysis, however, suggests highly diversified patterns, including linear or an inverted U-shape for the fastest growing coastal provinces and virtually no relationship for the majority of regions. The results corroborate some questions raised earlier about actual policy-making standards in China.

The framework is used to identify strengths and limitations of water markets in: (1) Australia's Murray-Darling Basin; (2) Chile (in particular the Limarí Valley); (3) China (in particular, the North); (4) South Africa; and (5) the western United States. It identifies what water markets are currently able to contribute to integrated water resource management, what criteria underpin these markets, and which components of their performance may require further development.
N15|China’s Fiscal Stimulus Package for the Current International Crisis: What does 1996–2006 Tell Us?|This paper uses Bi-Directional Reiterative Truncated Projected Least Squares (BD-RTPLS) to estimate annual ∂GPP/∂G and %∂GPP/%∂G multipliers for China’s 31 provinces between 1996 and 2006 (GPP = Gross Provincial Product and G = government spending in the province). In order to account for the influence of omitted variables, BD-RTPLS produces a separate ∂GPP/∂G and %∂GPP/%∂G estimate for every observation in the data set. I find that ∂GPP/∂G and %∂GPP/%∂G were highest in 1996 while China was drastically cutting government spending to curb inflation, were lowest in 1997 during the Asian Financial Crisis, slowly rose between 1998 and 2004, and then declined some in 2005 and 2006 when the Chinese yuan was slowly appreciating.
N15|Vietnam’s Economy in Transition: Successes and Challenges|Vietnam’s twentieth century economic development was interrupted by long years of destructive warfare and stunted by the distortions of central planning. During the last two decades, however, under the reform policy known as doi moi (renovation), Vietnam’s economy has made tremendous strides, establishing the institutions of a market system and dramatically improving living standards. Success has been accompanied, however, by serious challenges, some of which are legacies of the old central planning structure, while others have been largely caused by the growth of the market economy and are likely to prove very difficult to resolve.
