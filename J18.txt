J18|The Impact of Post-Marital Maintenance on Dynamic Decisions and Welfare of Couples|In many countries divorce law mandates post-marital maintenance payments (child support and alimony) to insure the lower earner in married couples against financial losses upon divorce. This paper studies how maintenance payments affect couplesâ€™ intertemporal decisions and welfare. I develop a dynamic model of family labor supply, housework, savings and divorce and estimate it using Danish register data. The model captures the policy trade off between providing insurance to the lower earner and enabling couples to specialize efficiently, on the one hand, and maintaining labor supply incentives for divorcees, on the other hand. I use the estimated model to analyze counterfactual policy scenarios in which child support and alimony payments are changed. The welfare maximizing maintenance policy is to triple child support payments and reduce alimony by 12.5% relative to the Danish status quo. Switching to the welfare maximizing policy makes men worse off, but comparisons to a first best scenario reveal that Pareto improvements are feasible, highlighting the limitations of maintenance policies.

J18|Another Look at “Bank Competition and Financial Stability: Much Ado about Nothing?”|This study replicates Zigraiova and Havranek’s (2016) meta-analysis of banking competition and financial stability. It performs multiple types of replications: a “Reproduction” replication where Z&H’s data and code are verified to reproduce the results of their study; a “Repetition” replication where the studies used by Z&H are independently recoded and then re-analyzed; an “Extension” replication where additional studies on banking competition and stability are analyzed; and a “Robustness Analysis” where we check Z&H’s results using an alternative empirical procedure. Our analysis strongly confirms Z&H’s main finding that competition in the banking sector has an economically negligible effect on financial stability. This result is consistently confirmed across a variety of replication analyses. Most impressively, we confirm their finding even when we analyze a completely independent set of 35 studies not included in Z&H’s meta-analysis. Our results for Z&H’s other findings are less supportive. As the first comprehensive replication of a meta-analysis, this study also provides insights into the robustness of meta-analysis. We find that meta-regression analysis, where estimated effects are related to data, estimation, and study characteristics, is sensitive to how data are coded and to the choice of estimation procedure; and that this sensitivity extends to “best practice” estimates.
J18|Reducing Mommy Penalties with Daddy Quotas|This paper investigates whether daddy quotas - non-transferable paternity leave policies - mitigate motherhood penalties women face in the labor market. Using the introduction of a daddy quota in Quebec, Canada as a natural experiment, the authors employ labor force survey data to conduct a difference-in-difference estimation of the policy's impact on a range of mothers' career outcomes. The results suggest Quebec mothers exposed to the policy are 5 percentage points more likely to participate in the labor force and to work full-time, 5 percentage points less likely to work part-time, and 4 percentage points less likely to be unemployed. These results are robust to an alternative semiparametric difference-in-difference methodology and to a battery of placebo and sensitivity tests. However, the authors find that the policy's effects are largest two to three years post-reform, reducing in size and significance thereafter, raising questions about the durability of such effects.
J18|Political economy of redistribution between traditional and modern families|We analyse a model in which families may either be “traditional” single-earner with caring for the child at home or “modern” double-earner households using market child care. Family policies may favour either the one or the other group, like market care subsidies vs. cash for care. Policies are determined by probabilistic voting, where allocative and distributional impacts matter, both within and across groups. Due to its impact on intragroup distribution, both types of households are likely to receive subsidies. In early stages of development where most households are traditional, implemented policies favour them, though to a small extent. Net subsidies to traditional households are highest in some intermediate stage, which may explain the implementation of cash for care policies. Such policies will be tightened again in late stages of development, where the vast majority of voters come from modern households. Finally, in an environment in which many traditional households are not entitled to vote (immigrants who have not yet obtained citizenship), redistribution toward them may be abolished and in extreme cases even replaced by net transfers to modern households.
J18|The Effects of Early Retirement Incentives on Retirement Decisions|This paper analyzes behavioral responses to a reform in the German public pension system that allowed individuals with a long contribution history to retire without deductions before reaching the regular retirement age. Following the 2014 reform, individuals with 45 contribution years could retire without deductions as early as age 63 instead of age 65. Using high-quality administrative data from public pension insurance accounts, we first conduct an event study to quantify responses to becoming eligible for the early retirement scheme. Our results indicate that the probability of retiring immediately increases by more than 10 percentage points upon becoming eligible, relative to the counterfactual probability of retiring at the same age with deductions. Second, we employ a coarsened exact matching procedure to compare retirement entry decisions of eligible and non eligible individuals. Results are in line with the event study and show that individuals who are eligible for the early retirement scheme retire on average 5.4 months earlier than non-eligible individuals with identical characteristics. With additional pension insurance expenditures of 3.4 billion euro and aggregate fiscal costs of 6.5 billion euro in 2016, our subsequent fiscal cost projections are at the upper end of the range of previous back-of-the-envelope estimates.
J18|The Impact of Abortion on Crime and Crime-Related Behavior|The 1966 abolition and 1989 legalization of abortion in Romania immediately doubled and decreased by about a third the number of births per month, respectively. To isolate the link between abortion access and crime while abstracting from cohort and general equilibrium effects, we compare birth month cohorts on either side of the abortion regime. For both the abolition and legalization of abortion, we find large and significant effects on the level of crime and risky-behavior related hospitalization, but an insignificant effect on crime and hospitalization rates (i.e. when normalizing by the size of the birth month cohort). In other words, the Romanian abortion reforms did affect crime, but all of the effect appears to be driven by cohort size effects rather than selection or unwantedness effects.
J18|Long Run Effects of Universal Childcare on Personality Traits|Although universal childcare has become an essential tool to support child development, few economic studies analyze its effects on non-cognitive skills and little is known about causal effects on these skills in the long run. In this paper we go beyond short run analyses and examine the long run effects of one additional year of universal childcare on students’ personality traits in adolescence. We focus on personality traits as part of their non-cognitive skills set and as important predictors of later educational achievements. As of 1996, a legal entitlement to universal childcare applied to children of three years and older in Germany. However, severe shortages in the former-West meant that many children could not get a childcare place and had to wait a full year until the next entry date. Using data from the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) we estimate effects of one additional year of childcare by exploiting geographical variation in the timing of childcare entry arising from local supply constraints. We find that an earlier entry in universal childcare increases extroversion in adolescence, which has been shown to be associated with favorable labor market outcomes.
J18|Living with the Neighbors: Demand-Driven Youth Training Programs: Experimental Evidence from Mongolia|Because of its high incidence and potential threat to social cohesion, youth unemployment is a global concern. This study uses a randomized controlled trial to analyze the effectiveness of a demand-driven vocational training program for disadvantaged youth in Mongolia. Mongolia, a transitional country whose economic structure shifted from a communist, centrally planned economy to a free-market economy over a relatively short period, offers a new setting in which to test the effectiveness of standard active labor market policies. This study reports positive and statistically significant short-term effects of vocational training on monthly earnings, skills matching, and self-employment. Substantial heterogeneity emerges as relatively older, richer, and better-educated individuals drive these positive effects. A second intervention that randomly assigns participants to receive repetitive weekly newsletters with information on market returns to vocational training shows positive impacts on the length of exposure to and successful completion of the program. These positive effects, however, are only observed at the intensive margin and do not lead to higher employment or earnings outcomes.
J18|Migration Constraints and Disparate Responses to Changing Job Opportunities|Using the Current Population Survey between 1996 and 2018, this paper investigates the role constraints to migration might play in explaining racial/ethnic disparities in the labor market. The Delta Index of dissimilarity is used to illustrate a greater distributional mismatch between race/education specific workers and jobs among minorities relative to white non-Hispanics. Regression analysis then shows that this mismatch is consistent with minorities being less responsive to changes in the distribution of job opportunities. However, minorities are more responsive when the growing job opportunities are located in areas with greater same-racial/ethnic representation, suggesting that social constraints might play a role in the observed distributional mismatch. The analysis focuses on 25–54 year old men.
J18|Do Immigrants Threaten U.S. Public Safety?|Opponents of immigration often claim that immigrants, particularly those who are unauthorized, are more likely than U.S. natives to commit crimes and that they pose a threat to public safety. There is little evidence to support these claims. In fact, research overwhelmingly indicates that immigrants are less likely than similar U.S. natives to commit violent and property crimes, and that areas with more immigrants have similar or lower rates of violent and property crimes than areas with fewer immigrants. There are relatively few studies specifically of criminal behavior among unauthorized immigrants, but the limited research suggests that these immigrants also have a lower propensity to commit crime than their native-born peers, although possibly a higher propensity than legal immigrants. Evidence about legalization programs is consistent with these findings, indicating that a legalization program reduces crime rates. Meanwhile, increased border enforcement, which reduces unauthorized immigrant inflows, has mixed effects on crime rates. A large-scale legalization program, which is not currently under serious consideration, has more potential to improve public safety and security than several other policies that have recently been proposed or implemented.
J18|The Introduction of Formal Childcare Services in Inuit Communities and Labor Force Outcomes|We study the impacts of the introduction of formal childcare services to 28 Inuit communities in Canada's North. We use geographical variation in the timing of the introduction of childcare services in the late 1990s and early 2000s to estimate the impact of increased access to childcare. We combine the 1996, 2001, and 2006 long-form census files with data on the opening dates of childcare centres and the number of childcare spaces in each of the 28 communities over time. We find evidence of impacts on female labour force participation driven by multi-adult households in Quebec. Point estimates also suggest possible improvements in high school graduation rates and increased participation of men in childcare. We do not find evidence that formal childcare decreases the ability of children to speak Inuktitut. We suggest plausible explanations for these findings and avenues for future research.
J18|Paid Family Leave and Breastfeeding: Evidence from California|This paper evaluates the effect of Paid Family Leave (PFL) on breastfeeding, which we identify using California’s enactment of a 2004 PFL policy that ensured mothers up to six weeks of leave at a 55 percent wage replacement rate. We employ synthetic control models for a large, representative sample of over 270,000 children born between 2000 and 2012 drawn from the restricted-use versions of the 2003 – 2014 National Immunization Surveys. Our estimates indicate that PFL increases the overall duration of breastfeeding by nearly 18 days, and the likelihood of breastfeeding for at least six months by 5 percentage points. We find substantially larger effects of PFL on breastfeeding duration for some disadvantaged mothers.
J18|The Effect of Job Referrals on Labor Market Outcomes in Brazil|This paper uses for the first time program administrative data from Brazil’s National Employment System (SINE) to assess the impact of SINE job interview referrals on labor market outcomes. Data for the five-year period 2012-2016 is used to evaluate the impact of SINE on employment probability, wage rates, time until reemployment and job tenure. Difference-in-differences estimates suggest that a SINE job interview referral increases the probability of finding a job within three months of the referral, and reduces the number of months to find reemployment, the average job tenure of the next job and the reemployment wage. Subgroup analysis suggests that compared to more educated workers, SINE is more effective in helping less educated workers by increasing their probability of finding a job and reducing time until reemployment. Finally, the evidence suggests that online labor exchange is less effective than the service provided in person at SINE offices.
J18|Expanding access to universal childcare: Effects on childcare arrangements and maternal employment|In most OECD countries, subsidised childcare is a key instrument to support maternal employment. Using a large reform implemented in Luxembourg in 2009, I study the effect of expanding access to subsidised childcare on childcare and employment decisions of women in a context where childcare is universal and heavily subsidised, but bound by capacity constraints. The identification relies on temporal variation across child age groups. The results show that, in response to the reform, the employment rate of mothers increased by 4-7 percentage points and their hours of work by around 3 hours per week. Studying heterogeneous effects reveals a differential impact of the reform for more vulnerable mothers. Parents whose youngest child is under the age of 3 are found to use more daycare services, for longer hours, while the use of informal care remains unchanged. These results suggest that there is no crowding out effect of the new policy.
J18|Adjustment Costs and Incentives to Work: Evidence from a Disability Insurance Program|"How important are adjustment costs for individuals when they face a change in work incentives induced by a policy change? I provide the first estimate of heterogeneous adjustment costs by exploiting a policy change that substantially increased work incentives. The policy change increased the exemption threshold in a disability insurance program. I document strong responses to work incentives as I observe excess mass –""bunching""– right below the exemption threshold where the marginal tax on earnings is low. A puzzling observation is that individuals continue bunching at the former threshold after the policy change. This finding suggests that they face adjustment costs when changing their labor supply. I use the amount of bunching at the new and former threshold to estimate adjustment costs that vary by individuals' ability to work. The estimated adjustment costs are higher for individuals with lower ability; varying from zero to twenty percent of their potential earnings, with an average at eight percent. The estimated elasticity of earnings respect to net-of-tax rate – accounting for heterogeneous adjustment costs – is 0.2, which is double the size of the elasticity estimated with no adjustment costs. To investigate the relative size of the adjustment costs to the work incentives induced by the policy change, I evaluate the overall effect of the policy change on the labor supply using a Difference-in-Differences design. I find that individuals who already work, work more, and those who did not work, start working. Policies designed to increase labor supply will work if the induced work incentives are large enough to offset the adjustment costs. Accounting for adjustment costs then might explain disparate findings on the effects of an increase in work incentives on labor supply in disability insurance programs. These findings have important implications for designing policies and targeting heterogeneous groups to increase labor supply in disability insurance programs."
J18|Divorced in a Flash: The Effect of the Administrative Divorce Option on Marital Stability in the Netherlands|Administrative divorce is an optional divorce procedure which allows couples to bypass the court system and dissolve their marriages in a streamlined, uncontested process. The lack of court involvement renders the administrative divorce faster and less expensive than the conventional divorce. In this paper, I investigate whether the administrative divorce option affected the stability of marriages in the Netherlands. Leveraging the ban of the procedure in 2009, I show that the divorce risks were 11.6% higher under the legal regime which allowed for administrative divorce. This effect is causal, and it exhibits considerable heterogeneity, being stronger among dual-earner couples, native couples, and couples living in rural regions.
J18|Long-run Effects from Comprehensive Student Support: Evidence from Pathways to Education|We estimate long-run impacts to the Pathways to Education program, a comprehensive set of coaching, tutoring, group activities and financial incentives offered to disadvantaged students beginning in Grade 9. High school administrative records are matched to income tax records to follow individuals up to the age of 28, even when they leave the household or province. We find significant positive effects on persistence in postsecondary education institutions, earnings and employment. Program eligibility increased adult annual earnings by 19 percent, employment by 14 percent and reduced social assistance (welfare) receipt by more than a third.
J18|NDC : The Generic Old-Age Pension Scheme|This paper defines a universal public pension scheme (UPPS) as a government mandated lifecycle longevity insurance scheme that transfers individual consumption from the working years to retirement. It discusses the differences in four UPPS designs designated as either defined contribution (DC) or defined benefit (DB), and financial or nonfinancial. With individual DC accounts, the ball is in the individual?s court. The transparent link between contributions and retirement income is the enabler of efficiency that through marginal decisions to choose formal work over informal work or leisure and to postpone retirement marginally toward the end of the working life, supports affordability and sustainability for a chosen level of adequacy. Hence, UPPS-DC designs are found superior to UPPS-DB designs.
J18|Voting Up? The Effects of Democracy and Franchise Extension on Human Stature|We study the health effects of the spread of democratic institutions and the extension of voting rights in 15 European countries since the middle of the nineteenth century. We employ both cross country and cohort variation in heights and employ a new instrument for democracy and the extension of the franchise, the effect of decolonisation on democracy in the colonising country’s democratisation to identify the causal effect of democracy on heights. We find robust evidence of a link between democratic quality and human stature. The results indicate that the transition to democracy increased average male heights by 0.7 to 1 cm, equivalent to a one-decade average increase in stature across cohorts. Including the extension of the franchise to women increases the effect on average stature to about 1.7cm. The effect is driven by both political participation and contestation in reducing inequality and expanding health insurance coverage.
J18|Wages and Hours Laws: What Do We Know? What Can Be Done?|We summarize recent research on the wage and employment effects of minimum wage laws in the U.S. and infer from non-U.S. studies of hours laws the likely effects of unchanging U.S. hours laws. Minimum wages in the U.S. have increasingly become a province of state governments, with the effective minimum wage now closely related to a state's wage near the lower end of its wage distribution. Original estimates demonstrate how the 45-year failure to increase the exempt earnings level for salaried workers under U.S. hours laws has raised hours of lower-earning salaried workers and reduced their weekly earnings. The overall conclusion from the literature and the original work is that wages and hours laws in the U.S. have produced impacts in the directions predicted by economic theory, but that these effects have been quite small.
J18|When Behavioral Barriers are Too High or Low – How Timing Matters for Parenting Interventions|The time children spend with their parents affects their development. Parenting programs can help parents use that time more effectively. Text-messaged-based parenting curricula have proven an effective means of supporting positive parenting practices by providing easy and fun activities that reduce informational and behavioral barriers. These programs may be more effective if delivered during times when parents are particularly in need of support or alternatively when parents have more time to interact with their child. This study compares the effects of an early childhood text-messaging program sent during the weekend to the same program sent on weekdays. We find that sending the texts on the weekend is, on average, more beneficial to children’s literacy and math development. This effect is particularly strong for initially lower achieving children, while the weekday texts show some benefits for higher achieving children on higher order skills. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that the parents of lower achieving students, on average, face such high barriers during weekdays that supports are not enough to overcome these barriers, while for parents of higher achieving students, weekday texts are more effective because weekdays are more challenging, but not so difficult as to be untenable for positive parenting.
J18|Parental Leave, Household Specialization and Children's Well-Being|Many countries offer new parents long periods of paid leave. Proponents argue that parental leave programs can reduce gender gaps in the labor market, support marital stability and promote children's well-being. In this paper, I show that lengthy leaves can instead work against several of these intended goals. Using a regression discontinuity design, I find that a 3-year expansion of paid leave in France increases household specialization by inducing mothers to exit the labor force and fathers to raise their work hours. The leave further discourages marriages among cohabiting couples and harms children's verbal development.
J18|Rank Incentives and Social Learning: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial|In a 1-year randomized controlled trial involving thousands of university students, we provide real-time private feedback on relative performance in a semester-long online assignment. Within this setup, our experimental design cleanly identifies the behavioral response to rank incentives (i.e., the incentives stemming from an inherent preference for high rank). We find that rank incentives not only boost performance in the related assignment, but also increase the average grade across all course exams taken over the semester by 0.21 standard deviations. These beneficial effects remain sizeable across all quantiles and extend beyond the time of the intervention. The mechanism behind these findings involves social learning: rank incentives make students engage more in peer interactions, which lead them to perform significantly better across the board. Finally, we explore the virtues of real-time feedback by analyzing a number of alternative variations in the way it is provided.
J18|Samuelson's Contributions to Population Theory and Overlapping Generations in Economics|Paul Samuelson made a series of important contributions to population theory for humans and other species, evolutionary theory, and the theory of age structured life cycles in economic equilibrium and growth. The work is highly abstract but much of it was intended to illuminate issues of compelling policy importance, such as declining fertility and population aging. While his work in population economics has been very influential, his work in population and evolution appears to have been largely overlooked, perhaps because he seldom published in demographic journals or went to population meetings. Here I discuss his many contributions in all these areas, but give particular attention to demographic aspects of his famous work on overlapping generation models, social security systems, and population growth.
J18|The Impact of Paid Family Leave on the Timing of Infant Vaccinations|Raising a new-born child involves not only financial resources, but also time investment from the parents. A time constraint can affect important decisions made by parents at the early stages of an infant's life. One form of investment that is particularly important is vaccinating an infant. We analyze the impact of time constraints on immunization of infants on time. To establish a causal relationship, we exploit California's implementation of Paid Parental Leave Program as a natural experiment. Using a nationally representative dataset from the National Immunization Survey, we find evidence that the policy reduced late vaccinations for children born to parents in California after the policy was implemented. We test for heterogeneous effects of the policy on different subgroups in the population. We find the policy had a stronger impact on families that are below the poverty line. We conduct a series of falsification tests and robustness checks to test the validity of the results. In addition, our results are robust to several placebo tests.
J18|The Asymmetry of Population Ethics: Experimental Social Choice and Dual-Process Moral Reasoning|Population ethics is widely considered to be exceptionally important and exceptionally difficult. One key source of difficulty is the conflict between certain moral intuitions and analytical results identifying requirements for rational (in the sense of complete and transitive) social choice over possible populations. One prominent such intuition is the Asymmetry, which jointly proposes that the fact that a possible child's quality of life would be bad is a normative reason not to create the child, but the fact that a child's quality of life would be good is not a reason to create the child. This paper reports a set of questionnaire experiments about the Asymmetry in the spirit of economists' empirical social choice. Few survey respondents show support for the Asymmetry; instead respondents report that expectations of a good quality of life are relevant. Each experiment shows evidence (among at least some participants) of dual-process moral reasoning, in which cognitive reflection is statistically associated with reporting expected good quality of life to be normatively relevant. The paper discusses possible implications of these results for the economics of population-sensitive social welfare and for the conflict between moral mathematics and population intuition.
J18|Institutional Responses to Aging Populations and Economic Growth: A Panel Data Approach|Will an aging population lower economic growth? Economists are generally concerned that the increase in life expectancy could lower economic growth, however, theory does not make a prediction. As life expectancy increases, so should household savings, which results in more physical capital per worker. This will stimulate economic growth. However, as the retired population share increases, this may reduce spending on children as more resources are transferred to the elderly. This will likely reduce human capital accumulation and lower growth. The net effect of these competing influences is an empirical question. This paper constructs a stylized endogenous growth model that includes both human capital and government transfers to the elderly. The model is mapped into a linear statistical framework that allows us to estimate each of these potential responses using panel data for a set of OECD countries during the period 1975-2014. We find evidence that households do in fact increase savings in response to a longer retirement period and this effect is associated with a higher realized rate of growth per worker. However, we also find evidence that an aging population reduces spending on children (or other productive investments) placing a drag on growth. These results suggest it is the institutional response to population aging that will determine whether or not an aging population will place a drag on future growth, not population aging itself.
J18|MaÃ®triser les dÃ©penses de santÃ© face au changement dÃ©mographique : Une analyse de lâ€™Ã©volution des coÃ»ts Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital au QuÃ©bec|Ã€ partir de donnÃ©es mÃ©dico-administratives longitudinales sur les sÃ©jours Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital et les coÃ»ts au QuÃ©bec pour la pÃ©riode 1995-2012, une dÃ©composition de la variation des coÃ»ts de santÃ© Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital est effectuÃ©e afin dâ€™en analyser les principaux dÃ©terminants. Entre 1995 et 2012, la part des sÃ©jours hospitaliers a reprÃ©sentÃ© 86% de la hausse des coÃ»ts Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital, contre seulement 14% pour les services mÃ©dicaux Ã lâ€™acte. De 2008 Ã 2012, cette rÃ©partition a Ã©tÃ© respectivement de 41% et 59%. Sur la pÃ©riode la plus rÃ©cente observÃ©e, comme on aurait pu sâ€™y attendre du fait de la hausse des rÃ©munÃ©rations des mÃ©decins spÃ©cialistes, câ€™est donc la forte hausse des coÃ»ts des services mÃ©dicaux qui a le plus contribuÃ© Ã la hausse des coÃ»ts Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital. NÃ©anmoins, lâ€™augmentation des volumes dâ€™actes a davantage contribuÃ© Ã la hausse globale des coÃ»ts que la hausse des prix des actes. Il est de plus difficile dâ€™Ã©tablir un changement de comportement chez les mÃ©decins suite aux bonifications rÃ©centes des prix des actes, dans la mesure oÃ¹ la variation des volumes dâ€™actes apparaÃ®t assez dÃ©connectÃ©e de la variation des prix des actes. On montre enfin que lâ€™effet de vieillissement ne prÃ©domine pas tous les autres et semble avoir une relativement faible influence sur lâ€™Ã©volution des coÃ»ts de santÃ© Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital. Câ€™est donc davantage une combinaison des changements dans la prÃ©valence des maladies et des changements de pratiques qui ont eu pour effet dâ€™entraÃ®ner la hausse globale des coÃ»ts.
J18|Demand-Driven Youth Training Programs: Experimental Evidence from Mongolia|Because of its high incidence and potential threat to social cohesion, youth unemployment is a global concern. This study uses a randomized controlled trial to analyze the effectiveness of a demand-driven vocational training program for disadvantaged youth in Mongolia. Mongolia, a transitional country whose economic structure shifted from a communist, centrally planned economy to a free-market economy over a relatively short period, offers a new setting in which to test the effectiveness of standard active labor market policies. This study reports positive and statistically significant short-term effects of vocational training on monthly earnings, skills matching, and self-employment. Substantial heterogeneity emerges as relatively older, richer, and better-educated individuals drive these positive effects. A second intervention that randomly assigns participants to receive repetitive weekly newsletters with information on market returns to vocational training shows positive impacts on the length of exposure to and successful completion of the program. These positive effects, however, are only observed at the intensive margin and do not lead to higher employment or earnings outcomes.
J18|California Paid Family Leave and Parental Time Use| Paid family leave policies are intended to help working parents fulfill their work and child care responsibilities by providing them with paid time off from work after the birth of a child. While other research has shown that paid leave policies increase leave-taking among parents, little is known about how parents of infants spend their time while they are on leave and shortly after returning to work. Using the American Heritage Time Use Study and taking a difference-in-differences approach, this paper shows that the California Paid Family Leave policy led to an additional six hours per week mothers spend on child care activities, four additional hours in basic care and two in educational or recreational care. Notably, the availability of paid leave resulted in increases in time mothers spend with children even after they return to work. The increases in maternal time investments also appear to persist beyond infancy, until children reach age three. While fathers are also eligible for paid leave under the California policy, the policy did not induce a change in the total amount of time fathers spend on child care but did result in slightly more time spent playing with children and less time on basic care activities. Given the large literature showing that parental time investments, especially those made early in a child’s life, play a strong role in child cognitive skill development, the findings in this paper are important for policymakers considering enacting paid leave policies.
J18|Does School Lunch Fill the “SNAP Gap” at the End of the Month?|This article investigates the relationship between the timing of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit payments and participation in school lunch and breakfast using the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey. An event study approach examines participation over the five‐day window before and after the SNAP payment. We find that school lunch participation decreases by 17–23 percentage points immediately after the SNAP payment among 11–18 year olds while breakfast drops by 19–36 percentage points. The decline begins the day prior to payment. We find no effects for 5–10 year olds. Models examining participation over the full SNAP month using individual fixed effects yield similar findings. Among teenagers, participation in school lunch and breakfast decline in the first two weeks of the SNAP month, increasing afterward. Non‐school meals show the opposite pattern. Overall, results indicate SNAP households rely more on school lunch and breakfast toward the end of the SNAP month.
J18|Marginal jobs and job surplus: a test of the efficiency of separations|"We present a sharp test for the efficiency of job separations. First, we document a dramatic increase in the separation rate – 11.2ppt (28%) over five years – in response to a quasi-experimental extension of UI benefit duration for older workers. Second, after the abolition of the policy, the ""job survivors"" in the formerly treated group exhibit exactly the same separation behavior as the control group. Juxtaposed, these facts reject the ""Coasean"" prediction of efficient separations, whereby the UI extensions should have extracted marginal (low-surplus) jobs and thereby rendered the remaining (high-surplus) jobs more resilient after its abolition. Third, we show that a formal model of predicted efficient separations implies a piece-wise linear function of the actual control group separations beyond the missing mass of marginal matches. A structural estimation reveals point estimates of the share of efficient separations below 4%, with confidence intervals rejecting shares above 13%. Fourth, to characterize the marginal jobs in the data, we extend complier analysis to difference-in-difference settings such as ours. The UI-indiced separators stemmed from declining firms, blue-collar jobs, with a high share of sick older workers, and firms more likely to have works councils – while their wages were similar to program survivors. The evidence is consistent with a ""non-Coasean"" framework building on wage frictions preventing efficient bargaining, and with formal or informal institutional constraints on selective separations."
J18|Child Penalties Across Countries: Evidence and Explanations|This paper provides evidence on child penalties in female and male earnings in different countries. The estimates are based on event studies around the birth of the first child, using the specification proposed by Kleven et al. (2018). The analysis reveals some striking similarities in the qualitative effects of children across countries, but also sharp differences in the magnitude of the effects. We discuss the potential role of family policies (parental leave and child care provision) and gender norms in explaining the observed differences.
J18|Long-Run Effects from Comprehensive Student Support: Evidence from Pathways to Education|We estimate long-run impacts to the Pathways to Education program, a comprehensive set of coaching, tutoring, group activities and financial incentives offered to disadvantaged students beginning in Grade 9. High school administrative records are matched to income tax records to follow individuals up to the age of 28, even when they leave the household or province. We find significant positive effects on persistence in postsecondary education institutions, earnings and employment. Program eligibility increased adult annual earnings by 19 percent, employment by 14 percent and reduced social assistance (welfare) receipt by more than a third.
J18|The Power of the IUD: Effects of Expanding Access to Contraception Through Title X Clinics|We estimate the effect of Colorado's Family Planning Initiative, the largest program to have focused on long-acting-reversible contraceptives in the United States, which provided funds to Title X clinics so that they could make these contraceptives available to low-income women. We find substantial effects on birth rates, concentrated among women in zip codes within 7 miles of clinics: the initiative reduced births by approximately 20 percent for 15-17 year olds and 18-19 year olds living in such zip codes. We also examine how extensive media coverage of the initiative in 2014 and 2015 altered its reach. After information spread about the availability and benefits of LARCs, we find a substantial increase in LARC insertions, extended effects on births among 15-17 year olds living greater than 7 miles from clinics, and significant reductions in births among 20–24 and 25–29 year olds.
J18|Paid Family Leave and Breastfeeding: Evidence from California|This paper evaluates the effect of Paid Family Leave (PFL) on breastfeeding, which we identify using California’s enactment of a 2004 PFL policy that ensured mothers up to six weeks of leave at a 55 percent wage replacement rate. We employ synthetic control models for a large, representative sample of over 270,000 children born between 2000 and 2012 drawn from the restricted-use versions of the 2003 – 2014 National Immunization Surveys. Our estimates indicate that PFL increases the overall duration of breastfeeding by nearly 18 days, and the likelihood of breastfeeding for at least six months by 5 percentage points. We find substantially larger effects of PFL on breastfeeding duration for some disadvantaged mothers.
J18|Redistributive Effects of Different Pension Systems When Longevity Varies by Socioeconomic Status|We propose a general analytical framework to model the redistributive features of alternative pension systems when individuals face ex ante differences in mortality. Differences in life expectancy between high and low socioeconomic groups are often large and have widened recently in many countries. Such longevity gaps affect the actuarial fairness and progressivity of public pension systems. However, behavioral responses to longevity and policy complicate analysis of possible reforms. Here we consider how various pension systems would perform in a general equilibrium OLG setting with heterogeneous longevity and ability. We evaluate redistributive effects of three Notional Defined Contribution plans and three Defined Benefit plans, calibrated on the US case. Compared to a benchmark non-redistributive plan that accounts for differences in mortality, US Social Security reduces regressivity from longevity differences, but would require group-specific life tables to achieve progressivity. Moreover, without separate life tables, despite apparent accounting gains, lower income groups would suffer welfare losses and higher income groups would enjoy welfare gains through indirect effects of pension systems on labor supply.
J18|When Behavioral Barriers Are Too High or Low: How Timing Matters for Parenting Interventions|The time children spend with their parents affects their development. Parenting programs can help parents use that time more effectively. Text-messaged-based parenting curricula have proven an effective means of supporting positive parenting practices by providing easy and fun activities that reduce informational and behavioral barriers. These programs may be more effective if delivered during times when parents are particularly in need of support, such as after work, or, alternatively when parents have more time to interact with their child, such as on a day off of work. This study compares the effects of an early childhood text-messaging program sent during the weekend to the same program sent on weekdays. We find that sending the text messages on the weekend is, on average, more beneficial to children's literacy and math development. This effect is particularly strong for initially lower achieving children, while the weekday texts show some benefits for higher achieving children on higher order skills. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the parents of lower achieving students, on average, face such high barriers during weekdays that supports are not enough to overcome these barriers, while for parents of higher achieving students, weekday texts are more effective because weekdays are more challenging, but not so difficult as to be untenable for positive parenting. In sum, the findings suggest that parenting support works best when parents have time, attention, and need.
J18|Effect of an Abrupt Change in Sexual and Reproductive Health Policy on Adolescent Birth Rates in Ecuador, 2008–2017|In recent years, several countries have implemented restrictive, abstinence-only policies toward reproductive health, as opposed to comprehensive, adolescent-friendly health services. Little is known, however, about the effects of these restrictive policies on adolescent birth rates at the national level or their differential effects by race and ethnicity. The extant literature is even scarcer in low- and middle-income countries. We fill this knowledge gap by exploiting an unexpected policy change in Ecuador that abruptly reversed course for reproductive health services for adolescent women in 2014. In a difference-in-differences analysis of age-specific birth rates in Ecuador’s 221 cantons, we find that the abrupt policy change was associated with an increase in teen birth rates by 9 births per 1000 women. In a difference-in-difference-in-differences analysis, we find that the policy change was associated with an additional increase of 12 births per 1000 women among those cantons where at least 12 percent of the population is self-declared as indigenous. Our results are robust to changes in standard error clustering, population weighting, logarithmic model specification, adjustments for underreporting, and changes in the year when the new policy went into effect.
J18|Impact of Defaults in Retirement Saving Plans: Public Employee Plans|This study examines the impact of the adoption automatic enrollment provisions by the state of South Dakota for its supplemental retirement saving plan (SRP). In South Dakota, state and local government employees, including teachers, are also covered by a defined benefit pension plan and by Social Security. Thus, career public employees in South Dakota can expect a life time annuity from these two programs of around 75 percent of their final salary. Prior to the introduction of automatic enrollment, the proportion of newly hired employees who were contributing to the SRP was less than three percent in their first year of employment. After the introduction of automatic enrollment, over 90 percent of newly hired workers who were auto enrolled were participating in the plan. Significant differences compared to earlier studies of auto enrollment include: we are examining public employees who are also covered by a defined benefit retirement plan, prior to the introduction of auto enroll participation were extremely low, and these is no employer match to employee contributions to the SRP. Thus, the key question is whether auto enrollment has the same powerful impact on contributions to a retirement saving plan under these conditions.
J18|Measuring women’s economic empowerment: Time use data and gender inequality|Empowerment, co-ordinated jointly by the OECD Development Co-operation Directorate, the Development Centre and Statistics Directorate. The initiative aims to identify policy and programme solutions to promote women’s economic empowerment by recognising, reducing and redistributing women’s unpaid care work. This paper presents new analysis of time use data and unpaid care work from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Peru and South Africa as well as comparisons with OECD countries. It provides recommendations for policy makers, donors and development practitioners to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, drawing on learning from the Social Institutions and Gender Index and in-country research by the OECD Policy Dialogue on Women’s Economic Empowerment. Specifically, the recommendations focus on how to recognise unpaid care work by measuring and valuing it, reduce time spent on drudgery by the provision of quality infrastructure and redistribute unpaid care tasks more equally between men and women by transforming gender stereotypes.
J18|The Effect of Paid Parental Leave on Breastfeeding, Parental Health and Behavior|Little is known about the effects of paid parental leave (in particular fathers' quotas) on parental health and involvement. In this paper, we exploit a reform that took place in the Canadian province of Quebec to address that important topic. In 2006, Quebec opted out of the federal plan and established its own parental insurance plan, named the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP). This program has lowered the eligibility criteria, increased income replacement and introduced fathers' quotas. Using three data sets, we investigate the impact of the QPIP on breastfeeding and parental health and behavior. Our results show that the reform increased breastfeeding duration and parental involvement. Results also suggest that the policy had limited positive effects on parental health.
J18|Optimal paid job-protected leave policy|Although many countries give workers the right to return to their previous workplace after a temporary leave period ends, little is known about the details of such policies. This study characterizes the optimal paid job-protected leave policy using a model in which a worker has to leave his or her job with a certain probability and chooses whether to return to work after the leave period ends. An optimal policy, consisting of the consumption of a worker, that of a worker on leave, and the length of the leave, maximizes social welfare subject to the resource feasibility constraint and incentive constraint under which a worker on leave voluntarily chooses to return to work after the leave period ends. The present study finds that when the incentive constraint does not bind, the income risk caused by the leave should be perfectly shared among workers and workers on leave and that the leave period balances the marginal welfare gain and loss from a slight increase in the leave period. When the incentive constraint binds, the income risk caused by the leave is not perfectly shared among workers and workers on leave and that workers consume more than workers on leave because the constrained-optimal allocation has to give an incentive to workers on leave to return to work. By lengthening the leave period, another feasible allocation improves social welfare, which implies that the length of the leave period at the constrained-optimal allocation is too short. In addition, the study compares two economies, one that experiences a high discount factor and the other that experiences a low discount factor. In the former economy, the incentive constraint does not bind, whereas it does bind in the latter economy. Comparing the constrained-optimal allocations in these two economies, I find that workers consume more in the latter economy than in the former economy and that {¥it total} consumption during the leave period in the former economy is larger than that in the latter economy. Moreover, as an application of the theory, the study focuses on the paid parental leave policies adopted by most OECD countries. Using a numerical simulation, I conclude that the negative relationship between the replacement rate, namely the ratio of cash benefits during the leave to wages while working, and length of the leave period could result from constrained-optimal allocations.
J18|The Influence of Old-age Retirement on Health: Causal Evidence from the Finnish Register Data|Abstract We quantify the impact of old-age retirement on health using longitudinal Finnish register data for the period 2000–2012, which allows for a strict isolation of the effects of transition from work to retirement for both mental and physical health indicators. We use the lowest statutory eligibility age for full old-age pensions, 63 years, as an instrument in FE-IV estimation to ensure causal inference. We find that (1) retirement moderately decreases the use of antidepressants, especially for women; (2) the beneficial effects of retirement on the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal conditions are smaller and more diffused; (3) there is no robust evidence that retirement effects vary systematically among socioeconomic groups, although more robust declines in musculoskeletal diseases were observed among manual-labour men; and (4) the beneficial effects in antidepressant use can be extended to apply to most Finns retiring at ages 62–64 based on our test of external validity.
J18|Exploring inter-household transfers:An assessment using panel data from Turkey|This paper aims to contribute to the growing literature on the crowding out/in effect of public transfers on private ones by using two consecutive four-year SILC panel data from Turkey covering years 2008-2011 and 2012-2015. Over the period under study, the number of beneficiaries has increased and the welfare system has expanded to segments of society that were uncovered before. In order to quantify the interaction between public and private transfers, we estimate the effects of public transfers on the amount and likelihood of receiving private transfers by controlling various household characteristics and individual heterogeneity through panel structure. We find that public transfers at the individual level lead to crowding out effects, while public transfers targeting household has no significant neutralizing effect on private transfers. Comparing results from different periods, we observe that the effect of both altruistic motive and crowding-out are decreasing. Additionally, we broaden the definition of standard private transfers to include rent-free (subsidized) housing support. Our results reveal that broadly defined private transfers have a downstream character, are less altruistically motivated and produce less crowding-out effect compared to standard definition.
J18|Effects of extended paternity leave on union stability and fertility|Long paternity leaves have the potential for lasting effects on parental unions, potentially reducing specialization and increasing union stability and fertility. We put these hypotheses to a causal test, using an extension of the Norwegian parental leave father's quota from 6 to 10 weeks as a source of exogenous variation in fathers' leave uptake. We implement a Regression Discontinuity design, using full population data from Norwegian administrative registers of parents of children in a four-month window around the reform (N = 9 757). The reform significantly increased the amount of leave taken by fathers by about three weeks and reduced the amount of leave taken by mothers. Neither union stability, fertility nor his or her subsequent earnings were affected by the reform.
J18|NDC: The Generic Old-Age Pension Scheme|"This chapter defines a universal public pension scheme (UPPS) as a government-mandated lifecycle longevity insurance scheme that transfers individual consumption from the working years to the retirement phase of the lifecycle. It discusses the differences in four UPPS designs defined with regard to whether they are defined contribution (DC) or defined benefit (DB), and financial (F) or nonfinancial (N). Generally speaking, DC schemes are distinguished from DB schemes by their basic building block of individual accounts. This ensures the important design feature of transparency, the ""enabler"" of economic efficiency - through the effects on marginal decisions to choose formal work over informal work or leisure and to postpone retirement marginally toward the end of the working life. The chapter examines additional criteria (fairness, financial sustainability, affordability, and adequacy), plus some other design characteristics of interest in a comparative assessment. The conclusion is that the two UPPS-DC designs are superior to the two UPPS-DB designs. The difference in the relative rates of return of NDC versus FDC designs, together with uncertain demographic effects on future investment needs, speak in favor of a UPPS portfolio with both. UPPS-FDC involves additional risks and costs, but also provides positive effects through returns for individuals and the economy."
J18|The Effect of House Prices on Fertility: Evidence from Canada|The price of housing is an important and under-studied candidate for consideration in fertility decisions. Theoretically, higher housing prices will cause renters to have fewer additional children, and home owners to have more children if they already have sufficient housing and low substitution between children and other “goods”, and fewer children otherwise. In this paper, we combine longitudinal data from the Canadian Survey of Labour Income and Dynamics (SLID) and housing price data from the Canadian Real Estate Association to estimate the effect of housing price on fertility. We follow non-moving women aged 18-40 (with their associated families) over time to ask whether changes in lagged housing price affects marginal or total fertility. For home owners, we find that lagged housing prices are positively associated with marginal fertility using pooled cross section or fixed effects, negatively associated with total fertility under pooled cross section, but positively associated using fixed effects. For renters, lagged housing prices are not significantly negatively associated with either total or marginal fertility measures.
J18|Corruption, Mortality and Fertility Rates, and Development|Mortality and fertility rates have an important in uence on economic devel- opment, while corruption also plays a role. This study examines the relationships among corruption, fertility and mortality rates, and economic development. The model is based on a three-period overlapping generations model in which agents are divided into two groups, households and bureaucrats. Households decide the number of children and bureaucrats supply public health services. All agents face mortality rates in the second period. As the empirical evidence indicates, we show that mortality and fertility rates affect development. We emphasize that corrup- tion determines the mortality rate and that the mortality rate affects corruption. Moreover, a two-way causal relationship exists between corruption and economic development. Therefore, three steady states can arise: the steady state of the early stage of development is characterized by a high level of corruption and high mortality and fertility rates; the steady state of the late stage is characterized by no corruption and low mortality and fertility rates; and the steady state of the middle stage is characterized by bureaucrats' mixed strategy whether they engage in corruption.
J18|Structure Demand Estimation of the Response to Food Safety Regulations in the Japanese Poultry Market|Since their implementation in 1995, the Agreements on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and Technical Barriers to Trade of the World Trade Organization have played an increasingly important role in the conduct of international negotiations. This study employs the method of moments estimator proposed by Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) and Nevo (2001) to estimate the effect of Japanese pesticide residue standards on poultry consumption with a particular focus on the maximum residue limits (MRLs) on pesticide and veterinary drugs. The results confirm that more stringent MRLs on pesticide and veterinary drugs enhance the demand for poultry imports by ensuring higher food safety. The results shed light on Japanese consumers’robust preference for food safety. Further counterfactual experiments of alternative MRLs show that the demand-enhancing effect may vary among the exporting countries, and appears to be more prominent for imported poultry from developed countries.
J18|Re-examination of the encouraging effect of childcare centers on maternal employment in Japan|This paper reexamines the effect of availability of childcare centers on maternal employment in Japan. Existing literature shows that there exist no or extremely small effects, focusing only on the availability of childcare centers licensed by the government. However, non-licensed centers have become available tremendously in big cities, and we need to examine the existence of the encouraging effect, taking account of the availability of non-licensed daycare centers. In order to reexamine the effect, we conducted an original survey in Osaka, one of the largest cities in Japan. We first show that, once controlled for maternal past employment status, observed household characteristics and labor market conditions, neither licensed or non-licensed daycare centers raise the probability of mothers starting working after childbirth. However, increases in the availability of daycare centers which supply a certain kind of nursing services, such as a care for ill children, can shorten the non-working period for mothers and raise maternal employment rate. The results also indicate that non-licensed daycare centers significantly increase maternal full-time employment rate when the child is 1.5 years old, and that this encouraging effect is different by services provided by daycare centers. On the other hand, the encouraging effects by licensed or non-licensed daycare centers are not found for mothers in part-time jobs.
J18|In the Same Boat, but not Equals: The Heterogeneous Effects of Indirect Taxation on Child Health in Punjab-Pakistan|No abstract is available for this item.
J18|The impact of universal child benefits on family health and behaviours|In 2006, the Universal Child Care Benefit was introduced in Canada for all children aged less than 6 years. This program aims to help cover the cost of children and to provide financial assistance to families with young children in their choice of childcare. We exploit this policy change to estimate the effects of unconditional family cash transfers on the health and behaviours of two-parent families and their children. Using a difference-in-differences model, we find no evidence that the program improved child and parental outcomes in aggregate. A modest but fragile beneficial effect is found for low-education families and for girls.
J18|Determinants of population growth: empirical evidence from Pakistan (1960-2017)|The importance of population studies in Pakistan has been recognized since very ancient times. While population growth issues rarely grab the headlines in the media, it is imperative to note that Pakistan continues to be a victim of population growth. Employing the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation criterion, the study seeks to uncover the determinants of population growth in Pakistan over the period 1960 – 2017. Diagnostic tests were carried out in order to verify the statistical appropriateness of the estimated model. Amongst other findings, the study revealed that a 1% increase in contraceptive prevalence rate will lead to approximately 3.53% decrease in population growth in Pakistan. The study, whose policy recommendations are four – fold, strongly; encourages the government to put measures as to reduce population growth in Pakistan.
J18|Análisis de complementariedad del Programa de Desarrollo de Zonas Prioritarias y del Programa de Zonas de Atención Prioritaria en el Programa Cruzada Nacional contra el Hambre en municipios indígenas en el Estado de Veracruz México|"Mexico, with the commissioning of the ""National Crusade Against Hunger Program"" in 2013, aimed at serving the population that presents both extreme poverty and food deprivation. The article aims to analyze whether the criterion of the selection of the municipalities of the State of Veracruz incorporated in the National Crusade Against Hunger Program (PNCH) show complementarity with the efforts in the fight against poverty in the social expenditure strategy applied in the Priority Attention Zones Program (ZAP) and the Priority Areas Development Program (PDZP) and, particularly, the indigenous municipalities that have a greater degree of social exclusion. The adjustment of a binary logistic regression model is presented, in order to assess the incidence of contextual factors to interpret the scope of the strategy adopted by the federal government in the fight against poverty and hunger. As a result, it is evident that there is no continuity in the fight against poverty, since the municipalities included in the strategy Priority Areas of Attention and Program of Development of Priority Zones are not considered in the selection of municipalities incorporated in the National Program of Crusade Against Hunger, a situation that identifies the relationship between programs is not complementary."
J18|Work and family as factors determining Individual Subjective Well-Being in Spain|We investigate the degree of satisfaction with life carried by individuals for the Spanish case and which are some of the most influential work and personal factors, all according to their family structure: single, single parent, couples with children and childless couples, and two periods in the recent economic cycle. In this paper, the subjective individual well-being level is analyzed as an indicator of inequality. We use factors from two of the areas in which the individual develops most part of his life: work and family. It is an empirical analysis with not too many precedents in the literature, using these family models and incorporating only labour and personal factors and not considering other variables such as health, to better highlight the relevance of labor considerations. The results indicate substantial differences in the degree of individual well-being depending on family type and cycle. Furthermore, of the explanatory variables, job satisfaction, and good labour relations and social relations on the job were found to be the most important and significant in relation to well-being. The research could serve to orient human resource policies in companies and also public policies to improve the plight of those least satisfied with the lives they lead, here single parents and couples with children.
J18|The Relationship between Race-Congruent Students and Teachers: Does Racial Discrimination Exist?|This paper explores the role of teacher race/ethnicity in the teacher-perceived relationship with early elementary school students. Employing a model with both student and teacher fixed effects, I discover a positive link between the racial/ethnic match and the teacher-reported relationship with students. Specifically, minority students tend to have a closer and more positive relationship with their teachers than white students when they are taught by a minority teacher. Adapted rank-based tests of discrimination reveal that the favorable teacher-reported relationship with students is not prompted by teachers favoring their own kind or discriminating against opposite-race students. I show that these estimates are driven by minority students reacting positively when they have a minority teacher but adversely once assigned to a white teacher, which is consistent with the role model effect. Given the importance of the relationship between young children with non-parental adults in their early stages of life, these findings have crucial policy implications.
J18|The impact of oil prices on CO2 emissions in China: A Wavelet coherence approach|This paper observes the possible co-movements of oil price and CO2 emissions in China by following wavelet coherence and wavelet partial coherence analyses to be able to depict short-run and long-run co-movements at both low and high frequencies. To this end, this research might provide the current literature with the output of potential short run and long run, structural, changes in CO2 emissions upon a shock (a change) in oil prices in China together with the control variables of World oil prices, fossil energy consumption, and renewables consumption, and, urban population in China. Therefore, this research aims at determining wavelet coherencies between the variables and phase differences to exhibit the leading variable in potential co-movements. By following the time domain and frequency domain analyses of this research, one may claim that the oil prices in China has considerable negative impact on CO2 emissions at high frequencies for the periods 1960-2014 and 1971-2014 in China. Besides, one may underline as well other important output of the research exploring that the urban population and CO2 emissions have positive associations, move together for the period 1960-2014 in China. Eventually, this paper might suggest that authorities follow demand side management policies considering energy demand behavior at both shorter cycles and longer cycles to diminish the CO2 emissions in China.
J18|The future of social protection in Latin America in a context of accelerated changes|This article discusses the future of social protection in Latin America and the challenges the region faces in the three key performance areas: coverage, sufficiency and sustainability. In particular, the article analyses how coverage is strongly determined by the structure of employment; the limits to expand it given the inability to generate sufficient fiscal space; the consequences of widespread economic and labour informality; the governance deficits; and the acceleration of population aging. It also discusses the increasing need of an adequate combination of contributory and non-contributory social protection provision, as well as the need for a better articulation of social protection systems with the sustainable development framework and its three main spheres: economic, social and environmental. Finally, it is addressed the future of social protection in a context of a growing employment in the services sector, technological change and automation of production and employment; and the relevance of an adequate social protection response to the consequences of climate change and the effects of natural disasters.
J18|"""Bad Apple"" Peer Effects in Elementary Classrooms: the Case of Corporal Punishment in the Home"|This paper provides the first empirical evidence on the existence of negative spillover effects from children exposed to corporal punishment in the home. We find that interactions with peers who suffer from physical punishment significantly depress achievement in both math and language among Vietnamese fifth graders. These adverse impacts are transmitted through the reduction of academic expectation and the increased incidence of physical bullies at school in the presence of more corporal-punishment-inflicted peers. Our results offer meaningful implications for both education and social policies.
J18|Marriage, Divorce and Sorting: A Reassessment of Unilateral Divorce Laws|I evaluate the impact of unilateral divorce laws (UDLs) on the risk of divorce via two channels: the effect on divorce of married couples (divorce effect), and the effect on marriage formation (sorting effect). The divorce effect affects the divorce probability of all married couples, while the sorting effect is only experienced by couples that married after the implementation of UDLs. I use differences in the timing of states' enactment of UDLs as a source of exogenous treatment variation in a difference-in-differences approach. Using the Divorce and Marriage file of Vital Statistics from the NBER data collection, I find that UDLs have a profound impact on marital sorting. The sorting effect significantly increases the cumulative risk of divorce within any length of marriage, while the divorce effect is only significantly associated with increasing the risk of divorce within the first 9 years and has no effect on subsequent years. Moreover, unstable marriages dissolve faster due to changes in marital sorting. The sorting effect increases the risk of divorce in each of the first 5 years of marriage by 4.5%, while there is zero divorce effect for these same years. 31% of the initial increase in the overall divorce rate identified in previous studies is due to the sorting effect.
J18|Missing Women, Gender Imbalance and Sex Ratio at Birth: Why the One-Child Policy Matters|In this paper, we show that the one-child policy has played a significant role in the decline of China’s fertility. The one-child policy had reduced China’s fertility rate by an additional 11.5%, based on a year-on-year comparison with the case if China had not implemented the policy. The methodology we introduced in estimating the number of “missing women” improves on the method employed in Anderson and Ray (2010). Our findings suggest that the one-child policy resulted in a total of approximately 11 million missing women in China, and contributed to more than 50% of its outstanding gender imbalance. The adoption of the one-child policy has prevented around 50 million births, and is confirmed to be the major cause of China’s highly skewed sex ratio at birth.
J18|Can financial incentives reduce the baby gap? Evidence from a reform in maternity leave benefits| In this paper, I assess whether earnings-dependent maternity leave positively impacts fertility and narrows the baby gap between highly educated (high-earning) and less-educated (low-earning) women. I exploit a major maternity leave benefit reform in Germany that considerably increased the financial incentives, by up to 21,000 EUR, for highly educated and higher-earning women. Using the large differential changes in maternity leave benefits across education and income groups in a differences-in-differences design, I estimate the causal impact of the reform on fertility for up to 5 years. In addition to demonstrating an up to 23% increase in the fertility of tertiary-educated women, I find a positive, statistically significant effect of increased benefits on fertility, driven mainly by women at the middle and upper end of the earnings distribution. Overall, the results suggest that earnings-dependent maternity leave benefits, which compensate women according to their opportunity cost of childbearing, could successfully reduce the fertility rate disparity related to mothers’ education and earnings.
J18|Labor Market and Distributional Effects of an Increase in the Retirement Age|We evaluate the labor market and distributional effects of an increase in the early retirement age (ERA) from 60 to 63 for women. We use a regression discontinuity design which exploits the immediate increase in the ERA between women born in 1951 and 1952. The analysis is based on the German micro census which includes about 370,000 households per year. We focus on heterogeneous labor market effects on the individual and on the household level and we study the distributional implications using net household income. In this respect we extend the previous literature which mainly studied employment effects on the individual level. Our results show sizable labor market effects which strongly differ by subgroups. We document larger employment effects for women who cannot rely on other income on the household level, e.g. women with a low income partner. The distributional analysis shows on average no significant effects on female or household income. This result holds as well for heterogeneous groups: Even for the most vulnerable groups, such as single women, women without higher education, or low partner income, we do not find significant reductions in income. One reason for this result is program substitution.
J18|Thinking about pension systems for the 21st century: A few remarks based on the Polish example|The end of 2018 will mark the 20th anniversary of the introduction of Poland’s current pension system. It has been subjected to constant modifications, in general dictated by either ideological or ad hoc goals, but it has resisted destruction, and in essence is working as it was designed. The need for its introduction, misleadingly called a reform, was dictated by a long-term shift in the age structure of the population. In essence, the earlier system was replaced by the current one. The essence of this switch is a shift from the quasi-tax financing suited to the population structure by age of the past, to quasi-savings financing suited to the structure in the 21st century. This text is not an overview of the 20-year history of the current system; it is a critical examination of the functioning of Poland’s pension system against the backdrop of the universal challenges that pension systems are facing in the 21st century. The text barely touches on many fundamental questions. A full discussion of them would require a longer discourse, for which there is no space here.
J18|Electronic monitoring of offenders and accused persons in Slovakia in the international and European context|The first program of Electronic monitoring of offenders and accused persons in Slovakia was launched by Law adopted in 2015 and shaped by the results of the pilot project co financed by the European Union. The aim of this presentation/paper is threefold: (1) to briefly summarize the key facts and data concerning this program, (2) to introduce the project titled ?Interdisciplinary approach to electronic monitoring of accused and convicted persons in the Slovak environment? (acronymed IAEMPS), and (3) to present the results of the research concerning the international and European context of the above mentioned Slovak national program, carried out within the IAEMPS project.
J18|Matching for Social Mobility with Unobserved Heritable Characteristics|We analyse the intergenerational transmission of ‘innate ability’, focusing on the role of marital sorting. The heritability of ability induces a concern for the ability of potential spouses independently of a concern for their earning capacity. Marriages form on the basis of beliefs about ability (since it is not observed) as well earning capacity (which is observed). Beliefs are informed by earning capacity, but crucially also by family background. We show how the intergenerational transmission of ability becomes sensitive to elements of the economic environment once marital sorting is endogenously determined, but also that policy variables (e.g. income redistribution) generally have no impact. The analysis also reveals a novel ‘status motive’ for parental investment and channel through which the fortunes of grandparents and prior generations persist.
J18|Health effects of caring for and about parents and spouses|Informal caregiving is a potentially attractive alternative to formal care but may entail health costs for the caregiver. We examine the mental and physical health impact of providing informal care and disentangle the caregiving effect – the effect of caring for someone in need – from the family effect – the effect of caring about someone in need. We account for potential endogeneity in the caregiving decision and control for previous health status using Arellano-Bond difference GMM models. We use four waves (2010-2013) of panel data from the Dutch Study on Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation (STREAM). We find that caregiving harms the mental health of caregivers; this effect is mainly present for spousal caregivers. A negative health shock of a family member also has a direct negative effect on mental health, providing evidence of a family effect. These findings imply that most studies may have overestimated the negative health effects of caregiving by not accounting adequately for the family effect. As the caregiving effect differs strongly between various types of caregivers, policies to counteract this effect should specifically target subgroups of caregivers that carry the largest burden of informal caregiving.
J18|Gender Composition of Children and Sanitation Behavior In India|Open Defecation has been linked to various public health issues and has gained significant policy attention. Investing in adoption of better sanitation has also been advocated on the grounds of providing women with privacy and protection from po-tential harassment. Nonetheless, previous research has shown that due to son-biased preferences, households in India under-invest in outcomes for their female children. I use the gender of the first-born child as an indicator of the presence of adult female children in households and find that, in certain cases, households reduce open defeca-tion if the first-born child is a girl. The findings in this paper provide a new first stage association between gender composition of children and sanitation behavior and also contribute to the economic literature on decision making in households belonging to developing countries.
J18|The Impact of Paid Maternity Leave on Maternal Health|We examine the impact of the introduction of paid maternity leave in Norway in 1977 on maternal health. Before the policy reform, mothers were eligible for 12 weeks of unpaid leave. Mothers giving birth after July 1, 1977 were entitled to 4 months of paid leave and 12 months of unpaid leave. We combine Norwegian administrative data with survey data on the health of women around age 40 and estimate the medium- and long-term impacts of the reform using regression discontinuity and difference-inregression discontinuity designs. Our results suggest paid maternity leave benefits are protective of maternal health. The reform improved a range of maternal health outcomes, including BMI, blood pressure, pain, and me mntal health, and it increased health-promoting behaviors, such as exercise and not smoking. The effects were larger for first-time and low-resource mothers and women who would have taken little unpaid leave in the absence of the reform. We also study the maternal health effects of subsequent expansions in paid maternity leave and find evidence of diminishing returns to leave length.
J18|Fertility and population policy|There have been significant changes in both the fertility rates and fertility perception since 1970s. In this paper, we examine the relationship between government policies towards fertility and the fertility trends. Total fertility rate, defined as the number of children per woman, is used as the main fertility trend variable. We use panel data from the United Nations World Population Policies database, and the World Bank World Development Indicators for the period 1976 through 2013. We find a significant negative association between a countryâ€™s fertility rate and its anti-fertility policy. On the other hand, there is no significant and robust relationship between the fertility rate and a countryâ€™s pro-fertility or family-planning policies. In addition we find evidence of spatial autocorrelation in the total fertility rate, and spatial spillovers from a governmentâ€™s policy on fertility.
J18|Frühe Eltern entscheiden sich für größere Familien: Determinanten des Übergangs zu erstem, zweitem und dritten Kind|Um dem demografischen Wandel in Deutschland nachhaltig entgegenzuwirken, könnten mehr junge Menschen dafür gewonnen werden, sich für das erste, zweite, dritte und weitere Kinder zu entscheiden. Allerdings ist trotz jahrelanger intensiver Forschung zu diesem Thema nach wie vor nicht vollständig klar, welche Faktoren dabei fördernd oder hemmend wirken. Ein zentrales Problem ist hierbei, dass sich die Rahmenbedingungen für das Familienleben und damit auch mögliche Determinanten für die Entscheidung über Kinder, wie das Einkommen, mit der Geburt des Kindes ändern. Daher wird im vorliegenden Beitrag mit Hilfe des Sozioökonomischen Panels die Situation von Personen, die sich erst in den Folgejahren für oder gegen erste und weitere Kinder entschieden haben, verglichen. Da hier allerdings insbesondere die Abgrenzung der Beobachtungsgruppen eine Herausforderung darstellt, wird das Verfahren nur angewandt, sofern sich die betrachteten Größen über die Zeit verändern können. Ist dies, wie beim Alter bei der ersten Geburt, nicht der Fall, erfolgt eine einfachere Ex-Post- Betrachtung von Eltern die ihre fertile Phase bereits abgeschlossen haben. Es zeigt sich, dass das Timing der Geburten von großer Bedeutung für die letztendliche Familiengröße ist. So haben 59 Prozent der Mütter im Alter zwischen 40 und 54 Jahren mit drei und mehr Kindern ihr erstes Kind im Alter unter 25 Jahren bekommen aber nur 28 Prozent der Mütter mit einem Kind. Auch liegt der Altersabstand zwischen dem ersten und zweiten Kind unter drei Jahren bei 51 Prozent bei Müttern mit drei und mehr Kindern, aber nur bei 31 Prozent bei Mütter mit zwei Kindern. Für die Familiengründung ist darüber hinaus eine verfestigte Partnerschaft von großer Bedeutung. So lebten 67 Prozent der im Jahr 2010 zwischen 25 und 29 Jahre alten, kinderlosen Frauen, die bis 2015 ihr erstes Kind bekommen haben, zu diesem Zeitpunkt mit einem Partner in einem Haushalt, während dies nur auf 37 Prozent derer zutraf, die kein Kind bekommen haben. Ein weiterer Faktor ist der soziale Hintergrund. So bekommen insbesondere Migranten und Personen, die selbst mehrere Geschwister haben, drei und mehr Kinder. Für die Politik lässt sich aus den Ergebnissen ableiten, dass einerseits Rahmenbedingungen geschaffen werden sollten, die es Paaren leicht machen, sich bereits früh für erste und weitere Kinder zu entscheiden, und andererseits darauf hingearbeitet werden sollte, dass eine vergleichsweise frühe Elternschaft und große Familien mit drei und mehr Kinder in der öffentlichen Wahrnehmung stärker sichtbar werden.
J18|Paying for the view? How nursing home prices affect quality of care|Increasing long-term care demand raises the need of high quality care in nursing homes. This study analyses whether higher prices have a causal effect on quality of care in Swiss nursing homes and assesses the extent of cross-subsidization between different price components. We use administrative data collected by the Swiss Federal Office for Statistics from 2012 to 2016 on all nursing homes in the twelve Swiss cantons with canton-wide fixed reimbursement rates for nursing care. We apply multivariate linear regressions and two-stage least square estimation techniques to estimate the effect of nursing care prices and prices for accommodation and services on care quality, measured by registered staffing levels. Our estimates show a positive impact of all price components on care quality. Although nursing homes are prohibited to use revenues from accommodation and services to cover nursing care, a 10% increase in that price component increases certified staffing levels by 0.7 to 1.7 nurses or four to ten percent (full-time-equivalent) for an average sized nursing home (50 beds). Thus, limiting care prices implicitly sets a limit for care quality and induces care providers to pass on costs to the residents.
J18|Give it Another Try: What are the Effects of a Job Creation Scheme Especially Designed for Hard-to-Place Workers?|Job creation schemes (JCSs) have for a long time been considered to function as stepping stone for unemployed workers into the labour market. However, previous research has shown that public job creation schemes could at best be effective for persons with little or no employment chances. This paper contributes to this discussion by studying the effect of a very large and innovative JCS which employs an extraordinary selection mechanism to identify this group. Relying on a combination of administrative data and survey data, we employ radius-matching with regression adjustment to estimate treatment effects. Our results indicate that the effects are still negative but weaker than the ones reported in previous studies. We argue that this is due to a principal-agent problem at the very last step of the selection process which undermines the intention of the programme. Furthermore, we point to effect heterogeneity with regard to programme duration which suggests that the results are more optimistic for shorter contracts. Finally, we show that the results are sensitive to the inclusion of survey variables, even if high quality administrative data are available.
J18|Inequality of educational opportunities and the role of learning intensity: Evidence from a quasi-experiment in Germany|Over the 2000s, many federal states in Germany shortened the duration of secondary school by one year while keeping the curriculum unchanged. Exploiting quasi-experimental variation due to the staggered introduction of this reform allows me to identify the causal effect of increased learning intensity on Inequality of Educational Opportunity (IEOp), the share in educational outcome variance explained by predetermined circumstances beyond a student's control. The reform-induced increase in learning intensity had no short-term effect on IEOp. In the medium term, however, IEOp increased as differences in parental resources gained importance through support opportunities like private tuition adapting to the intensified educational process. The effect is stronger for mathematics/science than for reading, implying the existence of subject-dependent curricular flexibilities. My findings point to the importance of accounting for distributional consequences when evaluating reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency of educational systems and to the role of learning intensity for explaining changes in educational opportunities influencing social mobility.
J18|Mortalidad neonatal en el Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia: desigualdades territoriales en el acceso a los servicios de salud|A pesar de los esfuerzos realizados para reducir la mortalidad neonatal en el Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, y de la implementación del Seguro Universal Materno Infantil (SUMI), los datos revelan que el progreso ha sido más lento que lo logrado en cuanto a la reducción de la mortalidad infantil en general. En ese contexto, el interés principal de esta investigación es definir las características de la mortalidad neonatal en el país. El estudio parte del análisis econométrico de los datos de la Encuesta Nacional de Demografía y Salud (ENDSA) de 2008. El objetivo es visualizar cómo el lugar de procedencia incide en el riesgo de muerte del recién nacido. Los hallazgos revelan que, en el Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, el riesgo de muerte neonatal está condicionado por el acceso a los servicios de salud, debido a las disparidades territoriales a nivel urbano y rural. Estas disparidades se traducen en barreras de acceso económicas, geográficas y de exclusión que disminuyen la equidad en el acceso y la utilización de los servicios de salud, refuerzan los determinantes sociales que inciden en la muerte del recién nacido y limitan el acceso a intervenciones oportunas y adecuadas en la atención materno-neonatal.
J18|The Measurement and Mismeasurement of Social Difference|Measures of social difference such as the Ethnolinguistic Fractionalization Index (ELF) and Polarization are commonly used proxies for community heterogeneity. They are used to “explain” collective outcomes ranging from voluntary contributions in elementary schools to civil wars. This essay reviews this literature in the face of new research on identity and collective outcomes. I argue that methods of social classification often seriously mis-measure identity and difference and that poverty rather than heterogeneity is often the source of community failures. Experiments on deliberative democracy offer important insights into how diverse societies can flourish.
J18|Carências habitacionais no Brasil e na América Latina : o papel do ônus excessivo com aluguel urbano|The last decade in Brazil has been marked by heavy investments in the real state sector. Despite such a significant flow of resources, an appraisal of indicators related to housing needs that have guided public policies in the sector exposes a relative persistence of the so-called housing shortage. This is mainly due to one of its four basic components: the urban rental affordability stress. In order to understand the behavior of this component, the present paper brings a conceptual discussion regarding the housing shortage indicator, by means of the theoretical framework provided by urban political ecology, as well as of a comparative analysis between the different calculation methodologies adopted by Latin American countries.
J18|Economic consequences of family policies|There is no compelling evidence that extended parental leave rights have a positive impact on female employment, according to research by Claudia Olivetti and Barbara Petrongolo, which analyses the labour market effects of family-oriented policies - such as parental leave, childcare support and flexible work arrangements - in 30 OECD countries over 45 years. Their study finds that job-protected parental leave entitlements up to 18 months are associated with better female employment and wage outcomes. But longer and more generously paid parental leave entitlements may be detrimental to female employment, especially for the less skilled. Making it easier to be a working mother, via subsidised childcare, leads to better labour market outcomes than extending parental leave.
J18|Does Part-Time Mothering Help Get a Job? The Role of Shared Custody in Women’s Employment|Though shared custody arrangements after divorce are more and more frequent in many countries, little is known about their economic consequences for parents. By relaxing family time constraints, does shared custody help divorced mothers return to work more easily? This article analyses to what extent the type of child custody arrangement affects mothers' labour market behaviours after divorce. Using a large sample of divorcees from an exhaustive French administrative income-tax database, and taking advantage of the huge territorial discrepancies observed in the proportion of shared custody, we correct for the possible endogeneity of shared custody. As it turns out, the probability of being employed is 16 percentage points higher for mothers with shared custody arrangements compared to those having sole physical custody, with huge heterogeneous effects: larger positive effects are observed for previously inactive women, for those belonging to the lowest income quintiles before divorce, for those with a young child, and for those who have three or more children. Shared custody is particularly helpful for women who are far removed from the labour market.
J18|The Politics of Aging and Retirement: Evidence from Swiss Referenda|Aging creates financial troubles for PAYG pension systems, since the share of retirees to workers increases. An often advocated policy response is to increase retirement age. Ironically, however, the political support for this policy may actually be hindered by population aging. Using Swiss administrative voting data at municipal level (and individual survey data) from pension reforms referenda, we show in fact that individuals close to retirement tend to oppose policies that postpone retirement, whereas young and elderly individuals are more favorable. The current process of population aging, and the associated increase in the size of the cohort of individuals close to retirement, may partially explain why a pension reform, which increased retirement age for females, was approved in two referenda in 1995 and 1998, while a reform, which proposed a similar increase in female retirement age, was defeated in a 2017 referendum.
J18|Freihandel von Lissabon nach Wladiwostok: wem nutzt, wem schadet ein eurasisches Freihandelsabkommen?|"Der Handel zwischen der EU und Russland ist derzeit durch Sanktionen des Westens gegen Russland und gegenseitige Embargo-Maßnahmen schwer belastet, ohne dass eine sichtbare Veränderung der geostrategischen Ausrichtung Russlands erreicht wurde. Vielleicht erfordert ein Interessensausgleich weniger Strafmaßnahmen, sondern eher die Perspektive auf vertiefte wirtschaftliche Kooperation. Sowohl die EU als auch die Nachfolgestaaten der Sowjetunion sollten großes Interesse an einer Freihandelszone „von Lissabon bis Wladiwostok"" haben, weil die Strukturen ihrer komparativen Vorteile stark komplementär zueinander sind. Für Russland könnte ein tiefgreifendes Abkommen zwischen der EU und der Eurasischen Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft einen Zuwachs der realen Pro-Kopf-Einkommen um 3% bringen; für Deutschland um 0,2%. Das bedeutet ein Einkommenszuwachs von 235 Euro pro Kopf und Jahr für Russland und 91 Euro für Deutschland. Damit könnten Russland und die anderen Länder der ehemaligen Sowjetunion interessante Partner für eine vertiefte wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit mit der EU sein. Die EU sollte an einer stabilen wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung in ihrer unmittelbaren Nachbarschaft größtes Interesse haben. Außerdem verspricht die komplementäre Spezialisierungsstruktur dieser Länder substantielle wirtschaftliche Vorteile auch für die EU."

Resumen Actualmente la muerte es un hecho inevitable, sin embargo, la esperanza de vida ha cambiado de forma importante en el tiempo y aún en nuestros días difiere ampliamente entre grupos humanos. El avance de la tecnología sanitaria ha permitido que ciertas muertes puedan controlarse, postergarse o evitarse. Por ello, el objetivo de este artículo es medir el impacto que tienen las causas de muerte evitable, sobre las variables demográficas en la región Caribe colombiana, 1999—2014. Para lograrlo, se utilizó el método de eliminación hipotética de causas de muertes usando tablas de vidas. Los resultados indican que si en el periodo de estudio se hubiesen evitado algunas muertes a causa de enfermedades del sistema circulatorio y causas externas de mortalidad, la esperanza de vida de esta población se hubiera prolongado significativamente.

Abstract Death is now an inevitable fact, however, life expectancy has changed significantly in time and still in our day it differs widely between human groups. The advancement of health technology has allowed certain causes of death to be controlled, postponed or avoided. Therefore, the objective of this research is to measure the impact of a preventable death cause on demographic variables in the Colombian Caribbean region 1999—2014. To achieve this, the hypothetical method of elimination death causes using life—tables. The results indicate that in this period of study, if deaths from diseases of the circulatory system and external causes of mortality had been avoided, the life expectancy of this population would have been significantly prolonged.

INTRODUCCIÓN La muerte es un hecho inevitable, sin embargo, la edad promedio de la defunción ha cambiado de forma importante a lo largo de la historia y aún en nuestros días var a ampliamente entre diferentes comunidades. Estas variaciones son el efecto de determinantes biológicos, ambientales, socioeconómicos y psicosociales, que influyen sobre el proceso vital. Dichos factores están sujetos a su vez a su propia dinámica histórica, se articulan de manera diferente y responden en grado variable a los avances tecnológicos (Gómez—Arias, 2008). Uno de los campos específicos del análisis de la mortalidad como fenómeno socioeconómico es el de la mortalidad evitable. Si bien es cierto que la muerte es un hecho inevitable, existen diferentes mecanismos o alternativas que hacen posible frenarla o postergarla si se interviene tempranamente en los factores que la desencadenan (Dávila—Cervantes & Agudelo—Botero, 2014). En el estudio de la mortalidad evitable se justifica, al igual que en el resto de causas de mortalidad, la incorporación de los factores socioeconómicos, a fin de explicar las desigualdades existentes en su distribución entre los diferentes grupos de población. Algunos autores han propuesto listas de causas de mortalidad evitable basadas en la Clasificación Internacional de Enfermedades (CIE), las cuales varían según el concepto que cada autor tenga sobre la evitabilidad de las diferentes condiciones. Este concepto toma importancia desde los años 70 en el campo de la epidemiología y en la literatura científica, sin embargo, no se cuenta con una definición exacta de ella. De acuerdo con Taucher (1978), a quien se le atribuye en gran parte el avance y desarrollo de este tema en América Latina, la estructura por causa de las defunciones está vinculada al grado de desarrollo de un país, ya que las tasas de mortalidad por causas se usan como indicadores del nivel de salud e identificación de los principales problemas de la población, porque es más fácil medir la mortalidad que la morbilidad. De acuerdo con Acosta & Romero (2014), las causas de muerte más sobresalientes están constantemente relacionadas con factores que pueden ser evitables, en la medida en que se pueda entender de qué se muere la población y cuáles son los grupos más vulnerables. Indagar sobre el tema de mortalidad evitable continúa siendo de vital interés en los campos de la demografía, la salud pública y la planificación del desarrollo. Esto puede atribuirse en gran medida a las relaciones existentes entre mortalidad y condiciones socioeconómicas, que se reflejan en diferencias de niveles y de causas de mortalidad entre países y entre sectores de un mismo país (Taucher, 1978). Así, la mortalidad evitable es considerada como uno de los indicadores más importantes al momento de medir las condiciones y calidad de vida de una población. El término evitabilidad depende en gran parte de las condiciones socioeconómicas de cada país. En el caso de Colombia y, en especial, la región Caribe, se experimenta una importante transición demográfica y epidemiológica, acompañada del avance tecnológico y el desarrollo científico en la medicina; así, las causas de muerte por enfermedades transmisibles se desplazan por enfermedades no transmisibles (cardiovasculares y cánceres) (Acosta & Romero P., 2014). En tal sentido, el estudio de la mortalidad evitable constituye un factor importante para medir el desempeño de los sistemas de salud y de los avances en desarrollo y bienestar en una comunidad. Las muertes evitables representan un costo social. En efecto, cuanto más joven es la persona que fallece “antes de lo esperado”, se provoca un impacto mayor sobre el capital humano de una ciudad, región o país (Alvis—Guzmán & Alvis—Estrada, 2009). Por ello, el objetivo de esta investigación es medir el impacto que tiene la mortalidad evitable, sobre los patrones de mortalidad de los habitantes de la región Caribe colombiana, durante el periodo 1999 a 2014. 2. MORTALIDAD EVITABLE: UNA REVISIÓN A LA LITERATURA INTERNACIONAL Y NACIONAL El concepto de mortalidad evitable tiene su origen hace cuatro décadas, y es el resultado del cuestionamiento por el impacto de los avances de la medicina en el descenso de la mortalidad observado durante la primera mitad del siglo XX. También se debe en gran parte al interés de un grupo de expertos de la Universidad de Harvard por desarrollar indicadores colectivos e individuales para evaluar la calidad de la atención médica (Franco et al., 2006). El uso de la mortalidad por causas específicas para evaluar el estado de los servicios sanitarios y las políticas públicas en salud asistencial nace en el siglo XX. Juanatey (2015) señala que los primeros vestigios datan desde el año 1928 en Reino Unido, donde se efectuaron estudios acerca de la mortalidad materna con la finalidad de identificar los errores y las áreas en las que se podrían realizar mejoras, y así poder evitar muertes innecesarias. Asimismo, plantea que en Estados Unidos se realizaron estudios similares en 1930, lo que conllevó a reducciones importantes en las tasas de mortalidad materna. El concepto toma mayor fuerza a partir de la década de los 70, con los importantes aportes de Rutstein, a quien se le atribuye ser el padre del concepto de evitabilidad (Rutstein et al. 1976). Él dirigió el Grupo Activo de Enfermedades Evitables y Manejables, el cual tomó como fuente el concepto de médicos especialistas y elaboró una lista de enfermedades, incapacidades y causas de muerte conocidas, consideradas innecesariamente precoces, pues si todo lo que se tenía que hacer se hubiera hecho, dichas defunciones se hubieran prevenido o retrasado. Este grupo desarrolló un método de medición de la calidad de los cuidados médicos, sustentado en contar los casos de enfermedades innecesarias, discapacidad y muertes prematuras. Por tanto, construyeron una lista de 90 condiciones que denominaron “eventos centinela de la salud”, pues suponían que su presencia era una señal de alerta para el seguimiento de la atención médica, ya que los casos de enfermedad, discapacidad o muerte en estas condiciones se consideran prevenibles y/o tratables mediante atención médica adecuada y oportuna (Rutstein et al., 1976). Para el grupo de Rutstein (1976), el hallazgo de muertes clasificadas como evitables debía interpretarse como una señal de alarma para las autoridades sanitarias, pues estas defunciones constituían indicadores de que la calidad de la atención médica, en alguno de sus niveles, era susceptible de mejorar. En consecuencia, se proponía incorporar el estudio de las causas de muerte evitable a los sistemas de vigilancia en salud pública (Juanatey, 2015). Para la década de los 80, aparece un grupo de investigadores británicos, que tiene como máximo exponente a Charlton. Este grupo de investigadores fue el pionero en utilizar el concepto de mortalidad evitable en un estudio empírico con datos procedentes de Inglaterra y Gales (Charlton et al., 1983), y en examinar las tendencias nacionales e internacionales. Rescatan la preocupación y necesidad de diseñar indicadores del resultado de la atención médica contra los cuales pudiera evaluarse el uso de los recursos. Es decir, el propósito central iba encaminado a establecer índices que pudieran mostrar el resultado de las intervenciones médicas. Así, Charlton et al. (1983) afianzaron la posibilidad de poder usar la mortalidad evitable como indicador para monitorizar el proceso y los resultados de la atención sanitaria. Los primeros resultados de las investigaciones de este grupo muestran que los factores sociales cobran un papel importante a la hora de comparar las razones estandarizadas de mortalidad, ya que se encontraron variaciones determinantes entre las diferentes regiones, es decir que la muerte evitable, así como la atención médica, eran también influenciadas por factores sociales. Pero las diferencias permanecían después del ajuste por factores sociales, sugiriendo que la variación en la mortalidad por estas causas se relacionaba también con los servicios de salud. Posteriormente, para la segunda mitad de la década de los años 1980 aparecen los aportes de Holland (1986), quien, junto con otro grupo de investigadores, por medio del Programa de Investigación de Servicios de Salud de la Comunidad Europea, publicó el Atlas de Mortalidad Evitable de la Comunidad Europea. En los análisis propuestos por este grupo de investigación, se evidencia la afinidad con las conclusiones propuestas por Charlton, que buscaba mejorar la relación entre algunas causas de muerte e intervenciones médicas específicas. Las causas de muerte se consideraron evitables cuando eran objeto de intervenciones efectivas y de proveedores de atención médica que fueran identificables. Para Holland (1986), las defunciones evitables pueden subdividirse en indicadores de atención médica (causas de muertes evitables con servicios médicos) e indicadores de políticas nacionales de salud (causas de muertes evitables con programas de salubridad pública). El Atlas denominaba a estas causas “indicadores de mortalidad evitable” con la intención de proveer señales de advertencia de fallas potenciales en la prestación de los servicios de salud. De acuerdo con Nolte & Mckee (2004), el concepto de mortalidad evitable se ha utilizado en mayor medida a finales del siglo XX, según las premisas provenientes de Rutstein (1976). Ellos introdujeron la noción de muertes evitables, proponiendo una lista de las condiciones en las que la muerte no debe ocurrir en presencia de atención médica oportuna y eficaz. Los datos de mortalidad con los cuales realizaron su estudio fueron extraídos de los archivos de mortalidad de la OMS para los años 1980—1998. Utilizaron una lista abreviada de causas de mortalidad evitable acorde con la lista de revisión de la CIE por sexo y edad. El análisis de la mortalidad evitable de Nolte & Mckee (2004) se limitó a los grandes estados miembros de la Unión Europea. Así, se observaron cambios susceptibles de mortalidad evitable en Austria, Dinamarca, Finlandia, Francia, Grecia, Alemania, Italia, los Países Bajos, Portugal, España, Suecia y Reino Unido. En términos generales, Holland et al. (2009) establecen que la mortalidad evitable es un concepto atractivo para los investigadores del campo de la salud, lo que ha conducido a un sinnúmero de publicaciones académicas a nivel internacional, pero lamentablemente son pocos los estudios de la utilización de los datos para mejorar los servicios. Argumenta que, cuando se han utilizado, se han centrado en la identificación de las fallas a nivel individual (médicos), en lugar de identificar las deficiencias del sistema, la mala ejecución de las políticas, la falta de recursos y la falta de coordinación de atención, entre otros factores. En América Latina, una de las pioneras en el análisis de mortalidad evitable fue Taucher (1978), quien argumenta que, a pesar de ser la muerte un evento inevitable, existen causas que pueden ser evitadas. Plantea que las enfermedades aceptadas como causa de muerte no tenían necesariamente un desenlace fatal y propuso clasificar las causas de defunción en evitables y no evitables, de acuerdo con el conocimiento vigente. Por consiguiente, los análisis de las causas de muerte podían utilizarse tanto para evaluar como para planificar las intervenciones, y se revelan como un recurso esencial para la gestión de políticas públicas. Taucher (1978) consideraba que la muerte es el resultado de múltiples condiciones, y proponía reagrupar las defunciones según grupos de intervenciones que más pudieran contribuir a su control. Entre las conclusiones a las que llegó Taucher (1978), se argumenta que las causas que provocan un mayor número de muertes, y que podrían evitarse con algunas medidas de fácil aplicación en el estado actual del conocimiento científico, son: los accidentes, las neumonías y las enfermedades de la primera infancia. A su vez, deja el camino abierto a la profundización del análisis de algunos factores condicionantes en el marco de las políticas de desarrollo, como lo son la mortalidad infantil y algunas de sus causas agrupadas en el rubro de “evitables por medidas mixtas”. En el caso colombiano, en la última década han surgido importantes estudios en esta materia. Entre estos resalta el trabajo investigativo propuesto por Gómez—Arias et al. (2009), quienes afianzaron su estudio hacia la elaboración de un inventario de indicadores de mortalidad evitables, para que los tomadores de decisiones puedan usar en el estudio de las fallas en el control de los riesgos de mortalidad predominantes en Colombia y en otros países con condiciones epidemiológicas y sanitarias similares. Para lograr el cometido, Gómez—Arias et al. (2009), utilizaron los registros oficiales de mortalidad de Colombia de 1985 a 2001. Una vez establecido el perfil de la mortalidad, procedieron a definir un sistema de clasificación de la mortalidad evitable, que pudiera aplicarse a las causas de muerte predominantes en el país. Para ello, en lugar de recurrir a un grupo de expertos, para construir este indicador, seleccionaron los indicadores de las listas de mortalidad evitable de Holland y Taucher, ya que ambas han logrado un buen consenso a nivel internacional. En consecuencia, para darle una mayor contextualización al indicador, dadas las condiciones epidemiológicas locales, decidieron integrar los dos enfoques propuestos mediante un algoritmo que combinó las listas. Así, cada causa de muerte ocurrida en el tiempo de estudio se clasificó como evitable o no, según el algoritmo establecido. Posteriormente, sobresalen los aportes del Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS, 2014a, 2014b), que parten del concepto de muerte evitable como aquella que, dados los conocimientos médicos y la tecnología actual, podría evitarse con servicios de salud de prevención y/o tratamiento. Por ello, proponen ampliar este concepto, sus costos y perspectivas adicionales del análisis. Para lograrlo, la institución elaboró un listado actualizado de mortalidad evitable, apoyado en las clasificaciones aceptadas internacionalmente (Taucher, 1978; Holland, 1986; Nolte & Mckee, 2004; Carvalho & Duarte, 2007 & Gómez—Arias et al., 2009). Una vez obtenida la lista de causas, realizan la estimación de las tasas de mortalidad ajustadas por edad y sexo, por toda causa y por causa de muerte evitable. Adicionalmente, agruparon los eventos con base en la clasificación de grupo de causas del Estudio de Carga Global de Enfermedad, GBD—2010 (IHME, 2010). Asimismo, estimaron los APVP para todas las causas de muerte evitable, a partir de la expectativa de vida de referencia del GBD, 2010. Para las causas de muerte evitable valoraron la pérdida económica por la pérdida de productividad. Posteriormente, Acosta & Romero (2014), en su investigación basaron el interés en conocer los cambios de las principales causas de muerte en Colombia. Considerando que las causas de muerte más destacadas están usualmente relacionadas con factores que pueden ser evitables, en la medida en que se entienda de qué se muere la población y cuáles son los grupos de edad más vulnerables. Los autores acuden a la estimación de la esperanza de vida en el caso hipotético de la eliminación de enfermedades y factores externos que causan el mayor número de muertes en el país. De igual forma calculan, para cada grupo de edad, la probabilidad de fallecer por las distintas causas de defunción seleccionadas. Acosta & Romero (2014) realizan el análisis de causas de muerte utilizando tablas de vida, las cuales brindan la facilidad de calcular la probabilidad de morir y de sobrevivencia en una edad y por una causa determinada. En sí, este estudio permite conocer los beneficios de utilizar las tablas de vida en el análisis de causas de muerte, ya que dan la oportunidad de conocer la severidad de las distintas causas, lo que no es posible inferir a partir de tasas brutas o porcentajes simples. A partir de estos primeros antecedentes, se puede denotar que el concepto de mortalidad evitable es relativamente reciente, teniendo en cuenta que los primeros estudios de mortalidad se llevaron a cabo hace mucho tiempo. Este concepto se inició teniendo en cuenta la mortalidad materna, dado que el seguimiento y el control en las mujeres embarazaras era mucho más factible. Otro aspecto para resaltar es que el estudio de la mortalidad evitable es diferente según el contexto que se esté analizando; y estas diferencias se hacen mucho más palpables cuando se comparan los estudios entre países desarrollados y en desarrollo, ya que el término de evitabilidad depende en gran medida de las condiciones socioeconómicas, tecnológicas, políticas y ambientales de cada país. 3. METODOLOGÍA: ELIMINACIÓN HIPOTÉTICA DE CAUSAS DE MUERTE EVITABLE USANDO TABLAS DE VIDAS CON MÚLTIPLES SALIDAS Para el análisis de la mortalidad en la región Caribe, se utilizaron los registros de estadísticas vitales publicados por el Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadísticas (DANE). Específicamente, el número de defunciones por sexo, grupo etario y causas agrupadas según la lista de 6/67—CIE—101 (OPS; OMS, 2008). Fue necesario conocer el listado de todas las causas que son consideradas evitables. En este sentido, se tuvo en cuenta la lista de causas de muerte evitable formulada por el INS (2014b). Esta lista tiene en cuenta la clasificación a nivel internacional y a nivel latinoamericano. Es decir, tiene en cuenta la lista de causas de muerte evitable descrita Al seleccionar las causas de muertes evitables para Colombia, se parte del supuesto que estas mismas causas podrían ser evitadas en cada una de las regiones que componen el territorio nacional. Así, se estaría dejando a un lado las diferencias geográficas, climáticas, sociales, económicas y tecnológicas internas, las cuales podrían afectar la evitabilidad de las distintas causas de muerte. La metodología que se sigue en el desarrollo de esta investigación es la descrita por Acosta & Romero (2014), quienes utilizan el proceso de eliminación hipotética de causas de muerte con tablas de vida con múltiples salidas, como herramienta para conocer los patrones de mortalidad en una población especifica. Los autores consideran que trabajar con tablas de vida representa ciertas ventajas en el análisis socioeconómico de las variables que atañen a la mortalidad en una población específica. Principalmente, porque, al evaluar el impacto de una causa de muerte sobre una población con tablas de vida, se deja a un lado el riesgo de caer en las malas interpretaciones de las tasas de mortalidad cuando no se tiene en cuenta el efecto poblacional. Otro aspecto importante es que las tablas de vida tienen la particularidad de ser estacionarias, lo que significa que el número de nacidos es igual al número de defunciones ocurridas en todas las edades. Así, los cálculos realizados a partir de ellas, no están influenciados por el tamaño de las cohortes. A su vez, permiten identificar las edades en las que es más probable morir por determinada causa, siendo este uno de los aspectos que más contribuyen con el objeto de esta investigación, ya que se pueden identificar del total de muertes, consideradas evitables, cuál es la que mayor peso tiene en la región Caribe. El proceso de eliminación hipotética de causas de muerte en distintos escenarios, descrito por Acosta & Romero (2014), parte de dos postulados esenciales. El primero se refiere a la estacionariedad de las tablas de vida, lo cual hace referencia a que el número de nacidos l(0), es igual al número de defunciones ocurridas en todas las edades, es decir: El segundo se refiere a que la tasa específica de mortalidad de una persona en una edad exacta x, o sea u(x), equivale a la suma de todas las tasas de mortalidad por todas las causas de muerte. En términos matemáticos sería: Donde: uj (x) ? 0 es la tasa de mortalidad relacionada con la causa de muerte j. Al promediar esta tasa con la población comprendida entre [x, x+n], es posible conocer la tasa central de mortalidad para una causa en específico, como se muestra en la siguiente ecuación: En la ecuación anterior, se denota que la tasa central de mortalidad total es igual a la sumatoria de cada una de las tasas de mortalidad por cada causa. En este mismo sentido, es preciso conocer que el término , es decir, el número de años vividos entre las edades x y x+n, es igual a la población estacionaria comprendida entre estas edades. Este factor, al ser multiplicado por la tasa de mortalidad central, muestra el número de muertes ocurridas a una generación entre las edades x y x+n, es decir: De la fórmula anterior es posible conocer el número de muertes por una causa en específico (ecuación a) y la proporción en el número de defunciones por determinada causa (ecuación b). De igual forma, las tablas de vidas permiten conocer la probabilidad que tiene una persona de x años de edad de fallecer por una causa de muerte en específico. Este hecho es posible, si se parte del supuesto que las causas de muerte se mantienen constantes en el tiempo, sin tener en cuenta su evolución. Esta probabilidad se puede conocer de la siguiente manera: Por otra parte, y siguiendo de igual forma a Acosta & Romero (2014), a partir de las tablas de vida se puede establecer escenarios hipotéticos donde se eliminan las tasas de mortalidad producidas por una causa en específico. Para esta investigación se eliminan las causas de muerte consideradas evitables; así se analizaría el impacto que tiene cada una de ellas en la tasa de mortalidad general, en el número de sobrevivientes y, mejor aún, en la esperanza de vida. Para poder realizar estas estimaciones es preciso definir una nueva función de mortalidad. Esta estaría expresada de la siguiente manera: uj*(x) por ende, la suma de todas las tasas de mortalidad va a cambiar, dado que se le está restando la participación de la j causa de mortalidad. Este proceso queda reflejado de la siguiente manera: Así las cosas, la nueva tasa de mortalidad (sin incluir la participación de muertes ocasionadas por la causa de muerte que se elimina), es determinada por el producto entre la tasa general de mortalidad y un factor Rj(x); dicho factor expresa la proporción de muertes que no están relacionadas con la causa de muerte que no se quiere eliminar. Este factor está presente para todas las funciones de la nueva tabla de vida a calcular y varía dependiendo la edad que se esté analizando, como se muestra a continuación: Dónde: nDx: es el total de defunciones por cada grupo de edad. nDx*j : es la suma de todas las defunciones, excepto las muertes por las causas que se quiere eliminar, por grupos de edad. Una vez calculado el valor del factor, se puede conocer los cambios en las probabilidades de supervivencia, al eliminar una causa de muerte, en este caso las causas evitables. El proceso se explica de la siguiente manera: Donde: npx : es la probabilidad de supervivencia por edad, teniendo en cuenta todas las causas de muerte. npx*j : es la probabilidad de supervivencia por edad, habiendo eliminado una causa de muerte. Ahora bien, dado que la tasa de mortalidad total disminuye al eliminar las muertes por la causa que se quiere eliminar, el número de sobrevivientes a la edad exacta x aumentará, es decir: De igual forma, al disminuir la tasa de mortalidad, la esperanza de vida tenderá a aumentar. Para poder conocer los cambios que experimenta la esperanza de vida, es necesario acudir al principio que dice que la participación de un individuo en la esperanza de vida es el tiempo que transcurre entre el momento en el que se alcanza la edad x años de vida y el momento en el que muere. Por ello, la manera de conocer la “nueva esperanza de vida” está dada por la siguiente ecuación: Este aporte de Acosta & Romero (2014), junto con las premisas de mortalidad hipotética nula realizadas por Arriaga (1996) y los aportes de Bocco (1996), permite conocer el impacto de la mortalidad por causa de muerte específica sobre la esperanza de vida de la población entre dos edades seleccionadas para el análisis. Por ejemplo, si se quiere estudiar la mortalidad en edades reproductivas, en edades laborales, o en edades muy avanzadas. En este caso se analizarán los cambios en la mortalidad y el impacto que tienen sobre la población las causas de muerte consideradas evitables. 4. IMPACTO DE LAS CAUSAS DE MUERTE EVITABLE EN LOS PATRONES DE MORTALIDAD DE LOS HABITANTES DE LA REGIÓN CARIBE En la región Caribe durante el periodo en estudio se observa una importante incidencia de muertes evitables. Las causas de muerte evitable relacionadas con las causas extremas, las enfermedades del sistema circulatorio y las enfermedades del sistema respiratorio, entre otras, son las más sobresalientes. Por ello, se valora el impacto que tendría la eliminación (evitar) de las muertes que se dieron a causas de estas enfermedades en los patrones de mortalidad de los habitantes de la región, a saber: la probabilidad de morir, la probabilidad de sobrevivencia, y la esperanza de vida por grupos etarios y por género. Del total de causas de muertes evitables descritas por el INS (2014b), el 56,7% corresponden a causas extremas; el 8,9% a enfermedades infecciosas y parasitarias; un 8,4% a embarazo, parto y puerperio; y un 6,6% a causas de muerte relacionadas con afecciones en el periodo neonatal, siendo estos cuatro grupos los que abarcan el 80,6% del total de causas evitables descritas por la institución. También es de resaltar la baja participación de las enfermedades de la piel, trastornos mentales, las enfermedades del sistema nervioso, las enfermedades del sistema genitourinario y las malformaciones. A pesar que el grupo de causas de muerte extremas contiene gran parte de las casusas de muerte evitable, en la práctica suele ser diferente, y mucho más en la región Caribe. Las causas relacionadas con el sistema circulatorio han sido las de mayor prevalencia en los últimos quince años; seguidas de las causas extremas, las enfermedades del sistema respiratorio, los cánceres, las enfermedades endocrinas y nutricionales, y las enfermedades infecciosas y parasitarias. Estos grupos de enfermedades presentan una participación muy marcada, sin embargo, la prevalencia de las causas de muerte que conforman cada grupo ha variado. En el caso de las causas evitables relacionadas con el sistema circulatorio, de 1999 a 2008 (primer y segundo quinquenio de estudio) las enfermedades isquémicas del corazón y accidentes cerebrovasculares fueron las de mayor participación; sin embargo, de 2009 a 2014 (último quinquenio del periodo de estudio) se mantienen las enfermedades isquémicas del corazón, pero aumentan las muertes a causa de las hemorragias y la cardiopatía hipertensiva. Para el caso de las causas de muerte evitable extremas, durante los dos primeros quinquenios, los homicidios y los accidentes de tránsito en carretera abarcan el 60% de las muertes de este grupo; no obstante, para el último quinquenio las muertes a causa de los accidentes en motocicletas aumentaron considerablemente; es decir que en los últimos cinco años las dos principales causas de muerte evitable extremas en la región Caribe son los homicidios, accidentes en motocicleta y los accidentes automovilísticos. En el caso de las causas evitables relacionadas con el sistema respiratorio, las enfermedades respiratorias bajas y las enfermedades pulmonares crónicas han sido las dos principales causas de muerte evitable en los dos primeros quinquenios; y para el último quinquenio las enfermedades crónicas del pulmón han tomado mayor participación. Por el lado de los cánceres, se encontró que el grupo considerado evitable ha tendido a disminuir, pero las enfermedades que lo conforman han tenido una distribución casi que constante. En 1999, el 60% de los cánceres considerados evitables fueron: cáncer de tráquea, bronquios y pulmón (22,9%); seguido del cáncer de cuello uterino (13,4%); cáncer de colon y recto (12%) y por último el cáncer de mama (11,5%). Para el año 2008, la distribución cambia un poco: el cáncer de tráquea, bronquios y pulmón sigue en primer lugar (26,8%), pero el cáncer de mama gana participación (14%), el cáncer de cuello uterino se mantiene (13%), y el cáncer de colon disminuye (10,2%). Para el año 2014, la participación en las muertes, a causa de cáncer de tráquea, bronquio y pulmón, tienden a disminuir (24,5%); sin embargo, se resalta el aumento significativo del cáncer de mama, el cual pasó a 18,7%, el cáncer de colon y recto disminuyó (11,8%), al igual que las muertes a causa del cáncer de cuello uterino (11,4%). Con respecto a las enfermedades endocrinas y nutricionales, se tiene que las principales causas evitables durante el periodo de análisis han sido: en primer lugar, la diabetes (57%), seguida de la desnutrición (30,2%) y enfermedades crónicas del riñón a causa de la diabetes (12,8%). En el grupo de enfermedades infecciosas y parasitarias, se resalta que en 1999 las principales causas evitables eran las enfermedades diarreicas (36,3%), seguidas de las enfermedades relacionadas con el VIH (26,1%), y la tuberculosis (21,7%). En 2014, las enfermedades diarreicas abarcaron el 38,4%, las enfermedades relacionadas con VIH pasaron al 30%, y la tuberculosis fue de 12,9%. 4.1. Eliminación hipotética de causas de muerte evitable Un primer ejercicio consistió en calcular las diferencias en la probabilidad de morir, eliminando los distintos grupos de causas de muerte evitable. En la figura 1, se muestran tres paneles, los cuales corresponden a los tres quinquenios de estudio (1999—2003; 2004—2008; 2009—2014). Los resultados muestran que, manteniendo constantes las condiciones de mortalidad observadas durante el primer quinquenio (panel a), la probabilidad de morir en los hombres de la región no varía significativamente al eliminar las causas de muerte relacionadas con enfermedades del sistema digestivo, las infecciones—parasitarias y los cánceres. La eliminación de las causas relacionadas con las afecciones en el periodo neonatal disminuye la probabilidad de morir considerablemente en los niños menores de 5 años. Las diferencias más significativas se observan al momento de eliminar las causas extremas, las del sistema circulatorio y las del sistema respiratorio. Con la eliminación de las causas extremas, disminuye considerablemente, y en mayor proporción en las edades de 5 a 55 años. En el caso de la eliminación de las causas del sistema circulatorio, las diferencias se ven reflejadas en mayor medida en las edades de 50 a 75 años, al igual que el caso de haberse evitado las causas del sistema respiratorio. En el segundo y tercer periodos de análisis, la situación es un poco distinta (panel c). Las probabilidades son más bajas en comparación con el periodo anterior. Las variaciones se observan, en mayor medida, en el último quinquenio de estudio (panel e), donde la eliminación de las principales causas de muerte representa un mayor peso en el total de defunciones; por tanto, las probabilidades disminuyen al momento que se eliminan tales causas, mucho más cuando se eliminan las causas de muerte extremas y las relacionadas con el sistema circulatorio. La mayor diferencia entre el primer y último quinquenio está en que en el último, con la eliminación de las causas de muerte relacionadas con el sistema circulatorio, las probabilidades disminuyan desde edades superiores a los 10 años, mas no a partir de los 55 años, como se daba al principio. Para el caso de las mujeres, los escenarios son distintos. Las funciones de probabilidad de morir en las mujeres tienen una curva mucho más definida (forma de jota), y menores en comparación con la de los hombres. En el primer quinquenio (panel b), la eliminación de las causas de muerte relacionadas con el sistema circulatorio son las más significativas a partir de edades superiores a los 50 años. Para el segundo quinquenio (panel d), la situación cambió un poco. En adición a las enfermedades del sistema circulatorio, la eliminación de las causas extremas tiende a disminuir la probabilidad de muerte, y en especial en las mujeres de edades inferiores, de 5 a 45 años. En los últimos cinco años (panel f), el panorama se ve mucho más distinto. Al eliminar las principales causas de muerte evitable, el riesgo de muerte para las mujeres disminuye de modo considerable, principalmente al eliminar las causas extremas y las del sistema circulatorio. Un segundo ejercicio consistió en evidenciar el impacto que tienen las distintas causas de muerte evitable sobre la probabilidad de sobrevivencia de los individuos de la región. En la figura 2, en los paneles a, c, e, se observan las probabilidades de sobrevivir en hombres. En el primer quinquenio, la eliminación de la mayoría de las causas no impacta significativamente las probabilidades de sobrevivir, sin embargo, la eliminación de las causas extremas lo hacen, principalmente en los hombres con edades de 15 a 55 años. Por su parte, la eliminación de las causas de muerte relacionadas con el sistema circulatorio también muestra cambios significativos en los hombres con edad superior a los 55 años, al igual que las muertes a causa de enfermedades del sistema respiratorio. En el segundo quinquenio, el panorama es muy parecido, pero, al eliminar las causas extremas, la probabilidad de supervivencia empieza a aumentar desde edades más tempranas, es decir, empieza desde los 5 a los 55 años. Este mismo comportamiento se evidencia al eliminar las enfermedades del sistema circulatorio, en las cuales las diferencias se notan desde la edad de los 40 años. Para el último periodo, las diferencias son mucho más marcadas. Al eliminar las causas extremas, las probabilidades de supervivencia aumentan desde edades muy tempranas, y la brecha aumenta mucho más en las edades productivas, 15 a 65 años. En el caso de eliminar las causas de muerte relacionadas con el sistema circulatorio, la probabilidad de supervivencia en los hombres mayores a 50 años se hace mayor. Para el caso de las mujeres, los resultados muestran que las probabilidades de supervivencia son mayores a las de los hombres. Si se analizan los paneles b, d y f, se observa que las probabilidades son mayores durante casi todo el ciclo de la vida, y tienden a ser parecidas después de los 65 años. Este comportamiento podría explicarse porque los hombres están expuestos en mayor medida a causas extremas de mortalidad, principalmente en edades de 15 a 60 años. De 1999 a 2003, las principales causas de muerte que impactan la probabilidad de sobrevivencia en las mujeres fueron las relacionadas con el sistema circulatorio y las respiratorias. 4.2. Impacto de las causas de muerte evitable en la esperanza de vida Un tercer ejercicio consistió en calcular la probabilidad de morir que tienen los habitantes de la región durante el resto de años que les queda por vivir. El ejercicio se realizó teniendo en cuenta los distintos grupos de causas de muerte evitable y grupos de edad, bajo el supuesto de que las condiciones de mortalidad observadas en la región se mantienen constantes en el tiempo. También se parte del supuesto que, al analizar el impacto de una causa en específico, el efecto de las otras es nulo, es decir, son mutuamente excluyentes e independientes. Los resultados observados en la tabla 2 describen que los niños menores de 5 años, independientemente del género, tienen mayor probabilidad de morir a causa de enfermedades infecciosas y parasitarias, aunque en el último quinquenio la probabilidad de que mueran a causa de enfermedades del sistema respiratorio ha aumentado. A pesar de que las defunciones por causas extremas han disminuido, continúan siendo la principal causa de muerte en los hombres de la región. En 1999, la probabilidad que tenía un hombre con 25 años de morir por una causa extrema en el resto de su vida fue de 41%, mientras que en 2014 la probabilidad pasó a 34,3%. En el caso de los hombres con 45 años, la situación es muy parecida, sin embargo, están altamente expuestos a morir por una enfermedad del sistema circulatorio. Para los hombres con edades superiores a 65 años, las causas extremas representan bajo riesgo; por tanto, la mayor probabilidad de morir en lo que les resta de vida es a causa de enfermedades del sistema circulatorio, los cánceres y las enfermedades del sistema respiratorio. En el caso de las mujeres, las diferencias con respecto a los hombres son más significativas cuando están en edad de 25 años, dado que el riego de morir por una causa extrema es bajo, pero es alta la probabilidad de morir a causa de un cáncer, de un embarazo, por un parto riesgoso o una enfermedad del sistema circulatorio. En el caso de las mujeres con 45 años, tienen mayor probabilidad de morir a causa de cáncer, principalmente el cáncer de mama y el de cuello uterino. También están altamente expuestas a morir a causa de enfermedades del sistema circulatorio, e incluso en mayor medida que las mujeres de 25 años. En el caso de las mujeres con 65 años y más, la prevalencia de los cánceres y las enfermedades del sistema circulatorio se mantienen, si bien ha aumentado la probabilidad de morir a causa de problemas en el sistema respiratorio. Analizar el impacto que tiene los distintos grupos de causas de muerte evitable sobre las probabilidades de mortalidad y, por ende, de sobrevivencia, conlleva directamente al análisis de los cambios en la esperanza de vida de los habitantes de la región. Este indicador, como se mencionó antes, es uno de los más importantes al momento de planificar y evaluar políticas públicas en salud, ya que en ella se ve reflejada la eficiencia de dichas políticas. Por ello, un cuarto ejercicio consistió en realizar ensayos en los que, al eliminar las causas de muerte consideradas evitables, se evidenciaran los cambios que producían en la esperanza de vida por cada grupo de edad. En la tabla 3, los resultados muestran que, si en el periodo de 1999 a 2003 se hubiesen controlado o evitado las muertes a causa de algunas enfermedades del sistema circulatorio, los hombres hubiesen ganado 9,7 años más de vida, mientras que las mujeres hubiesen ganado 14 años, aproximadamente. En el caso de que se hubiesen evitado las muertes por causas extremas, los “beneficiados” en este caso solo serían los hombres, con 4,2 años adicionales, mientras que en las mujeres solo se hubiese prolongando la vida en 0,8 años. Para el quinquenio de 2004 a 2008, la distribución se mantiene, sin embargo, se resalta el aumento de los años ganados a causa de las muertes evitables relacionadas con el sistema respiratorio, tanto en hombres como en mujeres. Para el quinquenio de 2009 a 2014, la situación es un poco distinta. A pesar de que la esperanza de vida aumentó tanto en hombres como en mujeres, las enfermedades consideradas evitables han tendido a disminuir, por tanto, los años de vida ganados por dichas causas también lo han hecho. De 2009 a 2014, los años de vida ganados, con la eliminación de las causas evitables del sistema circulatorio, pasaron a 7,8 años en los hombres, y en las mujeres fue de 9,6 años. Es decir que, en los hombres, en estos quince años, los años de vida ganados disminuyeron en 20,1%, y en las mujeres 31,8%. Estos resultados indican que en la región Caribe, a medida que transcurre el tiempo, están disminuyendo las enfermedades consideradas evitables, dando paso a enfermedades no evitables, dado el alcance de la tecnología y la infraestructura médica. Un ejemplo de esta premisa se constata al observar los años de vida ganados a causa de las enfermedades infecciosas y parasitarias. También se observa la disminución en los años de vida ganados a causa de cánceres considerados evitables, a pesar de que este grupo de enfermedades han aumentado en la región. 5. DISCUSIÓN/CONCLUSIONES Con la finalización de este estudio, que condujo al presente artículo, se pudo determinar que entre el 80% y 90% de las defunciones ocurridas en el grupo de edad menor a 5 años podrían ser evitadas. Las muertes a causa de afecciones en el periodo neonatal son las de mayor impacto en esta población, es decir, la brecha entre la prevalencia de este grupo con el resto es muy marcada, aproximadamente seis veces mayor. Asimismo, se resalta la distribución constante que han tenido las causas de muerte evitable en este grupo poblacional. Para el caso de la población vulnerable, es decir aquella mayor a 65 años, el grupo de causas evitables relacionadas con el sistema circulatorio, como lo son las enfermedades isquémicas del corazón, los accidentes cerebrovasculares y la cardiopatía hipertensiva, son las de mayor prevalencia en estos quince años de estudio. Sin embargo, con menor proporción en los últimos años. En 1999, la participación de estas enfermedades en este grupo poblacional fue de 58,7%, y en 2014 pasó a 51,3%. Por otra parte, es de resaltar el aumento de las defunciones a causa de enfermedades del sistema digestivo, las cuales, en 1999, abarcaban el 2,9% y en 2014 pasaron al 4,1%. De igual forma, en este grupo poblacional, las defunciones a causa de cánceres evitables y las enfermedades del sistema genitourinario evitables han disminuido. En el grupo poblacional de 15 a 64 años, se realizó el análisis por género. Para el caso de los hombres, la mayor tasa de defunción evitable se debe a las causas extremas. Sin embargo, a partir de 2008, ha presentado un ritmo decreciente, ubicándose en 2014 con los niveles más bajos en este periodo de estudio. Por su parte, se evidenció aumento en las causas relacionadas con las enfermedades del sistema circulatorio; en 1999, la participación de estas enfermedades fue del 17%, y para 2014 la proporción pasó a 23,4%, lo que significa que estas enfermedades están aumentando en hombres. Para el caso de las mujeres, se resalta el aumento significativo de los cánceres evitables. En 1999, la participación fue de 20%, aproximadamente, mientras que en 2014 pasó a 27%, lo que evidencia el aumento de la mortalidad a causa de cánceres que pueden ser evitados. Esta característica diferencia, en gran parte, los patrones de mortalidad evitable de las mujeres con los hombres; mientras que en las mujeres aumentan las causas de muerte por cánceres evitables, en los hombres disminuye. Asimismo, mientras que en las mujeres disminuyen las causas de muerte evitable relacionadas con el sistema circulatorio, en los hombres sucede lo contrario. Ahora bien, si en el periodo de 1999 a 2014 se hubiesen controlado o evitado las muertes por causas extremas o algunas enfermedades del sistema circulatorio, las probabilidades de morir en un hombre disminuirían en 37,2% y 15,8%, respectivamente. En las mujeres, estas probabilidades disminuirían en 19,7% y 10,4% si se controlarán las muertes a causa de las enfermedades del sistema circulatorio y respiratorio. De manera análoga, las probabilidades de sobrevivencia de un hombre, en promedio, aumentarían en un 14% y 6,1% si se controlaran las causas extremas de mortalidad y las causas de muerte relacionadas con el sistema circulatorio. En las mujeres, las probabilidades de sobrevivencia aumentarían en 8,7%, 6,2% y 5,2%, si se postergaran las causas de muerte relacionadas con enfermedades del sistema circulatorio, las enfermedades del sistema respiratorio, y los cánceres evitables (principalmente el cáncer de mama y cuello uterino). En concreto, los cambios en los patrones de mortalidad experimentados en la población de la región Caribe a causa de la mortalidad evitable, se traducen en cambios significativos en la esperanza de vida. Por ello, si en estos quince años de estudio se hubiesen evitado o postergado las muertes a causa de enfermedades del sistema circulatorio, los hombres hubiesen ganado, en promedio, 7,8 años más de vida, mientras que las mujeres hubiesen ganado 10 años, aproximadamente. En el caso de que se hubiesen evitado las muertes por causas extremas, los “beneficiados” en este caso solo serían los hombres, con 5 años adicionales. 6. LIMITACIONES Los aspectos que más limitaron el desarrollo de esta investigación fueron principalmente dos. Inicialmente, no se cuenta con una lista de causas de muerte evitable actualizada para la región Caribe, por tanto, al utilizar la lista establecida por el INS (2014b), se está dejando a un lado las diferencias geográficas, climáticas, sociales, económicas y tecnológicas internas del país, las cuales podrían afectar la evitabilidad de las distintas causas de muerte. Un segundo aspecto limitante tiene que ver con la metodología. Específicamente el supuesto de permanencia en las causas de muerte en el transcurso del tiempo, ya que las causas de muerte varían considerablemente con el desarrollo económico, social y tecnológico de un país o región.

J18|How Do Firms Respond To Place-Based Tax Incentives?|In this paper, we evaluate the effects of payroll tax changes on firm behavior, by exploiting a unique policy setting in Norway, where a system of geographically differentiated payroll taxes was suddenly abolished due to an EU regulation. We find that firms are only partially able to shift the increased costs from higher payroll tax rates onto workers’ wages. Instead, firms respond to the tax increase primarily by reducing employment. The drop in employment following the tax reform is particularly pronounced in labor intensive firms—which experience a larger windfall loss due to the tax reform than non-labor intensive firms—and in multi-establishment firms—which respond to the payroll tax increase in part by reducing the number of establishments per firm. Overall, our findings point to liquidity effects whereby a sudden and largely unexpected payroll tax increase aggravates firms’ liquidity constraints, forcing them to cut employment to bring down costs.
J18|The Gender Gap in Wage Expectations: Do Young Women Trade off Higher Wages for Lower Wage Risk?|Several studies show that young women start with lower wage expectations than men, even before entering the labor market and that this partly translates into the actual gender wage gap through effects on educational choice and the formation of reservation wages. Building on the theoretical reasoning of compensating differentials proposing that the labor market compensates higher wage risk with higher wages, this study investigates whether the gender gap in wage expectations can be explained by individuals anticipating this form of risk compensation. Relying on a unique survey on German high school graduates in which we elicited information on the entire distribution of expected wages, this study documents that already at this early stage, female students expect to earn around 16% less than their male counterparts. At the same time, they expect lower wage risk as measured by the individual-specific dispersion in wage expectations. I decompose the gender gap into components attributable to socio-demographic factors, academic performance and skills, intended college major choice, career motives, personality traits, economic preferences, measures for students’ confidence and expected wage risk. The results indicate that anticipated compensation for wage risk plays a major role in explaining the gender gap in wage expectations suggesting that females have lower wage expectations because they are willing to trade off higher wages for lower wage risk. The results of this study shed light on why young women make different choices regarding education and careers, thereby enhancing our understanding of the observed gender wage gap.
J18|Can Wealth Explain Neighborhood Sorting by Race and Income?|Why do high-income blacks live in neighborhoods with characteristics similar to those of low-income whites? One plausible explanation is wealth, since homeownership requires some wealth, and black households hold less wealth than white households at all levels of income. We present evidence against this hypothesis by showing that wealth does not predict sorting into neighborhood quality once race and income are taken into account. An alternative explanation is that the scarcity of high-quality black neighborhoods increases the cost of living in a high-quality neighborhood for black households with even weak race preferences. We present evidence in favor of this hypothesis by showing that sorting into neighborhood racial composition is similar across wealth levels conditional on race and income.
J18|Working time regulation, unequal lifetimes and fairness|Abstract We examine the redistributive impact of working time regulations in an economy with unequal lifetimes. We first compare the laissez-faire equilibrium with the ex post egalitarian optimum, where the realized lifetime well-being of the worst off (usually the short-lived) is maximized, and show that, unlike the laissez-faire, this social optimum involves an increasing working time age profile and equalizes the realized lifetime well-being of the short-lived and the long-lived. We then examine whether working time regulations can compensate the short-lived. It is shown that uniform working time regulations cannot improve the situation of the short-lived with respect to the laissez-faire, and can only reduce well-being inequalities at the cost of making the short-lived worse off. However, age-specific regulations involving lower working time for the young and higher working time for the old make the short-lived better off, even though such regulations may not fully eradicate well-being inequalities.
J18|The persistent labor market effects of a criminal conviction and ï¿½Ban the Boxï¿½ reforms|"Past literature has established that individuals who have been incarcerated face difculties reentering the work force following their release, while finding and keeping a job can significantly reduce recidivism amongst individuals with prior criminal convictions. In attempt to improve employment outcomes, many local and state governments in the United States have initiated ""Ban the Box"" regulations. These initiatives delay inquiries regarding criminal history on job applications. Versions of ban the box regulations covering public sector employment have been enacted in 31 states and more than 150 local governments. Ban the box laws have included private employers in eleven states and over 30 metropolitan areas including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Seattle. This study uses biennial data from November CPS reports from 2004 through 2016 to estimate the impact of ban the box laws on labor market outcomes using a unique proxy to identify individuals with a criminal record. With a few exceptions, the results do not show the intended improvements in employment and other labor market measures for those with a criminal history."
J18|The Impact of Paid Maternity Leave on Maternal Health|We examine the impact of the introduction of paid maternity leave in Norway in 1977 on maternal health. Before the policy reform, mothers were eligible for 12 weeks of unpaid leave. Mothers giving birth after July 1, 1977 were entitled to 4 months of paid leave and 12 months of unpaid leave. We combine Norwegian administrative data with survey data on the health of women around age 40 and estimate the mediumand long-term impacts of the reform using regression discontinuity and difference-inregression discontinuity designs. Our results suggest paid maternity leave benefits are protective of maternal health. The reform improved a range of maternal health outcomes, including BMI, blood pressure, pain, and mental health, and it increased health-promoting behaviors, such as exercise and not smoking. The effects were larger for first-time and low-resource mothers and women who would have taken little unpaid leave in the absence of the reform. We also study the maternal health effects of subsequent expansions in paid maternity leave and find evidence of diminishing returns to leave length.
J18|Paternity Leave and Family Outcomes|The received literature documents that reserving parental leave time for fathers has been effective in increasing fathers’ use of parental leave. However, whether paternity leave affects the families’ decisions in any other way is still not clear. This paper exploits reforms extending the Norwegian father quota as natural experiments, and estimates causal effects of a more substantial length of paternity leave than previously studied. We find that fathers extend their leave use as more leave days are reserved for them. Yet, there is no evidence that extended parental leave use by fathers alters the traditional gender norms at home. Specifically, we find no effects on parents’ earnings or working hours, which suggests no shift from market work to home production by fathers, nor a shift in the other direction by mothers. To measure parents’ involvement at home, we look at absence from work due to own illness, as well as a child’s illness. These measures are both unaffected by extended leave use by fathers. Moreover, there is no evidence that extended parental leave use by fathers contributes to narrowing the gender gap in income. However, extending the father-exclusive leave period comes at a non-negligible cost to the society. Taken together, this points to the conclusion that continuing expansions of the father quota needs to be justified by arguments other than the commonly used claim, that the father quota works as a policy instrument for gender equality.
J18|Promoting Academic Engagement: University context and individual characteristics|This paper aims to explore the impact of organizational context on individuals’ industry activities in Chinese universities. Academic engagement, which includes collaborative research, contract research, consulting and other informal outreach activities, is posited as being jointly determined by organizational and individual level factors. Based on 564 Chinese scientists’ survey responses, our results show that scientists perceiving their university as having a strong entrepreneurial mission or supportive policy context are more active in academic engagement. This relationship is, however, moderated by individual-level factors. Specifically, entrepreneurially oriented university mission and supportive policy are more strongly associated with intra-individual differences in academic engagement for junior scientists, and for scientists with established personal networks to industry. Our analysis also shows that several individual-level predictors of academic engagement identified in studies set in Europe and the US carry over to the Chinese context.
J18|The Involvement Of Russian Households In Intergenerational Transfers 2008-14|This paper investigates how households of various demographic compositions are involved in private intergenerational transfers in Russia. The authors provide a descriptive analysis of private exchanges using household surveys. The Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey—Higher School of Economics (RLMS-HSE, 2004, 2008, 2013), The Comprehensive Monitoring of Living Conditions (KOUG, Rosstat), The Survey of the Population Income and the Participation in Social Programs (VNDN, Rosstat). The study demonstrates that the demographic composition of households is an important predictor of household involvement in private exchanges of different goods and services. Single-person households and households represented by couples without children show their particular donor capacity in private intergenerational transfers. The recipients of private material transfers are primarily one-parent families and couples with under-age children. Multigenerational households and other households are also recipients of private material transfers. This paper demonstrates that the role of a household’s private exchange is related to their financial situation, but the role of private intergenerational transfers is not limited to giving assistance to the poor
J18|Divorced in a Flash: The Effect of the Administrative Divorce Option on Marital Stability in the Netherlands|Administrative divorce is an optional divorce procedure which allows couples to bypass the court system and dissolve their marriages in a streamlined, uncontested process. The lack of court involvement renders the administrative divorce faster and less expensive than the conventional divorce. In this paper, I investigate whether the administrative divorce option affected the stability of marriages in the Netherlands. Leveraging the ban of the procedure in 2009, I show that the divorce risks were 11.6% higher under the legal regime which allowed for administrative divorce. This effect is causal, and it exhibits considerable heterogeneity, being stronger among dual-earner couples, native couples, and couples living in rural regions.
J18|Are Apprenticeships Business Cycle Proof?|Although there is evidence that apprenticeship training can ease the transition of youth into the labour market and thereby reduce youth unemployment, many policy makers fear that firms will cut their apprenticeship expenditures during economic crises, thus exacerbating the problem of youth unemployment. Using recent panel data of Swiss cantons and dynamic regression models, we examine the relationship between new apprenticeships and the business cycle. The empirical results suggest that economic shocks induce a rather small, pro-cyclical immediate response in the apprenticeship market. However, within a year after the shock, firms compensate for their immediate reaction, with the result that no permanent effect is observable.
J18|Free Daycare and Its Effects on Children and Their Families|Many governments invest substantial public funds to foster early childhood education. And yet, there are still many open questions who responds to and who benefits from public investments into early childcare. We use the introduction of free public daycare in German states to analyze its effects on children and their families. Our results suggest that effects of the policy differ by child age, gender and socio-economic status. Free daycare increases attendance among 2-3 year olds with little response among older children. Yet, even with access to free daycare, we find few effects on maternal labor supply. Responses are generally stronger for poorer households and other vulnerable families. Child development, in turn, shows gender-specific effects that are in part explained by the differential choices parents of boys make compared to parents of girls.
J18|Distributional Effects of Welfare Reform for Young Adults: An Unconditional Quantile Regression Approach|The paper evaluates the distributional effects on earnings and income of requiring young welfare recipients to fulfill conditions related to work and activation. It exploits within-social insurance office variation in policy arising from a geographically staggered reform in Norway. The reform reduced welfare uptake and for women had large, positive effects in the lower part of the earnings distribution. The effect on the distribution of total income is also positive, thus gains in earnings more than offset reduced welfare benefits. Fewer welfare payments and smaller caseloads make the policy highly cost-effective.

J18|The Impacts of Paid Family Leave Benefits: Regression Kink Evidence from California Administrative Data|We use ten years of California administrative data with a regression kink design to estimate the causal impacts of benefits in the first state-level paid family leave program for women with earnings near the maximum benefit threshold. We find no evidence that a higher weekly benefit amount (WBA) increases leave duration or leads to adverse future labor market outcomes for this group. In contrast, we document that a rise in the WBA leads to an increased likelihood of returning to the pre-leave firm (conditional on any employment) and of making a subsequent paid family leave claim.
J18|Duration of Parental Leave and Women's Employment|The impact of the duration of parental leave on women's employment in Korea is examined by focusing on the heterogeneous effects. The results of the extension of the maximum job-protected leave from 12 months to 15 months are as follows. First, the policy change led to more female employees taking leave more often and for longer periods. The impact of leave take-up on high wage earners is found to be smaller than that on their low wage counterparts, but that on duration is larger; this points to a fixed cost in switching between own and paid child care. Further, those in large firms tend to benefit more than those in small- or medium-sized firms. Second, the extension encouraged women to return to work 2–3 years after childbirth, but this effect diminished after 4 years. The findings suggest that the distributional effect should be considered in designing leave policy.
J18|Live Longer, Work Longer: The Changing Nature of the Labour Market for Older Workers in OECD Countries|Population ageing poses stark dilemmas for labour markets, social protection systems and cultural norms. It will put strong downward pressure on labour supply, leading to falling real incomes and huge financial pressures on social protection systems unless there is an offsetting increase in employment rates. This is especially true for older workers whose employment rates are well below those of prime-age adults. In this paper, I examine how the labour market for older workers has evolved in OECD countries since 1990, what are the main forces at work, what are the main obstacles to working longer and how might public policies help overcome them. I also speculate about the future for older workers faced with the challenges and opportunities posed by the gig economy.
J18|Pension Policies in a Model with Endogenous Fertility|We set up an overlapping generations model with endogenous fertility to study pensions policies in an ageing economy. We show that an increasing life expectancy may not be detrimental for the economy or the pension system itself. On the other hand, conventional policy measures, such as increasing the retirement age or changing the social security contribution rate could have undesired general equilibrium effects. In particular, both policies decrease capital per worker and might have negative effects on the fertility rate, thus exacerbating population ageing.
J18|Local Labour Market Conditions on Immigrants' Arrival and Children's School Performance|In this paper we analyse the impact of labour market conditions at immigration on school performance for the immigrants' children. First, we establish the direct effect of initial labour market conditions on later labour market performance for the father. Along with several other studies in this field we find that later labour market performance of the father (measured by labour earnings and accumulated work experience) depend significantly initial labour market conditions. Second, we find evidence that this initial effect feeds into the children's school performance. Concretely, for the sons, we find a positive impact of initial favourable labour market conditions of the father on the grade point average in lower secondary school. Daughters' school performance seems to be unrelated to the same initial labour market conditions.
J18|Paid parental leave and families’ living arrangements|We examine how a paid parental leave reform causally affected families’ living arrangements. The German reform we examine replaced a means-tested benefit with a universal transfer paid out for a shorter period. Combining a regression discontinuity with a difference-in-differences design, we find that the reform increased the probability that a newborn lives with non-married cohabiting parents. This effect results from a reduced risk of single parenthood among women who gained from the reform. We reject the economic independence hypothesis and argue that the reform effects for those who benefited from the reform are consistent with hypotheses related to the improved financial situation of new mothers after the reform and increased paternal involvement in childcare.
J18|Labor Market and Distributional Effects of an Increase in the Retirement Age|We evaluate the labor market and distributional effects of an increase in the early retirement age (ERA) from 60 to 63 for women. We use a regression discontinuity design which exploits the immediate increase in the ERA between women born in 1951 and 1952. The analysis is based on the German micro census which includes about 370,000 households per year. We focus on heterogeneous labor market effects on the individual and on the household level and we study the distributional implications using net household income. In this respect we extend the previous literature which mainly studied employment effects on the individual level. Our results show sizable labor market effects which strongly differ by subgroups. We document larger employment effects for women who cannot rely on other income on the household level, e.g. women with a low income partner. The distributional analysis shows on average no significant effects on female or household income. This result holds as well for heterogeneous groups: Even for the most vulnerable groups, such as single women, women without higher education, or low partner income, we do not find significant reductions in income. One reason for this result is program substitution.
J18|Too little or too much? Actionable Advice in an Early-Childhood Text Messaging Experiment|Text-message based parenting programs have proven successful in improving parental engagement and preschoolers’ literacy development. The tested programs have provided a combination of (a) general information about important literacy skills, (b) actionable advice (i.e., specific examples of such activities), and (c) encouragement. The regularity of the texts – each week throughout the school year – also provided nudges to focus parents’ attention on their children. This study seeks to identify mechanisms of the overall effect of such programs. It investigates whether the actionable advice alone drives previous study’s results and whether additional texts of actionable advice improve program effectiveness. The findings provide evidence that text messaging programs can supply too little or too much information. A single text per week is not as effective at improving parenting practices as a set of three texts that also include information and encouragement, but a set of five texts with additional actionable advice is also not as effective as the three-text approach. The results on children’s literacy development depend strongly on the child’s pre-intervention literacy skills. For children in the lowest quarter of the pre-treatment literacy assessments, only providing one example of an activity decreases literacy scores by 0.15 standard deviations relative to the original intervention. Literacy scores of children in higher quarters are marginally higher with only one tip per week. We find no positive effects of increasing to five texts per week.
J18|Welfare Activation and Youth Crime|We evaluate the impact on youth crime of a welfare reform that tightened activation requirements for social assistance clients. The evaluation strategy exploits administrative individual data in combination with geographically differentiated implementation of the reform. We find that the reform reduced crime among teenage boys from economically disadvantaged families. Stronger reform effects on weekday versus weekend crime, reduced school dropout, and favorable long-run outcomes in terms of crime and educational attainment point to both incapacitation and human capital accumulation as key mechanisms. Despite lowered social assistance take-up, we uncover no indication that loss of income support pushed youth into crime.
J18|The growing American health penalty: International trends in the employment of older workers with poor health|Many countries have reduced the generosity of disability benefits while making them more activating - yet few studies have examined how employment rates have subsequently changed. We present estimates of how the employment rates of older workers with poor health in 13 high-income countries changed between 2004-7 and 2012-15 using HRS/SHARE/ELSA data. We find that those in poor health in the USA have experienced a unique deterioration: they have not only seen a widening gap to the employment rates of those with good health, but their employment rates fell per se. We find only for Sweden (and possibly England) signs that the health employment gap shrank. We then examine possible explanations for the development in the USA: we find no evidence it links to labour market trends, but possible links to the USA´s lack of disability benefit reform - which should be considered alongside the wider challenges of our findings for policymakers.
J18|Parental Leave Policies and Socio-Economic Gaps in Child Development: Evidence from a Substantial Benefit Reform Using Administrative Data|This paper examines the effects of substantial changes in paid parental leave on child development and socio-economic development gaps. We exploit a German reform from 2007 that both expanded paid leave in the first year and removed paid leave in the second year following childbirth. Higher-income households benefited relatively more from the reform than low-income households. We use administrative data from mandatory school entrance examinations containing detailed child development assessments at age six within a difference-in-differences approach. Our precise and robust estimates reveal no effects of the changes in parental leave benefits on child development across various socio-economic groups, and consequently no effects on socio-economic development gaps.
J18|The Effect of Pension Subsidies on Retirement Timing of Older Women: Evidence from a Regression Kink Design|This paper provides a clear and transparent setting to study the effect of additional pension benefits on women's retirement decision. Using administrative pension insurance records from Germany, I examine the impact of a pension subsidy program to low pay workers, implemented in 1992. The subsidies have a kinked relationship with the recipients' average pension contribution, which led to sharply different slopes of benefits for similar women to the left and to the right of the kink point. Using a regression kink design, I find that 100 euros additional monthly pension benefits induce female recipients to claim pension earlier by about 10 months. The hazard rate to claim a pension at age 60 increases by 17%. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests the ratio of behavioral cost to mechanical cost of this subsidy program is 0.3, which is smaller than other anti-poverty programs such as extending unemployment benefits and progressive taxation. I find that the phasing out of this subsidy program can account for one third of the increase in women's age of claiming pension over the past decade.
J18|Vocational Training for Unemployed Youth in Latvia: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design|This paper evaluates the impact of a vocational training programme on the labour market outcomes of unemployed youth in Latvia. The programme is part of the Youth Guarantee scheme for the period 2014-2020, the largest action launched by the European Union to reduce youth unemployment rate and to support young people aged between 15 and 29 who are not in education, employment or training (NEETs). To estimate the causal effect of participating in the programme on the employment outcomes, we exploit a rule that gives priority for participation to unemployed people under the age of 25 using a fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design setup. The estimated effects of the programme on the probability of being employed and monthly income up to 3.5 years after registering in the programme are positive but not statistically significant, although we find a strong positive effect of the priority rule on programme participation. This is the first evidence on the impact of a programme within the current Youth Guarantee scheme in Europe and our findings are in line with those from the literature on the evaluation of active labour market policies targeting youth.
J18|Female genital cutting and long-term adjustment of marriage markets: Evidence from West Africa|As female genital cutting (FGC) is conceivably required for women's proper marriage in Africa, its abandonment may have ambiguous impacts on married women's welfare. This study explores whether and how the abandonment of FGC is associated with women's marriage in the long term. It proposes a unique, externally applicable identification strategy and provides evidence consistent with the following view: Burkina Faso's political efforts at discouraging FGC increased the cost of FGC, as perceived by those who reside in the borderlands of its neighboring countries owing to cross-border knowledge spillovers, while reducing the area's cutting rate. However, this external policy shock had no distinct adverse influence on a range of young w omen's marital and health outcomes in these borderlands. These findings are not inconsistent with a game-theoretic model developed to formalize the well-known theory of marriage convention. In the long term, women's welfare may not markedly decline from a mating perspective, concomitantly along with the decline in FGC.
J18|The Economics of Parenting Skill and Child Development|This paper develops and tests a model of parental punishment in the context of parent-child interaction and child development. When the parent has better information than the child about the child's long-run returns to human capital, the child uses the parent's investment and punishment as noisy signals of what his optimal effort should be in both the short run and the long run. Punishment has a negative effect on the child's life cycle outcomes if it is used harshly and inconsistently with respect to child behavior. Conversely, punishment has positive effect on the child's life cycle outcomes if it is used moderately and consistently such that the parent can communicate to the child his optimal level of effort. Parents are heterogeneous in parenting skill, which is their ability to use punishment as a precise signal. The model suggests that punishment by itself can have either a positive or a negative effect on child outcomes, and thus the quality of punishment, not punishment itself, contributes to the child's human capital development. Experimental data from Germany shows that parenting skill can be improved through education and training, with behavioral improvement in the child observed as late as ten years after the intervention. Additionally, evidence from nationally representative data from the United States is consistent with model predictions.
J18|Who Benefits from Tax-Preferred Savings Accounts?|Many countries use tax-preferred saving accounts to incentivize individuals to save for retirement. The two main forms of tax-preferred saving accounts â€“ TEE and EET â€“ tax savings at the contribution and withdrawal years respectively. Thus the relative returns of the two savings vehicles depend on the effective marginal tax rates in these two years, which in turn depend on earning dynamics. This paper estimates a model of earning dynamics on a Canadian longitudinal administrative database containing millions of individuals, allowing for substantial heterogeneity in the evolution of income across income groups. The model is then used, together with a tax and credit calculator, to predict how the returns of EET and TEE vary across these groups. The results suggest that TEE accounts yield in general higher returns, especially for low-income groups. Comparing optimal saving choices predicted by the model with observed saving choices in the data suggests that EET are over-chosen, especially in the province of Quebec. These results have important implications for â€œnudgingâ€ policies that are currently being implemented in Quebec, forcing employers to automatically enrol their employees in savings accounts similar to EET. These could yield very low returns for low-income individuals, which are known to be the most sensitive to nudging.
J18|Marriage, Labor Supply and the Dynamics of the Social Safety Net|"The 1996 PRWORA reform introduced time limits on the receipt of welfare in the United States. We use variation by state and across demographic groups to provide reduced form evidence showing that such limits led to a fall in welfare claims (partly due to \banking"" benefits for future use), a rise in employment, and a decline in divorce rates. We then specify and estimate a life-cycle model of marriage, labor supply and divorce under limited commitment to better understand the mechanisms behind these behavioral responses, carry out counterfactual analysis with longer run impacts and evaluate the welfare effects of the program. Based on the model, which reproduces the reduced form estimates, we show that among low educated women, instead of relying on TANF, single mothers work more, more mothers remain married, some move to relying only on food stamps and, in ex-ante welfare terms, women are worse off."
J18|The Impacts of Paid Family Leave Benefits: Regression Kink Evidence from California Administrative Data|Although the United States provides unpaid maternity and family leave to qualifying workers, it is the only OECD country without a national paid leave policy, making wage replacement a pivotal issue under debate. We use ten years of linked administrative data from California together with a regression kink (RK) design to estimate the causal impacts of benefits in the first state-level paid family leave program for women with earnings near the maximum benefit threshold. We find no evidence that a higher weekly benefit amount (WBA) increases leave duration or leads to adverse future labor market outcomes for mothers in this group. In contrast, we document consistent evidence that an increase in the WBA leads to a small increase in the share of quarters worked one to two years after the leave and a sizeable increase in the likelihood of making a future paid family leave claim across a variety of specifications.
J18|Health and Mental Health Effects of Local Immigration Enforcement|We study the effect of two local immigration enforcement policies – Section 287(g) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act and the Secure Communities Program (SC) – that have escalated fear and risk of deportation among the undocumented on the health and mental health outcomes of Latino immigrants living in the United States. We use the restricted-use National Health Interview Survey for 2000-2012 and adopt a difference-in-difference research design. Estimates suggest that SC increased the proportion of Latino immigrants with mental health distress by 2.2 percentage points (14.7 percent); Task Force Enforcement under Section 287(g) worsened their mental health distress scores by 15 percent (0.08 standard deviation); Jail Enforcement under Section 287(g) increased the proportion of Latino immigrants reporting fair or poor health by 1 percentage point (11.1 percent) and lowered the proportion reporting very good or excellent health by 4.8 to 7.0 percentage points (7.8 to 10.9 percent). These findings are robust across various sensitivity checks.
J18|Why Are People Working Longer in the Netherlands?|Labor force participation at older ages has been rising in the Netherlands since the mid-nineteen-nineties. Reforms of the social security and pension systems have often been put forward as main explanations for this rise. However, participation rates above the normal retirement age of 65 have almost tripled for men and quadrupled for women despite the fact that at those ages reforms are unlikely to have had much impact. This suggests other factors may have played an important role in this rise as well. In addition to the effects of reforms in social security and pension systems, this chapter examines the importance for men’s labor force participation at older ages of improved health, increased levels of education, and differences in skills across cohorts, as the older cohorts moved into retirement, such that workers’ characteristics better matched labor demand. These changes on the labor supply side are likely to have contributed to the success of the reforms since the mid-nineteen-nineties and to have had a large independent impact on men’s labor force participation at older ages.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

J18|How Do Firms Respond to Place-Based Tax Incentives?|In this paper, we evaluate the effects of payroll tax changes on firm behavior, by exploiting a unique policy setting in Norway, where a system of geographically differentiated payroll taxes was suddenly abolished due to an EU regulation. We find that firms are only partially able to shift the increased costs from higher payroll tax rates onto workersâ€™ wages. Instead, firms respond to the tax increase primarily by reducing employment. The drop in employment following the tax reform is particularly pronounced in labor intensive firmsâ€”which experience a larger windfall loss due to the tax reform than non-labor intensive firmsâ€”and in multi-establishment firmsâ€”which respond to the payroll tax increase in part by reducing the number of establishments per firm. Overall, our findings point to liquidity effects whereby a sudden and largely unexpected payroll tax increase aggravates firmsâ€™ liquidity constraints, forcing them to cut employment to bring down costs.
J18|The Limits (and Human Costs) of Population Policy: Fertility Decline and Sex Selection in China under Mao|The vast majority of China’s fertility decline predates the famous One Child Policy – and instead occurred under its predecessor, the Later, Longer, Fewer (LLF) fertility control policy. In this paper, we first study LLF’s contribution to marriage and fertility behavior, finding that the policy reduced China’s total fertility rate by about 0.9 births per woman, explaining only 28% of China’s modern fertility decline. Given son preference, we then consider the parallel issue of sex selection, which also emerged prior to the One Child Policy (when prenatal selection was not technologically feasible). We find that LLF increased the use of male-biased fertility stopping rules from 3.25% to 6.3% of couples – and that it contributed to the early emergence of postnatal neglect of girls in modern China, rising from none to 0.3% of births (implying 210,000 previously unrecognized missing girls). Considering Chinese population policy to be extreme in global experience, our results demonstrate the limits of population policy’s ability to reduce fertility – and its potential for unintended consequences.
J18|Longer-Run Effects of Anti-Poverty Policies on Disadvantaged Neighborhoods|We estimate the longer-run effects of minimum wages, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and welfare on key economic indicators of economic self-sufficiency in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Our strongest findings are twofold. First, the longer-run effects of the EITC are to increase employment and to reduce poverty and public assistance, as long as we rely on national as well as state variation in EITC policy. Second, tighter welfare time limits also reduce poverty and public assistance in the longer run; while the effect on public assistance result may be mechanically related to loss of benefits, the effect on poverty is more likely behavioral. It is harder to draw firm conclusions about minimum wages and welfare benefits. With some specifications and samples, the evidence suggests that higher minimum wages lead to longer-run declines in poverty and the share of families on public assistance, whereas higher welfare benefits have adverse longer-run effects. However, the evidence on minimum wages and welfare benefits is not robust – and the estimated effects of minimum wages are sometimes in the opposite direction, including when we restrict the analysis to more recent data that is likely of more interest to policymakers.
J18|Gender Budgeting: A Useful Approach for Aotearoa New Zealand|Gender budgeting provides a way of analysing government expenditure and fiscal policy to promote gender equality. It can take many forms in practice including analysis of budget allocations, the structure of fiscal policies, expenditure tracking and monitoring systems to identify gender bias, whether explicit or implicit. It is generally understood that to ensure success such initiatives should be supported by both government and civil society. The concept of gender budgeting is now accepted globally, gaining the support of the OECD, the United Nations, the ILO, and the IMF. Some form of gender budgeting is now undertaken in over 80 countries, and while there have historically been many examples of effective application in developing countries, it is now also gaining popularity in OECD and G7 countries as they seek to address gender equality issues. This paper includes an example of gender analysis on tax concessions but other studies have focused on health, education, and labour market incentives. New Zealand has not introduced any formal gender budgeting initiatives. In this paper, its 2016 Tax Expenditure Statement was reviewed, and identified as lacking any gender specific analysis but including a number of expenditures that could have a potentially negative impact on gender equality. Tax expenditures are generally not recognised and treated as expenditure, although the financial impact is the same, and this small example illustrates how gender budgeting has the potential to provide greater transparency and analysis of expenditure on tax concessions. The paper discusses increasing the transparency of tax expenditures as an example of how gender budgeting could increase fiscal transparency in New Zealand. This paper argues that New Zealand would benefit from exploring the potential application of gender budgeting principles to increase the transparency of fiscal policy and inform policy debate.
J18|Unauthorized Mexican Workers in the United States: Recent Inflows and Possible Future Scenarios|The U.S. economy has long relied on immigrant workers, many of them unauthorized, yet estimates of the inflow of unauthorized workers and the determinants of that inflow are hard to come by. This paper provides estimates of the number of newly arriving unauthorized workers from Mexico, the principal source of unauthorized immigrants to the United States, and examines how the inflow is related to U.S. and Mexico economic conditions. Our estimates suggest that annual inflows of unauthorized workers averaged about 170,000 during 1996-2014 but were much higher before the economic downturn that began in 2007. Labor market conditions in the U.S. and Mexico play key roles in this migrant flow. The models estimated here predict that annual unauthorized inflows from Mexico will be about 100,000 in the future if recent economic conditions persist, and higher if the U.S. economy booms or the Mexican economy weakens.
J18|The Impact of Affirmative Action on the Gendered Occupational Segregation in South Africa|This paper studies the impact of an affirmative action policy on occupational segregation by gender in South Africa. We estimate effects of the Employment Equity Act of 1998, the Black Economic Empowerment Act in 2003 and the Codes of Good Conduct in 2007 on (Black) female employment in top occupations using individual level, repeated cross-section data of 21 years. The findings based on difference-in-difference-in-difference identification strategy show that the probability of Black female employment in top occupations increased after 2003, however it decreased after 2007. Overall, the effects are quite small. We offer several explanations for these effects.
J18|Negotiation with Patriarchy in Women’s Lives: A Case Study in a Malaysian Public University |"""Objective – While women make up almost 65% of undergraduates in public universities in Malaysia, only in the last three years their labour force participation rates have gone beyond the 50% mark. In addition, women form less than 20% of the legislature and Cabinet of Ministers in Malaysia. What pushes women in their achievements in education and what factors pull them back in other areas? How do patriarchal gender norms underpin their ability and decisions in life’s choices and how have they understood and negotiated these norms? This paper aims to explore these questions through narratives of women in a public university. Methodology/Technique – The paper is based on Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with 12 women who are staff and postgraduate students of the university. The respondents were divided into two groups: one consisting of the university’s academic and administrative staff and the other postgraduate students. Separate discussions were conducted for each group. The discussions were transcribed and analysed. Findings – Findings show that women have confidence in their ability to contribute effectively and in the same manner as men in different spheres of their lives such as work, home and community. However, often they have had to negotiate their ways around various beliefs, practices and norms about the superiority of men in society. Novelty – The study researches factors that affects woman achievements in life."""
J18|Ein stochastisches Prognosemodell internationaler Migration in Deutschland|Internationale Migration ist eines der gesellschaftlich am kontroversesten diskutierten Themen. Kritiker einer offenen Migrationspolitik sehen hohe Immigrationszahlen als großes Risiko für die Sicherheit und warnen vor möglichen Verdrängungseffekten am Arbeitsmarkt, während die Befürworter u.a. argumentieren, dass internationale Migration aus demografischer Sicht eine große Chance sei, die Folgen des Demografischen Wandels durch eine Erhöhung und Verjüngung der Bevölkerung auszubremsen und vor allem das Arbeitskräfteangebot in vom Fachkräftemangel bereits betroffenen Wirtschaftsbereichen zu erhöhen. Aus diesen Gründen ist es umso wichtiger, eine sachliche Diskussion auf Basis empirischer Ergebnisse zu führen. Eine quantitative Diskussionsgrundlage bildet in diesem Zusammenhang eine Prognose der zukünftigen Migrationsströme für Planungen in der Politik und dem Unternehmenskontext, was bisher nur unzureichend durchgeführt wird. Hierfür stellen wir einen Modellansatz für die Prognose der internationalen Nettomigration zwischen Deutschland und dem Ausland, differenziert nach Geschlecht, Alter und Nationalitätsgruppen, vor. Der Beitrag liefert stochastische Prognosen der zukünftigen Nettomigrationen auf Basis eines Hauptkomponenten-Zeitreihenmodells. Bei diesem Verfahren bilden Prognoseintervalle die Unsicherheit über die zukünftige Entwicklung ab.
J18|Jumping the welfare gap in designing public transfers|We consider three transfer models with a representative individual who discounts the utility of the merit good with respect to the standard one's. In each model, a paternalistic government taxes the consumer and transfers him additional merit goods in return. The private purchase of the merit goods is cheaper than the transfer. Even if the optimal transfer system is welfare superior to the transfer-free system, a system with much lower transfer may be inferior, therefore this welfare gap should be jumped. Various pension modelers (e.g. Feldstein, 1985; van Groezen, Leers and Meijdam, 2003) overlooked this problem and drew wrong conclusions.
J18|How did Feldstein (1985) undervalue the optimal level of social security benefits?|In his seminal model (Feldstein, 1985), the government operates a social security system to counter the representative worker's myopia. (i) For a complete myope, he determined a sizable optimal tax rate (and the corresponding benefit level). (ii) For a partially shortsighted worker, he determined another optimum, which was much lower, possibly zero. Departing from Feldstein, I take into account that neither a paternalistic government nor a cautious bank tolerates long-term negative saving, and then even in (ii), the government may choose the first rather than the second optimum. Having revised it, Feldstein's model regains its place in the textbooks.
J18|Peer Effects from a School Choice Reform|In 2005 the city of Bergen, Norway, went from a geographical catchment area high school intake system to a grade point average-based (GPA) intake system. The reform changed the composition of high school peer student characteristics substantially for comparable groups of students before and after the reform. This article compares changes in outcomes for students in Bergen before and after the reform to changes in the outcomes of students in control cities. Positive effects are found on test scores and grades at high school.
J18|Parental Investments in Early Life and Child Outcomes: Evidence from Swedish Parental Leave Rules|We study how parental resources early in life affect children’s health and education exploiting the so-called speed premium (SP) in the Swedish parental leave system. The SP grants mothers higher parental leave benefits for the subsequent child without re-establishing eligibility through pre-birth market work if the two births occur within a pre-specified interval. This allow us to use a Regression Discontinuity framework. We find that the SP improves the educational outcomes of the first-born child, but not of the second-born. Impacts are driven by a combination of a positive income shock, and substitution from informal care to maternal time.
J18|Unemployment risk among newly hired immigrants|Unemployment among immigrants is one of the most pressing issues facing European policy makers. Most of the research on unemployment among immigrants has been directed towards those who are low-educated or long-term unemployed, while those who are closer to establishing themselves on the labor market have received surprisingly little attention. Our aim is to address this shortcoming by investigating differences in unemployment risk between newly hired immigrants and natives using register data from Statistics Sweden. We find that unemployed immigrants are more likely to re-enter unemployment than natives in the same position, even after controlling for a wide range of individual- and firm-level factors. The difference in unemployment risk between immigrants and natives is significantly reduced if immigrants are hired by a firm in the hospitality sector, a young or small firm, or a firm with at least one manager born in a nonwestern country. Therefore, it appears that systematic differences exist in the risk of reentering unemployment between immigrants and native workers and that these differences are related to the workplace and industry in which they are hired.
J18|Economic assimilation of immigrants arriving from highly developed countries: The case of German immigrants in Sweden and the US|Migration across well-developed countries has been overlooked in the immigration literature. The present study is designed to evaluate the interplay between the effects of host countries' characteristics and self-selection patterns of immigrants from a highly developed country on their economic assimilation in other developed countries. We focus on immigrants originated from Germany during 1990–2000 who migrated to Sweden and the US. We use the 5 percent 2000 Public Use Microdata files (PUMS) of the US census and a pooled file of the 2005–2007 American Community Survey, and the 2000 and 2006 Swedish Registers. We analyze eight groups of German immigrants – by country of desti¬nation (the US/ Sweden), gender, and skill level (with/without an acade¬mic degree). The results show that almost all German immigrants reached full earnings assimilation with natives of similar observed attributes, and that the assimilation of highly skilled Germans was better than that of the low skilled. We also found that the skilled immigrants were compensated for their human capital acquired in Germany prior to their migration. Finally, we find that despite higher educational levels of the Germans that headed to Sweden, the better assimilation of German immigrants, especially the highly educated, took place in the US. The better assimilation of Germans in the US was probably the result of an interaction between the Germans’ pattern of self-selection (mainly on un¬observed attributes) and the US context of reception – mainly higher returns on their observed human capital in the US.
J18|Toothless Reforms? The Remarkable Stability of Female Labor Force Participation in a Top-Reforming Country|Low Female Labor Force Participation (FLFP) constitutes a foregone opportunity at both the macro and at the micro levels, potentially increasing the vulnerability of households and lowering the long-run development perspectives of a country. Most international organizations and national policy makers see low FLFP as a serious issue that needs to be addressed by adopting appropriate policies. We investigate the possible reasons of the remarkable stability of FLFP in a top-reforming upper-middle income country. Our goal is to in disentangle the different forces at work and to draw useful lessons for the design of participation-enhancing policies. Using data from a nationally representative Household Survey covering the period 2003-2015, we employ Blinder-Oaxaca (Blinder, 1973 and Oaxaca, 1973) type decomposition to decompose changes over time in FLFP levels into parts that are due to changes in observable factors versus changes in the strength of impact of these factors. This allows us to identify possible shifters of the FLFP rate and propose areas of special interest for policy making. We show that the stability of FLFP in Georgia during the period 2003-2013 is due to offsetting socio-economic changes taking place in the country, and that the increase in the last period covered by our dataset – 2013-2015 – can be attributed to the emergence of new labor opportunities for women. We conclude that, while useful, supply-side economic reforms are not sufficient to increase FLFP and need to be complemented by demand-side policies aiming at creating more and better work opportunities for women.
J18|Does Parents’ Access to Family Planning Increase Children’s Opportunities? Evidence from the War on Poverty and the Early Years of Title X|This paper examines the relationship between parents’ access to family planning and the economic resources of their children. Using the county-level introduction of U.S. family planning programs between 1964 and 1973, we find that children born after programs began had 2.8% higher household incomes. They were also 7% less likely to live in poverty and 12% less likely to live in households receiving public assistance. A bounding exercise suggests that the direct effects of family planning programs on parents’ resources account for roughly two thirds of these gains.
J18|Parental Investments in Early Life and Child Outcomes: Evidence from Swedish Parental Leave Rules|How do parental resources early in life affect children's health and schooling outcomes? We address this question by exploiting the so-called speed premium (SP) in the Swedish parental leave (PL) system. The SP grants mothers higher PL benefits for the subsequent child without the need to re-quality for benefits through pre-birth market work, if the two births occur within a pre-specified interval. The eligibility birth interval for this automatic renewal of PL benefits was set to 24 months in 1980–1985, and to 30 months since 1986. This allow us to use a Regression Discontinuity framework to study how additional parental time and monetary resources impacts both the existing and new child's educational and health outcomes. We find that maternal eligibility to the SP increases the 9th grade GPA, and the likelihood of college attendance of the first-born child, but it does not affect the secondborn. These impacts can be generalized for higher-order parities. The effects are prevalent primarily among children to high-income mothers. Impacts are driven by a combination of a persistent positive income shock, and substitution away from informal care to maternal time.
J18|Regional discontinuities and the effectiveness of further training subsidies for low-skilled employees|"""I analyze the effects of further training subsidies for low-skilled employees on individual labor market outcomes in Germany for the period from 2007 to 2012. Using detailed administrative data, I exploit cross-regional variation in the conditional policy styles of local employment agencies and use this fuzzy discontinuity as an instrument for program participation. I find that subsidies significantly increase cumulative employment duration and earnings for the subgroup of compliers. These gains are particularly pronounced for workers who are women, younger than 35 years old, non-German citizens and participated before the economic crisis of 2009."" (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en))"
J18|Give it Another Try: What are the Effects of a Public Employment Scheme Especially Designed for Hard-to-Place Workers?| Job creation schemes (JCSs) have for a long time been considered to function as stepping stone into the labour market for unemployed workers. However, previous research has shown that public job creation schemes have mostly negative effects on the employment outcomes of participants, probably due to strong lock-in effects, which are particularly strong for unemployed workers with higher labour market attachment. This raises the question of whether JCSs could be an effective policy tool for very-hard-to-place workers who have very low job chances anyway. We contribute to this discussion by analysing a JCS that employs a special selection mechanism to identify these workers. Relying on a combination of administrative data and survey data, we employ radius-matching with regression adjustment to estimate treatment effects. Our results indicate that the effects are still negative but weaker than the ones reported in previous studies. Furthermore, we point to effect heterogeneity with regard to contract duration which suggests that the results are more optimistic for shorter contracts. Finally, we show that the results are sensitive to the inclusion of survey variables, even if high quality administrative data are available.
J18|Public Policy As A Tool For Floriculture Development In The Municipality Of Tepetlixpa Mexico State, Politica Publica Como Herramienta De Desarrollo Para La Floricultura Del Municipio De Tepetlixpa Estado De Mexico|One problem facing the flower industry in Mexico, is a low linkage between government sectors responsible for supporting resources to producers. There are shortcomings in the management, dissemination and application of various types of programs that provide financial resources. These programs include national, state and municipal development at the federal level, the public body responsible for implementation is the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA). Such support programs must be permeated by t federal, state and municipal government with the intention of promoting the development of the region. This paper examines these government programs
J18|Paying Patients for Prenatal Care: The Effect of a Small Cash Transfer on Stillbirths and Survival|We study the effects of conditional cash transfers to pregnant women on stillbirths and child survival in Bolivia. Payments are conditional on compliance with medically recommended prenatal care and skilled birth attendance. At a value equivalent to just 1% of monthly household consumption, the payments are the smallest amongst national cash transfer programs in Latin America. Using multiple data sources and empirical methods, we show that the intervention reduced the average rate of stillbirths by 9.5% to 22.3%, and increased the survival rates of birth cohorts exposed to the program by 3.5% to 16.8%. The causal pathways of these effects are consistent with evidence of increased utilization of recommended health care services, including early initiation of prenatal care (17%), at least four prenatal visits (16%), and skilled birth attendance (15%). Given the modest transfer amounts and considerable effects on health care utilization, we posit that final health outcomes are likely driven by the health care conditionality, rather than an income effect. The intervention is highly cost-effective, at $184.54 per DALY averted, making the program’s pay-per-compliance design a promising policy alternative.
J18|Childcare, maternal employment and residential location|The economic literature provides mixed evidence of the relationship between local childcare provision and maternal employment. We document this question further by focusing on the role of the provision of childcare services close to the family?s residential location. We use a simultaneous equations approach to estimate the employment and childcare decisions of mothers of children aged 0-3, conditional on their residential location. Our estimates are based on a rich data set, which matches household and individual level microdata for Luxembourg in conjunction with municipality level data (provision of childcare services and other local amenities) and travel time distances for the year 2011. In line with the evidence provided by the recent literature, we find that, in a context where the female employment rate and the availability of childcare have increased over the last years, policies that make childcare services more widely accessible have no effect on maternal employment.
J18|Maternity and Family Leave Policy|Maternity and family leave policies enable mothers to take time off work to prepare for and recover from childbirth and to care for their new children. While there is substantial variation in the details of these policies around the world, the existing research yields the following general conclusions. First, despite important barriers to the take-up of leave, both the implementation of new programs and extensions of existing ones increase leavetaking rates among new parents. Second, leave entitlements less than one year in length can improve job continuity for women and increase their employment rates several years after childbirth; longer leaves can negatively influence women's earnings, employment, and career advancement. Third, extensions in existing paid leave policies have no impact on measures of child well-being, but the introduction of short paid and unpaid leave programs can improve children's short- and long-term outcomes. Fourth, while more research is needed, the current evidence shows minimal impacts of existing U.S. state-level programs on employer-level outcomes such as employee productivity, morale, profitability, turnoverrates, or the total wage bill.
J18|The Economic Consequences of Family Policies: Lessons from a Century of Legislation in High-Income Countries|By the early 21st century, most high-income countries have put into effect a host of generous and virtually gender-neutral parental leave policies and family benefits, with the multiple goals of gender equity, higher fertility, and child development. What have been the effects? Proponents typically emphasize the contribution of family policies to the goals of gender equity and child development, enabling women to combine careers and motherhood, and altering social norms regarding gender roles. Opponents often warn that family policies may become a long-term hindrance to women's careers because of the loss of work experience and the higher costs to employers that hire women of childbearing age. We draw lessons from existing work and our own analysis on the effects of parental leave and other interventions aimed at aiding families. We present country- and micro-level evidence on the effects of family policy on gender outcomes, focusing on female employment, gender gaps in earnings, and fertility. Most estimates range from negligible to a small positive impact. But the verdict is far more positive for the beneficial impact of spending on early education and childcare.
J18|Closing Routes to Retirement: How Do People Respond?|We present quasi-experimental evidence on the employment effects of an unprecedented large increase in the early retirement age (ERA). Raising the ERA has the potential to extend contribution periods and to reduce the number of pension beneficiaries at the same time, if employment exits are successfully delayed. However, workers may not be able to work longer or may choose other social support programs as exit routes from employment. We study the effects of the ERA increase on employment and potential program substitution in a regression-discontinuity framework. Germany abolished an important early retirement program for women born after 1951, effectively raising the ERA for women by three years. We analyze the effects of this huge increase on employment, unemployment, disability pensions, and inactivity rates. Our results suggest that the reform increased both employment and unemployment rates of women age 60 and over. However, we do not find evidence for active program substitution from employment into alternative social support programs. Instead employed women remained employed and unemployed women remained unemployed. The results suggest an increase in inequality within the affected cohorts.
J18|Immigration and innovation: Evidence from Canadian cities|We examine the effect of changes in skilled-immigrant population shares in 98 Canadian cities between 1981 and 2006 on per capita patents. The Canadian case is of interest because its 'points system' for selecting immigrants is viewed as a model of skilled immigration policy. Our estimates suggest unambiguously smaller beneficial impacts of increasing the university-educated immigrant population share than comparable U.S. estimates, whereas our estimates of the contribution of Canadian-born university graduates are virtually identical in magnitude to the U.S. estimates. The modest contribution of Canadian immigrants to innovation is, in large part, explained by the low employment rates of Canadian STEM-educated immigrants in STEM jobs. Our results point to the value of providing employers with a role in the immigrant screening process.
J18|Fathers, Parental Leave and Gender Norms|Social norms and attitudes towards gender roles have been shown to have a large effect on economic outcomes of men and women. Many countries have introduced policies that aim at changing gender stereotypes, for example fathers’ quota in parental leave schemes. In this paper, we analyze whether the introduction of the fathers’ quota in Germany in 2007, that caused a sharp increase in the take-up of parental leave by fathers, has changed the attitudes towards gender roles in the grandparents’ generation. To this end, we exploit the quasi-experimental setting of the 2007 reform and compare grandparents whose son had a child born before the 2007 reform to grandparents whose son had a child born after it. Our results suggest that such policy programs not only induce direct behavioral responses by the target group but also have indirect effects on non-treated individuals through social interaction and can thus change attitudes towards gender roles in a society as a whole.
J18|Taxing Childcare: Effects on Childcare Choices, Family Labor Supply, and Children|Previous studies report a range of estimates for the response of female labor supply and childcare attendance to childcare prices. We shed new light on these questions using a policy reform that raises the price of public day care. After the reform, children are 8 percentage points less likely to attend public day care, which implies a compensated price elasticity of −0.6. There is little labor supply response in the full sample, although there are declines for vulnerable subgroups. Spillover effects on older siblings and fertility decisions show that the policy affects the whole household, not just targeted family members.
J18|The Impacts of Reduced Access to Abortion and Family Planning Services: Evidence from Texas|Between 2011 and 2014, Texas enacted three pieces of legislation that significantly reduced funding for family planning services and increased restrictions on abortion clinic operations. Together this legislation creates cross-county variation in access to abortion and family planning services, which we leverage to understand the impact of family planning and abortion clinic access on abortions, births, and contraceptive purchases. In-state abortions fell 20% and births rose 3% in counties that no longer had an abortion provider within 50 miles. Births increased 1% and contraceptive purchases rose 8% in counties without a publicly-funded family planning clinic within 25 miles.
J18|Stigma of sexual violence and women’s decision to work|Our study is motivated by two disturbing evidences concerning women in India. On one hand, crime against women is on the rise while on the other, women’s labor force participation rate (WLFPR) has been declining over the last three decades. We estimate the extent to which the decline in WLFPR can be assigned to increasing instances of crime against women. We argue that an increase in crime against women, increases the non-pecuniary costs of traveling to work, particularly in a traditional society marked by stigma against victims of sexual crimes. Our findings suggest that women are less likely to work away from home in regions where the perceived threat of sexual harassment against girls is higher. The estimate is robust to various sensitivity checks. Moreover, the deterrence effect of crime responds to the opportunity cost of work on one hand and the stigma cost of sexual crimes on the other.
J18|Violent Conflict and Breastfeeding: The Case of Iraq|This study explores the relationship between armed conflict and breastfeeding practices of Iraqi mothers. Using a unique pairing of the Iraq Body Count database, in conjunction with the 2006 and 2011 Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys for Iraq, we find that increases in conflict-related casualties are associated with a decline in breastfeeding incidence, with some mixed results on breastfeeding duration. We also explore a number of potential causal channels, including interactions with household wealth and accessibility of formula. The results are informative in the context of designing policy aimed at stabilizing the long-term health and productivity of populations in conflict areas.

Evidence from Swedish Parental Leave Rules|We study how parental resources early in life affect children’s health and education exploiting the so-called speed premium (SP) in the Swedish parental leave system. The SP grants mothers higher parental leave benefits for the subsequent child without re-establishing eligibility through pre-birth market work if the two births occur within a pre-specified interval. This allow us to use a Regression Discontinuity framework. We find that the SP improves the educational outcomes of the first-born child, but not of the second-born. Impacts are driven by a combination of a positive income shock, and substitution from informal care to maternal time.
J18|Education Effects on Days Hospitalized and Days out of Work by Gender: Evidence from Turkey|The strong relationship between various health indicators and education is widely documented. However, the studies that investigate the nature of causality between these variables became available only recently and provide evidence mostly from developed countries. We add to this literature by studying the causal effect of education on days hospitalized and days out of work for health reasons. We consider two educational reforms. One is the educational expansion of the early 1960s and the other is the 1997 increase in compulsory level of schooling from five to eight years. However, due to the possibility of weak instruments we do not further pursue this avenue. We focus on individuals in two cohorts namely, 1945-1965 which is an older cohort and 1980-1980 which is a younger cohort. We estimate Tobit models as well as Double Hurdle models. The results suggest that an increase in years of education causes to reduce the number of days hospitalized for both men and women unambiguously and the number of days out of work only for men while an increase in education increases the number of days out of work for a randomly selected women.

J18|Demographic dynamics and long-run development: insights for the secular stagnation debate|Abstract This paper takes a global, long-run perspective on the recent debate about secular stagnation, which has so far mainly focused on the short term. The analysis is motivated by observing the interplay between the economic and demographic transition that has occurred in the developed world over the past 150 years. To the extent that high growth rates in the past have partly been the consequence of singular changes during the economic and demographic transition, growth is likely to become more moderate once the transition is completed. At the same time, a similar transition is on its way in most developing countries, with profound consequences for the development prospects in these countries, but also for global comparative development. The evidence presented here suggests that long-run demographic dynamics have potentially important implications for the prospects of human and physical capital accumulation, the evolution of productivity, and the question of secular stagnation.
J18|Impact of short term vocational training on youth unemployment: Evidence from Mongolia|Mongolia is a lower-middle income country characterized by high youth unemployment and a large informal sector. Training programs have been implemented in order to promote employment and tackle these issues. In this study, we evaluate the impact of a vocational training program (VTP) through a field experiment conducted between 2013 and 2015. This time frame allows us to explore short and medium term impacts. In particular, we focus on three outcomes of interest: employment, earnings and job quality. We find a positive and short-term impact on employment and a positive impact on monthly earnings in short and medium terms. We also show that providing information about schooling returns increases attendance and reduces dropout, which may help improve the program’s impact in non-expensive ways.
J18|Reduction of child poverty in Serbia: Improved cash-transfers or higher work incentives for parents?|Based on the 2013 Serbian Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC) and on the Serbian version of the EUROMOD platform, we evaluate the poverty and distributive effects on children of various reform (benefit and employment) strategies concerning the two major social benefit programs in Serbia: child allowance and social monetary assistance. Both the first and second-order effects of the proposed reforms are considered. For the second-round impacts, a structural labour supply model on parents has been estimated. Our results show that a benefit strategy (which also combats fiscal evasion) is preferred to an employment strategy which aims at raising the work incentives by parents
J18|Pregnancy Medicaid Expansions and Fertility: Differentiating between the Intensive and Extensive Margins|The theoretical and empirical links between public health insurance access and fertility in the United States remain unclear. Utilizing a demographic cell-based estimation approach with panel data (1987-1997), we revisit the large-scale Medicaid expansions to pregnant women during the 1980s to estimate the heterogeneous impacts of public health insurance access on childbirth. While the decision to become a parent (i.e., the extensive margin) appears to be unaffected by increased access to Medicaid, we find that increased access to public health insurance positively influenced the number of high parity births (i.e., the intensive margin) for select groups of women. In particular, we find a robust, positive birth effect for unmarried women with a high school education, a result which is consistent across the two racial groups examined in our analysis: African American and white women. This result suggests that investigating effects along both the intensive and extensive margin is important for scholars who study the natalist effects of social welfare policies, and our evidence provides a more nuanced understanding of the influence of public health insurance on fertility.
J18|Understanding Discrimination against Same-Sex Couples in the United States: Evidence from an Email Correspondence Audit|As of 2017, no federal law protected Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) individuals from housing discrimination. However, 22 U.S. states and over 200 municipalities have passed laws prohibiting housing discrimination based on sexual orientation. In this paper, I present the results of a randomized pair-email correspondence audit of 6,490 property owners in 94 U.S. cities. I provide a nationally-representative estimate of the level of discrimination same-sex couples experience when inquiring about rental housing. I find that same-sex male couples, especially Black same-sex male couples, are less likely to receive a response to inquiries about rental units. Same-sex female couples receive preferential treatment compared to heterosexual couples. I then examine how state and local anti-discrimination laws covary with rates of housing discrimination against same-sex couples. Compare to localities without any housing protections, I find that response rates covary positively with statelevel protections but negatively with local-level protections. I conclude by testing several hypotheses about the causes of this discrimination. This preliminary evidence suggests that property owners are willfully discriminating against same-sex male couples.
J18|Combating domestic violence against women in Turkey. The role of women's economic empowerment|This paper identifies motors and barriers for combatting domestic violence against women in Turkey – a country where modernism and conservatism are in constant interplay. We combine information from the Demographic Health Surveys and the Turkish Domestic Violence Survey and distinguish between controlling behavior, physical and sexual violence. Our empirical analysis tests how far a woman's intra-household decision making power (as measured by her education, her activity status, her income etc.) bears the potential to reduce her risk of experiencing domestic violence in Turkey. The analysis takes into account contextual factors as well as partner and household characteristics. We find that women's participation in the labor market does not, on its' own, reduce women's risk of experiencing intimate partner violence, but an egalitarian share of economic resources between spouses in likely to protect women against domestic violence. This finding has two important implications: First, higher education enabling women to access formal wage employment allows women not only to gain economic independence, but also to freely choose their partner. Second, unstable economic conditions that harm earning opportunities for men are an important risk factor for couples to experience conflits that can result in domestic violence against women. Against the background of the recent economic crisis that comes hand in hand with a backlash of gender and family norms in Turkey, our results highlight the need of policy action in this field
J18|The Effect of Labor Market Information on Community College Students’ Major Choice|An important goal of community colleges is to prepare students for the labor market. But are students aware of the labor market outcomes in different majors? And how much do students weigh labor market outcomes when choosing a major? In this study we find that less than 15% of a sample of community college students in California rank broad categories of majors accurately in terms of labor market outcomes. Students believe that salaries are 13% higher than they actually are, on average, and students underestimate the probability of being employed by almost 25%. We find that the main determinants of major choice are beliefs about course enjoyment and grades, but expected labor market outcomes also matter. Experimental estimates of the impact of expected labor market outcomes are larger than OLS estimates and show that a 10% increase in salary is associated with a 14 to 18% increase in the probability of choosing a specific category of majors.
J18|The Effect of Stress on Later-Life Health: Evidence from the Vietnam Draft|A substantial literature has examined the impact of stress during early childhood on later-life health. This paper contributes to that literature by examining the later-life health impact of stress during adolescence and early adulthood, using a novel proxy for stress: risk of military induction during the Vietnam War. We estimate that a 10 percentage point (2 standard deviation) increase in induction risk in young adulthood is associated with a 1.5 percentage point (8%) increase in the probability of being obese and a 1 percentage point (10%) increase in the probability of being in fair or poor health later in life. This does not appear to be due to cohort effects; these associations exist only for men who did not serve in the war, and are not present for women or men who did serve. These findings add to the evidence on the lasting consequences of stress, and also indicate that induction risk during Vietnam may, in certain contexts, be an invalid instrument for education or marriage because it appears to have a direct impact on health.
J18|A Letter and Encouragement: Does Information Increase Postsecondary Enrollment of UI Recipients?|For individuals who experience job loss, enrollment in postsecondary programs may provide an opportunity to improve future employment outcomes. However, decisions to enroll may be hampered by insufficient information about the benefits and costs and the necessary steps and assistance available to facilitate such investments. Using variation in the dissemination and timing of letters sent to Unemployment Insurance (UI) recipients containing this information, we find that individuals sent the information are 40 percent more likely to enroll. These findings suggest that well coordinated information interventions delivered with institutional support may be more effective than raising the generosity of existing government programs in increasing participation.
J18|Male Earnings, Marriageable Men, and Nonmarital Fertility: Evidence from the Fracking Boom|We investigate whether an increase in the potential earnings of men leads to an increase in marriage and a reduction in nonmarital births by exploiting the positive economic shock associated with fracking in the 2000s. A reduced-form analysis reveals that in response to local-area fracking production, which increased wages and jobs for non-college-educated men, both marital and nonmarital birth rates increase, but marriage rates do not. The pattern of results is consistent with positive income effects on births but no associated increase in marriage. We contrast our findings to the Appalachian coal boom experience of the 1970s and 1980s.
J18|Access and Use of Contraception and Its Effects on Women’s Outcomes in the U.S|Changes in childbearing affect almost every aspect of human existence. Over the last fifty years, American women have experienced dramatic changes in the ease and convenience of timing and limiting childbearing, ranging from the introduction of the birth control pill and the legalization of abortion to more recent availability of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs). This article chronicles these changes, provides descriptive evidence regarding trends in use, and reviews the literature linking them to changes in childbearing and women’s economic outcomes.
J18|The Effects of the Affordable Care Act on Health Insurance Coverage and Labor Market Outcomes|The Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes several provisions designed to expand health insurance coverage that also alter the tie between employment and health insurance. In this paper, we exploit variation across geographic areas in the potential impact of the ACA to estimate its effect on health insurance and labor market outcomes in its first four years. Our findings indicate that approximately 70 percent of the increase in health insurance coverage since 2013 is due to the ACA. We also find that these increases in health insurance coverage did not result in statistically significant changes in labor market outcomes.
J18|The impacts of reduced access to abortion and family planning services on abortions, births, and contraceptive purchases|Between 2011 and 2014, Texas enacted three pieces of legislation that significantly reduced funding for family planning services and increased restrictions on abortion clinic operations. Together this legislation creates cross-county variation over time in access to abortion and family planning services, which we leverage to understand the impact of family planning and abortion clinic access on abortions, births, and contraceptive purchases. In response to these policies, abortions to Texas residents fell 16.7% and births rose 1.3% in counties that no longer had an abortion provider within 50 mi. Changes in the family planning market induced a 1.2% increase in births for counties that no longer had a publicly funded family planning clinic within 25 mi. Meanwhile, responses of retail purchases of condoms and emergency contraceptives to both abortion and family planning service changes were minimal.
J18|Can financial incentives reduce the baby gap? Evidence from a reform in maternity leave benefits|To assess whether earnings-dependent maternity leave positively impacts fertility and narrows the baby gap between high educated (high earning) and low educated (low earning) women, I exploit a major maternity leave benefit reform in Germany that considerably increases the financial incentives for higher educated and higher earning women to have a child. In particular, I use the large differential changes in maternity leave benefits across education and income groups to estimate the effects on fertility up to 5 years post reform. In addition to demonstrating an up to 22% increase in the fertility of tertiary educated versus low educated women, I find a positive, statistically significant effect of increased benefits on fertility, driven mainly by women at the middle and upper end of the education and income distributions. Overall, the results suggest that earnings-dependent maternity leave benefits, which compensate women commensurate with their opportunity cost of childbearing, could successfully reduce the fertility rate disparity related to mothers' education and earnings.
J18|Uber vs. Taxi: A Driver’s Eye View|Ride-hailing drivers pay a proportion of their fares to the ride-hailing platform operator, a commission-based compensation model used by many internet-mediated service providers. To Uber drivers, this commission is known as the Uber fee. By contrast, traditional taxi drivers in most US cities make a fixed payment independent of their earnings, usually a weekly or daily medallion lease, but keep every fare dollar net of expenses. We assess these compensation models from a driver’s point of view using an experiment that offered random samples of Boston Uber drivers opportunities to lease a virtual taxi medallion that eliminates the Uber fee. Some drivers were offered a negative fee. Drivers’ labor supply response to our offers reveals a large intertemporal substitution elasticity, on the order of 1.2. At the same time, our virtual lease program was under-subscribed: many drivers who would have benefitted from buying an inexpensive lease chose to opt out. We use these results to compute the average compensation required to make drivers indifferent between ride-hailing and a traditional taxi compensation contract. The results suggest that ride-hailing drivers gain considerably from the opportunity to drive without leasing.
J18|Does Parents' Access to Family Planning Increase Children's Opportunities? Evidence from the War on Poverty and the Early Years of Title X|This paper examines the relationship between parents’ access to family planning and the economic resources of their children. Using the county-level introduction of U.S. family planning programs between 1964 and 1973, we find that children born after programs began had 2.8% higher household incomes. They were also 7% less likely to live in poverty and 12% less likely to live in households receiving public assistance. After accounting for selection, the direct effects of family planning programs on parents’ incomes account for roughly two thirds of these gains.
J18|Is Occupational Licensing a Barrier to Interstate Migration?|Occupational licensure, one of the most significant labor market regulations in the United States, may restrict the interstate movement of workers. We analyze the interstate migration of 22 licensed occupations. Using an empirical strategy that controls for unobservable characteristics that drive long-distance moves, we find that the between-state migration rate for individuals in occupations with state-specific licensing exam requirements is 36 percent lower relative to members of other occupations. Members of licensed occupations with national licensing exams show no evidence of limited interstate migration. The size of this effect varies across occupations and appears to be tied to the state specificity of licensing requirements. We also provide evidence that the adoption of reciprocity agreements, which lower re-licensure costs, increases the interstate migration rate of lawyers. Based on our results, we estimate that the rise in occupational licensing can explain part of the documented decline in interstate migration and job transitions in the United States.
J18|The social origins of inventors|In this paper, we merge three datasets - individual income data, patenting data, and IQ data - to analyze the deterninants of an individual’s probability of inventing. We find that: (i) parental income matters even after controlling for other background variables and for IQ, yet the estimated impact of parental income is greatly diminished once parental education and the individual’s IQ are controlled for; (ii) IQ has both a direct effect on the probability of inventing an indirect impact through education. The effect of IQ is larger for inventors than for medical doctors or lawyers. The impact of IQ is robust to controlling for unobserved family characteristics by focusing on potential inventors with brothers close in age. We also provide evidence on the importance of social family interactions, by looking at biological versus non-biological parents. Finally, we find a positive and significant interaction effect between IQ and father income, which suggests a misallocation of talents to innovation
J18|The Long-Run Effects of the Earned Income Tax Credit on Women’s Earnings|We use longitudinal data on marriage and children from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to characterize women’s exposure to the federal and state Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) during their first two decades of adulthood. We then use measures of this exposure to estimate the long-run effects of the EITC on women’s labor market outcomes as mature adults. We find evidence indicating that exposure to a more generous EITC when women were unmarried and had children leads to higher wages, earnings, and hours in the longer-run. We also find evidence that exposure to a more generous EITC when women had children but were married leads to lower earnings and hours in the longer-run. These longer-run effects are consistent with what we would expect if the short-run effects of the EITC on employment that are documented in other work, and predicted by theory, are reflected in effects of the EITC on cumulative labor market experience and other consequences of labor market attachment that influence earnings.
J18|The Effect of Age-Specific Sex Ratios on Crime: Instrumental Variable Estimates from India|Using data from 1961 to 2001, we show the impact on crime of two age-specific sex ratios corresponding to pre-marital (ages 10 to 16) and marriageable (ages 20 to 26) age groups in India. To deal with the endogeneity of sex ratios, we use an Instrumental Variable (IV) strategy that exploits district level variation in historical area under wheat-rice cultivation, and time-variation in relative producer prices of wheat-rice. We find that an increase in 10-16 age sex ratio by one female per 1000 males leads to a 1.5
J18|How self-sorting affects migrants’ labour market outcomes|Assuming that immigrants select destinations according to absolute returns to their observable and unobservable human capital, I present a human capital model of migration accounting for taxes, transfers and limited portability of skills. The model predicts both segmented sorting of migrants to countries with a compressed income distribution, with negative sorting increasing with lower portability and positive sorting increasing with portability. Sorting to countries with greater income dispersion increases unambiguously with host-country relevant skills. Migrants to countries with compressed incomes will hence be more likely to be either out of work or overqualified and low-paid compared to natives with similar observable skills, and compared to migrants to countries with greater income dispersion. Regressions results on data for 16 OECD countries from the OECD Survey of Adult Skills are in line with the model. Controlling for observable skills and characteristics, including a literacy test score, immigrants from countries that are less wealthy or further away in geographical and cultural distance are significantly more likely to be either out of work or overqualified and low-paid in high-benefit countries. Wage compression, generous transfers and high taxes, typical traits of the so-called “Nordic” or “Flexicurity” model, may therefore contribute to making immigrant integration more challenging.
J18|Actuarial Deductions for Early Retirement|The paper studies how the rates of deduction for early retirement have to be determined in PAYG systems in order to keep their budget stable. I show that the budget-neutral deductions depend on the speci_c rules of the pension system and on the choice of the discount rate which itself depends on the collective retirement behavior. For the commonly used _ction of a single individual deviating from the target retirement age the right choice is the market interest rate while for the alternative scenario of a stationary retirement distribution it is the internal rate of return of the PAYG system. In this case the necessary budget-neutral deductions are lower than under the standard approach used in the related literature. This is also true for retirement ages that uctuate randomly around a stationary distribution. Long-run shifts (e.g. increases in the average retirement age) might cause problems for the pension system but these have to be dealt with by the general pension formulas not by the deduction rates.
J18|Aging, depression, and non-communicable diseases in South Africa|This is the first study that offers a comprehensive analysis of depression among the old (60+ years) in South Africa. By using an analytical framewrok that builds on the (sparse) extant literature and a new dataset extracted from the four waves of the South African National Income Dynamics Study (2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014), we examine factors contributing to depression of people in this age cohort. Depending on whether the dependent variable is binary (self-reported depression for 3 or more days in a week) or continuous (as in two indices of depression), we use random effects probit estimator with Mundlak adjustment or simply random effects with Mundlak adjustment. It is found that, among the old, those in their sixties, the Africans and Coloureds, women, those suffering from multimorbidity, those in lower asset quartiles, and individuals suffering family bereavement are more likely to be depressed. Factors that attenuate depression include marriage, pension, affluence, and trust in a community and familiar neighbourhoods.
J18|Has improved daycare accessibility increased Japan's maternal employment rate? Municipal evidence from 2000–2010|Over the past decades, female labor force participation in Japan has continued to expand, accompanied by an improvement in daycare accessibility. This paper quantifies the daycare effects on employment of mothers with preschool children, analyzing newly constructed municipality-level data covering 1758 municipalities for 2000, 2005, and 2010. The results suggest that 5%–11% of the increase in maternal employment rate during 2000–2010 was attributable to the improvement in daycare accessibility. However, the daycare effects on maternal employment are quite limited compared with those on enrollments at licensed daycare centers. Our new evidence suggests that such discrepancy could emanate from the fact that better access to licensed daycare centers encouraged working mothers to switch from kindergartens.
J18|The Political Economy of Development: A Critical Assessment of Balochistan, Pakistan|This study aims at examining the political economy of the province of Balochistan, Pakistan and the underlying causes of social and economic under-development of the province. After presenting a brief and critical account on the historical development of the people of Balochistan, the paper argues that the province of Balochistan notwithstanding having a huge and resourceful land has failed to keep the pace of socio-economic development and modernity with other fellow provinces in the federation of Pakistan. After the independence of Pakistan and the formation of Balochistan as a province of, the people of Balochistan because of their political disorganization and segregation and economic backwardness failed to exert them within the political economy realm of Pakistan in order to grab their due resource share. The saga of economic and social backwardness of Balochistan province is a multifaceted puzzle. A section of the Balochistan political elite and scholars believe that the centralist nature of Pakistani federation is such that small nationalities like the Baloch and Pashtoon would find it hard to get their due share within the federation. That is because, the resource distribution and representation to both elected bodies and state institutions are based upon population, and Balochistan in spite of having 44% of Pakistan territory accommodates only 5% of country’s total population, whereas, another section is in the view that the nature of geo-economics and historical perspective of the province hinder the pace of economic development. The paper also touches the geostrategic importance of Balochistan and underlines its economic difficulty in terms of the dearth of human resources, physical infrastructure, economic autonomy, and productivity among others.
J18|Analysis of Present Day Election Processes vis-à-vis Elections Through Blockchain Technology|Currently, Democracy is realised through representatives elected by the people. These elections are periodic activities. They involve expenditure of big amounts of manpower, money, time and other resources. It is important to note that during an election, the administration and day-to-day lives of people are affected as election activities take centre stage. Present day elections are amenable to influence where Voters can possibly be intimidated to vote against their will. In many instances, the trustworthiness of the election process is itself uncertain. In such a situation, we need an election process that is fair, convenient transparent, and inexpensive. Blockchain technology provides a possibility to attain a highly dependable and certifiable election process. This process is also inexpensive at the same time. This paper deals with examining possibilities of conducting elections through the Blockchain. Blockchain technology is briefly introduced. The procedure that underlies voting through Blockchain is defined. The advantages of such a system are then deliberated. The various points vis-a-vis present day election processes are analysed. The paper concludes by analysing the possible impacts of voting through the Blockchain.
J18|Two-child Policy, Gender Income and Fertility Choice In China|We build up a three-period overlapping generation model to explore the effectiveness of fertility policy and the corresponding factors affecting the fertility choices in China. The results show that there is a significant U-shaped relationship between female income and the two-child fertility choice, and a significant positive relationship between male income and the two-child fertility choice, and the relationship between the price of other child care services and the two-child fertility choice is negatively correlated. The analysis of the effectiveness of the current universal two-child policy suggests that there exists a threshold of the fertility policy estimated to be between 1 and 2. Therefore, even if the two-child policy is further relaxed to a three child policy, it will exert little influence on fertility choice. Thus other forms of fertility policy should be combined to improve fertility rate.
J18|Spatial Inequality of Growth between Morocco Regions|Although significant progress had been made in Morocco, the inter-regional inequalities persist. The aim of this paper is to analyse this spatial inequality and convergence phenomenon in Morocco, using regional data between 2000 and 2007. Thus, relying on methods of spatial data analysis and taken from theoretical and empirical contributions, this paper analyses the role of the sectorial externalities and spatial spillovers in growth. Next, we tested the existence of a convergence process and the conditions for its improvement. The results showed the existence of a growth convergence process in value added and productivity but not in employment. On the other hand, the variables of human capital and infrastructure can significantly reduce regional inequality. Thus, we conclude that the conventional policies based solely on the infrastructure development or education are not sufficient. A more comprehensive approach that integrates these two axes and encourages business development and knowledge transfer is needed.

J18|Seductive Solutions, Inspiration, Easy-to-Remember Phrases, and Ambiguity: Why Is the Idea of Active Ageing so Successful?|The idea of active ageing has become one of the most influential perspectives in modern gerontology, social work, and social policy. This paper discusses factors that helped to establish active ageing as a successful theoretical concept that has significantly influenced contemporary social representations of ageing and has a practical impact on social work and policy. The perspective of the philosophy of social science is employed to explain what makes the idea of active ageing so attractive despite the remaining confusions concerning what “activity” and “ageing actively” means. The paper aims to answer the following question: What makes the concept of active ageing so successful? It draws upon the work of Murray Davis (1986) and her insight into the key aspects that make sociological theory “seductive.” The paper analyzes in what ways the concept of active ageing fulfills the specific features that, according to Davis, determine the success of social theories. Simultaneously, the paper critically evaluates the ways the idea of active ageing is translated into ageing policy. The case of Czech Republic is used to illustrate the problematic aspect of active ageing policies as well as the specific rhetoric that makes the idea of active ageing so attractive for a broad spectrum of disciplines as well as for social policy.
J18|Fertility Expectations and Educational Attainment: Evidence from the Mothers of China's Sibling-less Generation|The speed at which women's educational attainment has caught up with men's is probably one of the greatest social changes in the late 20 century. What explains this impressive increase in female's education? This paper exploits China's One-Child Policy as a natural experiment that exogenously reduced fertility to study the relationship between fertility and educational attainment of the mothers of the sibling-less generation. I use two difference-in-differences approaches to estimate the education changes in the post-policy Han women cohorts. My estimates suggest that the policy increased the education of women younger than 19 when the policy was implemented by up to 1.3 years of schooling, which counts for up to 54.5% of increase in education improvement of women born between 1960-1980. Females under age 15 experienced the strongest effect compared to other teenagers. In addition, the policy increased the likelihood of women completing high school by up to 8.10 percentage points, but has not much effect on college completion. Further analysis on post-school outcomes provides evidence for the potential mechanisms, such as delaying entry to motherhood and increasing labor force participation, through which the policy increased women's education.
J18|Optimal Social Assistance and Unemployment Insurance in a Life-Cycle Model of Family Labor Supply and Savings|We analyze empirically the optimal design of social insurance and assistance programs when families obtain insurance by making labor supply choices for both spouses. For this purpose, we specify a structural life-cycle model of the labor supply and savings decisions of singles and married couples. Partial insurance against wage and employment shocks is provided by social programs, savings and the labor supplies of all adult household members. The optimal policy mix focuses mainly on Social Assistance, which provides a permanent universal household income floor, with a minor role for temporary earnings-related Unemployment Insurance. Reflecting that married couples obtain intra-household insurance by making labor supply choices for both spouses, the optimal generosity of Social Assistance decreases in the proportion of married individuals in the population. The link between optimal program design and the family context is strongest in low-educated populations.
J18|The Economic Consequences of Family Policies: Lessons from a Century of Legislation| We draw lessons from existing work and our own analysis on the effects of parental leave and other interventions aimed at aiding families. The outcomes of interest are female employment, gender gaps in earnings and fertility. We begin with a discussion of the historical introduction of family policies ever since the end of the nineteenth century and then turn to the details regarding family policies currently in effect across high-income nations. We sketch a framework concerning the effects of family policy to motivate our country- and micro-level evidence on the impact of family policies on gender outcomes. Most estimates of the impact of parental leave entitlement on female labor market outcomes range from negligible to weakly positive. The verdict is far more positive for the beneficial impact of spending on early education and childcare.
J18|Does migrating with children influence migrants' occupation choice and income?| This paper studies the impact of migrant children on their parents' occupation choice and wage income using a dataset from a household survey conducted in 2011. We find that the heads of migrant households with school-age children earn significantly less than those who left them at their place of hukou registration. This result holds when we control for personal characteristics, migration duration, origin location, and family structure. Households migrating with school-age children have a higher probability of doing so within the prefecture/province of their hukou registration and are less likely to target coastal regions. After controlling for migration scope and destination location, the presence of children does not influence wages of migrant household heads. We also find that presence of children below age 6 has no impact on the income of migrant household heads. Our results suggest that the hukou system still impedes labor mobility.
J18|The Gap Year: An Overview of the Issues|Taking a gap year between high school and post-secondary education appears to be an increasingly popular phenomenon in popular culture, among well-known individuals and for Canadian youth. This report reviews the literature on issues related to gap years, with a focus on the Canadian context and the experiences of youth in several similar countries. Overall, taking a gap year appears to be a beneficial choice for many Canadian youth, although the impacts of a gap year are often dependent on the youth’s socioeconomic background and the activities they participate in during their gap year. Based on these findings in the literature, a number of options for public policy are proposed to improve knowledge of gap years, increase the take-up of gap years, and make gap years a more accessible option for disadvantaged segments of the population.
J18|Local labor markets and earnings of refugee immigrants|Abstract This paper estimates how local conditions at the time of immigration influence later outcomes for refugee immigrants to Norway, exploiting the quasi-experimental nature of the Norwegian system for settlement for “quota” or resettlement refugees. A unique administrative dataset with assigned settlement municipalities is used to identify the causal effect of initial location characteristics. Being placed in a labor market where other non-OECD immigrants do well increases own annual labor earnings up to 6 years after immigration. Extended models suggest that this effect is not driven by individual scarring effects: when controlling for the contemporaneous employment rate in the assigned region, effects of initial conditions disappear. Rather, the effects appear to be due to persistence in local labor market conditions combined with limited geographical mobility in response to adverse labor market conditions.
J18|Information and Women’s Intentions: Experimental Evidence About Child Care|Abstract We investigate the effect of providing information about the benefits to children of attending formal child care when women intend to use formal child care so they can work. We postulate that the reaction to the information differs across women according to their characteristics, specifically their level of education. We present a randomized experiment in which 700 Italian women of reproductive age with no children are exposed to positive information about formal child care through a text message or a video, while others are not. We find a positive effect on the intention to use formal child care and a negative effect on the intention to work. This average result hides important heterogeneities: the positive effect on formal child care use is driven by high-educated women, while the negative effect on work intention is found only among less-educated women. These findings may be explained by women’s education reflecting their work–family orientation, and their ability to afford formal child care.
J18|Offline effects of online connecting: the impact of broadband diffusion on teen fertility decisions|Abstract Broadband (high-speed) internet access expanded rapidly from 1999 to 2007 and is associated with higher economic growth and labor market activity. In this paper, we examine whether the rollout also affected the social connections that teens make. Specifically, we look at the relationship between increased broadband access and teen fertility. We hypothesize that increasing access to high-speed internet can influence fertility decisions by changing the size of the market as well as increasing the information available to participants in the market. We seek to understand both the overall effect of broadband internet on teen fertility and the mechanisms underlying this effect. Our results suggest that increased broadband access explains at least 7 % of the decline in the teen birth rate between 1999 and 2007. Although we focus on social markets, this work contributes more broadly to an understanding of how new technology interacts with existing markets.
J18|Pensions and fertility: back to the roots|Abstract Fertility has long been declining in industrialised countries and the existence of public pension systems is considered as one of the causes. This paper provides detailed evidence on the mechanism by which a public pension system depresses fertility, based on historical data. Our theoretical framework highlights that the effect of a public pension system on fertility is ex ante ambiguous while its size is determined by the internal rate of return of the pension system. We identify an overall negative effect of the introduction of pension insurance on fertility using regional variation across 23 provinces of Imperial Germany in key variables of Bismarck’s pension system, which was introduced in Imperial Germany in 1891. The negative effect on fertility is robust to controlling for the traditional determinants of the first demographic transition as well as to other policy changes.
J18|The impact of school entry laws on female education and teenage fertility|Abstract The literature on school entry laws in the USA suggests that school entry laws affect educational success in offsetting ways, where students born after the entry cutoff date tend to achieve higher test scores yet complete fewer years of schooling. However, the laws have little impact on a number of other outcomes, including fertility, wages, and employment. This paper has two goals. First, using a North Carolina dataset which individually links birth certificate data to school administrative records, it more fully explores the opposite impacts on educational success than previous papers and investigates why students born after the cutoff date have lower educational attainment despite doing better in school. Second, it investigates the impact of school entry laws on teenage fertility and provides some evidence that test scores and years of education have negative impacts, but that these impacts offset each other in the case of school entry laws.
J18|The Effects of Differential Income Replacement and Mortality on U.S. Social Security Redistribution|We study redistribution via the United States Social Security retirement system for cohorts of men born during the second half of the 20th century. Our focus is on redistribution across race and education groups. The cohorts we study are younger than cohorts studied in previous, similar research and thus more exposed to recent increases in earnings inequality. All else equal, this should increase the degree of progressivity of Social Security redistribution due to the structure of the benefit formula. However, we find that redistribution is only modestly progressive for individuals born as late as 1980. Differential mortality rates across race and education groups are the primary explanation. While black-white mortality gaps have narrowed some in recent years, they remain large and dull progressivity. Mortality gaps by education level are also large and unlike the gaps by race, they are widening, which puts additional regressive pressure on Social Security redistribution.
J18|Veterans in Workforce Development: Participation and Labor Market Outcomes|This paper compares the employment status and earnings of veterans and nonveterans following their receipt of public workforce development services in Washington State during the years 2002–2012. It also describes workforce program participation patterns for veterans and nonveterans to determine if veterans have equal or prioritized access to key programs, where prioritization is required by law. Based on tabulations and propensity score weighted regressions using administrative data, the results indicate slightly lower levels of participation by veterans than nonveterans in two major workforce programs (Wagner-Peyser and the Workforce Investment Act Adult program), and high participation in veteran-specific programs (Disabled Veterans Outreach Program and Local Veterans Employment Representative). Employment rates of veterans after program receipt are substantially lower than those for nonveterans. Meanwhile, average earnings are slightly higher, conditional on employment. These results highlight the ongoing challenge of closing the gap in employment between veterans and nonveterans to reach goals stated by policymakers.
J18|Does Increased Access to Health Insurance Impact Claims for Workers' Compensation? Evidence from Massachusetts Health Care Reform|We study over 20 million emergency room (ER) discharges in Massachusetts and three comparison states to estimate the impact of Massachusetts health care reform on claims for Workers’ Compensation (WC). Prior evidence on the relationship between health insurance and WC claiming behavior is mixed. We find that the reform caused a significant decrease in the number of per-capita ER discharges billed to WC. This result is driven by larger decreases in WC discharges for conditions for which there is greater scope to change the payer or the location of care. Conversely, we estimate smaller impacts for weekend versus weekday admissions and for wounds compared to musculoskeletal injuries. Our findings are consistent with the reform lowering WC medical costs for employers/insurers, primarily by inducing injured workers to seek care at less costly sites. The results suggest much smaller impacts on the propensity to bill WC for a given injury.
J18|The Impact of Introducing Formal Childcare Services on Labour Force Participation in Inuit Nunangat|We study the labour force impact of introducing formal childcare services to 34 Inuit communities in Canada's North. We use geographic variation in the timing and intensity of the introduction of childcare services in the late 1990s and early 2000s to estimate the impact of increased access to childcare. We combine the 1996, 2001, and 2006 long-form census files with data on the number of childcare spaces in each of the 34 communities over time. We find that a one standard deviation increase in the number of childcare spaces per 100 children increases labour force participation in single-adult households by 3.6 percent. We find no impact in households with more than one adult present. We suggest plausible explanations for these findings and avenues for future research.
J18|Effects of Informal Elderly Care on Labor Supply: Exploitation of Government Intervention on the Supply Side of Elderly Care Market|This study analyzes the effect of informal elderly care on caregiver labor supply. Since the Japanese government intervenes on the supply side of the elderly care market and market entry of nursing home suppliers is regulated, this analysis utilizes exogenous variations from the supply side of government intervention on the elderly care market. Owing to such intervention and regulation, public nursing home capacity exogenously changes for caregivers, which we use to estimate the effect of informal elderly care on labor supply. To the best of our knowledge, no study has thus far utilized exogenous institutional variation as an instrument to estimate this effect. Analysis results reveal that the effect of informal elderly care on female labor force participation is negative. By contrast, male labor force participation is not affected by such care, since, in Japan, females spend more time on informal care than males. The increase in nursing home capacity is thus effective for decreasing the female burden of informal care.
J18|La despoblación en Aragón, 2000-2016: tendencias, datos y reflexiones para el diseño de políticas|En este trabajo se analizan las principales tendencias demográficas de Aragón entre 2000 y 2008. El análisis se hace tanto a escala comarcal como municipal para dos subperiodos: 2000-2008 y 2008-2016. El primero coincide con una etapa de crecimiento económico y expansión demográfica; el segundo con una profunda crisis y retroceso demográfico. Se concluye que es, sobre todo, la llegada de inmigrantes procedentes del extranjero la principal causa del crecimiento de la población en la primera etapa. También se estudian las políticas frente a la despoblación desarrolladas y se realizan una serie de recomendaciones para orientar las políticas futuras.
