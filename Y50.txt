Y50|The Formation of Consumer Brand Preferences|Brands and brand capital have long been theorized to play an important role in the formation of the industrial market structure of consumer goods industries. We summarize several striking empirical regularities in the concentration, magnitude and persistence of brand market shares in consumer goods categories. We then survey the theoretical and empirical literatures on the formation of brand preferences and how brand preferences contribute to our understanding of these empirical regularities. We also review the literature on how brand capital creates strategic advantages to firms that own established brands.

Y50|Honey production systems (Apis mellifera L.) in Kaffa, Sheka and Bench-Maji zones of Ethiopia|Southwest parts of Ethiopia particularly Kaffa, Sheka and Bench-Maji zones are endowed with very diverse and dense natural forests. This favours for the existence of dense honeybee population and production of large volume of honey. However, detail information on honey production systems of the area was lacking. In this study five representative districts were selected and data on beekeeping practice and its major constraints were collected. Traditional beekeeping system is practiced by more than 99% of beekeepers. The average traditional hives owned/household in Masha and Gesha were significantly higher (P
Y50|Betwixt and Between: Turin's CIE - Responses From Authorities|This paper is a supplement to the International University College of Turin's September 2012 report 'Betwixt and Between: Turin's CIE - A Human Rights Iinvestigation into Turin's Immigration Detention Centre' (IUC Research Commons, paper no. 1-12), which considered the findings of an interview-based study of Turin's immigration detention centre in terms of international, European and Italian human rights and migration law. The 'Betwixt and Between' report examined Turin's Centre for Identification and Expulsion (Turin's CIE) by considering both individual and systemic problems faced by detainees, their families and people who have direct contact with Turin's CIE in a professional or voluntary capacity. On 12 November 2012, the researchers met with the Director of Turin's CIE (Italian Red Crossâ€“Military Section) and senior representatives from the 'Questura di Torino â€“ Ufficio Immigrazione'(Police Immigration Office) and Prefettura di Torino (the Italian government's territorial office) in order to conduct a lengthy interview about issues raised in the 'Betwixt and Between' research study. This paper analyses the information received during this interview with the authorities in response to the allegations made by interviewees of the September 2012 'Betwixt and Between' report in relation to conditions of detention inside Turin's CIE and related judicial and legal processes.

Y50|Financial Intermediation and Macroeconomic Analysis|"Understanding phenomena such as the recent financial crisis, and possible policy responses, requires the use of a macroeconomic framework in which financial intermediation matters for the allocation of resources. Neither standard macroeconomic models that abstract from financial intermediation nor traditional models of the ""bank lending channel"" are adequate as a basis for understanding the recent crisis. Instead we need models in which intermediation plays a crucial role, but in which intermediation is modeled in a way that better conforms to current institutional realities. In particular, we need models that recognize that a market-based financial system—one in which intermediaries fund themselves by selling securities in competitive markets, rather than collecting deposits subject to reserve requirements—is not the same as a frictionless system. I sketch the basic elements of an approach that allows financial intermediation and credit frictions to be integrated into macroeconomic analysis in a straightforward way. I show how the model can be used to analyze the macroeconomic consequences of the recent financial crisis and conclude with a discussion of some implications of the model for the conduct of monetary policy."

Y50|Finance éthique : oxymore ou realutopie ? (Ethical financce: oxymoron or realutopie ?)|La crise du credit crunch, au-delà du rideau de fumée de ses aspects techniques, n’est autre qu’un profond déficit d’éthique. De telles crises, cependant, ne sont en rien nouvelles. Le capitalisme s’est édifié et consolidé à partir de l’avènement de crises financières. Chaque fois, comme le décrit le schéma schumpetérien de la destruction créative, un meilleur système s’est instauré, depuis le Banco del Rialto et la Casa di San Giorgio, à la Wisselbank, la Banque d’Angleterre, ou la Federal Reserve. Mais cela n’a pas empêché les folies telles que la Tulipmania ou la bulle de la Compagnie des Mers du Sud, pour n’en citer que quelques unes, situées loin dans le temps. Le modèle conventionnel de l’homo oeconomicus n’est pas à même de nous fournir une explication solide sur l’effet Veblen ou sur les bulles financières. Les économistes, qui recourent à des explications de types vaudou et zombie qu’ils désapprouvent, en disent long sur leurs propres limites. Tout à l’opposé, la très parcimonieuse théorie de René Girard sur le désir mimétique, avec les concepts de médiation externe et interne, est étonnamment convaincante. La médiation externe mène à l’émulation sans violence, qui est spécifique des temps modernes, grâce à l’éthos de confiance. Mais quand la confiance s’estompe, se produit un changement en faveur de la médiation interne, menant à un emballement du système, caractéristique, dans le vocabulaire de Girard, d’une crise sacrificielle. Pour s’y opposer, les réglementations rigides de la realpolitik peuvent proliférer, elles seront pratiquement vaines sans une attitude de Realutopie exigeant davantage d’éthique. Trois buts doivent être atteints : un gouvernement mondial, une monnaie mondiale, le pouvoir aux actionnaires, pas aux managers. Aussi, soyons réalistes, visons l’impossible : l’éthique. The credit crunch crisis, beyond the smokescreen of its technicalities, is but a deep lack of ethics. Such crises, however, are nothing new. Capitalism did build up from the occurrences of financial crises. Each time, as described by the Schumpeterian creative-destruction pattern, a better system was set up, from the Banco del Rialto and the Casa di San Giorgio, to the Wisselbank, the Bank of England, or the Federal Reserve. But this did not prevent such follies as the Tulipmania or the South-Sea Bubble, to name but a few and remote ones. The conventional homo oeconomicus model fails to give us any sound explanation about the Veblen effect or about financial bubbles. Economists reprovingly resorting to voodoo and zombie behaviours as an explanation are just speaking volumes about their own limits. In contrast, René Girard’s eminently parsimonious theory of mimetic desire, with the notions of internal and external mediation, is amazingly convincing. External mediation leads to emulation without violence, which is specific of modern times, thanks to the ethos of confidence. But when confidence fades away, then a shift towards internal mediation happens, leading to a runaway system which typifies a sacrificial crisis in Girard’s parlance. To counter it, stiff realpolitik regulations may proliferate, they would be almost useless without a Realutopie attitude demanding more ethics. Three goals are to be achieved: a world government, a world currency, power to the shareholders, not to the managers. So let us be realistic and look for what is impossible: ethics.

Y50|Le monde selon Girard (The world according to Girard)|L’imitation explique comment et pourquoi, d’un point de vue historique, l’hominisation a eu lieu. Girard soutient que le désir mimétique en soi est propre à mettre à mal toute communauté pré-humaine en ce qu’elle conduit à la rivalité mimétique qui se propage à l’ensemble et aboutit au chaos de la lutte de tous contre tous, rivaux indifférenciés. La théorie mimétique de Girard pose que toute société humaine est issue du meurtre collectif originel d’une victime arbitraire innocente, processus de réconciliation soudaine et inespérée. Ce sacrifice apportant la paix et l’ordre, la différenciation des membres de la communauté est entretenu par des interdits, des rites, des mythes. Les interdits empêchent tout ce qui peut recréer le chaos mimétique. Les mythes sacralisent la victime et escamotent le meurtre collectif humain en attribuant le miracle de la réconciliation à des puissances extra-humaines, les divinités. Les rites sont des cérémonies répétitives qui reproduisent le sacrifice initial à travers des victimes de substitution. A partir de la nécessité vitale de recourir au symbole, c’est-à-dire de la substitution d’une chose par une autre, commence la culture humaine, et notamment le langage. Un cerveau plus grand est un moyen de sélection naturelle si, crise après crise, l’usage de symboles se complexifie. La culture occidentale a apporté une révolution radicale car le message judéo-chrétien s’est graduellement rangé du côté du « bouc émissaire », en signifiant son innocence. Ce faisant, il a dédivinisé le monde, ouvrant la voie à l’émulation à tout-va avec pour effet un progrès formidable par l’innovation depuis trois siècles. Mais du même coup, la violence mimétique prend de l’ampleur et semble immaîtrisable, l’éthique, seul moyen désormais de la contenir, n’étant apparemment pas à la hauteur. L’apocalypse est-elle proche ? Imitation explains how and why, historically, humanization took place. Girard holds that mimetic desire per se is likely to jeopardize any pre-human community as it would lead to mimetic rivalry, a contagious process that quickly snowballs to end up into the chaos of a struggle of all against all, as undifferentiated rivals. Girard’s mimetic theory has it that any human society is stemming from an original collective murder of an innocent arbitrary victim, as a sudden and unexpected reconciliation process. As this sacrifice brings peace and order, the differentiation of the community members is maintained through taboos, rites and myths. Taboos forbid anything that could lead again to mimetic chaos. Myths make the victim sacred and conceal the fundamental collective murder in attributing the miracle of reconciliation to some extra-human powers, divinities. Rites repeatedly reenact the original sacrifice through a substitute victim. From this vital necessity to symbolize, that is to replace one thing by another, starts human culture, and among its main traits, language. A bigger brain is a way of natural selection if, crisis after crisis, the use of symbols is sophisticating. Western culture has brought a radical revolution as the judaic-christian message has taken sides, gradually meaning that the “scapegoat” is innocent. By so doing, it has “dedivinized” the world, paving the way to open emulation resulting into a fantastic progress through innovation since the last three centuries. But by the same token, mimetic violence is gathering momentum and seems unstoppable, ethics, by now the only way to prevent it, being apparently no match. Is apocalypse near?
Y50|The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) in the Nineties: An Example of Incremental Innovations in an Ongoing Longitudinal Study|The main aim of the present paper is to historically reappraise the development of the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) in the 1990s after the first six waves had been collected. This development was closely connected to the opening of the Iron Curtain in Eastern Europe and the fall of the Wall separating the two German states. In addition to its relevance for the SOEP, this study is also of interest in relation to the contemporary history of science.
