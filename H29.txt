H29|Subvention du capital agricole des femmes et inÃ©galitÃ©s de genre au Burkina Faso|Sub-Saharan African countries have a strong presence of women in agriculture, but women have limited access to productive agricultural resources. This paper analyzes the potential impacts of a 30% subsidy on women's capital in agriculture in Burkina Faso. It makes use of a computable general equilibrium model. The results indicate that the modernization of agriculture frees the female labor force from agriculture to non-agricultural activities such as agribusiness, catering, and textiles. This leads to a fall in unemployment for women (-0.24%) than for men (-0.16%). In addition, the subsidy policy increases women's income (+ 0.33%) more than men's (+ 0.02%). Finally, the agricultural capital subsidy for women (men) is more effective in terms of reducing gender inequalities (GDP growth) respectively.
H29|The media coverage of wealth and inheritance taxation in Germany|Based on the political economy of the media perspective, this paper explores the media coverage of wealth and inheritance taxation over the early 21st century (2000 to 2018) based on a large-scale corpus of seven German daily and weekly newspapers. Germany is a useful case study, being one of the most unequal countries in the Eurozone area in terms of wealth inequality. Drawing on text mining methods and corpus linguistics, it shows that wealth and inheritance taxation is a relatively infrequent topic over the entire period, with the exception of a few intense months of increased reporting. On the occasions that the media do report on the topic of wealth and inheritance taxation, it is mainly covered in terms of a political debate. This debate centres on the politics of a possible reform process and the connected difficulties of finding compromise between different actors, rather than focussing on the potential economic impact. Furthermore, this paper explores the power of agents (both on the organisational and individual level) as the primary definers of social reality. It shows that market-liberal and conservative organisations and economists dominate the news over social-democratic and left-wing ones. Overall, the findings indicate a hostile news coverage concerning the introduction of wealth taxation and the increase of inheritance tax.
H29|Reaganomics: A Historical Watershed|The socio-economic impact of Reaganomics and its long-run deleterious legacy is documented. The preponderance of data indicate that economic growth was not particularly impressive in the wake of the tax cuts of 1981 or 1986. GDP did snap back to potential but failed to accelerate beyond the rates achieved in prior or subsequent decades. The supposed incentives of supply-side economics failed to materialize. People did not work more, they did not save or invest more than they did before, and the benefits trickled down like molasses and got stuck at the very top of the income distribution. Instead, Reagan’s presidency was a watershed in U.S. economic development in the sense that it reversed many of the accomplishments of the New Deal and inaugurated an era in which low-skilled men’s wages began a long period of decline, and labor’s share of GDP continued to fall. Reagan’s true legacy is a dual economy that accompanied the hollowing out of the middle class, a more business-friendly regulatory and oversight framework for Wall Street that ultimately led to the financial crisis, a stupendous increase in the national debt from 30% to 50% of GDP that put it on a path such that by 2012 it exceeded 100%, anti-statism that contributed to the rise of Trumpism, a remarkable rise in inequality that gave rise to an oligarchy, and the benign neglect of blue-collar workers who eventually became Hillary Clinton’s “deplorables.” Reagan put the economy on a trajectory to ultimately, even if not inevitably, led to the triumph of Trumpism and an economy of malaise.
H29|Sostenibilidad de la deuda pública en Colombia|Este artículo presenta un análisis sobre la sostenibilidad de la deuda pública en Colombia para el periodo 2012-2016. Se procede en dos partes: la primera corresponde al estado del arte en esta materia, se incluye una serie de definiciones y distinciones clave, así como los elementos relevantes de la teoría económica —siendo el criterio de sostenibilidad de Blanchard (1990) el indicador más importante—. Al mismo tiempo, se presentan las disposiciones jurídicas que enmarcan el manejo de la deuda por parte del Estado. Adicionalmente, se muestra que la trayectoria de la deuda impacta no sólo las finanzas públicas, sino que también afecta la desigualdad y los objetivos de crecimiento y desarrollo del país. La segunda parte expone la evidencia empírica. Se centra en la discusión de los elementos macroeconómicos y sociopolíticos que han incidido en la dinámica de la deuda durante este periodo. Para ello, se incorpora una simulación de largo plazo del organismo de control y se plantea que la sostenibilidad requiere, más allá del cumplimiento de los criterios de teoría económica —particularmente el de Blanchard— de una serie de decisiones políticas en torno a la estructura tributaria y productiva del país, en relación con los objetivos de crecimiento y desarrollo económico. Para finalizar, se introduce una serie de conclusiones que permiten sintetizar los hallazgos presentados y servir de insumo para las discusiones de política económica que se requieren en torno al manejo responsable y sostenible de la deuda.
H29|Earnings Management, Effective Tax Rate (Etr) And Book-Tax Gap (Btg)|Objective – This research examines the effect of company size, changes in out-cash flow, return on assets, conservatism, and profit levelling on earnings management. Methodology/Technique – The results of this research show that banking capital structure, capital intensity, intensity of inventory, and intensity of R & D have a significant impact on effective tax rates. Further, the results also show that, with respect to the non-banking sector, R & D expenditure contributes significantly to effective tax rates. Simultaneously, earnings management and effective tax rates, as well as other factors, also have an effect on book tax gap. Findings – This study shows that profit management has a significantly positive effect on book tax gap, and effective tax rates has a significant negative effects o book tax gap. In terms of the non-banking sector, earnings management and effective tax rate have no effect on book tax gap. Deferred tax expenses have a lower capability to detect earnings management than accrual, in both the banking and non-banking sector. Novelty – The study of management capabilities optimizes the role of book tax gap and effective tax rate for earning management. Both tax management and earnings management are closely related to behavior management in managing a company based on the agency theory. Furthermore, the study identifies a relationship between earnings management and book tax gap
H29|Opportunistic Behavior, External Monitoring Mechanisms, Corporate Governance, and Earnings Management|Objective - The purpose of this research is to analyze the effect of motivational bonus, leverage, firm size, corporate governance (audit committee's size, the proportion of independent commissioners, institutional ownership, managerial ownership) and free cash flow on earnings management. Methodology/Techniques - Earnings management is analyzed in this research using the modified Jones model. The population for the research consists of manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) between 2013-2015. The final sample includes 60 manufacturing companies. Findings - The result of this study indicate that motivational bonus, leverage, firm size and free cash flow have an influence on earnings management practices. Motivational bonuses and free cash flow as opportunistic behavior also influence earnings management. In addition, leverage and firm size as external monitoring mechanism influence earnings management practices while audit committee size, the proportion of independent commissioners, institutional ownership and managerial ownership as corporate governance practices in companies has no significant effect on earnings management practices. Hence, it is concluded that corporate governance has no effect on earnings management practices in Indonesia.
H29|The Impact of Inheritance and Transfer Taxation on Economic Behaviors and Inequality: a Literature Review for France|No abstract is available for this item.
H29|Redistribution in Whose Favor? Preferences with Regard to Nationality and Type of Beneficiaries|In this paper, we elicit preferences for the allocation of income redistribution to different uses through a Discrete Choice Experiment performed with a representative sample of Swiss citizens. The total desired amount of income redistribution is estimated as a share of disposable income. Further, we estimate marginal willingness-to-pay values for recipients' nationalities (Swiss, citizens of western European countries, citizens of other countries) as well as their types (old-age pensioners, people with ill health, the unemployed, working poor, and families with children). Swiss citizens are found to have a positive willingness to pay for a reallocation of social expenditure in favor of themselves or Western European citizens to the detriment of citizens of other countries, who are perceived to be culturally distant.
H29|Grundsteuerreform und Gleichmäßigkeit der Besteuerung|Die Grundsteuer muss aufgrund höchstrichterlicher Rechtsprechung reformiert werden, da die veralteten Einheitswerte dem Gebot einer gleichmäßigen Besteuerung nicht genügen. Aufgrund der rund 35 Mio. zu bewertenden Grundstücke sind einfache standardisierte Bewertungsverfahren unerlässlich. Jedoch sind die vor allem mit dem Argument der Einfachheit ins Spiel gebrachten flächenorientierten Verfahren nicht geeignet, die Einheitsbewertung abzulösen, da sie ähnlich eklatant wie die Einheitsbewertung gegen das Gebot der Gleichmäßigkeit der Besteuerung verstoßen. Deutlich besser schneiden einfach gestaltete wertorientierte Verfahren ab, die jedoch grundstücksartabhängig ausgestaltet werden müssen. Bei vermieteten Grundstücken (Mietwohngrundstücken) bewirkt das Abstellen auf Mietwerte (Mietwertmodell) die besten Bewertungsergebnisse. Bei selbstgenutzten Immobilien (Ein- und Zweifamilienhäuser) führt das erbschaftsteuerliche Vergleichswertverfahren zu den besten Ergebnissen. Jedoch kann dieses Verfahren auf eine Vielzahl von Ein- und Zweifamilienhäuser nicht angewendet werden, so dass hierfür ein Ersatzverfahren notwendig ist. Hier bietet sich, der Not eines einfach zu handhabenden Verfahrens gehorchend, das Kostenwertmodell an. Aber selbst bei den am besten wirkenden Verfahren streuen die Bewertungsergebnisse merklich. Selbst Fehlbewertungen von mehr als 35% sind in zahlreichen Fällen hinzunehmen. Andernfalls muss auf die Erhebung einer Grundsteuer verzichtet werden.
H29|Carga y estructura tributaria en Chile: comparación con países OCDE|Uno de los argumentos utilizados para justificar la reforma tributaria de 2014, que se espera recaude 3 puntos porcentuales del PIB, fue que Chile tenía una carga tributaria inferior a la de la gran mayoría de los países de la OCDE (Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económico), por lo que era razonable aumentarla, más aún en vista de que se requería recursos para financiar programas sociales adicionales. En este trabajo se compara la carga tributaria y la estructura de dicha carga en Chile y en el resto de los países de la OCDE. La comparación se hace para cuando las naciones tenían un ingreso per cápita similar al chileno actual. La conclusión básica es que la carga tributaria en Chile post reforma tributaria será similar (un punto del PIB menor) a la de la mediana de esos países cuando tenían un nivel de desarrollo similar al chileno. También se analiza la estructura de la carga tributaria. Se concluye que la recaudación por impuesto a las utilidades de las empresas en Chile es elevada en relación al resto de los países de la OCDE, que la recaudación por el impuesto al ingreso de las personas es baja y que en términos de impuesto a los bienes y servicios la recaudación es similar. Se discuten algunas hipótesis sobre la razón por la cual la recaudación del impuesto al ingreso personal es tan baja en nuestro país (la menor entre los 35 naciones). Se concluye que la principal razón es que el mínimo exento en Chile es relativamente alto. En efecto, mientras en la mediana de los países de la OCDE los individuos comienzan a pagar impuestos cuando su ingreso es alrededor de un 30% del ingreso mediano de su respectivo país, en Chile lo hacen cuando su ingreso llega a 180% de dicho ingreso mediano. Finalmente, se debe destacar que una discusión sobre el nivel y la estructura óptima de la carga tributaria excede el propósito de esta nota. Lo aquí planteado sólo pretende ser una comparación de niveles y estructuras bajo condiciones similares de desarrollo, junto con una explicación del porqué algunas diferencias en las estructuras tributarias de Chile y el resto de los países de la OCDE.
H29|Goods and Services Tax and Kerala Economy|GST has become a reality in India. GST is a comprehensive tax regime which heralds not only the dawn of a new era in the tax realm of the country, but also it ushers in a ‘behavioural change’ in the transactions that happen in the economy. Many countries have embraced GST as an efficient and profitable indirect tax system. GST bestows many benefits on economies in the form increasing indirect tax proceeds and enhancing the efficiency in economic activities. This paper discusses the pros and cons of implementing GST in India with special emphasis on Kerala Economy.
H29|Tax corruption and private sector development in Vietnam|This article aims to examine the impact of tax corruption on private sector development in Vietnam. It is motivated by two separate but related considerations. First, despite the seriousness of the phenomenon of corruption, there is a paucity of rigorous empirical research of corruption, particularly tax corruption, in Vietnam. Secondly, ineffective control of corruption is viewed as a cause of Vietnam’s recent total factor productivity (TFP) slowdown or its poor industrial policy, both of which may hamper Vietnam’s progress as a low middle-income country. Without some understanding on the impact of tax corruption on the economy, it may not be possible to devise the most effective anti-corruption policy and measures. After a brief literature review that focuses on tax corruption, various conceptual issues relating to tax corruption are discussed and clarified. The extent of petty tax corruption in Vietnam is then discussed, followed by a review of findings and implications of recent studies on how tax corruption impacts on private sector development in Vietnam. Despite perceptions and evidence of widespread petty tax corruption, Vietnam ranks very highly both in terms of tax collection and tax effort.Not unexpectedly, the impact of tax corruption is mixed in the sense that empirical evidence lends credence to both 'sanding the wheels' and 'greasing the wheels' hypotheses. Finally, some broad policy recommendations for combating tax corruption are offered.
H29|Revenue for EMU: A Contribution to the Debate on Fiscal Union|In the wake of the euro area crisis, the debate on instruments to deepen economic integration among its members has intensified, among others putting forward a fiscal stabilization capacity for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) members. Contributions made so far to further this idea have mostly concentrated on the expenditure side and possible stabilization properties. This analysis reviews the most important proposals and discusses design choices and institutional conditions to develop the revenue side of such a fiscal instrument.
H29|Las crisis económicas y el escenario político en la introducción de reformas tributarias. La experiencia argentina (1980-2010) y una constatación para Latinoamérica|Este artículo analiza las reformas tributarias en Argentina entre 1980 y 2010, con base en las circunstancias económicas y políticas que las acompañaron. Se establece cómo las crisis económicas y la posición de poder político del Gobierno inciden en el tipo de reformas que se promueven; el estudio muestra que en épocas de recesión se favorece el aumento del IVA, aunque ello está limitado por las condiciones que exhibe el escenario político en que se discuten las iniciativas legislativas. Además, este artículo presenta una constatación empírica que va más allá del caso argentino e incorpora a veinte países de América Latina y el Caribe, para identificar con sustento estadístico qué factores inciden en la aprobación de reformas que aumentan el IVA y los impuestos sobre la renta. ***** This paper analyses tax reforms in Argentina between 1980 and 2010 based on economic and political circumstances that accompanied them. It sets out how the economic crisis and the government’s position regarding its political power affect the kinds of reforms that are promoted; the study shows that in times of recession VAT increases are favoured, although this is limited by the conditions of the political scene in which legislative initiatives are discussed. Additionally, the paper presents an empirical exercise that goes beyond the Argentine case, incorporating twenty countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, with statistical support to identify the factors that influence the adoption of reforms that raise VAT and income taxes.
H29|How uncertain are economic policies? New evidence from a firm survey|This study, using data from an original survey covering both public and private firms in Japan, presents evidence on uncertainties over economic policies, their effects on managerial decisions, and firms’ evaluations of the government’s numerical targets related to economic policies. The results indicate that Japanese firms perceive uncertainty over certain economic policies, such as the social security system, tax policy, fiscal expenditure, and international trade policy. Policy uncertainties have substantial effects on managerial decisions, especially on equipment investment and hiring of regular employees. Medium- to long-term numerical targets related to the government’s economic policies are perceived to be difficult to achieve.
H29|Optimal tax structure and public expenditure composition in a simple model of endogenous growth|In this paper, using an endogenous growth model where the structural relationship between public expenditures and taxes is considered, we investigate how the optimal tax structure is determined by public spending structure. Public spending provides two public goods, public service and public capital that impact production, the former as a flow, the latter as a stock, and these can be financed by flat rate taxes on consumption and income. Our theoretical model suggests that the optimal tax structure is equivalent to the public spending composition. Our numerical example provides a further proof for the theoretical propositions.
H29|Taxes and international risk sharing|We extend a standard model of international risk sharing to include an empirically plausible distortion: Taxes. The tax-inclusive theory implies, even under full risk sharing, a predictable relationship between consumption growth and the consumption and capital income tax rates, both within and across countries. We find strong empirical evidence in favor of this relationship. While idiosyncratic output fluctuations account for substantially more of cross-country consumption growth variability than do taxes, trends in tax differentials are found to be informative about the dynamic evolution of international risk sharing. In particular, adjusting for capital taxes reveals a marked improvement in risk sharing over the last three decades that is absent in baseline measures. This improvement has been driven by the convergence of average tax rates on capital income across OECD countries toward the United States average capital tax rate.
H29|Economic Effects From Change In Tourism Policy On An Island Economy|Taiwanese government adjusted its tourism policy toward Chinese people in 2008, hoping it would enhance its economic prosperity and create the employment. Motivated the economic effects generated by the relaxation of the policy were unclear, we have employed both the industry-related spillover model to examine the economic scale and the number of persons employed created, and to investigate the extent of the effect. Our findings were that the economic spillover effects were brief and transient. Nonetheless, it could overcome Taiwanâ€™s economic challenges. Only through the sustainable management of the tourism-related industry could long-term economic effects be created
H29|2014-2015 tax changes in EU Member States vs the Commission’s tax policy recommendations|At first glance, it would seem that in recent years the tax changes adopted by EU Member States have diverged from the European Commission’s tax policy recommendations. Member States generally appear to go no further than making minor changes to existing tax rules. The Commission, on the other hand, recommends far broader reforms designed to help tax systems meet the challenges raised by the current economic crisis. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to monitor this situation, and to offer an overall picture of the 2014-2015 tax changes made by European Union Member States. Furthermore, we shall be discussing the EU’s 2015 tax policy recommendations to Member States. By doing so we are in a position to affirm that the said divergence appears to exist, and we offer a number of observations regarding this result.
H29|From Dual to Unified Employment Protection: Transition and Steady State|This paper analyses the optimal design of a single open-ended contract (SOEC) and studies the political economy of moving towards such a SOEC in a labour market where employment protection is highly discontinuous. We develop a computationally tractable approach to compare two economic environments: one with a large employment protection gap after a short tenure, and another one with a SOEC featuring a smooth tenure profile. For illustrative purposes, we specialise the discussion of such choices to Spain, a country often considered as an epitome of a labour market with dual employment protection. We show that a SOEC has the potential of bringing substantial improvements in equilibrium allocations and welfare. We provide estimates for the eligibility rule and tenure profile of the optimal SOEC, defined as the contract maximising the steady-state lifetime utility of new labour-market entrants. Finally, we use the model to identify winners and losers among younger and older workers in the transitional path of such a reform, and evaluate its political support.
H29|Tax Stories from South Anatolia|In this research, the data obtained from the oral history interviews with both sides â€“ tax payer peasants and tax collectors â€“ are used to interpret how tax relations work and how this process is perceived by the tax payer. Based on the idea that nicknames might offer a more realistic framework in this sense, the nicknames given to tax collectors, such as RÄ±za of the Cliff (UÃ§urumlu RÄ±za), Mustafa the Angel (Melek Mustafa), the Slender Tyrant (Ä°nce ZalÄ±m), and the Black/Yellow Hell (Kara/SarÄ± Cehennem), are believed to be a representative of the relationship between both parties. Never published before in another medium, the story of SÃ¼leyman, the Butcher (Kasap SÃ¼leyman) is also hereby introduced into field literature.
H29|The Impact Of Globalization On The Characteristics Of Tax Systems Of The European Countries|In the international literature, a great number of studies have sought to determine the relationship between the characteristics of the national tax systems and globalization. Most of the research was conducted to prove the impact of the tax system on the competitiveness of the national economy, in order to give a clear recommendation for how economic and fiscal policy should create a stimulating economic background and enable greater involvement of the national economy in international flows. However, the process can be viewed from the reverse perspective, in the sense that the process of globalization and international competition can shape the characteristics of national tax systems. This paper aims to determine by empirical evidence the impact of the process of globalization and international competition on the characteristics of taxation in observed European countries.
H29|Taxes And Entrepreneurship In Oecd Countries|" type=""main"" xml:id=""coep12079-abs-0001""> I examine how taxes and tax progressivity affect two different types of entrepreneurship—established business ownership and nascent entrepreneurship—in a large group of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, using 2000–2009 macro-level Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data. Empirical evidence from Arellano-Bond generalized method of moments estimation suggests that higher tax progressivity exerts a negative influence on nascent enterprises but appears to have no impact on established business ownership. Changes in marginal and average tax rates are found to have no significant influence on either type of entrepreneurship. The most important contribution of the article is the comparison of tax impacts on actual and nascent entrepreneurship rates. (JEL H24, H29, M13, M19)"
H29|Moving Towards a Single Labor Contract: Transition vs. Steady State|This paper analyzes the optimal design of a single open-ended contract (SOEC) and studies the political economy of moving towards such a SOEC in a dual labour market. We compare two economic environments: one with flexible entry-level jobs and high employment protection at long tenure, and another with a SOEC featuring employment protection levels that increase smoothly with tenure. For illustrative purposes, we specialize the discussion of such choices to Spain. A SOEC has the potential of bringing big time efficiency and welfare gains in a steady-state sense. We also identify winners and losers in the transitional path of such a reform and analyze its political support.
H29|Salience of carbon taxes in the gasoline market|We demonstrate that the carbon tax imposed by the Canadian province of British Columbia caused a decline in short-run gasoline demand that is significantly greater than would be expected from an equivalent increase in the market price of gasoline. That the carbon tax is more salient, or yields a larger change in demand than equivalent market price movements, is robust to a range of specifications. As a result of the large consumer response to the tax, we calculate that during its first four years, the tax reduced carbon dioxide emissions from gasoline consumption by 2.4 million tonnes.
H29|The Taxation Effects of Tourism Under Aviation Deregulation in a Small Open Economy|In the past four years, Chinese touristsâ€™ consumption in Taiwan has contributed to the Taiwanese economy. However, there is a limited literature documenting the actual tax effects under the aviation deregulation. Based on the models established by Leontief (1966) and Miyazawa (2002) and by adding the effective tax rate, which is employed by the Japan National Tourism Organization (2010), the present study measures the indirect tax, the personal income tax, and the corporate income tax resulting from the change in the transport policy. This allows us to get better understanding the tax effects of the change in a transport policy. The empirical results show that the total tax revenue of the aviation deregulation generated for US$1,047.3164 million, equivalent to the total tax revenue of 1.78% in 2011 in a small open economy. The indirect tax revenue, the personal income tax revenue and the corporate income tax revenue accounted for 0.76%, 0.81%, 0.21%, respectively. As for the industrial sector, the tax revenue from the service-related industry is US$939.7126 million, which accounts for up to 89.73% of the total tax revenue under the aviation deregulation.
H29|When it comes to container port efficiency, are all developing regions equal?|In this paper we carry out a container port performance analysis of the developing world between 2000 and 2010, using both parametric and nonparametric approaches. From a unique dataset – our sample covers 70 developing countries, 203 ports, and 1750 data points–, we examine the evolution and drivers of productivity and efficiency changes across developing regions. We show that productivity growth rates between 2000 and 2010 vary significantly and that this heterogeneity is explained by pure efficiency changes rather than scale efficiency of technological changes. Therefore, we carry out a detailed efficiency analysis to determine the drivers of port efficiency. Time series results show an upward trend for port efficiency in developing regions, as it increased from 51 percent in 2000 to 61 percent in 2010. Our analysis indicates that private sector participation, the reduction of corruption in the public sector, improvements in liner connectivity and the existence of multimodal links increase the level of port efficiency in developing regions.
H29|Should Fines Depend on Income? A Questionnaire Study on Values and Institutions|How do we make sense of the cross-country heterogeneity in value judgments emerging from international surveys? Our study suggests that the answer needs to go beyond the adaptation of values to existing institutions and should tap into deeper beliefs. In our case, Finnish respondents do support their country´s system of income-dependent fines more strongly than respondents in countries using a fixed fine system. However, they also hold different beliefs on the relationship between income and well-being and hence on the burdens imposed by fining offenders at different income levels. A further illustration is provided in the context of income taxation.
H29|Improving Taxes and Transfers in Australia|Getting tax and transfer systems to efficiently deliver sufficient revenues to achieve macroeconomic targets, address goals in re-distribution and social welfare, encourage employment, accommodate business-competitiveness concerns and incorporate environmental issues is difficult. In Australia, slowing economic growth in the wake of the mining boom has sharpened the trade-offs and brought into focus the importance of encouraging broad-based advances in employment and productive capacity while also dealing with other long-term challenges, in particular population ageing and greenhouse-gas emission reduction. This review particularly recommends shifting away from income taxation to indirect taxation, for instance by raising more revenue from the Goods and Services Tax. The report also advises caution in some recent welfare-reform proposals, and advocates broad support for business rather than targeted subsidies and other forms of corporate welfare. As regards environmental policies, the report comments on the proposed Emission Reduction Fund for reducing greenhouse gases and supports reform to vehicle-related taxation. This Working Paper relates to the 2014 OECD Economic Survey of Australia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-australia.htm). Améliorer le système de prélèvements et de prestations en Australie Il n’est pas facile de faire en sorte que le système de prélèvements et de prestations dégage suffisamment de recettes pour atteindre les objectifs de politique macroéconomique, de redistribution et de bien-être social, encourage la création d’emplois, réponde aux préoccupations de compétitivité des entreprises et contribue à relever les défis environnementaux. En Australie, le ralentissement de la croissance économique à la suite du boom minier a accentué les arbitrages et mis en lumière l’importance d’encourager de larges progrès en matière d’emploi et de capacités productives, tout en relevant d’autres défis à long terme, comme le vieillissement démographique et la réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre. Cet examen recommande en particulier de se détourner de l’imposition des revenus au profit de la fiscalité indirecte, par exemple en augmentant les recettes provenant de la taxe sur les produits et services. Le rapport met également en garde concernant certaines propositions récentes de réforme du système de protection sociale, et préconise un large soutien aux entreprises plutôt que des subventions ciblées et d’autres formes d’aide sociale aux entreprises. S’agissant des politiques d’environnement, le rapport formule des observations sur le projet de Fonds pour la réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre et appuie la réforme de la taxation des véhicules. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE de l'Australie, 2014 (www.oecd.org/fr/economie/etude-economique-australie.htm.).
H29|Importance Of Tax Revenue Concerning Budgets Of Local And Regional Self-Government Units|Since its independence the Republic of Croatia has commenced a thorough reconstruction of its taxation system according to the market economy taxation policy. Essential taxation reforms have brought the system closer to EU systems i.e. it has been being harmonized with taxation systems of developed European countries. The tax systems of modern countries are using a large number of tax forms, which differs from country to country. The Republic of Croatia has adopted solutions that are used by the majority of European countries. Current tax system of the Republic of Croatia can be viewed through three fiscal levels, but this paper deals with revenue, especially tax revenue of local and regional selfgovernment units. The paper will present importance and a way of collecting revenue, especially tax revenue and satisfying public needs in terms of counties, cities and municipalities.
H29|Research, Development And Innovations In Czech Manufacture Of Electronic Products|The paper deals with the topic of research and development investments and its use in small and medium-sized enterprises SME’s operating in the electronic industry. The aim of the article is to find out the impact of innovation activities on enterprises, especially the influence of the sources of funding for the research activity. The Czech Republic is the geographic segment to be explored. A chapter on theoretical issues is followed by a description of the current situation in the Czech Republic and abroad, and access to legal support for research and development in the business sector. Primary data collected from a survey are analysed in the analytical part. The statistical data processing was done using Statistica 12 software. Some SME’s of chosen group of manufacturing industry focus on research and development performed by their own means, and they searched for the possibility of financing the research from various sources.
H29|R&D tax incentives in industry: empirical study among small and medium electronics manufacturing enterprises|The paper deals with the topic of direct and indirect support for research and development and its use in small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the electronic industry. The Czech Republic is the geographic segment to be explored. A chapter on theoretical issues is followed by a description of the current situation in the Czech Republic and abroad and access to legal support for research and development in the business sector. Primary data collected from a survey are analysed in the analytical part. Some small and medium-sized enterprises of chosen group of manufacturing industry focus on research and development performed by they own means and they searched the possibility of financing the research from various sources. The initiative of these enterprises increase considerably their competitiveness in the global market and they realize the necessity of the innovation policy in the strategic management of the business, but still they do not make full use of all available supports in research and development from public sources and instruments of fiscal policy, which allows the legislation of the Czech Republic.
H29|Norm for redistribution, social capital, and perceived tax burden: comparison between highand low-income households|This paper explores how a perceived tax burden is influenced by the degree that neighbors prefer income redistribution. Further, this paper investigates how the influence of neighbors is affected by the degree of interaction between neighbors. For these purposes, individual-level data and place of residence data were combined. After controlling for individual characteristics, I obtained the following key findings: people are more likely to perceive the amount of tax as low when neighbors are more likely to support redistribution policies. Further, this neighbor effect increases when community participation rates are high. This tendency is clearly observed in high-income groups but not in low-income groups. This implies that the norm for redistribution leads rich people to consider the tax burden as low. Further, the effect of the norm increases when there is a greater accumulation of social capital within a residential area.
H29|Tax Policy and Food Security|We build a two sector (agriculture and manufacturing) heterogenous agent model to analyze the effects of a food subsidy program on output and prices. The government may finance this subsidy by levying a distortionary income tax or a tax on manufacturing consumption. We find that in the long run the program increases the food output but lowers the manufacturing output, in both methods of its financing. While the price of food crop relative to the price of manufacturing good falls with subsidies in the income tax regime, the effect is opposite in the consumption tax regime. We also find that the food subsidy program may have long-run welfare gains for the two agents, but only for a certain range of subsidies. However, our simulations suggest that there is no subsidies which benefit both agents at the same time. Further, financing this program using an indirect consumption tax is a Pareto improvement over the direct income tax regime.
H29|Internet and taxation in European Union|The purpose of this paper is to offer a primer on certain important features and issues concerning Internet and taxation in the European Union. After a general introduction concerning the origins of the matter, the paper discusses why a tax on the huge profits made by the big US digital MNEs in Europe was not substantially reflected in the tax policy of EU members, notwithstanding the large tax gap among EU countries resulting from the shift in profits by the (US digital) MNE towards lower or no taxation countries. Then the main directives on Internet and taxation introduced by the EU (and also by the OECD) since the late 1990s are discussed: the EU especially focusses on establishing the due place of taxation on electronic commerce, while the OECD (more recently together with the G20) has placed the emphasis on regulating Transfer Prices and contrasting Base Erosion and Profits’ Shifting (BEPS).
H29|The dynamics of public investment under persistent electoral advantage|This paper studies the effects of asymmetries in re-election probabilities across parties on public policy and their subsequent propagation to the economy. The struggle between groups that disagree on targeted public spending (e.g., pork) results in governments being endogenously short-sighted: Systematic underinvestment in infrastructure and overspending on targeted goods arise, above and beyond what is observed in symmetric environments. Because the party enjoying an electoral advantage is less short-sighted, it devotes a larger proportion of revenues to productive investment. Hence, political turnover induces economic fluctuations in an otherwise deterministic environment. I characterize analytically the long-run distribution of allocations and show that output increases with electoral advantage, despite the fact that governments expand. Volatility is non-monotonic in electoral advantage and is an additional source of inefficiency. Using panel data from US states I confirm these findings. (Copyright: Elsevier)
H29|Un modelo de elección de medidas tributarias. El caso de América Latina|Este artículo presenta un modelo que supone la racionalidad de los políticos y gobernantes cuando fijan las tasas de impuestos de renta y de consumo de cada contribuyente, y sugiere que esas decisiones dependen del tamaño y la movilidad política de los grupos de votantes y de sus expectativas sobre las condiciones económicas, entre otros factores, lo que ayuda a explicar las reformas regresivas adoptadas en América Latina durante las crisis económicas desde los años ochenta. Además, contrasta el modelo con un panel de datos no balanceado de 18 países para el periodo 1980-2010.
H29|Fight Against Tax Competition in the EU and the Effects of Tax Policies Implemented in the EU During the 2008 Global Financial Crisis on Tax Competition|Globalized economy has brought about many economic and political problems in both national and international fields. One of the most significant results of globalization is that it has removed boundaries and reduced time and space related costs preventing international capital from moving towards areas where it can increase its value. This change, which is positive considering revaluation and profit increase in global capital, has caused normlessness and led to a process blocking international competition, which may most of the time result in national and international economic crises. Countries have, thus, started to introduce tax policies that would attract global capital. This problem has conceptually been handled in fiscal literature as international tax competition. Recently its harmful aspects have also been included in the discussions. In this context, national authorities as well as international institutions such as European Union and OECD have been working on projects to prevent harmful tax competition. Yet, globalization and financialization of economy have made countries more dependent on international capital. It is conflicting that countries are making new regulations to prevent harmful tax competitions while they are also creating an environment where they can promote global capital to avoid possible financial crises. This conflict was clearly observed in European Union during the 2008 global crisis. This study reveals the conflict between tax policies applied by EU to overcome the 2008 global financial crisis and the works intended for preventing harmful tax competition in EU.
H29|Public Opinions in Obesity Tax: A Field Research in Turkey (Obezite Vergisine İlişkin Halkın Düşünceleri: Türkiye’de Bir Alan Araştırması)|"The threat generated by obesity is increasing in terms of health of both individuals and society day by day. States are using different tools in fighting against this threat. One of these tools is taxing obesity. In fighting against obesity, in order to protect health, while there are tax proposals and practices in different names and subjects, Obesity Tax"" is used as a generic name. We conducted a field questionnaire study applied all around Turkey, in order to measure the public opinion related with ""Obesity Tax"" that probably would be applied in Turkey. In this paper it is determined that public believe the necessity of fighting obesity; however, this struggle must be based on non-tax instruments because they have concern the tax might be applied for the fiscal purposes. According to results of the study, we offer specifically to the policy makers that regulative, public supported, efficient and unique “Obesity Tax” must be implemented, but, such tax revenues must be spent for fighting against obesity or subsidies for healthy products."

H29|Exploratory Panel Data Evidence on the Relative Efficacy of Real Federal as Opposed to Real State Cigarette Excise Taxes in Reducing Cigarette Smoking in the United States|Within the context of the fixed-effects model, this study uses a2002-2007state-levelpanel dataset of the United States to investigate the relative effectiveness of real (constant-dollar) federal cigarette excise taxation versus real (constant-dollar) state cigarette excise taxation in reducing cigarette smoking in the United States. The empirical estimates in this study find that each of two aggregate measures of the extent of cigarette smoking, namely, the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per capita annually and the percentage of the population classified as smokers, is a decreasing function of both the federal cigarette excise tax and the state cigarette excise tax. However, it is also found that a given percentage increase in there all federal excise tax has a much greater negative impact on both the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per capita annually and the magnitude of the percentage of the population classified as smokers than does an equal percentage increase in the real state cigarette excise tax.
H29|Does the Presence of Very Young Children and/or Older Minor-aged Children in the Home Reduce Cigarette Smoking? Panel Data Evidence for the United States|Within the context of the Period Fixed-Effects Model, this study of cigarette consumption in the US uses a state-level panel dataset to investigate a new hypothesis. This hypothesis argues that the presence in the home of minor-aged children, that is, children under 18 years of age, reduces the percentage of the population that smokes cigarettes. The eclectic model includes the levels of federal plus state cigarette excise taxation along with a number of other established explanatory variables. The empirical estimates in this preliminary study find support for the hypothesis proffered here, that is, it is found that the percentage of the population that smokes cigarettes is a decreasing function of the percentage of households with minor-aged children residing in the home. Moreover, aside from providing further insight into smoker behaviour, the results from this study also raise the question that since this phenomenon has been ignored in previous related studies involving such public policies as cigarette taxation and cigarette smoking bans that those studies may suffer from omitted variable bias.

H29|Vergi Mükelleflerinin Vergi Denetimi Algıları: Çorum Örneği|The basic economic theory of tax compliance deals with the question ‘why taxpayers pay taxes’. But a psychological tax contract explains tax complaince as an interaction between tax payers and the tax authority.

This study aims to examine the hypothesis of psychological tax contract by using a survey which is applied to members of Çorum Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
H29|A Study on R&D Tax Incentives - Final report|Investment in research and innovation plays a critical role in kick-starting smart growth and upgrading the competitiveness of European companies. In the post-crisis world, Europe needs innovation more than ever before to keep up with the rapid technology advances and growing global competition. R&D tax incentives are an important innovation policy tool widely used in Europe. In some countries, during the crisis, tax instruments have become increasingly important for stimulating private R&D than direct funding. The recent study conducted jointly by DG TAXUD and DG GROW finds fiscal incentives for R&D expenses to be effective in stimulating investment in R&D. The size of the effect varies across countries which can be linked to country specific features, but, crucially, also to differences in the design and organisational practices of the fiscal schemes. The study identifies what are good designs for R&D tax incentives and which features are to be avoided. To answer this question, the study benchmarks the 80 existing R&D tax incentives in 33 countries (including all EU Member States) based on a number of identified good practices in design and administration.
H29|Study on the effects and incidence of labour taxation. Final report|In the aftermath of the financial crisis most European countries are continuing to face employment problems. In a number of Member States government intervention has further resulted in increasing debt levels and high tax burdens overall and in particular on labour. Therefore well-targeted tax reforms seem to be in order to improve the labour market outcomes. It is often implicitly assumed that a decrease on the employee side, i.e. in the personal income tax rate or the employee part of social security contribution, leads to a higher labour supply. Similarly, a decrease in the employer labour taxes is often assumed to raise the demand of labour. However, the economic literature argues that in the presence of labour market imperfection economic incidence of a tax change is often different from the legal incidence. In this case the impact of a tax change on labour market outcomes depends on the interaction of the demand and the supply side of the market. This interaction is determined by the behaviou al responses of economic operators, measured by elasticities. Higher (demand or supply) elasticities will cause larger responses to tax changes, with the relatively less elastic side bearing a higher tax burden. Against this background four main goals of this study emerge. First, is to identify from the literature which labour market imperfections result in employment problems and to attribute them to the labour supply or on the labour demand side. Given the heterogeneity in the labour market situation of different groups, we also set out to identify which socioeconomic groups are most vulnerable to employment problems. The next step is to review the literature which assesses the short-run and long-run economic incidence of labour taxation. To further break down the incidence into its underlying determinants we also review the literature on the (tax) elasticities of labour supply and labour demand. Then the literature on the influence of the economic environment on the tax incidence outcome, most notably the wage setting mechanisms and the institutional background, is reviewed. Finally the findings of the literature review are brought together in a framework of indicators to identify the potential of tax reforms to reduce tax related employment problems.
H29|Moving towards a Single Labour Contract: Transition vs. Steady-state|This paper analyses the optimal design of a single open-ended contract (SOEC) and studies the political economy of moving towards such a SOEC in a labour market with dual employment protection. We develop a computationally tractable approach to compare two economic environments: one with flexible entry-level jobs and high employment protection at longer tenures, and another one with a SOEC featuring employment protection levels that increase smoothly with tenure. For illustrative purposes, we specialise the discussion of such choices to Spain, a country often considered as an epitome of a dual labour market. We show that a SOEC has the potential of bringing substantial improvements in equilibrium allocations and welfare. We provide estimates for the eligibility rule and tenure profile of the optimal SOEC, defined as the contract maximising the steady-state lifetime utility of new labour-market entrants. Finally, we use the model to identify winners and losers among younger and older workers in the transitional path of such a reform, and evaluate its political support.
H29|Collusive tax evasion and social norms|Abstract Although collusive tax evasion by buyers and sellers of commodities and also by employers and employees is widespread all over the world, it has rarely been analyzed in the tax evasion literature. To fill this gap and to compare collusive tax evasion with independent tax evasion, this paper develops a simple noncooperative game-theoretic model and confirms the model’s predictions in a laboratory experiment. Because collusive tax evasion involves social interaction, this paper focuses on the effect of social norms and theoretically and empirically demonstrates that the tax compliance norm has a stronger negative effect on the magnitude of collusive tax evasion than on independent tax evasion. The reason for this result is that in a collusive tax evasion game with multiple equilibria social norms affect the range of equilibria and act as an equilibrium selection device, whereas social norms need to be strongly internalized to change the behavior of taxpayers who evade taxes unobservedly.
H29|The Effects of Tax Policy on Alcoholic Beverage Trends and Alcohol Demand in Japan| This paper examines the evolution of alcoholic beverage sectors and the effects of tax policies on these sectors as well as the alcohol beverage demand systems in Japan utilising data from 1948 to 2011. In tax policy analyses, liquor tax policies are found to have differential effects on the production and consumption of different types of alcohol. Although sectoral growth and general economic performance in terms of final consumption expenditure per capita are found to be significant, with major positive effects, tax rates are found to have mixed effects, depending on the type of alcohol considered. The analyses suggest that preferential tax rates may be beneficial for boosting the sectoral performance of certain types of alcoholic beverages. The results, based on double-log and demand system equation estimations for five types of alcoholic beverages, suggest that all alcoholic beverages, except for shōchu, are normal goods with positive expenditure elasticities. Although the results suggest that shōchu may be the safest taxable subject in a Ramsey sense, the own-price elasticity estimates provide less coherent results depending on the model applied.
H29|Methodology for assessment of the internal financial control system (for the purpose of tax control practices)|The article studies the opportunity to apply a methodological assessment instrument for the internal financial control system, as a part of the audit risk assessment – for tax control purposes (such an assessment has not been applied in this sphere yet). In this regard an assessment methodology for the internal financial control system in the businesses has been outlined and adopted for tax control purposes in case of tax audits (at the preparation and planning stage) as a tool to increase their efficiency. The key characteristics of the internal control system in small-scale enterprises have been derived and investigated.

H29|Administrative Dimensions of Tax Reform|The best tax policy in the world is worth little if it cannot be implemented effectively. Tax policy design in developing countries must therefore take the administrative dimension of taxation carefully into account. What can be done may to a considerable extent determine what is done in any country. This paper discusses the relationship between tax policy and tax administration. When can policy lead administration? When must policy initiatives wait on administrative reform? How exactly can both sides of the policy and administrative agenda be advanced together? The paper sets out the broad outlines of administrative reform -- the essential conditions for such reform, its principal components, and its limits as a way of solving critical tax problems and provides a short case study of the interaction of tax policy and tax administration in the Polish Tax reform of the early 1990s.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H29|The Optimal Petroleum Fiscal Regime for Ghana: An Analysis of Available Alternatives|Ghana became an oil producing country in December 2010. This development renewed the expectation of the citizenry as to the revenue that will accrue to the state and its direct effect on standard of living. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Ghanaian upstream petroleum fiscal regime, including state and investor shares, and to compare it with petroleum fiscal regimes of some six other oil producing African countries. The qualitative assessment compared the regime on general taxation and petroleum taxation in particular. The traditional Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method was used in the quantitative assessment of the regimes. Out of the seven regimes used in the quantitative analysis, the Ghanaian regime ranks sixth in terms of government take. It also ranks second with 31 months investor payback period based on post-tax discounted cash flow. Though the Ghanaian fiscal regime appears to be progressive; thin capitalisation, royaltyrate, and cost recovery limits withholding taxes on interest. Therefore tying of additional oil entitlements to profits are recommended in future reviews of the Ghanaian fiscal regime. It appears from the study that the Ghanaian regime is not optimal and the recommendation provided would help improve upon it.
H29|The Role Of The Automatic Stabilizers In Modern Economy|Automatic stabilizers as a factor of cyclical fluctuations stabilization attract economists' attention for several decades. This paper deals with the mechanisms through which automatic stabilizers influence economy and positive and negative effects on aggregate demand they can produce. It is common when discussing automatic stabilizers to put the accent on certain tax categories, such as personal income tax and corporate income tax, оr some public expenditures, such as unemployment benefits and social protection. Given that, here only fiscal stabilizers will be discussed, although some nonfiscal categories also demonstrate stabilizing impact.
H29|Major Taxpayers Tax Control: Foreign Experience and Home Practice|With the enhanced business activity in Ukraine and increasing number of large business entities the search for effective mechanisms to improve the tax control over major taxpayers has been intensified. According to the Ministry of Revenue and Duties of Ukraine, for the period of 2010-2013 their number has grown from 586 to 1,486 units or correspondingly 29.0 %. In 2014 the Register of major taxpayers has accounted for 2,131 businesses. Provided a more favorable business climate in the country is developed, the number of major taxpayers will only be growing. Thus, the relevant is the research into foreign experience in tax control over major taxpayers. The article provides the analysis of major tax payers tax control procedure in Ukraine and in the developed countries. Based on the results of research the author has offered recommendations as to the organizational and economic mechanism for improving the tax control over major taxpayers in Ukraine allowing for progressive foreign trends in this field.
H29|Tax professionals' view of the Spanish tax system: efficiency, equity and tax planning|The design of a tax system is a daunting task. Economies have become increasingly complex, which makes the design of taxes has to take into account behavioral taxpayers' responses - including mobility -, but also tax planning issues. Additionally, increasing inequality trends put more pressure on design. This complex framework increases the need of complete and constantly updated information about the functioning of the system to carry out welfare-enhancing reforms and having stable sources of public funding. It seems now the moment the Spanish tax system takes advantage of all sources of information to undertake a necessary reform. For this ambitious purpose, we aim at providing a novel source of information: the (objective) opinion of tax professionals. From a survey all over Spain, tax professionals unanimously conclude the current tax system is unfair, while the main inefficiencies, rather than due to traditional responses, come out as a consequence of tax planning and tax mobility. We hope the complete results of the survey are a useful source of information.
H29|Why tax effort falls short of capacity in Indian states: A Stochastic frontier approach|Taxation is an important tool to enhance the economic development and to finance the expenditure responsibilities of a government. This paper attempts to measure the tax capacity and tax effort of 14 major Indian states from 1992-92 to 2010-11 using Stochastic Frontier Analysis. The use of tax capacity frontier helps to identify those states which are operating near their tax capacity and states which are away from tax frontier. The results indicate presence of large variation in tax effort index across states and which seems to be increasing over time. Econometric analysis suggests that economic and structural variables have significant impact on the tax capacity. While per-capita gross state domestic product has positive effect on states' own tax revenue, relative size of agriculture sector of a state has adverse effect on its own tax revenue. The evidence on tax efficiency suggests that the higher inter-governmental transfers tend to reduce tax efficiency. Outstanding liabilities and expenditure on debt repayment also indicate adverse effect on tax efficiency, but the adverse effect of the latter is lesser than the former. Enactment of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act seems to have improved the tax efficiency which has been further strengthened by the better law and order inside states. Higher political competition inside a state, represented by effective number of parties, has favourable effect on the tax efficiency of a state. Implications are drawn for policy.
H29|Tax structure and entrepreneurship|Using macro-level panel data, we examine the effects of taxation and tax progressivity on entrepreneurship in a large group of European countries. We address two main questions. First, we try to explore whether tax increases discourage entrepreneurial activity, focusing on new self-employment (nascent entrepreneurship). Second, we investigate the impact of tax progressivity on entrepreneurship, again focusing on new self-employment. We find that tax progressivity at higher-than-average incomes has a robust negative effect on nascent entrepreneurship. We discuss the policy implications of our results.

This article will be devoted to reflection problems and some ways of resolving them.
H29|The Bulgarian Flat Tax|"The flat tax has become broadly popular in Central and Eastern Europe in recent years. Many of EU newcomers adopted flat tax regime. Even at first glance, however, it is evident that there are large variations in its design, although flat tax is clearly defined in literature. The question is whether this relates to different applications of one and the same concept or to different concepts called by the same name – flat tax. Perceived as standard the coherent tax structure of the flat tax, proposed by Hall and Rabushka, we assess the current income tax system in Bulgaria. We focus on the structure of the tax system and design of the tax bases, because even they reflect to a greater extent the specificity of the flat tax. Cuts of tax rates are important; they have been not only broadly discussed, but also do not necessarily relate to the flat tax concept. Bulgaria adopted the ""flat tax"", this did not increase the transparency of income taxation nor did it become easier to administer. Moreover, income taxation is not simple, neutral, and non-distortive. Despite the introduction of some elements of the flat tax, one cannot say that a theoretical flat tax system is implemented in Bulgaria."
H29|Factors Affecting Tax Compliance of Taxpayers: The Role of Tax Officer The Case of Istanbul and Canakkale|The need for tax revenue is increasing day after day, state needs to raise its service quality in order not to lose the tax payers, but to gain them. Especially the tax officers and their chiefs who are in direct relationship with the tax payer should have good relations with all taxpayers, empathize with the taxpayer, treat equally to each taxpayer and motivate the taxpayers regarding conformity with the taxes. In this study, a survey was conducted among the tax officers employed in the Revenue Administration of Canakkale and Istanbul, and from the perspective of them, a correlation analysis of the relations between the taxpayer, the tax officer and the chief of the tax officers, was carried out with statistical techniques including Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis H test.
H29|Smokers’ Sexual Behavior and Their Satisfaction with Family Life|Smokers tend to be more impatient and prefer immediate benefits compared with non-smokers. If people follow their primitive instincts they will engage in sexual behavior. Impatient people are more likely to have sex. However, for married people, having sex with a spouse is considered to be an investment in family life. Based on individual level data of Japan General Social Surveys, this paper investigated how sexual behavior differs between smokers and non-smokers. In addition to it, determinants of life satisfaction are also investigated. The important findings through the interval regression model and the ordered probit model are: (1) frequency of sex is positively associated with family satisfaction; (2) unmarried smokers are more likely to have sex than unmarried non-smokers; (3) married smokers are less likely to have sex than married non-smokers. It follows from estimation results that smoking behavior alerts us to his unobserved characteristics before marriage, thus reducing information asymmetry.

H29|A review and evaluation of methodologies to calculate tax compliance costs|This study reviews, assesses and compares twelve methodologies which can be used for measuring compliance costs of taxation. These methodologies are: the Standard Cost Model (SCM), Paying Taxes, the Taxpayer/Business Burden Model, the Total Cost of Regulation to Business (TCR), the Scanning Instrument Regulations of Other Compliance Costs (SIROCCO), the Regulatory Check-up Model (RCM), Guidelines on the Identification and Presentation of Compliance Costs in Legislative Proposals by the Federal Government (GIPCC), the Cost-Driven Approach to Regulatory Burden (CAR), the Complexity Index of the UK Office of Tax Simplification, the Total Cost to Serve (TCS), the Tax Information and Impact Note (TIIN), and the Bureaucracy Cost Index (BKI).
H29|The Organic Food Premium: A Canterbury Tale|The present paper attempts to bring further evidence on the behavioural gap for organic food in Britain. The stated preferences are analysed by contingent valuation, while the revealed preferences are estimated by hedonic pricing. A small but significant gap in the premium for organic food between stated and revealed preferences has been found. This gap may suggest a need for price premium intervention. The estimated price elasticity for organic products is on average above one in absolute value suggesting that a pricing policy could be very effective.
H29|Assessment Of The Internal Financial Control System For The Needs Of Tax Practice|In the article there are worked out a characterization and a definition of internal financial control. There is clarified the need for carrying out this kind of financial control and are considered the reasons for which there is developed a system of internal financial control in the enterprise. There is presented the possibility for assessment of the established system of internal financial control in the enterprises as an innovative means of raising the efficiency of tax control. With regard to this, from auditing practice there have been borrowed and adapted - for the needs of tax control - the guidelines and the criteria for the assessment of the system of internal financial control in the enterprises.
H29|The effect of tax enforcement on tax morale|In this paper we argue that tax enforcement is an additional contextual factor affecting tax morale, one of the most important determinants of tax compliance. By using a unique dataset that merges a representative sample of Italian households with administrative data on tax enforcement, we first find that tax morale is positively correlated with tax enforcement. Second, to deal with possible endogeneity of tax enforcement, we show that results are confirmed in an IV specification using the change in the tax gap at the provincial level as an instrument for tax enforcement. Finally, we provide evidence that the impact of tax enforcement and social environment is stronger at low quantiles of tax morale. Our results show that besides that of lowering the expected value of tax evasion, tax enforcement has an additional and indirect effect on tax compliance through its effect on tax morale.
H29|"Grundsteuer: Gemeindesteuer und ""Reichensteuer""?"|German municipalities receive almost all of their tax revenue from four different taxes: real property tax, trade tax and shares of value added tax and income tax. Compared with the three latter taxes, real property tax meets the requirements of a rational local tax system in the best way. For that reason tax revenue from the real property tax should be increased and the one of the trade tax should be decreased. This paper analyses furthermore weather the real property tax is useful for redistribution of wealth. On the one hand without a change to a progressive tax schedule the real property tax is no instrument for redistribution. On the other hand a tax allowance will increase the tax burden of the remaining tax payers very strong to keep the tax revenue on the same level as before. This could be a problem for politicians, which want to be re-elected. Thus real property tax is no instrument for redistribution of wealth. In diesem Beitrag wird dargelegt, dass von den derzeitigen vier gewichtigen den Kommunen zufließenden Steuern (Grund- und Gewerbesteuer sowie kommunaler Anteil an der Einkommen- und Umsatzsteuer) die Grundsteuer am besten die an eine kommunale Steuer zu stellenden Anforderungskriterien erfüllt. Insofern sollte der Anteil der Grundsteuer am kommunalen Steueraufkommen erhöht werden, etwa auf Kosten der Gewerbesteuer. Hingegen hat sich gezeigt, dass eine verteilungspolitische Instrumentalisierung der Grundsteuer nicht unproblematisch ist. Erst bei Verwendung von Freibeträgen und damit einer Abkehr vom Realsteuercharakter wäre die Grundsteuer als verteilungspolitisches Instrument einsetzbar. Allerdings würde der Freibetrag zu einer deutlichen Minderung der Bemessungsgrundlage führen. Dieser Umstand würde - allein zur Wahrung der Aufkommensneutralität - zu Steigerungen der Grundsteuerhebesätze führen, die aus politischer Sicht unakzeptabel sein dürften. Insofern ist die Grundsteuer für die Umverteilung weniger gut geeignet.
H29|Input–output modelling of the effect of implicit subsidies on general prices|Implicit subsidies are implemented for different reasons in many countries. These subsidies generally emerge through selling public resources such as gas, oil, and water at a lower price to one or more sectors. They are not considered in government payments and national accounts. Hence, it is expected that any change in the size of these subsidies influences the price of the relative sectors through the intermediate expenditures. This paper aims at developing the Table Adjusting Price (TAP) and Standard Leontief Price (SLP) models to measure the effect of an exogenous change in the size of implicit subsidy on the price indices of all sectors. The proposed models allowed the researcher to analyse a change in the level of implicit subsidy in different cases. In addition, an empirical example illustrates the result of the implementation of these models.
H29|Conflict and negotiation in Colombia: Are pre-donations useful?|We model conflict between two agents in which each one has two possible strategies: cease-fire or rejection of the truce. We use the concept of pre-donations, namely, a redefinition of the game in which each agent commits to transfer a share of its output to the other agent (Sertel, 1991). Conditions are established under which a system of pre-donations may facilitate a truce. In particular, for conflicts involving high costs there is a distributive mechanism, acceptable for both parties, whereby cease-fire is the best strategy for both of them. However, in many cases the conditions are not right for such a scheme of pre-donations to be effective. Some limitations of the framework are analyzed and the model is extended to deal with certain shortcomings in the basic setup. To illustrate the relevance of the theoretical results, we briefly describe the circumstances that have characterized the negotiation processes between the Colombian government and various illegal groups in this long-lasting armed conflict.
H29|The Politics of Surprise Devaluations: Modelling Motives for Giving Up a Peg|Planned ‘‘surprise’’ devaluations are often spurred by non-economic circumstances: a rentseeking government; political instability; or the opportunity to put the blame on a predecessor government. In this paper, these aspects are incorporated in the monetary and fiscal policy framework first suggested by Alesina and Tabellini (1987). It is shown that reneging on a fixed exchange rate promise unambiguously produces short term benefits, but long run losses. This leads to a non-straightforward trade-off between greediness (propensity for expropriation) and political stability (which implies a low time preference). The findings are empirically relevant and theoretically robust to extensions.
H29|International Comparison of Macroeconomic Factors Affecting the Tax Revenue|The paper deals with the possibility of estimating similarity between the tax systems of selected countries (Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia) based on the development of tax revenues and important macroeconomic indicators. The methodology is based on regression and correlation analysis, when possible similarities are subsequently discussed with the results of correlation analysis and the size of the estimated regression coefficients. Although the outcome in some cases does not preclude possible similarity between tax systems, only the evaluation of the development of regression analysis, so this conclusion is not evidential due to the small size of the data obtained.
H29|Research of Estimates of Tax Revenue: An Overview|The paper deals with a summary of findings in the area of tax forecasts. It describes the basic methodology for predicting tax revenues, both in terms of the macroeconomic approach and from a microeconomic perspective. The microeconomic approach used microsimulation methods with methods based on tax elasticities. The macroeconomic approach explains the basic characteristics of regression analysis and time series analysis. It also describes methods for assessing the quality of predictions, together with the distribution of basic statistical error estimate.

The other public goods has ""final"" services for house holds. We are interested in a benefit approach to charging for government services that includes government services flowing directly to firms. The legal system is our representative intermediate public good and benefit charges to firms should include part of the maintenance of the legal system."

H29|Democracy, Economic Freedom and Taxation in the European Union|"The purpose of this paper is to study empirically how democracy, taxation and economic freedom interact within the European Union (EU-27), european old member states (EU-15) and european new member states (EU-NMS), using VAR methodology, with panel data for 24 countries and yearly observations for the period 1995-2008. The main findings show for EU-27 that democracy amplifies the level of taxation and it discourages economic freedom, while economic freedom has an almost unsignificant, but positive effect on the level of taxation, and a small, positive effect on democracy. As for EU 15, taxation and economic freedom seem to discourage each other; finally, in the case of EU-NMS, the results are similar to EU-27. In respect to policy implication, governments should protect and support private property and initiative, the only ones able to provide functionality for the market’s ""invisible hand""."
H29|Issues Concerning The Role Of Promotion For Tax Authorities|Tax administration having as general objectives fighting against tax evasion, business support, modernization and improvement of procedures, prevention of tax evasion during collection, improving the collection of budgetary debts wants to be a modern administration that rely on principles of efficiency, transparency and responsibility. How the objectives of tax administration are known? Does everyone understand the objectives of tax administration? Do taxpayers know that major strategic orientation of the tax administration is the attention to expectations of citizens and businesses? What are the actions that can improve and stimulate the relationship taxpayer – tax administration? Through this article we intend to present a number of aspects of marketing policy that can be implemented by the institutions with attributions in tax administration to promote the image among taxpayers and thus provide the answer to the above questions.

H29|Non-scale endogenous growth effects of subsidies for exporters|We built a general equilibrium endogenous growth model in which final goods are produced either in the relatively skilled-labour intensive exports sector or in the relatively unskilled-labour intensive domestic sector. We show that, by affecting the technological-knowledge bias, subsidies explain the simultaneous rise in the exports sector, the skill wage premium and the economic growth rate. Then, to shed light upon the causal nexus between production-related subsidies and exports, we use a Portuguese longitudinal database (1996–2003) and implement a propensity score matching approach. Empirical results seem to prove the theoretical predictions: subsidies generate the rise in the wage premium of exporters and the increase in the relative size of export sector, even if no impact of subsidies is found in the capacity of transforming domestic firms into new exporters.
H29|Revenue decentralization and inflation: A re-evaluation|A problematic feature of the existing empirical literature on the relationship between revenue decentralization (RD) and inflation is the use of inaccurate measures for RD. Using a newly constructed measure for RD that accounts for over-time changes in sub-national tax autonomy, this paper finds that RD leads to lower inflation.
H29|On voluntary eco-labeling and fiscal incentives|The conditions under which a government would initiate a fiscal incentive scheme to encourage the use of an eco-label in a duopoly are determined. The results reveal a scope for fiscal incentive provision in conjunction with the eco-label scheme for highly polluting industries.
H29|Illusion therapy: How to impose an economic shock without social pain|This study attempts to demonstrate how a government launched an economic structural reform plan that previous governments, fearing a serious social backlash, had been unable to implement over the course of 30 years. The findings show that the Iranian government used “illusion therapy”, a package of econo-psychological techniques, to implement IMF-backed “shock” economic reforms to long-standing energy and food subsidies, without facing the expected social reaction.
H29|Social norms and tax compliance: Framing the decision to pay tax|Observed levels of tax compliance are higher than predicted levels (when predictions are based on Allingham and Sandmo's neoclassical model of tax evasion). They are higher if social norms recognise the importance of compliance. But how do social norms frame decisions to pay tax? Can prospect theory be applied to shed insight into the way that social norms exert their influence? An analysis of questionnaire responses (from Italy and from the UK) suggests that they exert their influence by changing the reference points that individuals use when they code changes as ‘gains’, or ‘losses’. The evidence suggests that social norms frame the decision to pay tax by changing individuals’ perceptions of their entitlement to income. This consideration is important when designing policy to deter evasion.
H29|‘Spite effects’ in tax evasion experiments|This paper sets out to consider individuals’ motivations to evade taxation. Experimental results indicate that individuals do not simply maximize pecuniary welfare. Their behaviour is consistent with the presence of a ‘spite effect’ when their perceptions are that enforcement variables are ‘excessive’.

H29|The Impact of the Business Cycle on Elasticities of Tax Revenue in Latin America|This paper estimates short-run and long-run elasticities of tax revenue with respect to GDP in eight Latin American countries using quarterly data. Taxes considered are corporate income tax (CIT), personal income tax (PIT), value-added tax (VAT), and overall taxes. Results indicate that long-run elasticities are statistically and economically larger than 1, whereas short-run elasticities appear not to be statistically different from zero in the majority of cases. Tax systems seem very elastic in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. The CIT exhibits the largest estimated long-run elasticity in most countries. Focusing on short-run elasticities that show statistical significance, only the CIT in Colombia and the PIT in Brazil and Colombia show larger fluctuations over the business cycle than growth potential in the long run. Overall, our results indicate that tax systems in Latin America are significantly more elastic than previous estimations.
H29|IMFG Graduate Student Papers: (1) Development Charges across Canada: An Underutilized Growth Management Tool? (2) Preparing for the Costs of Extreme Weather in Canadian Cities: Issues, Tools, Ideas|(1) Increasingly, compact and sustainable development has become a priority for Canadian municipalities. In order to realize these growth objectives, it is possible to look not only to conventional land use and growth management policies, but also to fiscal instruments to achieve planning goals. Existing literature suggests that development charges, which are financial tools used by municipalities in several Canadian provinces to pay for the growth-related capital costs associated with new development or redevelopment, can influence how land resources are consumed and developments are designed. Drawing on information from the literature and interviews with key informants, this research analyzed how development charges are used in British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario, as well as the Halifax Regional Municipality, to understand how jurisdictions employ development charges and what role these charges currently play in achieving growth objectives. The research found that few municipalities use their development charges proactively to meet planning goals. Moreover, the research revealed a divide among practitioners, with some maintaining that development charges were a revenueraising tool and a poor mechanism by which to achieve planning objectives. Others recognized that development charges could be—and were being—used as a tool to encourage compact growth, but identified several barriers to more effective and widespread use as a planning tool. Suggested recommendations for policy changes include more flexibility within legislation to collect for transit and other services, ongoing support from provincial officials to assist municipalities in designing development charge programs with policy goals in mind, and further exploration of how fiscal tools can best be used as planning tools. (2) This paper reviews the risks to Canadian municipal finance from extreme weather and analyzes the financial tools that cities can use to prepare for extreme weather events: insurance, weather reserves, weather derivatives, and budget provision. Despite the threat of climate change, Canadian cities are not substantially increasing their use of these tools. However, improvements could be made to accounting procedures and disaster assistance regulations, and amalgamating smaller cities could improve their ability to manage risk, all of which will ameliorate the financial impacts of extreme weather. The paper proposes reasons why Canadian cities have failed to fully adapt their infrastructure to extreme weather: lack of information, low fiscal capacity, externalities, moral hazard in disaster assistance arrangements, and poor program design. It concludes by discussing how these arrangements may be overhauled to better prepare Canadian municipalities for extreme weather, including new provincial legislation and the creation of a federal infrastructure fund modelled on the United States’ Pre-Disaster Mitigation program.
H29|The Relationship Between Accounting And Taxation - The Romanian Accounting Environment|The paper analyses the relationship between accounting and taxation in the Romanian accounting environment. In this respect the paper illustrates the results of the main research conducted in the national and international literature in terms of the relationship between accounting and taxation in Romania and also the main research directions in terms of tax-accounting link. The paper concludes that the level of influence was decreased over time (de jure and de facto) as a result of changes made in the Romanian accounting and tax environment.
H29|Carbon Tax Salience and Gasoline Demand|We demonstrate that the carbon tax imposed by the Canadian province of British Columbia, a unique carbon pricing policy that comprehensively applies to all fossil fuels, caused a decline in short-run gasoline demand that is significantly greater than would be expected from an equivalent increase in the market price of gasoline. That the carbon tax is more salient, or yields a larger change in demand than equivalent market price movements, is robust to a range of specifications including intuitively plausible and strong instrumental variables. Along with calculating the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions attributable to the tax, we discuss potential explanations for the differential consumer responses to the carbon tax relative to the marketdetermined price.

H29|Practical and Theoretical Aspects on Transfer Pricing|It is known that in 2010, the art. 11 para. 2 of the Tax Code was amended as to extend the application of regulations concerning transfer pricing on the transactions between the Romanian affiliated persons. As a consequence, a significant increase in the number of tax inspections has been observed between 2010-2011, that has aimed to investigate the transfer pricing charged by companies in the relations with the affiliated persons, both non- resident and Romanian persons.It has been found out of these tax inspections that it is difficult to put into practice the set of regulations regarding the transfer pricing, both taxpayers and tax inspectors being inexperienced in this field.
H29|Fixed-term and permanent employment contracts: theory and evidence|This paper constructs a theory of the coexistence of fixed-term and permanent employment contracts in an environment with ex ante identical workers and employers. Workers under fixed-term contracts can be dismissed at no cost while permanent employees enjoy labor protection. In a labor market characterized by search and matching frictions, firms find it optimal to discriminate by offering some workers a fixed-term contract while offering other workers a permanent contract. Match-specific quality between a worker and a firm determines the type of contract offered. We analytically characterize the firms' hiring and firing rules. Using matched employer-employee data from Canada, we estimate the wage equations from the model. The effects of firing costs on wage inequality vary dramatically depending on whether search externalities are taken into account.

H29|Optimal taxation in the presence of a congested public good and an application to transport policy|In this paper we demonstrate that even if policies prior to reform have been rational, it is possible, in fact in certain policy areas likely, that a green tax reform, contrary to the perceived wisdom among economists, will be associated with a double-dividend, i.e. with both environmental and fiscal benefits. We first establish this theoretically by avoiding imposing potentially unrealistic separability assumptions, and by recognising that taxation involves administrative costs. To illustrate our theoretical results, we use graphical tools well-known from fishery economics to assess the effects of the introduction of a tax on road transport.

H29|The grey escape: investigating older people's use of the free bus pass|Since 2008 most older people in England have benefited from unlimited area-wide free travel by bus after the morning peak period. The official policy rhetoric supporting implementation of the measure drew significantly on the need to reduce social exclusion amongst older people. However, despite a substantial increase in the number of concessionary journeys in England and the associated cost liabilities for local authorities and possibly also operators, there is currently only limited understanding of the wide ranging effects on bus use of providing a free pass, and in particular to whom benefits from the policy accrue. In part, this circumstance results from a methodological focus by evaluation studies hitherto that has emphasised aggregate-level data, often at the expense of the very rich contextual information about how the individual benefits from using a pass. This article presents insights into the perceptions, motivations and decisions relating to use of free bus passes, highlighting the existence of both tangible and intangible benefits which arise. It offers a fresh insight into previously undefined uses and benefits derived from possessing and using a concessionary bus pass. This article concludes by noting possible policy implications of the research in the context of the UK’s ageing population and for other international contexts where the transport intervention of free bus travel is being considered.
H29|Regional Policy in a Multiregional Setting: When the Poorest are Hurt by Subsidies|Regional policies that seek to reduce economic inequalities between regions are common. These policies normally involve subsidies or transfers to the poorest regions. Over any given short-term horizon such subsidies serve to reduce inter-regional inequalities, but as they also affect migration patterns the long-term effects are less clear. This paper demonstrates using a three-region, general equilibrium model that subsidising the poorest region may be to the detriment of the periphery as a whole and even to the very region that receives the subsidy, if the subsidy draws firms away from a nearby region that would function better as a production centre. Though further research is needed to isolate the conditions under which such an effect would arise, the result has potentially important implications for the design of regional policy.
H29|Macro‐Fiscal Volatility and the Composition of Public Spending|Earlier empirical literature has examined some long- and medium-term aspects of macro-fiscal volatility while leaving its short-term fiscal impact unexplored. To help fill that gap, we examine the impact of macro-fiscal volatility on the composition of public spending. To that end, we analyse a panel of 10 EU countries during 1991—2007. Our results suggest that contemporaneous increases in the volatility of regularly collected revenues such as the VAT and income taxes tend to tilt the expenditure composition in favour of public investment. In contrast, increases in the volatility of ad hoc –type of taxes such as capital taxes tend to favour public consumption spending. A possible explanation to these differences concerns news about the underlying economic conditions embedded in short-term volatility changes: the policy maker may be more inclined to increase public investment in response to persistent changes in the economic conditions, while temporary changes may prompt a reaction on consumption spending.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

H29|Pakistan 2011: Policy Measures for the Economic Challenges Ahead|Pakistan faces economic challenges in the summer of 2011 with regard to its balance of payments and its public finances, resulting primarily from the suspension of an ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, the associated cessation of program lending by other multilateral financial institutions, and the termination of the US’s cash logistics support. This paper argues that these challenges can be met without resorting to a new program with the IMF. The policy measures recommended with regard to the balance of payments are: (i) to allow the orderly depreciation of the exchange rate in the foreign exchange interbank market by about 5–15 percent or to PKR90–100/US dollar, (ii) to impose import surcharges of 10–20 percent on nonessential imports, and (iii) to re-impose measures originally imposed to increase the cost of import letters of credit. Public finance-related policy measures recommended on the expenditure side are: (i) to gradually reduce the State Bank of Pakistan’s policy rate by 300 basis points in the fiscal year (FY) 2012 from its present level of 13.5 percent, thereby reducing the interest burden on public debt; and (ii) to utilize these savings to restart the stalled public sector infrastructure development program. These measures will also stimulate economic activity. On tax policy, the paper recommends that: (i) the sales tax rate be increased from its present 16 percent to 18 percent, (ii) custom duties be increased by 10–20 percent on nonessential imports (as also recommended for the balance of payments, and (iii) regulatory and excise duties be increased and their original (FY2011) coverage restored.
H29|The role of subsidies for exports: Evidence for Portuguese manufacturing firms|Using a longitudinal database (1996-2003) at the plant level, this paper aims to shed light on the causal nexus between production-related subsidies and exports, in Portugal. Given that there is a selection of firms for subsidies we implement a propensity score matching approach in order to evaluate adequately the effects of subsidies on both the probability of domestic firms to begin exporting and on the probability of increasing the export share of already exporters. At one hand, we find no impact of subsidies on the ability of domestic firms to become exporters; at the other hand, some evidence of positive effects of subsidies are detected on export shares, especially for higher levels of subsidy per employee and for specific sectors as a clear sectoral heterogeneity is observed. Complementarily, some weak positive effects of subsidies are noticed in employment but no evidence is observed for firms´ sales or efficiency.
H29|A Longitudinal Analysis Regarding The Evolution Of Profit Tax Regulations In Romania - An Empirical View|The study conducted a longitudinal analysis regarding Romanian profit tax regulations. Beginning with the first profit tax regulation implemented in 1991 and until now, we analyzed based on a empirical approach all changes that have occurred over time in the Romanian accounting environment. The motivation of the study conducted was based on the strong relationship between accounting and taxation in the Romanian accounting environment over time, the profit tax being one of the main items of this relation. This particular study is divided into five sections. After a short introduction and presenting the motivation of the study (section 1), in section 2 we conducted the literature review based on international and national studies regarding the profit tax regulations through the relationship between accounting and taxation. Section 3 presents a brief review of the main Romanian regulations that concerned the profit tax and the most important changes that have occurred over time. In section 4 we conducted the empirical analysis. In this section is realized a series of analysis, aiming the following: (1) the total number of regulations that have amend the main regulations presented in the previous section; (2) the type of amendments implemented over regulations (abolishment, text amendment, adding new articles or alignments); (3) the total number of amendments approved by law without modifications, respectively the total number of amendments approved on the Official Journal through Government Ordinance or Emergency Ordinance and unapproved by law. The empirical analysis conducted documented that the main shortcoming associated with the profit tax regulation is due by the multiple changes which have been subject of the 5 main profit tax regulations. The last section (section 5) consists in presenting the conclusions of the study. As main conclusion, the profit tax regulation is stable only in terms of the small number of main regulations, the large number of amendments creating difficulties in the understanding and application by practitioners.
H29|Do Religious Beliefs Explain Preferences for Income Redistribution? Experimental Evidence| Due to the mixed empirical evidence bearing on the economic determinants, beliefs have been at the centre of attention of research into preferences for income redistribution. We elicit preferences for income redistribution through a Discrete Choice Experiment performed in 2008 in Switzerland and relate them to several behavioural determinants, in particular to religious beliefs. Estimated marginal willingness to pay (WTP) is positive among those who do not belong to a religious denomination, and negative otherwise. However, the marginal WTP is shown to increase with a higher degree of religiosity. Moreover, those who state that luck or connections play a crucial role in determining economic success exhibit significantly higher WTP values than those who deem effort to be decisive.

H29|Income redistribution: how to divide the pie?|In this paper, we elicit preferences of Swiss citizens for the allocation of income redistribution to different uses through a Discrete Choice Experiment performed in 2008. Neustadt and Zweifel (2009} provide an estimate of the total desired amount of income redistribution as a share of disposable income. Here, we estimate marginal willingness-to-pay values for types of recipients (old-age pensioners, people with ill health, the unemployed, working poor, and families with children) and their nationality (Swiss, citizens of western European countries, others). Hypotheses derived from the insurance motive for redistribution receive some empirical support.
H29|Aplikace kombinatorických aukcí na alokaci veřejných podpor v oblasti životního prostředí: ekonomický laboratorní experiment<BR>[Application of Combinatorial Auctions on Allocation of Public Financial Support in the Area of Environmental Protection: Economic Laboratory Experiment]|This paper presents results of repeated economic lab experiments. They were designed to test a model of combinatorial auctions on the case of providing financial support (capital investment subsidies) to polluters. Combinatorial auctions are those auctions in which bidders can place bids on combinations of items. The advantage of combinatorial auctions is that the bidder can more fully express his preferences. This is particular important when items are complements. In the experiment presented in the paper, the polluters have two options: (i) to invest individually or (ii) create coalitions, i.e. to prepare and realize common capital investment projects. The common model of combinatorial auctions is described first in the paper. The design of the laboratory experiment is presented in the next section and the results are shown in the last section.
H29|Equilibrium Search And Tax Credit Reform|An empirical equilibrium job search model with wage posting is developed to analyze the impact of U.K. tax reforms. The model allows for a rich characterization of the labor market, with hours responses, accurate representations of the tax and transfer system, and both worker and firm heterogeneity. The British Working Families' Tax Credit and contemporaneous reforms are predicted to increase employment, with equilibrium effects found to be relatively modest. The model is used to assess the impact of alternative policies, with equilibrium effects shown to become important as the generosity of tax credits is increased.
H29|Fixed-Term and Permanent Employment Contracts: Theory and Evidence|This paper constructs a theory of the coexistence of fixed-term and permanent employment contracts in an environment with ex-ante identical workers and employers. Workers under fixed-term contracts can be dismissed at no cost while permanent employees enjoy labor protection. In a labor market characterized by search and matching frictions, firms find optimal to discriminate by offering some workers a fixed-term contract while offering other workers a permanent contract. Match-specific quality between a worker and a firm determines the type of contract offered. We analytically characterize the firm’s hiring and firing rules. Using matched employer-employee data from Canada, we estimate the wage equations from the model. The effects of firing costs on wage inequality vary dramatically depending on whether search externalities are taken or not into account.
H29|Tax Expenditures: Revenue and Information Forgone - the experience of Ireland|Tax expenditures are perceived to represent a ‘pervasive and growing' (OECD, 2010) element of many national taxation systems. Despite this, in many countries, there remains a critical lack of understanding of their impact and scale. A 2010 OECD analysis produced data for only seven of its thirty-four member states. Internationally and nationally, such an information deficit undermines the ability of taxation systems to function efficiently and compromises the ability of policy makers to design, control and evaluate taxation interventions. The latter is all the more relevant in the context of recent economic challenges. This paper derives from the results of the first comprehensive exploration of Ireland's tax expenditure system. It highlights the previously unknown scale of that system, points towards a series of information deficits and compares the Irish system to that of other OECD countries. Based on this analysis, the paper offers a series of administrative and structural reforms relevant to all tax expenditure systems.
H29|Is the Welfare State Sustainable? Experimental Evidence on Citizens’ Preferences for Redistribution|The sustainability of the welfare state ultimately depends on citizens’ preferences for income redistribution. They are elicited through a Discrete Choice Experiment performed in 2008 in Switzerland. Attributes are redistribution as GDP share, its uses (the unemployed, old-age pensioners, people with ill health etc.), and nationality of beneﬁciary. Estimated marginal willingness to pay (WTP) is positive among those who deem beneﬁts too low, and negative otherwise. However, even those who state that government should reduce income inequality exhibit a negative WTP on average. The major ﬁnding is that estimated average WTP is maximum at 21% of GDP, clearly below the current value of 25%. Thus, the present Swiss welfare state does not appear sustainable.
H29|Two-Tier Labor Markets in the Great Recession: France Vs. Spain|This paper analyzes the strikingly different response of unemployment to the Great Recession in France and Spain. Their labor market institutions are similar and their unemployment rates just before the crisis were both around 8%. Yet, in France, unemployment rate has increased by 2 percentage points, whereas in Spain it has shot up to 19% by the end of 2009. We assess what part of this differential is due to the larger gap between the dismissal costs of permanent and temporary contracts and the less restrictive rules regarding the use of the latter contracts in Spain. Using a calibrated search and matching model, we estimate that about 45% of the surge in Spanish unemployment could have been avoided had Spain adopted French employment protection legislation before the crisis started.

H29|Corporate Tax Stimulus and Investment in Colombia|This paper uses a yearly dataset of plant-level investment in Colombian firms during the period 1997 to 2007 to assess the impact of a tax incentive for firms that invest in fixed assets implemented in 2004. A positive and statistically significant correlation is found between the boom observed in investment and the adoption of the tax policy. However, the correlation vanishes when year-specific effects are controlled for. This result is robust to changes in the empirical specification, changes in estimation techniques, the inclusion of additional controls, and changes in the data set, among other tests. Overall, it is concluded that the tax stimulus analyzed was ineffective in promoting investment in Colombia.
H29|Why is it so Difficult to Implement a GST in Pakistan?|This paper discusses the efforts by the Government of Pakistan to implement a General Sales Tax (GST). First, a history of Pakistani tax reform efforts is presented along with the reforms recommended by the National Taxation Reforms Commission. After this, the design and implementation of the GST is discussed followed by an analysis of the political economy and provincial issues that arise in the process of implementing the GST. Finally, the paper discusses various proposals regarding the determination of the base for the GST. The paper concludes that the splitting of the GST by sectors, given the perspective that the 1930’s style sales tax, is not sensible, and the Pakistani formulation is more unstable than the assignment of the GST on goods.
H29|Why Don't Issuers Choose IPO Auctions? The Complexity of Indirect Mechanisms|In this paper we present a comprehensive comparison of IPO placement methods in over 50 countries. We find that out of the three primary methods, fixed price public offers, auctions, and book building, auctions are least popular with issuers. Since auctions allow for price discovery while avoiding the potential conflict of interest between issuer and underwriter, this is a surprising finding that is not adequately explained in the existing literature. We propose a new explanation: namely, that participating in auctions is substantially more difficult for investors compared to the other methods, and that this complexity can lead to investor behavior that is undesirable for the issuer. We suggest that this effect could be mitigated through a hybrid mechanism that resembles the one that is used in US treasury auctions.
H29|The Relationship Between Accounting And Taxation: A Brief International Literature Review|This paper analyses the international literature regarding the relationship between accounting and taxation in the last 20 years. To this purspose we reviewed the 3 international economic databases (EMERALD, EBSCO and SCIENCE DIRECT). We have found various studies approaching this relationship, the main research being performed due to the differences between them in the accounting systems that govern the world countries.
H29|Tax audit impact on voluntary compliance|This study examines the tax audit impact on voluntary compliance. It is different from those in the literature in several ways. First, models were built exclusively for investigating the voluntary compliance behavior shifts after a firm is audited. Second, apart from the theoretical approach and laboratory experiment approach used in the literature, this study applied the difference-in-differences non-experimental approach. Third, historical population data of a New York State economic sector were used in this study instead of experimental data or randomly selected sample data often used in the literature. The results of both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Time Series Cross Section (TSCS) autoregressive modeling methods are presented. The results of both methods suggest that after an audit, a firm would report a higher sales growth rate. The TSCS approach shows that in the year of the audit, a typical firm would report a sales growth rate which is 2.63 percentage points higher than a firm that was not audited. The percentage would decline by a rate of 1/3 each year thereafter. The findings suggest that the audit productivity derived in many research papers, where only the direct audit collections are considered, may be underestimated. The results of this research may provide policy makers with extra incentives to strengthening the audit efforts to generate more revenues.
H29|Taxpayers' Response to Warnings of a Possible Tax Audit: Do They Change Their Compliance Behavior?|In 2008, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance sent letters to clients of a fraudulent tax preparer, warning them of a possible audit and asking them to participate in the Department’s Voluntary Disclosure and Compliance Program if they had filed inaccurate tax returns in the past. This study examines the impact of the letters on voluntary compliance in their future (2008 and 2009) returns. In this study, a simple method similar to “difference in differences”, which we call “difference in positions”, is applied. 10,000 samples are randomly drawn from the taxpayer population and the growth rates of Federal adjusted gross income (AGI) for these samples are put into relative frequency density graphs. We then examine the relative positions of the experiment group (the clients of the fraudulent tax preparer) within the normally distributed curves before and after the letters were sent. The change in the relative positions is regarded as the letter impact on voluntary compliance. It is found that the impact is significant in the first year (2008 tax returns) after the letters were sent. The impact is 17.49 percentage points on the AGI growth rate, which translates to $8.68 million of reported AGI for the 507 taxpayers in the experiment group. However, the impact is minimal in the second year (2009 tax returns), indicating that the long-run effect of the letter mailings may be weak.
H29|Is the Welfare State Sustainable? Experimental Evidence on Citizens' Preferences for Redistribution|The sustainability of the welfare state ultimately depends on citizens' preferences for income redistribution. They are elicited through a Discrete Choice Experiment performed in 2008 in Switzerland. Attributes are redistribution as GDP share, its uses (the unemployed, old-age pensioners, people with ill health etc.), and nationality of beneficiary. Estimated marginal willingness to pay (WTP) is positive among those who deem benefits too low, and negative otherwise. However, even those who state that government should reduce income inequality exhibit a negative WTP on average. The major finding is that estimated average WTP is maximum at 21% of GDP, clearly below the current value of 25%. Thus, the present Swiss welfare state does not appear sustainable.
H29|Corruption, decentralization and yardstick competition|Several empirical studies have found a negative relationship between corruption and the decentralization of the powers to tax and spend. In this paper we explain this phenomenon using a model of Yardstick Competition. Using data on federal corruption-related convictions in U.S. states we propose and test a spatial autoregressive model of corruption, providing new evidence in support of the theoretical findings.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

H29|Subsidies and Exports in Germany. First Evidence from Enterprise Panel Data|We use newly available representative panel data for manufacturing enterprises in West and East Germany to investigate the link between production-related subsidies and exports. We report that only a small fraction of enterprises is subsidized, and that exports and subsidies are positively related. Using a matching approach to investigate the causal effect of subsidies on export activities we find no impact of subsidies on the probability to start exporting, and only weak evidence for an impact of subsidies on the share of exports in total sales in West Germany but no evidence in East Germany.
H29|Does German foreign direct investment lead to job losses at home?|This paper provides firm-level evidence on the labour demand effects of outward investments using a panel of multinationals (MNEs) based in Germany. Distinguishing the type of investments and the location of subsidiaries around the world between 1997 and 2008, our evidence shows that for both the manufacturing and services sector the expansion of employment abroad does not occur at the detriment of employment at home. The analysis is extended to see whether outward FDI causes average wage cuts for workers employed in the German parent firm. Our findings indicate no clear average wage effects due to outward FDI. Given that domestic MNEs are seen to play an important role in the growth potential for an economy, these findings are somewhat re-assuring from a policy point of view.
H29|Perspectives Regarding The Taxation System In Romania| Regarding the perspectives for the accounting-taxation ratio in Romania, it was mentioned that they are according to the international tendencies regarding the disconnection. Taking into account some of the recent evolutions (adopting the IV Directive of the European Economic Communities) we can say that the seeds that lead (at least theoretically in the beginning) to the possibility of gradually opening the road towards an efficient accounting system, where accountancy and taxation work independently from one another, exist. This tendency becomes more certain if we take into consideration Romanian's opportunity to join the European Union. This event implies also joining the official position of the Union, regarding the aknowledgement and utilization of the international accounting norms, and at the same time the desconnection between accountancy and taxation
H29|The Economic Losses Due to Drinking Water Impurity: A Revealed Preference Analysis in Kolkata, India|Supply of water of desirable quality yields a range of benefits to households by reducing averting expenditure and expenditure on treating illness. The sum of these expenditures can be used as a measure of the costs that the society bears due to undesirable quality of water. The present paper uses household production function approach to formulate a structural model of averting behaviour and illness. The mathematical model is used to empirically estimate the total losses borne by households of Kolkata on averting activities and waterborne illness. The factors explaining variation in averting expenditure and cost of illness were separately investigated.

H29|Governance on Mars|Whomever paid for the Mars trip (and related preparations) will get to determine who will govern Mars, and how? Or, will that be the case? For example, on what principles of governance? Is it going to be a democracy (whatever that may have meant), dictatorship of spacesuits, or inmates of the bubble abodes? Besides, will the payment be entirely in monetary terms? Who paid for the Glorious Revolution (1688)? American Revolution (1776)? French Revolution (1789)? Russian Revolution (which one?)? And a number of similarly momentous ones, some much older that those listed above?
H29|Screening on the Job: Should Temporary Jobs Be Subsidized?|The difficulty to allocate the right workers to the right jobs is an important source of market frictions. With the expansion of atypical jobs in the mid-1980’s, the idea that screening and flexibility could be complementary motivations arose. The purpose of this paper is twofold : (i) First, we investigate the screening effect of fixed-term contracts on employment (ii) Then, we analyze different subsidized temporary job schemes and their impact on the social welfare. We extend the framework of Pries and Rogerson (2005) by allowing firms to hire workers on both temporary and permanent jobs. Screening takes the form of a learning process where both the employer and the employee infer the match quality during a temporary job. We show that when temporary jobs are used as a screening device, they increase the employment size. Hiring and wage subsidies reduce both the unemployment rate and unemployment duration but have a different impact on the transition rate between unemployment, temporary jobs and permanent jobs. The hiring subsidy can be welfare enhancing while a permanent and identical wage subsidy for all temporary employed workers is always welfare detrimental. However, allowing the wage subsidy to compensate low income temporary jobs have a positive impact on labour market performance and may increase the aggregate welfare.
H29|Diyarbakır ilinde mükelleflerin vergiye ilişkin tutum ve algı analizi|Diyarbakır’da yaşayan vergi mükelleflerinin vergiyi algılama biçimleri, ödedikle¬ri vergilerin adaleti, vergi yükü, vergi kaçakçılığı ve vergi idaresi hakkında neler düşün¬düklerini saptamaya yönelik bu çalışmada, il sınırları içerisinde faaliyet gösteren gelir vergisi, kurumlar vergisi, veraset ve intikal vergisi mükellefleriyle KDV’ye muhatap olan tüketicilerden oluşan 395 adet vergi mükellefinin anket sorularına verdiği yanıtlar analiz edilmiş ve sağlanan bulgular ışığında değerlendirmeler yapılmıştır. Çalışmadan sağlanan bazı önemli bulgular şöyle özetlenebilir: Diyarbakır’da yaşayan mükelleflerin büyük bölümü ödedikleri verginin yükünü çok ağır hissetmekte, vergilerin adaletli olmadığını düşünmektedirler. Vergi mükelleflerinin çoğunluğu devletten bekledikleri kamu hizmetlerinin karşılı¬ğı olarak düşündükleri vergileri, aldıkları kamu hizmetine oranla fazla bulmaktadırlar. Mükelleflerin büyük bir bölümü de, ödedikleri vergilerle finanse edilen kamu harcamala¬rında savurganlığın olduğuna inanmaktadır. Bu yüzden, mükelleflere yöneltilen devletin artan gelir gereksiniminin nasıl karşılaması gerektiği sorusuna, mükelleflerin yarısına yakını devletin harcamalarını kısması gerektiğini savunmaktadır. Mükelleflerin yarıya yakını vergi kaçıran diğer mükelleflerin bu davranışını hoş karşılamamaktadır. Ayrıca, mükellefler vergi aflarına da sıcak bakmamaktadırlar.

[fre] Faut-il moduler les cotisations patronales à l'assurance chômage ?. . L'objet de cet article est d'étudier les conséquences d'une modulation des cotisations patronales à l'assurance chômage sur un marché du travail de type « européen », avec des coûts de licenciement, des emplois à durée déterminée et un salaire minimum. L'étalonnage d'un modèle de flux prenant en compte de telles caractéristiques suggère que la modulation des cotisations patronales est susceptible d'accroître l'emploi et l'efficacité économique sur ce type de marché du travail.
