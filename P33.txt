P33|Globalization and state capitalism: Assessing Vietnam's accession to the WTO|What do state-owned enterprises (SOEs) do? How do they respond to market incentives? Can we expect substantial efficiency gains from trade liberalization in economies with a strong presence of SOEs? Using a new dataset of Vietnamese firms we document a set of empirical regularities distinguishing SOEs from private firms. Then we empirically study the effect of the 2007 WTO accession on selection, competition, and productivity. Our results show that WTO entry is associated with higher probability of exit, lower firm profitability, and substantial increases in productivity for private firms but not for SOEs. Our estimates suggest that the overall productivity gains would have been about 40% larger in a counterfactual Vietnamese economy without SOEs. We highlight some economic mechanisms possibly driving these findings through the lenses of a model of trade with heterogeneous private and state-owned firms. The model suggests that political/regulatory barriers to entry and access to credit are key drivers of the different response of SOEs to trade liberalization. Further empirical tests broadly validate these insights.
P33|Is favoritism a threat to Chinese aid effectiveness? A subnational analysis of Chinese development projects|Chinese aid comes with few strings attached, allowing recipient country leaders to use it for domestic political purposes. The vulnerability of Chinese aid to political capture has prompted speculation that it may be economically ineffective, or even harmful. We test these claims by estimating the effect of Chinese aid on subnational economic development - as measured by per-capita nighttime light emissions - and whether this effect is different in politically favored jurisdictions than in other parts of the country. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, we do not nd that the local receipt of Chinese aid undermines economic development outcomes at either the district level or provincial level. Nor does political favoritism in the allocation of Chinese aid towards the home regions of recipient country leaders reduce its effectiveness. Our results - from 709 provinces and 5,835 districts within 47 African countries from 2001-2012 - demonstrate that Chinese aid improves local development outcomes, regardless of whether such aid is allocated to politically consequential jurisdictions.
P33|Current account dynamics and exchange rate regimes in Central and Eastern Europe|The paper seeks to determine the factors that drive the current account dynamics of the 11 EU members from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Panel data models are estimated on annual data for the period 1997â€“2017 and both domestic pull factors and external push factors are included. The models are, as a key innovation, estimated separately for floating and fixed exchange rate regimes. The current account exhibits substantial persistence in both cases. For the floaters, the current account has been driven by domestic factors while external factors appear unimportant. For the fixers, the current account has mainly been driven by external factors, suggesting there is substantial vulnerability to external developments. The analysis underscores the importance of the exchange rate regime for the drivers of the current account balance in the CEE countries.
P33|Diversification des exportations, investissements directs étrangers et croissance économique en Afrique Subsaharienne<BR>[Export diversification, foreign direct investment and economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa]|Abstract The objective of this article is to analyse the effects of export diversification and foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic growth. Second, to examine whether foreign direct investment (FDI) can contribute to export diversification. We have adopted a methodology based on the generalized moments method in dynamic panel system over the period 1990-2014 for forty-seven (47) sub-Saharan African countries. The results of our estimates show a positive impact of export diversification on economic growth. This positive impact would be greater through the number of export lines that sub-Saharan African countries will create. On the other hand, the concentration of exports based on raw materials and manufactured value added have a negative impact on GDP per capita growth. This negative effect is due to the concentration of FDI in the raw materials sector. It would therefore make sense for sub-Saharan African countries to diversify FDI in several sectors, which will allow them to create a larger number of potential export lines for growth.
P33|Moving Into the Slow Lane|Growth in much of CESEE will remain healthy by post-crisis standards, but has passed its peak. We expect most economies to slow from here, reflecting weaker external demand and domestic capacity constraints. Global trade tensions, structural weakness in the eurozone and Brexit all pose downside risks to our forecasts.
P33|Georgia’s Economic Performance: Bright Spots and Remaining Challenges|Georgia has long been one of the most trade-open economies in the world. It joined WTO in 2000 and currently has a free trade agreement with the EU and EFTA, as well as with Turkey, the CIS and China. Georgia has been also one of the most business-friendly countries. The basic objectives of Georgia’s trade policy are integration, liberalisation, diversification and transparency. The Association Agreement (AA) with the EU signed in June 2014 and in force since July 2016 lays the foundations for far-reaching political and economic cooperation with the EU and serves as a backbone for reforms. The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) agreement that represents a part of AA envisages a gradual implementation of reforms in areas such as trade, environment, agriculture, tourism, energy, transport and education with the aim to bring Georgia in line with EU standards. The DCFTA sets a path for further reforms in trade-related policies, such as hygiene standards for agriculture products, the approximation of regulations for industrial products, enforcement of intellectual property rights at the border, rules on public procurement and approximation to EU rules in the services area. However, there is no prospect for EU membership in the Agreement. Georgia has been suffering from chronic goods trade and current account deficits; the export base has been very narrow. Foreign trade has been regionally focused on its neighbouring partners. Russia is the largest export market, ahead of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Turkey and China. Among the EU countries, the biggest markets for Georgian exports are Bulgaria and Romania. Exports are highly concentrated and there has not been much export diversification yet. The key exports to the EU include copper ores (39% of the total), nuts, nitrogen fertilisers and mineral oils. The DCFTA apparently has not had much positive effect on Georgian exports to the EU so far, despite some spectacular increases by individual products. Rather than in goods exports, Georgia has a competitive advantage in services, especially in tourism and transit transport. Georgia has been also relatively successful in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) cumulated inward FDI stocks amounted to about EUR 4,000 per capita as of mid-2018. A development strategy combining existing competitive advantages of tourism with domestic agriculture (using the excellent domestic wine and delicious local food), supported by structural reforms in the agricultural sector and targeted FDI policies, could be a viable option to foster inclusive economic growth and mitigate external vulnerabilities.
P33|Osteuropa trotzt dem globalen Gegenwind|This publication is available in German language only. For a brief English summary see further below. Die Konjunktur in den mittel-, ost- und südosteuropäischen Ländern (MOSOEL) kühlt sich zwar ab, aber viel weniger als noch im Frühjahr erwartet Die Prognosen für heuer wurden für die Mehrheit der Länder nach oben revidiert. Vor allem in der EU-MOE-Region hat sich das Wachstum vom Abschwung im Euro-Raum recht deutlich abgekoppelt. In einigen Ländern mehren sich sogar die Anzeichen einer Überhitzung, die allerdings nur in Rumänien Anlass zur Sorge gibt. Die Westbalkanländer profitieren von steigenden FDI-Zuflüssen, mehrere GUS-Länder von der expansiven Fiskalpolitik. In Russland dagegen hat der restriktive fiskalpolitische Kurs die Wirtschaft an den Rand einer Rezession gebracht. Die Wirtschaftskrise in der Türkei erwies sich zwar tiefer als früher erwartet, dürfte aber spätestens 2020 überwunden sein. Insbesondere die Visegrád-Staaten gehören zu Österreichs wichtigsten Wirtschaftspartnern. Ihnen waren im Jahr 2018 mehr als 10% des österreichischen Güterhandels, 20% der Einkommen aus Direktinvestitionen sowie 40% der Auslandsforderungen österreichischer Banken zuzurechnen. Gleichzeitig sind sie auch EU-Mitglieder mit brisanten politischen und wirtschaftlichen Herausforderungen, von welchen auch Österreich nicht unberührt bleiben wird. English Summary Eastern Europe standing firm in face of global headwinds The economy in the Central, East and Southeast European countries (CESEE) is cooling down, but much less than expected in the spring the forecasts for this year have been revised upwards for the majority of countries. Particularly in the EU-CEE region, growth has decoupled quite clearly from the downturn in the euro area. In several countries there are even signs of overheating, although only in Romania this is a cause for concern. The Western Balkans are benefiting from rising FDI inflows, while several CIS countries from expansionary fiscal policy. In Russia, on the other hand, the restrictive fiscal policy has brought the economy to the brink of recession. Although the economic crisis in Turkey proved to be deeper than previously expected, it should be overcome by 2020 at the latest. The Visegrád countries, in particular, prove very important for the Austrian economy. In 2018, they accounted for more than 10% of Austrian goods trade, 20% of income generated by Austrian investment abroad, as well as 40% of foreign claims of Austrian banks. At the same time, they are among the EU Member States facing increasing political and economic challenges, by which Austria will not be unaffected.

P33|Analysis on the Openness and Economic Welfare of North Korea (in Korean)|"North Korea's trade volume in 2016 was three times higher than in the mid-1990s. North Korea's external openness seems to have considerably increased, but it still faces difficulties in expanding its external openness due to economic sanctions by the international community. This study uses Arkolakis, Costinot and Rodriguez-Claire's model (ACR model), which measures the economic welfare effects of various international trade models. In the ACR model, the ""import penetration ratio,"" which is the ratio of imports to domestic demand, indicates the degree of external openness, and ""gains from trade"" is a measure of the real income growth rate that occurs when switching from a closed to an open economy. We estimated the import penetration rate and gains from trade of North Korea during 1996-2016 using North Korean foreign trade data from UN Comtrade, IMF DOTS and KOTRA as well as inter-Korean trade data from the Unification Ministry of Korea. The main results of this study are as follows. North Korea's import penetration rate has shown a gradual increase, indicating an expansion of international openness. This trend has become especially clear since 2000 when the North Korean economy began stabilizing after the end of â€œthe Hardship March,â€ although it faltered slightly from 2014 to 2016. In addition, it is estimated that gains from trade is in the range of 1.5%-4.5% based on real income, and the annual change trend is similar to that of the import penetration rate."
P33|Has CEFTA Increased Members’ Mutual Trade? Evidence with an Enlarged Set of Plausibly Exogenous Instruments|The objective of the paper is to measure the effect of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) in its today’s composition on members’ mutual trade. Special consideration is given to CEFTA endogeneity stemming from members’ will to form a trade bloc as a vehicle to approximate EU sooner and prevent further misunderstandings in the Balkan. We use a Conditional Mixed Process estimator whereby CEFTA is instrumented by a set of variables measuring democracy and governments’ negotiation will. The recent Conley et al. (2012) method is used to deal with only plausibly exogenous instruments. The 1996-2015 period is covered. Results suggest that CEFTA played quantitatively large and statistically significant role for its members. When endogeneity is considered, the effect of CEFTA on its members’ mutual trade is found even higher by 50% to 61%. This may indirectly suggest that CEFTA trading power has been drawn not only from countries’ GDPs and proximity, but also from their governments’ will to establish level playing field for cooperation and approach the EU quicker. However, if instruments’ strict exogeneity cannot be secured by the means of argument or statistical tools, then results suggest that CEFTA effect’s amplification may be rather driven, at least partially, by the correlation between the instrument and trade shocks.
P33|The Impact of Foreign Aid on Aggregate Welfare Measures: A Panel Data Analysis|Does foreign aid enhance aggregate human welfare? This paper attempts to answer this question by using a panel of twenty-eight countries, covering the period from 1990 to 2014. It explores intra-country variation by splitting the sample into low-income and middle-income countries. Combined with the fixed effects estimator, these approaches sought to control for the heterogeneity of the effects of aid on welfare measures. Perhaps suprisingly, there was no evidence that foreign aid contributes to the reduction of infant mortality or increase of human development index.
P33|China's go out policy - a review on China's promotion policy for outward foreign direct investment from a historical perspective|China became the second largest outward investor for first ever in 2015. The dominant role of Chinese “go out” policy on such rising OFDI is agreed by a growing number of literatures. This paper presents historical view of that policy and discuss how the government is helping Chinese MNEs to invest abroad. Overall, the “go out” policy has been through four stages, from the initiation, to the formalization, to the expansion and to the new era. As breakthroughs have been made, the regulatory framework is still cumbersome. Although the central government is working on simplification and deregulation, the latest change of the framework might be seen as a signal of centralization. While several challenges ahead, the dominant role of Chinese SOEs in OFDI and the market asymmetry between China and other countries are two problems that worries foreign investors the most.
P33|Pull factors for Chinese FDI in East Central Europe|Chinese companies have increasingly targeted East Central European (ECE) countries in the past one and a half decades. This development is quite a new phenomenon but not an unexpected one. On one hand, the transformation of the global economy and the restructuring of China’s economy are responsible for growing Chinese interest in the developed world, including the European Union. On the other hand, ECE countries have also become more open to Chinese business opportunities, especially after the global economic and financial crisis with the intention of decreasing their economic dependency on Western (European) markets. In ECE, China can benefit a lot from the EU’s core and peripheral type of division. For China, the region represents dynamic, largely developed, less saturated markets, new frontiers for export expansion, new entry points to Europe and cheap but qualified labour. This adds up to less political expectations, less economic complaints, less protectionist barriers and less national security concerns in the ECE region compared to the Western European neighbours.
P33|The Determinants of Young Firms Growth in Tunisia|The aim of this paper is to investigate the growth dynamics of young small firms (in contrast with larger and older incumbents) in a developing country context, using a unique and comprehensive dataset of non-agricultural Tunisian companies. Our results suggest that significant differences between young and mature firms can be found as far as the drivers of their growth are concerned. The key finding being that − while consistently with the extant literature Gibrat's law is overall rejected − the negative impact of the initial size is significantly larger for young than mature firms. This result has interesting policy implications: since smaller young firms are particularly conducive to employment generation, they can be considered good candidate for targeted accompanying policies addressed to sustain their post-entry growth.
P33|Export structure and performance in a landlocked transitional economy: The case of Kyrgyz Republic|Thanks to the market-oriented reforms undertaken since the early 1990s, the Kyrgyz Republic has emerged as one of the most globally integrated economies in the former Soviet space and the centre of entrepôt trade in Central Asia. However, the patterns of global economic integration of the Kyrgyz economy have so far been rather lopsided. While there have been some notable changes in the structure of exports in line with the country’s comparative advantage, export expansion has not kept pace with rapid import penetration in the economy. This has led to increased dependence of the economy on migrant-worker remittances and external financing. The composition of external financing has begun to shift from grants and concessionary loans towards borrowing at commercial rates, thus potentially exposing the economy to additional external economic shocks. A major contemporary policy challenge faced by the country is broadening the export base. This requires speedy implementation of behind-the-border reforms to supplement the significant opening of the economy to foreign trade and investment.
P33|North Korea: Sanctions, Engagement and Strategic Reorientation|This paper examines the roles that sanctions, and inducements might play in resolving the North Korea problem. It finds that while the “maximum pressure” narrative is plausible, the evidence to substantiate it is thin. Likewise, the North Korean regime is aware of the potentially constraining (or even destabilizing) political implications of cross‐border economic integration and has acted to structure engagement in ways to blunt its transformative impact. Maximizing the transformative possibilities of engagement will require conscious planning by North Korea's partners. Multilateral guidelines and voluntary codes on corporate conduct could be used to anchor this process, but they will only be effective if there is greater political commitment to such norms than has been witnessed to date. Without such commitments, engagement risks enabling North Korea's doctrine of the parallel development of the economy and weapons of mass destruction.
P33|Studiu retrospectiv privind comerțul exterior al României în ultimii 100 de ani<BR>[A retrospective study on Romania’s external trade in the past 100 years]|Throughout the last century, Romania's economy has suffered major adverse costs, especially caused by external factors, with an adverse impact both on the volume of foreign trade and its commodity structure and geographical orientation. The study focuses on the evolution of Romania's foreign trade over the past 100 years trying to highlight the main features and trends in the different stages of the Romanian economy development, covering the periods 1918-1947, 1948-1989 and 1990-2017, marked by the the interwar economy particularities, the socialist political and economic regime, and the Romania's transition to the market economy, in the context of pre-accession and integration in the European Union. The presentation of the main coordinates of Romania's trade policies precedes the foreign trade quantitative and qualitative analysis for each of the above mentioned periods.
P33|Evoluția capitalului în România în secolul 1918-2018 de la Marea Unire la tranziția la economia de piață<BR>[Romania’s capital developments during 1918-2018 century from the Great Union to the market economy transition]|The paper focuses on the evolution of the capital in Romania, in three extremely different periods during the last century, under the changes of internal / international context and political regimes, with special emphasis on the relationship with the country economic development. In the years 1918-1945, the share of foreign capital in the capital of joint-stock companies was higher compared to domestic capital, which is explained by the interest of foreign investors to seek relatively cheap resources and production factors in Romania. A certain role of foreign investments in this period to the development of several industrial sectors is broadly recognized in the special literature. In the socialist period, 1948-1989, characterized by the insignificant size of foreign capital in Romania (excepting some few failed joint venture companies), the accelerated accumulation of capital and the fast increase of fixed assets led to an excessive development of production overcapacities, with relatively low efficiency, energy-intensive and polluting, what created severe economic and financial imbalances, ended with the collapse of the system. During the transition period to the market economy, 1990-2018, marked, in the first decade, by a certain degradation of the domestic capital due to the bankruptcy and/or unsuccesful privatization of state-owned companies, after the year 2000, at the same time with the gradual integration in the euro-atlantic structures, the foreign investors have increased significantly their presence in Romania, entering in a competitive relationship with the domestic capital and production.
P33|Strong Growth Amid Increased Negative Risks|The outlook for growth in CESEE remains generally positive, but downside risks have increased significantly since our last forecast. The main areas of concern are the developing US-China trade war and the potential for a renewed outbreak of the eurozone crisis.
P33|Riding the Global Growth Wave|Aggregate real GDP growth in CESEE is at its strongest level for six years, and in 2017 all economies in the region expanded for the first time in a decade. External conditions are highly supportive of growth in CESEE. All the big engines of the global economy – the US, China and the eurozone – are expanding strongly together for the first time since 2010. The coordinated global upswing has further to run, and we expect CESEE economies to continue to benefit in the coming years. EU-CEE and Turkey will grow strongly during our forecast period, while activity in the Western Balkans will pick up from recent years. The CIS and Ukraine will remain the regional laggards, but will continue to recover slowly. We do not think that any economy in the region is ‘overheating’, although there are growing risks in Romania and Turkey. We expect inflation to remain very subdued in most of CESEE during the forecast period. In parts of CESEE, large-scale Ukrainian migration is helping to relieve labour market tightness. Wage increases in most of CESEE have been strong, but are concentrated largely in the manufacturing sector, and have been more than offset by rising labour productivity and non-price competitiveness. External competitiveness is not in danger. Across the region, investment will rise faster than headline real GDP growth in 2018-2020, driven by low interest rates, high capacity utilisation, stronger confidence, EU funds and still low base effects. Most countries have seen their export/GDP shares rise in the past decade, which increases their ability to take advantage of the current upswing. Many are moving up the value chain. Banking sectors in CESEE are generally on a much stronger footing than a few years ago. However, the old pre-crisis, highly leveraged model reliant on foreign inflows is mostly a thing of the past, meaning that credit growth will be relatively low by historical standards in the coming years. Downside risks to regional growth emanating from local and global factors are significant. In particular, we are worried about a trade war, the exit of major central banks from extraordinarily loose monetary policy, pockets of high corporate and government leverage, east/west EU splits, the undermining of institutional independence in some countries, geopolitical tensions, the Ukraine crisis, and potential spill-overs from a renewed outbreak of volatility in the eurozone, or a Chinese debt crisis. Convergence with Western European income levels will proceed in the long term. However, there is a risk that specialisation in parts of the supply chain where little value is created will condemn the region to a permanent ‘semi-periphery trap’.
P33|Investment in the Western Balkans|New Directions and Financial Constraints in Infrastructure Investment Investment in infrastructure is important to generating long-term productivity gains. The Western Balkans lack infrastructure capacity and investment – particularly in non-traditional sectors such as water, sewerage, waste, health, social affairs and education. Two important regional infrastructure investment initiatives are active in the Western Balkans the European Western Balkans Investment Framework WBIF and the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative BRI. Both are focusing on traditional infrastructure such as energy and transport and both come with a volume of about EUR 8 billion in loans. The European initiative has in addition provided for some EUR 800 million in grants and has an emphasis on Green Economy projects. Overall infrastructure investment needs in the region are huge. Lower bound estimates of additional investment needs only in alternative infrastructure investment for the next five years are at around EUR 800 million. The financial conditions in the region are underdeveloped but improving. Nevertheless, external debt levels have increased substantially since the outbreak of the global financial crisis and thus pose a serious threat to economic stability in a situation when the global interest rates are again on the rise. Thus, substantially hiking up investment in traditional as well as non-traditional infrastructure in the Western Balkans without dramatically increasing the countries’ indebtedness is the primary duty in order to achieve higher long-run productivity growth and provide the population a perspective for a better future without a need to migrate. Short-run pragmatic policy recommendations include Western Balkan governments should rebalance their infrastructure investment mix to support the Green Economy; the new EU IPA III funds should be rearranged to focus more on Western Balkan alternative infrastructure sectors; in order to create the necessary financial leeway for more public investment in non-traditional infrastructure, national governments in the Western Balkans could adopt the Austrian ASFINAG model; similarly, PPP projects might be considered but these need particularly good management; the IFIs should issue GDP-linked loans for crucial investment in the region in order to avoid macro-financial crises in the future. Long-run forward-thinking policy recommendations include a Joint Project Pipeline of a Common Western Balkans Investment Committee with supranational overruling powers representing the infrastructure interests of the whole region; the creation of a Western Balkans Regional Infrastructure Fund with a much bigger volume and much stronger grant component than the current Western Balkans Investment Framework in order to curb the influence of external players in the region and reduce indebtedness; joining the euro area – even if only with limited rights, e.g. without voting rights – before EU accession would be a powerful tool to bring down interest rates and improve the financial conditions for both the private as well as the public sector’s investment. Acknowledging that often political tensions are a barrier to greater connectivity and trade between countries, support for infrastructure investment could be used as a bargaining chip in EU-brokered negotiations to solve long-standing political stalemates in the Western Balkans.
P33|MOSOE: Konjunkturzenit überschritten|This publication is available in German language only. For a brief English summary see further below. MOSOE Konjunkturzenit überschritten Die jüngsten Statistiken deuten auf ein weiterhin robustes BIP-Wachstum in den meisten Ländern Mittel‑, Ost- und Südosteuropas (MOSOEL) hin. Der konjunkturelle Höhepunkt scheint allerdings bereits überschritten zu sein. Einerseits lässt die Dynamik der privaten Konsumnachfrage leicht nach, andererseits dämpft die Konjunkturabkühlung im Euro-Raum die Exportentwicklung vieler MOSOEL. Die Investitionen steigen weiterhin kräftig an, getrieben in erster Linie von EU-Transfers in der EU-MOE-Region und von ausländischen Direktinvestitionen im Westbalkan. Ein deutlicher Wachstumseinbruch ist heuer nur in Rumänien und der Türkei zu erwarten – Ländern, deren Wirtschaft sich bislang in einem Zustand der „Überhitzung“ befand. Vor dem Hintergrund der österreichischen EU-Ratspräsidentschaft und divergierender Handelspolitiken der weltgrößten Volkswirtschaften werden auch die immer engeren wirtschaftlichen Verflechtungen Österreichs mit den MOSOEL analysiert. Insbesondere die Visegrád-Staaten gewinnen für den österreichischen Güterhandel, Tourismus und auch als Investitionsstandorte an Gewicht. Österreich präsentiert sich als Top-10-Exportdestination für sieben der MOSOEL, für acht zählt es zu den zehn wichtigsten Ländern für Importe, und für siebzehn Länder rangiert Österreich unter den Top-10-Investoren. Ausgewählte Indikatoren zu den österreichischen Wirtschaftsbeziehungen mit den MOSOEL können kostenlos über interaktive Visualisierungen erkundet werden. English Summary CESEE Growth has passed its peak The latest statistics point to ongoing robust GDP growth in most countries of Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE). However, the growth peak seems to have already been passed. On the one hand, private consumer demand is weakening slightly; on the other hand, the economic slowdown in the eurozone is dampening the export performance of many CESEE countries. Investment continues to grow strongly, driven primarily by EU transfers in the EU-CEE and by foreign direct investment in the Western Balkans. A significant slump in growth this year can only be expected in Romania and Turkey, countries whose economies have been ‘overheating’. In the context of the Austrian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and diverging trade policies of the two largest economies in the world, we analyse the deepening economic relations between Austria and the CESEE countries. The Visegrád states in particular are gaining weight for Austrian trade in goods, tourism and as FDI destinations. From the perspective of CESEE, Austria represents a top 10 export destination for seven countries, a top 10 source country for imports for eight countries and a top 10 investor for even seventeen countries in the region.

P33|Democracy and aid donorship|Almost half of the world's states provide bilateral development assistance. While previous research takes the set of donor countries as exogenous, this article is the first to explore the determinants of aid donorship. We hypothesize that democratic institutions reduce poor countries' likelihood to initiate aid giving. On the contrary, the leadership of poor authoritarian regimes face fewer constraints that would hinder these governments to reap the benefits of a development aid program despite popular opposition. To test our expectations, we build a new global dataset on aid donorship since 1945 and apply an instrumental-variables strategy that exploits exogenous variation in regional waves of democratization. Our results confirm that the likelihood of a democratic country to start aid giving is more responsive to income than it is the case for authoritarian countries. Overall, democracies are - if anything - less rather than more likely to engage in aid giving.
P33|Digital connectivity & e-commerce: Overview of financing flows and examples of aid for trade support|Digital networks are an increasingly critical component of global trade. In 2017, the Global Review of Aid for Trade highlighted the importance of accessible and affordable connections for trade connectivity. Drawing extensively on information harvested in the Monitoring and Evaluation exercise in preparation for the Review, this paper analyses aid for trade for digital connectivity and e-commerce. Also presented in this paper are the types of issues and challenges faced in cross-border electronic transactions - an area in which demand for support is set to grow. The paper also surveys flows reported to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Creditor Reporting System. Funds disbursed to digital connectivity amounted to US$6.6 billion in concessional financing and US$8.3 billion in non-concessional financing in the period 2006-2016. The top providers of financing were the European Union, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the World Bank Group. The paper also highlights the various methodological difficulties encountered, and explains the need to further refine reporting definitions so as to better capture financing flows to digital connectivity and to understand how aid for trade is being used to leverage private sector financing for ICT. The analysis concludes by reviewing the catalytic role that aid for trade is playing in mobilizing private sector financing. Research for the 2017 Global Review suggests that both developing countries and donors view ICT connectivity as an area where demand for financing will grow in future.
P33|Nonparametric Counterfactual Predictions in Neoclassical Models of International Trade|We develop a methodology to construct nonparametric counterfactual predictions, free of functional form restrictions on preferences and technology, in neoclassical models of international trade. First, we establish the equivalence between such models and reduced exchange models in which countries directly exchange factor services. This equivalence implies that, for an arbitrary change in trade costs, counterfactual changes in the factor content of trade, factor prices, and welfare only depend on the shape of a reduced factor demand system. Second, we provide sufficient conditions under which estimates of this system can be recovered nonparametrically. Together, these results offer a strict generalization of the parametric approach used in so-called gravity models. Finally, we use China's recent integration into the world economy to illustrate the feasibility and potential benefits of our approach.
P33|Transaction costs and recorded remittances in the post-Soviet economies: Evidence from a new dataset on bilateral flows|Labour migrants' remittances are a rapidly growing phenomenon in the countries of the former Soviet Union. The size and growth of remittances in the countries of the recipients brought the issue under the scrutiny of researchers and policymakers. In this paper we investigate the main factors behind the growing volume of remittances in the post-Soviet space. By applying panel data techniques we found that a reduction in transaction costs and a depreciation of the currency in the host country were the main factors that influenced the growth of recorded remittances. The size of transaction costs remains a significant predictor of the volume of formal remittances, even after correcting for endogeneity using an instrumental variable estimator. The inverse relationship between transaction costs and recorded remittances suggests that migrants switch from informal channels to formal channels to send remittances when costs are low. Thus lower transaction costs may help curb the proportion of informal flows and lead to increased use of remittances in the formal economy.
P33|Nationalism and economic openness: The cross-country evidence revisited|In this paper we examine the empirical relationship between economic openness and nationalism. We replicate and extend the cross-country analysis of Lan and Li (2015) using additional measures of nationalism and additional years of data from the World Values Survey. We fail to find the negative relationship between economic openness and nationalism that Lan and Li (2015) find, even when using the same data sources, years and sample of countries. When we expand the sample of countries and years of the data, we find no statistically significant relationship between economic openness and nationalism.
P33|Re-Opening the Silk Road to Transform Chinese Trade|Under anti-globalization and isolationism, China is seeking to portray itself as a new leader for globalization under the banner of the Silk Road initiative. Meanwhile, China’s traditional and comparatively advantaged industry, silk, has faced dire predicaments and challenges for long time, and needs a transformation in terms of initiatives. Throughout history, the prosperity arising from silk was supposed to represent a microcosm of Chinese society. This paper searches the breakthrough point to improve the current dilemma of Chinese silk enterprises; uses a Case Study for inductive reasoning that is feasible for marketing strategies; and provides a strategy to help Chinese silk enterprises to transform their market positioning and operating modes to obtain better development opportunities. The paper also analyzes the new external environment based on the “One Belt, One Road” principle, which is of crucial importance for the implementation of new marketing strategies..
P33|Driving forces behind the international expansion strategies of Chinese MNEs|The rise of multinational enterprises (MNEs) from emerging markets is topical, important and poses a number questions and challenges that require considerable attention in the future from academia as well as business management. This rise is driven by the Asian economy, mainly China, as Chinese MNEs have become important players in several regions around the globe, ranging from the least developed countries to the developed markets, including East Central Europe. Although several components of the strategy and attitude of Chinese MNEs are in line with what can be observed for MNEs from developed countries, but some components – with regard to motivations, operational practice and challenges – are different. Therefore, this paper will focus on these specificities of Chinese outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) in order to better understand the rise of Chinese MNEs.
P33|Structural Changes in the Russian Outward Banking Foreign Direct Investment|Following recent government initiatives, such as the shift (turn) to the East and the possibility of establishing new economic and investment cooperation with the Asia-Pacific region and other regions, proposed in conditions of financial and economic sanctions imposed towards Russia by the West, the study aims to evaluate whether any significant structural changes in the Russian outward banking foreign direct investment emerged in 2013-17 as the result of the proposed initiatives. By analyzing both the macro-picture of outward banking foreign direct investment and behavioral patterns of Russian banks since 1990s, the study found that only a marginal number of Russian banks, comprising of large state-owned banks, banks closely related to the natural resource-type Russian multinational corporations, and large private banks, have the capacity to expand their operations abroad. While the increasing presence of the natural resource-type Russian multinational corporations in the Asian and African regions is slowly luring Russian banks into these markets, drastic structural changes in the outward banking foreign direct investment are unachievable in the short-term. The geographical distribution of Russian banks remains unchanged with offshore financial centers, Europe, and the Commonwealth of Independent States being the traditional destinations of Russian outward banking foreign direct investment.
P33|Foreign Direct Investment Drivers and Growth in Central and Eastern Europe in the Aftermath of the 2007 Global Financial Crisis|Abstract Our paper provides new insights on the developments and the drivers of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Central and Eastern European countries over the period 1993–2014, whilst taking into account the occurrence of the 2007 and 2011 crises. We apply a panel data general-to-specific approach and show that FDI inflows are driven by both external (i.e. macroeconomic and financial conditions in the euro area, global macroeconomic conditions and global risk environment) and domestic determinants (past FDI, human capital, market size, infrastructure, competitiveness, corporate tax system, risk premium, trade openness, geographical proximity to Western Europe, accession to the European Union and progress in implementing structural reforms). In addition, through a dynamic panel data analysis, we find a positive impact of FDI inflows on economic growth. We show that, despite the severe decline in FDI and real GDP growth rates at the onset of the 2007 crisis, the positive impact of FDI inflows on economic growth has amplified during this crisis, whilst it has become non-significant during the 2011 crisis.
P33|US and China aid to Africa: Impact on the donor-recipient trade relations|This paper investigates the impact of the US and China's foreign aids to Africa on trade flows between donor and recipient countries. Evidence from the gravity model estimates reveals that the two donors' exports are strengthened by their aids to African partners. Interestingly, China's aid shows a positive effect on its total volume of trade and imports from Africa, while the aid from the US exhibits little impact on the US-Africa total trade and its imports from Africa. A possible explanation for such a difference could be due to the dissimilar national interests of donors in Africa. This study finally suggests that African countries should accelerate the pace of advancing domestic economies and rely less on foreign assistance, in order to establish a fairer and more equal international economic order.
P33|The Analogue Method Comes Unfastened – The Awkward Space between Market and Non-Market Economies in EC–Fasteners (Article 21.5)|The compliance Appellate Body decision marks the latest twist in the long-running EC-Fasteners dispute. The question before the AB is whether the European Union complied with earlier rulings on its antidumping procedures. Broadly, the AB found that the EU had not, generally ruling in favor of the People’s Republic of China. In the process, the AB raised interesting questions about what it means to be a Non-Market Economy (NME) in the WTO. While NME status has traditionally led to large dumping margins, the AB approach in this case may lessen the consequences for China. Among other things, the case raises the interesting and important question of how pervasive the taint of NME status may be when calculating margins. By allowing for adjustments of certain costs, the AB seems to constrain the more draconian analogue country methodology of calculation.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P33|CESEE Back on Track to Convergence|GDP forecasts for 2017 have been revised upwards for all Central and East European EU Member States (EU-CEE). Farther east, especially in Russia, but also in the Western Balkans, the post-crisis recovery has been much weaker. Private consumption is the main growth driver, underpinned by rising wages and household incomes. Nonetheless, CESEE labour cost competitiveness is not yet endangered. Gradually, along with expanding private consumption, investments have also gained strength and have increasingly emerged as a driver of growth. Trade balances have improved, and many EU-CEE countries (as well as Russia) also report current account surpluses. Growth is thus becoming broader based, more robust, and probably also more sustainable. Improvements in labour markets are spectacular, with rising employment levels mirrored by declining unemployment. Simultaneously, emerging labour shortages are acting as a potential constraint on future growth. In terms of current GDP growth prospects, the CESEE region is split into three sub-regions the EU-CEE, with average annual growth close to 4% in the forecasting period; the Western Balkans, with GDP growing by around 3% per year; and finally, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Ukraine, where growth will be around 2% annually in the medium term. The EU-CEE region is thus catching up again with Western Europe, and the process of economic convergence has resumed at a greater pace than previously expected. This catching-up process will continue probably for the rest of the decade. Importantly, economic convergence is not expected to resume in Russia, where the lack of structural change, lasting investment climate deficiencies and geopolitical conflicts impose a burden on growth. Meagre growth in Russia adversely affects the growth prospects of her CIS partners. But there are several other CESEE countries where recent political developments are not very conducive to growth and European integration in the medium term. However, for the moment, economic growth seems to be unaffected by domestic political instability. Globally, economic resilience persists, regardless of the elevated geopolitical risks. The Forecast Report also includes three special topics (on income convergence with Western Europe, on euro accession and on higher yields on hard currency sovereign debt in CESEE). The key findings of these reports are Convergence in terms of per capita GDP levels in CESEE is a long-term process; by 2050, most of the region will only have bridged half the current gap with the EU-28 level; during the next decade, no country in the region will catch up with average EU-28 wealth levels, and advanced EU-CEE countries like Poland and Hungary will not even reach the 80% mark. Despite sustained criticism since its inception, the euro may yet survive and attract new members in the EU-CEE; it is in the interests of Croatia and Bulgaria to join, and is potentially advantageous for Hungary and Poland; the case is less clear cut for the Czech Republic and Romania, although in neither case would accession be harmful. Many CESEE sovereigns are not in a markedly better shape to deal with a sharp rise in debt yields than they were 10 years ago, and in some cases they are in a worse position; for countries with heavy debt loads and little apparent prospect of achieving high and sustained growth, bond markets could panic, leading to funding difficulties; Ukraine stands out as particularly vulnerable from a sovereign risk perspective, while we conclude that Belarus and many countries in the Western Balkans are also in a weak position.
P33|Cautious Upturn in CESEE: Haunted by the Spectre of Uncertainty|Summary Growth in the CESEE economies will strengthen gradually, surpassing on average 3% by 2019. This growth will be driven by consumption and increasing investment, amid a largely supportive international economic environment. Despite a rise in ULCs, competitiveness will not be endangered. Although the size of labour forces in CESEE is stagnating, data indicate an improvement in educational levels of workers. Meanwhile the tightness of labour markets will propel wage growth. The CESEE region as a whole is back on a convergence track, with an average positive growth differential of 1.2 pp vis-à-vis the euro area over the forecast horizon. Downside risks are significant, mostly stemming from political factors. The CESEE countries and Europe more broadly, together with the rest of the world, will be haunted by the spectre of political uncertainty; it is only to be hoped that, once fully roused, the ‘animal spirits’ of economic agents will shrug off the gloom. For the economies of CESEE, the international economic environment appears generally positive. In 2017-2018, GDP growth in the euro area is expected to hover around 1.7%. The international financial markets have stabilised and the current economic mood is improving. Because of the global recovery, the US Fed is expected to increase interest rates further in 2017, while oil prices are likely to rise. In the EU, disbursements from the payments cycle of the European Structural and Investment Funds are only just beginning, indicating higher co-financed investments in the EU‑CEE countries from this year onwards. Over recent quarters, GDP growth throughout almost the entire CESEE region has stabilised in positive territory. The only exception is Belarus, where growth is still in negative territory (albeit less so than was the case in 2015). The country is going through a painful adjustment process triggered by accumulated macroeconomic imbalances and its excessive dependence on Russia. Current wiiw CESEE GDP growth forecasts for 2017-2019 point to growth of around 3% for most of the region, with a slightly upward trend. The EU-CEE sub-region and the Western Balkan economies in particular should manage to attain average GDP growth rates of up to 3% and in some countries, such as Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Albania and Kosovo, the levels may be even higher. In Turkey, where growth slowed down markedly in 2016 to below 2% (down from around 6% in prior years) on account of the domestic political turmoil and deterioration in foreign relations, we also expect growth to be closer to 3% by the end of the forecast horizon. The CIS-3 economies will record increasing GDP growth rates, rising from more than 1% in 2017 to over 2% in 2019, given the higher oil prices. Over the same forecast period, economic growth in Ukraine is projected to accelerate gradually to 3% by 2018-2019 – barring all-out warfare in Donbas and abortion of the IMF programme. Private consumption and increasing investment will continue to be the main growth drivers over the forecast horizon. After the investment slump in 2016 attributable to the switch from the previous to the current EU (co-) financing period, investment in the EU-CEE economies will recover in the years ahead. Meanwhile the mood among consumers is improving and, due to changing spending patterns in the EU-CEE sub-region, this trend should prove durable. Tightening labour markets are conducive to major wage increases. Despite the general rise in unit labour costs, competitiveness does not seem to be endangered. Most of the latest industrial production figures for the CESEE countries are encouraging; they point to an ongoing improvement in industry structure and, in several cases, to re-industrialisation. Longer-term FDI trends hold particular promise for the Western Balkans. In Romania and Slovakia the prospects for future FDI increases are also quite good, especially in the automotive sector. Although the size of the labour force in CESEE countries is more or less stagnating, a marked improvement in education levels is evident, as a younger and better educated generation enters the work force. This hints at a potential general increase in labour quality across the region’s economies. Nevertheless, heightened uncertainties following the UK referendum on Brexit in June 2016 and the US presidential elections in November have cast a cloud over the improved economic conditions noted above. A number of worrying scenarios are quite conceivable that could ultimately make our forecasts appear upbeat and overoptimistic. Thanks to US President Donald Trump, a rise in global protectionism is possible, which would harm industry in the region. Mr Trump has also questioned post-war European security arrangements, thus causing consternation in some EU-CEE countries. Meanwhile, the growing irritation with the EU-CEE sub-region among some older EU Member States and the fallout from Brexit could possibly pose a threat to west-east fiscal transfers and the free movement of labour in their current forms. In the Western Balkans, any confrontational interventions by Russia and uncertainties as to developments in Turkey could prove quite disruptive, were the influence of the EU and USA in the region to decline. Increasing uncertainties in the CIS and Ukraine are mostly related to future commodity price developments (most importantly oil prices) and heightened geopolitical tensions. Three special sections of the forecast report shed more light on the issue of heightened uncertainties in the EU-CEE, the Western Balkans and the CIS+UA regions.
P33|Wirtschaftliche Konvergenz trotz politischer Unsicherheit|Zusammenfassung Wirtschaftliche Konvergenz trotz politischer Unsicherheit Das internationale Umfeld für die Wirtschaft der mittel-, ost- und südosteuropäischen Länder (MOSOEL) präsentiert sich als Kontrast zwischen wirtschaftlichem Aufschwung einerseits sowie politischer Unsicherheit und geopolitischen Spannungen andererseits. Kurzfristig setzen sich die positiven Effekte der wirtschaftlichen Erholung im Euroraum und der damit verbundenen Exporte, sowie des relativ niedrigen Ölpreises gegen mögliche negative Effekte politischer Turbulenzen durch. Gegenüber der wiiw-Frühjahrsprognose wurden die Wachstumsprognosen für die MOSOEL größtenteils nach oben auf 2,4% für das laufende Jahr und 2,6% für das Jahr 2018 korrigiert. English Summary Economic convergence despite political uncertainty The international environment for the economies in Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) is characterised by a contrast between economic upswing, on the one hand, and political uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, on the other hand. In the short term, positive effects of the economic recovery in the euro area and related exports, as well as of the relatively low oil price are prevailing over potential negative effects of political turmoil. Compared with the wiiw Spring Forecast, growth projections for the CESEE region were for the most part revised upwards, to 2.4% and 2.6% for the years 2017 and 2018, respectively.
P33|Federalism and Foreign Direct Investment: How Political Affiliation Determines the Spatial Distribution of FDI – Evidence from India|This paper links the foreign economic engagement of India's states with the literature on federalism, thereby contributing to an understanding of the political economy of FDI inflows in a parliamentary federal system. More specifically, it studies subnational governments' international engagements to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and investigates whether the political affiliations of states' chief ministers and parliamentarians determine the spatial distribution of FDI across the Indian states, correcting for the influence of per capita income, population density, urbanisation, infrastructure, policy regime, and human development. Although the central government plays no direct role in determining the state to which FDI goes, the centre-state relations in a federal structure play a role in creating perceptions about the relative political risk involved in different investment destinations. Employing multiple linear regressions to analyse time-series (2000-2013) cross-sectional (12 states) data using the panel procedure, the study finds that affiliated states attract relatively more FDI per capita in comparison to states ruled by opposition parties or coalition partners. However, some exceptions do result, primarily due to two phenomena: first, the presence of a strong state leadership and, second, the presence of a significant share of members of parliament belonging to the prime minister's party in the non-affiliated states. Further, states ruled by outside supporters have been most successful in attracting FDI inflows during the coalition period.
P33|Does trade openness contribute to driving financing flows for development?|Trade has been recognized in the 2030 development Agenda as well as in the Addis Ababa Agenda for Action as an important means for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper questions whether trade openness could be an important driver of financing for development flows, notably development aid (ODA), Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows, and government public revenue, the latter being the ultimate financing source for development for any country. The paper also takes advantage of the framework of analysis to investigate the interplay between these three types of financial flows. Relying on an unbalanced panel dataset comprising 125 countries, of which 37 are Least Developed Countries (LDCs), the empirical analysis uses the three stage least squares econometric approach and provides two important pieces of evidence: first, international trade openness is an important tool for driving financial flows for development, including government public revenue, development aid and FDI. As a result, it could contribute to mobilizing the substantial financial resources needed for development, including for the implementation of the SDGs. Second, there are strong interactions (complementarity and substitutability) between these three types of financing for development flows.
P33|Domestic Value Added in Exports: Theory and Firm Evidence from China|China has defied the declining trend in domestic content in exports in many countries. This paper studies China's rising domestic content in exports using firm- and customs transaction-level data. The approach embraces firm heterogeneity and hence reduces aggregation bias. The study finds that the substitution of domestic for imported materials by individual processing exporters caused China's domestic content in exports to increase from 65 to 70 percent in the period 2000-2007. Such substitution was induced by the country's trade and investment liberalization, which deepened its engagement in global value chains and led to a greater variety of domestic materials becoming available at lower prices.
P33|The Surprisingly Swift Decline of US Manufacturing Employment|This paper links the sharp drop in US manufacturing employment after 2000 to a change in US trade policy that eliminated potential tariff increases on Chinese imports. Industries more exposed to the change experience greater employment loss, increased imports from China, and higher entry by US importers and foreign-owned Chinese exporters. At the plant level, shifts toward less labor-intensive production and exposure to the policy via input-output linkages also contribute to the decline in employment. Results are robust to other potential explanations of employment loss, and there is no similar reaction in the European Union, where policy did not change.
P33|Internal Geography, International Trade, and Regional Specialization|We introduce an internal geography to the canonical model of international trade driven by comparative advantages to study the regional effects of external economic integration. The model features a dual-economy structure, in which locations near international gates specialize in export-oriented sectors while more distant locations do not trade with the rest of the world. The theory rationalizes patterns of specialization, employment, and relative incomes observed in developing countries that opened up to trade. We find regional specialization patterns consistent with the model in industry-level data from Chinese prefectures. (JEL F11, O18, P23, P25, P33, R12, R32)

P33|How do firms respond to political tensions? The heterogeneity of the Dalai Lama Effect on trade|Little is known about the firm-level dynamics behind trade responses to political tensions. This article reinvestigates variation in the travel pattern of the 14th Dalai Lama to study how political tensions affect trading decisions of Chinese importers. Using monthly trade data from China Customs covering imports of machinery and transport equipment from 173 countries over the 2000–2006 period, our empirical results show a significant reduction of imports in response to foreign government members' meetings with the Dalai Lama. In line with the idea that Chinese importers face a trade-off between bearing costs from suboptimal trade transactions and costs from not accommodating the government, this ‘Dalai Lama Effect’ operates at the intensive margin, i.e., via a decrease in the import volume per importer. Examining differential effects across types of firm ownership, we find that the observed effect is driven by state-owned enterprises (and foreign-invested firms) and not by private companies. Moreover, while direct importers temporarily reduce their trade with Dalai Lama-receiving countries, there is some evidence that trade intermediaries fill the void. Overall, we find the effects to be much more short-lived than previously thought.
P33|A monetary policy rule for Russia, or is it rules?|We estimate several monetary policy rules for Russia for the period 2003–2015. We find that the traditional Taylor rule describes the conduct of monetary policy in Russia reasonably well, whether coefficients are restricted to being the same or allowed to change over the sample period. We find that the Bank of Russia often overshot its inflation target and that extensive overshooting is associated with large depreciations of the ruble, testifying to the importance of the exchange rate in the conduct of monetary policy in Russia.
P33|Too big to fault? Effects of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize on Norwegian exports to China and foreign policy| In October 2010, the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the Nobel peace prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. The Chinese government responded by freezing political and economic relations with Norway, introducing sanctions against imports of fish and other products, and limiting diplomatic interaction. Using a synthetic control approach, this paper estimates the effect of Chinese sanctions following the peace prize on Norwegian exports to China, and on Norwegian foreign policy. Allowing for potential interference (effects of the sanctions on control units), we find that the sanctions reduced direct exports of fish to China by between 125 and 176 million USD in the period 2011–13, and direct total exports from Norway to China by between 780 and 1300 million USD. By 2014, however, exports had rebounded to normal levels. One possible explanation for this normalization could be Norwegian government efforts to distance itself from the peace prize committee, and a weakening of the Norwegian foreign policy position on human rights. This paper shows that immediately following the peace prize, Norwegian agreement with Chinese voting in the United Nations on human rights resolutions increased. The results suggest that the Chinese government can effectively use economic sanctions to affect the foreign policy positions of democratic governments, with potentially chilling effects for international progress on human rights. China has become too big to fault. Keywords: Sanctions, trade, foreign policy, international political economy, China, Norway JEL codes: F14, F51, F53, P33
P33|Aid on Demand: African Leaders and the Geography of China s Foreign Assistance|We investigate whether the political leaders of aid-receiving countries use foreign aid inflows to further their own political or personal interests. Aid allocation biased by leaders selfish interests arguably reduces the effectiveness of aid, negatively affecting development outcomes. We examine whether more Chinese aid is allocated to the political leaders birth regions and regions populated by the ethnic group to which the leader belongs, controlling for objective indicators of need. We have collected data on 117 African leaders birthplaces and ethnic groups and geocoded 1,955 Chinese development finance projects across 3,553 physical locations in Africa over the 2000-2012 period. The results from various fixed-effects regressions show that current political leaders birth regions receive substantially larger financial flows than other regions. We do not find evidence that leaders shift aid to regions populated by groups who share their ethnicity.
P33|Remote markets as shelters for local distortions: Evidence from China|We study how the presence of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) distorts private firms' decision on interprovincial sales in China. Using data from World Bank Investment Climate Survey and Annual Survey of Manufacturing Firms in China, we find evidence that the prevalence of SOEs in a city-industry where private firms reside will affect these firms' decision on the allocation of sales between interprovincial markets versus adjacent market. The direction of the effect on private firms, however, depends crucially on the private firms' access to credit. Specifically, the prevalence of SOEs leads to a higher propensity to sell to remote markets for firms with adequate financial access, whereas the opposite is true for firms who are credit constrained. We build a parsimonious model which links political/market distortion, market access, and credit constraint to explain these patterns, and argue that remote markets can serve as shelters for local distortions resulted from SOEs presence for some private firms.
P33|FDI, human capital and income convergence—Evidence for European regions|This study examines income convergence in regional GDP per capita for a sample of 269 regions within the European Union (EU) between 2003 and 2010. We use an endogenous broad capital model based on foreign direct investment (FDI) induced agglomeration economies and human capital. By applying a Markov chain approach to a new dataset that exploits micro-aggregated sub-national FDI statistics, the analysis provides insights into regional income growth dynamics within the EU. Our results indicate a weak process of overall income convergence across EU regions. This does not apply to the dynamics within Central and East European countries (CEECs), where we find indications of a poverty trap. In contrast to FDI, regional human capital seems to be associated with higher income levels. However, we identify a positive interaction of FDI and human capital in their relation with income growth dynamics.
P33|Technology transfer and spillovers from FDI in transition economies: A meta-analysis|In this paper, we conduct a meta-analysis of the literature that empirically examines the microeconomic impacts of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The meta-synthesis of estimates collected from relevant studies shows that both the effect size and the statistical significance of the indirect effect of FDI, namely the productivity spillover effect, are obviously lower than those of the direct effect caused by foreign participation in company management through ownership. Moreover, the meta-regression analysis reveals that, probably due to the presence of publication selection bias, previous studies have not yet provided empirical evidence of a non-zero productivity spillover effect in the region. Further research efforts are required to capture the true effect.
P33|Economic integration, product cycles and regime effects|By adopting the modified north–south product cycle model of Grossman and Helpman (G&H, hereafter) (1991a) and adding “two-way” FDIs to form a complete economic integration, we obtain the opposite conclusion for such regime effects from that of both Krugman (1979) and G&H (1991b) in different frameworks, while G&H (1991a) have similar results in the same oligopolistic framework (without FDIs) we adopt. This demonstrates that the relative wage rate between the north and south will not be affected by the size of labor markets and that there are no regime effects on relative wage rate, regardless of their existing FDIs.
P33|North Korea’s Economic Integration and Growth Potential|The growth projections based on cross‐country evidence show that North Korea could achieve higher economic growth in the long run if it embarks on substantial policy reforms toward a market‐oriented and open economy. Using an empirical gravity model of trade and direct investment, we forecast that, when the two Koreas pursue economic integration and cooperation without military conflicts, North Korea's trade with South Korea can increase by up to 36 percent of North Korea's GDP and its foreign direct investment (FDI) flows from South Korea by up to 6 percent of GDP. Overall, by promoting trade and FDI integration with South Korea, North Korea can boost its GDP growth by approximately 3 percentage points per year. Combined with a market‐oriented reform, the North Korean economy could grow by approximately 4.7 percent per year over the coming decades. Conversely, if more rigid sanctions imposed on North Korea become effective, its trade and investment will decrease and its GDP growth rate is expected to fall by approximately 2 percentage points per year.
P33|What drives European multinationals to the EU neighbouring countries? A mixed methods analysis of Italian investment strategies|This paper aims to investigate the economic integration between the European Union and its neighbouring countries by exploring the location drivers of Italian Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) in 33 destination countries including the New Member States of the European Union (NMs) and the European Neighbouring countries (NCs). The paper compares market- and efficiency-seeking motivations with asset-seeking strategies. The analysis is based on a mixed-method approach. The quantitative analysis assess the location determinants of 518 Italian MNEs that invested in the area in the years 2003-2008, while qualitative information on strategic location decisions is collected by means of in-depth interviews with executives in two of the largest Italian MNEs active in the region. Market-seeking considerations are still predominant drivers of location decisions in EU Neighbouring Countries together with resource-seeking motivations. However, different MNEs develop diversified strategies to increase their access to these areas which are of increasing interest for global investors.
P33|Economic Institutions and the Location Strategies of European Multinationals in their Geographic Neighborhood| This article investigates how the location behavior of multinational enterprises (MNEs) is shaped by the economic institutions of the host countries. The analysis covers a wide set of geographically proximate economies with different degrees of integration with the old fifteen European Union members: new member states, accession and candidate countries, as well as European Neighborhood Policy countries and the Russian Federation. The article aims to shed new light on the heterogeneity of MNE preferences for the host countries’ regulatory settings (including labor market and business regulation), legal aspects (i.e., protection of property rights and contract enforcement), and the weight of the government in the economy. By employing data on 6888 greenfield investment projects, the random-coefficient mixed logit analysis shows that, although the quality of the national institutional framework is generally beneficial for the attraction of foreign investment, MNEs’ preferences over economic institutions are highly heterogeneous across sectors and business functions.
P33|Foreign direct investment in the Western Balkans: what role has it played during transition?|The paper explores the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the economies of the Western Balkans during their transition to a market system. The paper recalls the political and historical circumstances that have delayed transition in the Western Balkans economies, and draws attention to the specific features of FDI that have influenced their economic development. The main hypotheses are formulated and basic tests performed on data from the manufacturing sector. However, data limitations mean that we can only test for horizontal, rather than vertical, spillovers and in practice we are not able to identify many significant horizontal spillover effects. This finding can probably be explained by various factors – institutional, economic and political – that have constrained FDI effects in the Western Balkan economies in comparison with the Central East European countries. Our work has important policy implications; in order to accelerate economic development, Western Balkan policymakers may need to implement more effective economic policies.
P33|Real and Financial Sector Studies in Central and Eastern Europe: A Review|This survey focuses broadly on real and financial sector studies in former transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe. The survey shows that in the real sector there has been considerable trade and global integration in the post-transition period. Moreover, there is no uniform evidence regarding convergence or divergence from the surveyed empirical studies regarding business cycles in Central and Eastern Europe. Financial sector studies show that foreign bank ownership is associated with higher banking efficiency than in the case of domestic bank ownership and significant return and volatility transmission also from core European financial markets. However, the recent global financial crisis significantly affected these patterns. Finally, central bank communication seems to have significant wealth effects in financial markets and tends to reduce financial market uncertainty.
P33|Firm entry and exit during a crisis period: Evidence from Russian regions|In this paper, we aim to empirically analyze the determinants of firm entry and exit in Russia using a regional-level panel data for the years of 2008–2014, with special emphasis on institutional failures and the politico-economic impact of external crises. We found that these two elements exhibit statistically significant and economically meaningful effects both on the creation and destruction of Russian firms, controlling for potentially explanatory factors. Our empirical results also suggest that the process of firm entry and exit is manifold across Russian regions due to their heterogeneity. Nevertheless, a surprisingly robust estimate of the world oil price (irrespective of the difference in target regions) suggests a possible high exposure of each Russian region to a global crisis. This comes from the importance of oil trade with the world and, accordingly, the ongoing crisis may bring a harmful influence to regeneration of Russian businesses.
P33|Soviet Foreign Trade Earnings Revisited|Soviet statistics authorities attempted to incorporate foreign trade earnings into national income, based on a unique formula. First, we clarify that they must have applied the so called Burge-Geary system for trading gain or terms of trade to their specific accounting in a different context. Then we prove that this Soviet practice should have been corrected. Second, demonstrating our estimate of Soviet foreign trade earnings by using Soviet official data on foreign trade and input-output tables, we explore implications of our estimate. We further look at how present Russia has succeeded to the Soviet statistical and institutional legacies of foreign trade earnings in the national accounting.
P33|Estimating GDP and Foreign Rents of the Oil and Gas Sector in the USSR then and Russia now|A Soviet legacy for present-day Russia is found in its resource dependency as well as its implicit exposition of resource rents from foreign trade in the national accounting. Estimating rents from the oreign trade of oil and gas, we demonstrate how large the GDP of the oil and gas sector had been in the Soviet Union and has been in present-day Russia, as well.
P33|Chinaâ€™s State Enterprises and the Free Market (Economics) Test|Among the core dilemmas accompanying any attempt made to investigate the Chinese economic model, there is the one pertaining to the place and role of state enterprises: has the evolution (at least nominally documented by indicators) of the country in the last almost four decades been done â€œdue toâ€ or â€œin spite ofâ€ the eminent place of these entities in nodal sectors of the economy? State/public enterprises are the official bastion of the Chinese Communist Party, dedicated, on one hand, to fuel the predominantly capitalistic economic development and, on the other hand, not least important, to strengthen Chinaâ€™s imperial geopolitical pretence and propensity. The economic literature hosts a still unclosed debate on the possibility and performance if not of central planning, at least of scientific dirigisme and bureaucratic management. State enterprises (from China) remain a pertinent case study, both theoretical and historical, in the endeavour to grasp features of economics and economies.
P33|Central and Eastern European countries between the 16+1 platform and Chinese OBOR - One Belt, One Road - Initiative|This paper aims at analysing the projects and the initiatives of the Central and Eastern European countries that have been finalised, are in progress or will be developed in the near future with the help of the existing or future financial instruments specific to the 16+1 platform and the One Belt, One Road complex program. For our research we selected four countries, namely: Poland, Romania, Serbia and Hungary, the group being relevant from the perspective of the transportation corridors connected to the â€ One Belt, One Roadâ€ initiative: (1) - Piraeus, Skopje, Belgrade, Budapest, Western Europe; (2) - Suez Canal, Constanta and then Danube, Western Europe, or through Moldova towards Ukraine and Poland; (3) â€“ Constanta, through the Black Sea and Caspian Sea and then the corridors mentioned at the previous point. We based our analysis on the data provided by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, China-CEEC think-tank network and the literature in the field.
P33|Financing The Eu Neighbourhood – Key Facts And Figures For The Eastern Partnership|The EU is permanently trying to secure its proximity by creating a “ring of friends” in the neighbourhood. Thus, stabilization through economic integration and modernization have been the purpose of the European Neighbourhood Policy (the ENP) since its creation, in 2004. Successive reviews of the ENP in the past decade have aimed to customize support to different needs of the partners. Funding has been allocated according to the level of commitment to reform of the EU neighbours. The six small states of the Eastern Partnership (EaP) have benefitted not only from common ENP provisions, but also from specific instruments dedicated to their particular situation. Bilateral and multi-country programmes included in the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI), but also instruments from other EU policies and support from the International Financial Institutions (IFI) have helped the EaP members to achieve progress in EU approximation.
P33|Technology use and availability in entrepreneurship: informal economy as moderator of institutions in emerging economies|Abstract This paper investigates the contextual influences of institutions on the use of latest available technologies by early stage entrepreneurs in emerging economies. Hypotheses are developed and then tested using multi-level modeling techniques on a dataset covering entrepreneurs in 20 emerging economies. We utilized 10,431 individual-level responses from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor survey from 2002 to 2008 and complemented it with data on country-level institutions such as the size of a country’s informal economy, intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes obtained from the Index of Economic Freedom and inward foreign direct investment (FDI) from the World Bank Group. Results on the direct effects suggest that levels of FDI negatively influences the use of latest technology by entrepreneurs in emerging economies, while the moderation effects of informal economy suggest that as its size increases (1) the negative effects IPR on the use of latest technology by entrepreneurs strengthens, and (2) the negative effects of FDI on the use of latest technology strengthens. These findings support the overall proposition that the size of a country’s informal economy is an important moderator of institutional influences on technology use by entrepreneurs in emerging economies. More generally, the study proposes that institutions may not have the same effects on entrepreneurs in emerging economies that might be expected in developed countries, suggesting that future research should take the level of socio-economic development of a country into account when theorizing the role of institutions.
P33|China in the World Economy|After several decades of widely admired success in raising its gross national product (GNP) and becoming the world’s second largest economy behind the United States, doubts have recently emerged about the sustainability of China’s impressive economic success unless it undertakes major reforms and changes its growth model. Opinions vary, however, about China ever attaining the same level of growth that had been achieved in past decades, particularly since the 1978-79 reforms. Sometimes, expressing the present realities and forecasting the future is affected by the measures used, the observer’s expectations, and perceptions of what can or cannot be done to deal with current issues and problems. Often, it is a matter of perceiving the glass as half full or half empty. For some observers, the growth model, adopted since 1978-79, has been extremely successful in gaining the objectives sought, To others, that model resulted in many unintended consequences such as a wide disparity in incomes and excessive emphasis and reliance on manufacturing and exports at the expense of the service sector and domestic consumption. What cannot be disputed, nevertheless, is the fact that millions of Chinese have been lifted out of poverty, and incomes per capita have substantially increased. Instead of depending on foreign assistance, China is now an aid- giver and a major player in world economic affairs. This paper examines the current economic status of China, its transition from one of the poorest countries in the world, to become a middle income country despite the fact that it has a huge population of 1.3 billion people, and the imbalances that have emerged and have to be corrected to ensure sustained economic growth.
P33|The Determinants of Foreign Direct Investment in Transition Economies: A Meta-analysis|In this paper, we conduct a meta-analysis of studies that empirically examine the relationship between economic transformation and foreign direct investment (FDI) performance in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union over the past quarter century. More specifically, we synthesize the empirical evidence reported in previous studies that deal with the determinants of FDI in transition economies, focusing on the impacts of transition factors. We also perform meta-regression analysis to specify determinant factors of the heterogeneity among the relevant studies and the presence of publication selection bias. We find that the existing literature reports a statistically significant nonzero effect as a whole, and a genuine effect is confirmed for some FDI determinants beyond the publication selection bias.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P33|Unequal among equals: Why are developing countries less likely to win WTO disputes?|This article discusses the factors that affect the chances of a favorable resolution of claims to the WTO dispute settlement. Drawing on several hundreds of complaints received by the WTO since the establishment of the organization and till 2014, we demonstrate that the developing countries have a smaller probability of successful resolution in the dispute than the developed countries. This inequality can be explained by differences in the size of economies (GDP), but the paper shows that differences in the country’s experience of participation in WTO disputes have a higher predictive power.
P33|Problems Of Attracting Of Foreign Direct Investments In Ukraine|In this article there is analyzed the foreign direct investments inflows dynamics in Ukraine e. It is identified that the main investors in Ukrainian economy are offshore countries and this is the trend for the last decade. It is demonstrated that the most investment attracted spheres of Ukrainian economic activity are economically inefficient. It is presented the dynamics of international ratings estimating ease of doing business in Ukraine and the level of its financial solvency. There are also analyzed the trends in legislative field for Ukrainian economic activity stimulation.

P33|Debt Sustainability and direction of trade: What does Africa’s shifting engagement with BRIC and OECD tells us?|This study assesses the evolution of debt sustainability in the Sub Saharan African (SSA) region. It also examines the respective contributions of OECD and BRIC to debt sustainability in the region. We reveal how the external demand for SSA goods and services from OECD and BRIC helps to lower ‘debt-to-exports’ and ‘debt-service-to-exports’ ratios, two of the main gauges of debt sustainability. Furthermore, using simple growth accounting, we assess how the net exports by SSA to the OECD and BRIC contributes to the region’s GDP growth, and thus indirectly helps to lower the ‘debt-to-GDP’ ratio, which is another important measure of indebtedness. Our study also compares the ‘actual’ debt levels of SSA with ‘hypothetical’ debt levels that simulate the contributions of OECD and BRIC. On the basis of debt sustainability thresholds of the joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF), we test how the sustainability of SSA debt has evolved overtime and how much the OECD and BRIC contribute to three classes of ‘weak’, ‘medium’ and ‘strong’ debt sustainability targets.
P33|Impact of Human Capital on Economic Growth: A Panel Study|Pakistan is in the race of economic development like other developing countries. The government of Pakistan, like that of other developing countries would invest in human capital at the expense of its economic growth. This issue is more sensitive in nature, which is going to explored through the relationship between human capital and economic growth in case of panel of eleven (11) countries. This investigation is accomplished by using the panel data during the period 1992-2014. The gross domestic product (GDP) as the economic indicator and the investment, net secondary school enrollment, health expenditures, total labor force and life expectancy at birth as the human capital indicator. The panel econometrics tools like Panel Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) unit root test, Pooled OLS test, fixed effect test, redundant variable f-test and Hausman test are applied to investigate such relationship. The results derived by applying these panel econometrics tools show that there is a long term relationship between the real gross domestic product (GDP) and human capital in fixed effect OLS test.
P33|Capital Inflows and Domestic Investment in Sub-Saharan Africa|The issue of whether capital inflows promote domestic investment has been of major concern especially in developing countries considering their massive dependence on these inflows. To this end, we make a case for 25 sub-Saharan African countries, using foreign direct investment and external debt as proxies for capital inflows, and the pooled mean group estimator over the period 1981â€“2010. The results reveal that foreign direct investment positively impacts domestic investment, but external debt has a negative impact on domestic investment in the long run. This implies that increase in foreign direct investment and/or reduction in external debt will promote domestic investment in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore measures have to be put in place to attract more foreign direct investment and reduce the inflow of external debt in the region.
P33|Labour Shortages Driving Economic Growth?|Summary In most of the countries from Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE), the current virtuous circle of rising consumption and incomes is expected to continue at least in the near term, accompanied by solid GDP growth to the tune of some 3% p.a. Ongoing labour-market improvements and rising wages will continue to be the main growth driver throughout the region; they will be complemented by a recovery in fixed investments as new EU funds become available. The economies of Russia, other CIS countries (except Belarus) and the Ukraine are expected to bottom out, as the negative shocks of the past two years have already been largely absorbed. Turkey is heading for a ‘soft landing’. These are the main findings of the newly released medium-term macroeconomic forecast by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw). Despite the sluggish external environment, economic growth remains fairly strong in the majority of CESEE countries; the economic dynamics in almost half of those countries have intensified over the current year compared to 2015. Growth in the EU Member States from Central and Eastern Europe (EU-CEE) has declined only modestly over the current year, mostly on account of temporary investment weaknesses. It remains 1.5 pp higher on average than in the euro area. In Turkey, economic dynamics were also very solid up until mid-2016, albeit accompanied by signs of ‘overheating’, while the CIS countries are experiencing a ‘bottoming out’. The main driver of growth throughout the CESEE region continues to be private consumption, underpinned by sharply rising wages and incomes as well as decreasing unemployment. The tightening of labour markets and the rising labour shortages are partly a consequence of sizeable outward migration over the past years, which has had a cumulative negative effect on labour supply. A number of countries have also introduced higher minimum wages, sometimes as part of a more general fiscal relaxation package. Inflationary pressures in most CESEE countries – with the exception of the CIS countries and Turkey – are almost non-existent, as solid wage growth has been largely offset by marked gains in labour productivity and a profit squeeze. The expansion of fixed investments, which were an important pillar of GDP growth in 2015, has largely run out of steam this year. In the EU-CEE region, the main reason for this lies in a temporary drop in EU transfers that, in previous years, used to be an important source of investments. EU funds disbursed under the previous 2007-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) were absorbed in 2015 at the latest, whereas attracting new funds under the recently adopted 2014-2020 MFF will take time. At the same time, disregarding the ‘EU transfers effect’, the underlying dynamics of investments remain strong. The export dynamics in many CESEE countries have been better than those of imports, resulting in a positive contribution of net exports to GDP growth. In most EU-CEE countries and Serbia, this is largely a reflection of their ever-strengthening export base and further gains in competitiveness. However, in the CIS countries it is entirely due to the weakness of domestic demand which is still depressed following strong currency depreciations over the past two years. Credit expansion in the CESEE region remains rather modest no country, with the possible exception of Slovakia, is currently experiencing a credit boom. Other factors tend to be more important determinants of the demand for loans than interest rates, which in many CESEE countries are rather low. Going forward, this reduces the risk of ‘boom-and-bust’ developments that have characterised the trajectories of a number of CESEE countries in the run-up to and during the global financial crisis. Domestic demand in many CESEE economies is supported by fiscal policy relaxation, particularly in Romania and Ukraine. One reason for this may have been a decline in government borrowing costs. Furthermore, the general disenchantment with the practical results of ‘expansionary austerity’ pursued in the past has played a role as well. At the same time, in most Western Balkan countries and in the CIS, the fiscal stance tends to be either neutral or restrictive – and in the case of the CIS countries it is essentially pro-cyclical. The impact of the forthcoming Brexit on CESEE economies should be contained by those countries’ relatively low trade exposure to the UK economy. In the EU-CEE region, some 1.6% of GDP is accounted for by final demand from the UK, and that share is even lower in other CESEE countries. At the same time, from 2019 onwards the EU-CEE region potentially faces the prospects of much lower (by up to 20%) EU transfers once the UK – the second largest net contributor country to the EU budget after Germany – leaves the bloc. The migration flows from the EU-CEE region to the UK could fall by nearly half compared to the past two years even without any changes to the migration regime, as the UK will become less of a magnet for migrants.
P33|Growth Stabilises: Investment a Major Driver, Except in Countries Plagued by Recession|GDP growth in the EU Member States of Central and Eastern Europe (EU-CEE), the Western Balkans (WB) and Turkey will remain stable or even increase. The trend growth path will be around 3%. EU-CEE countries will thus continue to catch up to the EU average, however at low speed. Russia and Ukraine, on the other hand, will show a considerably worse performance growth will return in 2017 at the earliest. These are the main results of the newly released medium-term macroeconomic forecast by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw). In 2015, the EU-CEE group registered the highest rate of economic growth since the outbreak of the financial crisis, 3.4% (see Table 1). In 2016-2017 the group will experience some modest growth deceleration on account of the recent consumption boom subsiding and a temporary decline in EU transfers. As for 2018, the EU-CEE countries will pick up some speed driven by an inflow of new investments and transfers. Uncertainties concerning the global economy do not allow us to predict average growth of more than 3% over the medium term. Countries in the Western Balkans also improved their performance in 2015 and will maintain positive growth rates in 2016 and beyond. However unimpressive it may be, compared to their need for catching-up, the average growth rate in the WB countries (excluding Serbia) will not lag behind that in the EU-CEE countries. Turkey will maintain a fragile stability despite relatively high inflation and a high current account deficit, while coping with increasing challenges emerging, for instance, from the war in Syria, the refugee crisis and the loss of export and tourism revenue owing to the Russian trade sanctions. Russia and Belarus will face yet another year of recession in 2016. Russia will continue to suffer from low oil prices, high inflation, currency depreciation, sanctions and fiscal austerity. As usual, structural change and institutional reforms will be slow and half-hearted, incapable of offsetting the losses. Ukraine’s economic growth, after the dramatic fall over the past years, will stabilise as the economy will by and large have completed the adjustment process that was triggered by the country decoupling from Russia and the occupied territories. The Russian annexation of the Crimea and the conflict in East-Ukraine look set to last. Export markets lost will not be regained even in the medium term, nor should one expect the volume of exports to the EU to make up for the shortfall quickly. The divergence of economic performance between the EU-CEE and the WB plus Turkey on the one hand and the CIS-3 (Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan) and Ukraine on the other hand will continue in 2016 and beyond. The difference between the two large country groups, however, will not take on more pronounced dimensions as the recent collapse of the major commodity prices may turn into stagnation. The leading role attributed to household demand in driving economic growth in the EU-CEE and WB countries will be matched by investments. A medium-term investment revival is expected in most of the CESEE countries in both the public and private sectors. FDI has already shown some signs of emerging from stagnation in the EU-CEE and WB countries. Credit conditions for private borrowers have improved. Moreover, gross fixed capital formation is responding to the transfer of EU funds that are bound to decline in 2016, but will recover later, once access to EU transfers provided under the 2014-2020 financing framework picks up. As fiscal consolidation and more rapid economic growth have been achieved, fiscal space has widened in several countries, thus granting governments more room in which to implement and support investments. Even highly indebted countries have managed to adopt a less restrictive fiscal stance. The CIS-3 and Ukraine are outliers in this respect as well; they have started cutting back on expenditures so as to reduce their fiscal deficits. Exports may increase if external demand recovers, but imports may grow even more rapidly as consumption and investment expand in the EU-CEE and WB economies. Thus, net exports will not be a strong driver of economic growth. Foreign investors’ income may rise overall, while remittances and labour income from abroad will remain important sources of current account revenues. Special sections of the Forecast shed light on other topical issues low oil prices are mainly supply-driven; the Juncker Initiative will not take the place of EU transfers; outmigration and demography are leading to labour shortages in EU-CEE countries; the recent inflow of refugees may, in the medium term, put pressure on existing migrant workers in Austria.
P33|Bescheidener Aufschwung im Osten – Bremsklotz EU-Fiskalregeln|Zusammenfassung Bescheidener Aufschwung im Osten – Bremsklotz EU-Fiskalregeln Für die mittel-, ost-und südosteuropäischen Länder (MOSOEL) ist das internationale Umfeld insbesondere von der trägen Erholung des Euro-Raumes gekennzeichnet. Die rigiden EU-Fiskalregeln sind der größte Bremsklotz für einen nachhaltigen wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung in Europa. Mittelfristig erwarten wir für die MOSOEL ein BIP-Trendwachstum von bis zu 3%. Dabei ist der Haushaltskonsum vor allem in den mittel- und osteuropäischen EU-Mitgliedstaaten wachstumsbestimmend. In den Ländern des Westbalkans können auch Investitionen und Nettoexporte als wichtige Wachstumstreiber identifiziert werden. In der Gemeinschaft Unabhängiger Staaten und der Ukraine scheint die Talsohle erreicht worden zu sein. Nach einer Phase der Stagnation kann auch dort ein leichtes Wachstum erwartet werden. Österreich sollte ein Profiteur von der Erholung in den MOSOEL sein, da es sich um wichtige Handelspartner handelt. Für die österreichische Wettbewerbsfähigkeit stellen die MOSOEL aber nur eine geringe Gefahr dar. Längerfristig steigen dort die Löhne stärker als die Produktivität. Die Folgen des BREXIT stellen ein großes Risiko für ganz Europa dar. English Summary Modest recovery in the East – EU fiscal rules act as obstacle to growth The international environment for Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) is affected by the weak recovery in the euro area. The rigid EU fiscal rules are an important obstacle to sustainable economic revival in Europe. Over the medium term, we expect a GDP trend growth rate of up to 3% for CESEE. Especially for the EU members of Central and Eastern Europe, household consumption will be an important component of economic growth. In the countries of the Western Balkans also investment and net exports will be important growth drivers. In the Commonwealth of Independent States and in Ukraine the economic downturn has bottomed out. After a period of stagnation, slow growth can be expected also there. Austria should gain from the recovery in CESEE, given that the region is home to important Austrian trading partners. These pose, however, only little danger for Austrian competitiveness. There, over the longer term wages will be rising faster than productivity. The BREXIT implications pose a substantial risk for all of Europe.
P33|New Methods of Financing Your Business in the United States:A Strategic Analysis|United States (US) has one of the deepest pools of potential investors of any country. It has more than 33 million total investors, both accredited and non-accredited. It has been reported that over 9 million US households qualify as accredited investors, with a net worth of over &1 million (exclusive of primary residence). It has also been reported that, in US, there are over 700,000 “angel investors” who are willing to invest their own money in ranges of $150,000 to $2 million. This book will describe three new methods of raising capital from US investors which have recently been approved. It also analyzes strategies for successfully implementing these finance methods.
P33|Trade Liberalization and Markup Dispersion: Evidence from China's WTO Accession|In this paper, we empirically investigate whether trade liberalization affects markup dispersion, a potential source of resource misallocation. The identification uses China's WTO accession at the end of 2001. We show that trade liberalization reduces markup dispersion within a narrowly defined industry. We also examine both price and cost responses to trade liberalization, as well as heterogeneous effects across firms and across locations. Our study contributes to the literature by identifying another potential channel through which free trade benefits a nation. (JEL F13, L11, O14, O19, P23, P31, P33)
P33|The Economics of Nationalism|This paper provides an economic framework for examining how economic openness affects nationalism. Within a country, a region's level of nationalism varies according to its economic interests in its domestic market relative to its foreign market. All else being equal, increasing a region's foreign trade reduces its economic interests in its domestic market and thus weakens its nationalism. This prediction holds both cross-sectionally and over time, as evidenced by our empirical study using the Chinese Political Compass data and the World Value Surveys. Our framework also applies to analysis of nationalism across countries and receives support from cross-country data. (JEL F14, F52, O17, O19, P26, P33)
P33|Geopolitics - A New Framework Of Analysis: Global Challenges And Perspectives|Geopolitics born at the end of the 19th century and reborn at the end of the 20th century, from the need to explain certain issues arising out of the general evolution of human society and the growing influence of permanent politico-economic changes on the human consciousness and the entire system of socio-political life and culture. Also, geopolitics gives us the opportunity to reflect on the manifestation and evolution of power relations within a particular historical period, to assess and track changes and trends in the current system of international relations, giving us indicators and analytical methods about the reality of international relations. The relations of competition versus cooperation between international actors have changed gradually in the 21st century; however, development cooperation can provide solutions or opportunities for defining global problems. Globalization creates a new framework in security and international relations also introduced the geo-economics perspectives to assumed new found geopolitical importance at the outset of the twenty-first century.
P33|Knowledge capital, innovation, and growth in China|We study the relationship between industry-level investments in intangible knowledge capital (KC) and three key economic indicators in China. We find evidence consistent with the hypothesis that investments in KC are productivity-enhancing among domestically owned and foreign invested enterprises (FIEs). Consistent with other research, we find that China's KC generates new patents, but fewer than in major industrialized economies. Finally, we find that China's comparative advantage has shifted toward those sectors where domestic firms have made larger investments in KC, but this trend appears to be independent of the KC accumulated by FIEs.
P33|Why parliament now decides on war: tracing the growth of the parliamentary prerogative through Syria, Libya and Iraq|Research Highlights and Abstract: Precedents set in debates over Iraq, Libya and Syria established a new parliamentary prerogative, that MPs must vote before military action can legitimately be launched. Tony Blair conceded the Iraq vote to shore up Labour back-bench support, because he was convinced he would win, and because he was unwilling to change course regardless. David Cameron allowed a vote on Libya because he believed parliament should have a say, because UN support meant he was certain to win, and to gain plaudits for not being Blair. Cameron then had to allow a vote on Syria despite its greater political sensitivity. He mishandled the vote, and lost, and felt constrained to pull out of mooted military action. Collectively these three precedents comprise a new constitutional convention, which will constrain the executive in future whether the law is formally changed or not. Parliament now decides when Britain goes to war. The vote against military intervention in Syria on 29 August 2013 upheld a new parliamentary prerogative that gradually developed through debates over earlier actions in Iraq and Libya. While the academic community and much of the British political elite continue to focus on the free rein granted to prime ministers by the historic royal prerogative, this article argues it is critically constrained by its parliamentary counterpart. It traces the way political conditions, individual policymaker preferences, and the conventional nature of the unwritten British constitution allowed parliament to insert itself into the policymaking process without the consent of successive governments. It concludes that MPs will in future expect the right to vote on proposals to deploy the armed forces overseas, and that the legitimacy of military action will depend on the government winning such a vote.
P33|Economic Institutions and the Location Strategies of European Multinationals in their Geographical Neighbourhood|This paper investigates how the location behaviour of Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) is shaped by the economic institutions of the host countries. The analysis covers a wide set of geographically proximate economies with different degrees of integration with the 'Old' 15 European Union (EU) members: New Member States, Accession and Candidate Countries, as well as European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) countries and the Russian Federation. The paper aims to shed new light on the heterogeneity of MNE preferences for the host countries' regulatory settings (including labour market and business regulation), legal aspects (i.e.protection of property rights and contract enforcement) and the weight of the government in the economy. By employing data on 6,888 greenfield investment projects, the randomcoefficient Mixed Logit analysis here applied shows that, while the quality of the national institutional framework is generally beneficial for the attraction of foreign investment, MNEs preferences over economic institutions are highly heterogeneous across sectors and business functions.
P33|After Ricardo â€“ after Marx â€“ after Keynes: comparative advantage, mutual advantage and implications for global governance|This paper submits that one of the most fallacious paradigms in economic thought and policy, stemming from Ricardo, has been that of comparative advantage, as it has assumed no capital mobility whereas it has been mainly foreign direct investment that has driven global trade since World War II and has confirmed Marx's claims for uneven development. The paper outlines that this has meant asymmetric outcomes compromising the post-war Bretton Woods system and suggests that this needs both a post-Ricardian and a post-Keynesian conceptual framework for global governance.
P33|Determinants of Export Performance: Comparison of Central European and Baltic Firms|Following the new strand in the new trade theory literature focusing on firm heterogeneity in this paper we investigate the determinants of firms’ export performance in three Baltic states and four Central European countries (CECs). We start by estimating probit regressions for the pooled datasets that include these two groups of countries and then we disaggregate the samples into particular countries. The study covers Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia and is based on BEEPS firm-level data collected for three years: 2002, 2005 and 2009. Our estimation results obtained for the Baltic and CECs indicate that the probability of exporting is positively related to the level of productivity, firm size, the share of university graduates in productive employment and the internationalization of firms. The results obtained for the two groups of countries are not statistically different, while results for particular countries reveal some degree of heterogeneity.
P33|Implications of the Transformation of the State-Owned Banking System into System of Foreign-Owned Banks in New Member States for Macroeconomic and Financial Stability|All studied CEECs represent heterogeneous entities with different starting positions in their transition to market economies as well as chosen paths that have constrained or enabled the emergence of macro-economic and financial fragility, associated with the dominance of foreign-owned banks in the transition economies of CEE region. The implications of foreign ownership for macro-economic stability have to be presented and interpreted with caution. When drawing conclusions on the effects of different ownership structure, one has to bear in mind that in the case of CEECs, specific historical context needs to be acknowledged, as several problems and obstacles in achieving the macroeconomic stability with the state-ownership in the banking sector were related to the transition process from socialist production regime to the introduction of market economy institutions. In the 2000s, on the other hand, the activities of foreignowned banks took place in the context of increasing global liquidity and asset prices’ boom that was taking place in the Western world. Hence, ownership as such has not mattered so much for the macro-economic stability in the CEECs, but rather internal developments, that is, transition to market economy with associated challenges in the 1990s that rendered these economies unstable, and external factors, such as international capital flows in the 2000s that incurred imbalances through the activities of the banking sector.

P33|Foreign direct investment and regional economic development in Russia: an econometric assessment|In this paper, we estimate the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on total factor productivity (TFP) in Russian regions, paying special attention to the country’s investment boom and the remarkable regional gaps in terms of cumulative direct investments in and after 2003. We also examine possible synergistic effects between FDI and local R&D potential to test the absorptive capacity hypothesis. Our estimation results strongly suggest the remarkable role of FDI in the regional economic development in Russia. In addition, we found that the positive effect of FDI on TFP may increase in the regions that received larger amounts of foreign capital. Furthermore, we detected a surprisingly robust and positive synergistic effect between FDI and local R&D potential, indicating that the absorptive capability is essential for linking FDI and regional economic development in Russia.

P33|Exchange Rate Volatility and Oil Prices Shocks|Consumption is positively correlated with disposable income, due to higher oil prices a fall in disposable income will decreases consumption and production and adverse impact on growth. If investment decisions are concerned increase in oil prices will increase cost of production and lowers profit margin and investment. This paper seeks to identify the impact of exchange rate volatility and oil prices fluctuations on economic growth in France based on annual data for fourty years. Impact of oil prices and exchange rate volatility on economic growth has been significant. Cointegration technique is applied to check exchange rate volatility has been significant. Engle and Granger cointegration technique applied and the impact of oil prices and exchange rate volatility on economic growth is checked. Engle Granger results indicate that relationship is significant in the long run and its error correction adjustment mechanism (ECM) in short runs is significant and correctly signed for France.
P33|Behavior of Exchange Rate Volatility: Once Again in Action|In the area of international trade few studies have examined whether fluctuation in exchange rate is base on macro variables that are used in this study. Basically the study is conducted in Pakistan. As it has been noticed that there is continuously increasing in exchange rate since last 20 years. This paper investigate that foreign direct investment, inflation and supply of money have strong relationship with exchange rate. This means that if there is increase in foreign direct investment then the exchange rate will decrease, if there is increase in supply of money then the exchange rate will grow and if there is increase in inflation then the exchange rate will increase and vice versa.
P33|United State’s Dollar & Economic Escalation: A Co Integration Case|Affect of increase and decrease in balance of trade is observed in determination of balance of payments of country. Balance of payment and exchange rate has significant relationship with each other. This research investigates that the determinants of trade i.e. Import, export, industrial growth, consumption level and oil prices fluctuation brings changes in exchange rate and its influence eventually on balance of payments in United state of America (USA). Data of defined variables is collected on annual basis for thirty one years. By applying cointegration, it is estimated that there exist a long run relationship. USA has significantly and correctly signs the short run dynamic. Exchange rate does not Granger cause balance of payment and balance of payment does not granger cause exchange rate. In conclusion, we found that determinatnts of balance of trade affect the exchange rates, also, these rates have an considerable effect (positive or negative) on balance of payments. Therefore, for the macroeconomic stability within a country; economists, policy makers and government should collectively device appropriately matched and synchronized monetary, trade and fiscal policies which stabilize the exchange rate and sustain the balance of payment objectives.
P33|Export Inhibitors In The First Stage Of The Internationalization Process: Evidence From Mexico|This paper identifies export inhibitors in the first stage of the internationalization process of companies. Evidence indicates export inhibitors have the strongest effects on small and midsized manufacturing companies (SMEs) in the state of MichoacÃ¡n, Mexico. Some 191 managers or owners of different industrial SMEs were interviewed for this study. I found the lack of information about government agencies involved in the export process, lack of knowledge about government support for companies intending to export, lack of information about international agreements that Mexico has and lack of information about the procedure to export are export inhibitors with the strongest impact on the surveyed SMEs. One possible explanation for this finding could be that information is not effectively reaching key stakeholders. This implies it is necessary for the Mexican government to develop new strategies that allow information to accomplish its goal. By doing so, companies may broaden their horizons through international markets
P33|Energy Consumption, Economic Growth, Financial Development and Trade Openness in Turkey: Maki Cointegration Test|This paper investigates the relationship between energy consumption, economic growth, energy prices, financial development and trade openness in Turkey for 1960-2011. The Maki cointegration test under multiple structural breaks and VECM Granger causality test are employed to determine cointegration and causality relations. The results reveal that economic growth and trade openness positively, financial development and energy prices negatively affect energy consumption in the long-run. The bidirectional causality exists between energy consumption and economic growth and financial development causes energy consumption for the long-run in Turkey.
P33|Money Monetization and Economic Growth in Pakistan|Purpose: Money plays an important role in determining the national income that economic theory is a widely accepted concept. The study economic development in Pakistan and Money monetization investigate the relationship between the long- terms. Methodology: Based on endogenous growth theory, this study empirically developed models of standard gross domestic product (GDP) based on examination term is negative and significant.Money supply, the study applies error correction model. This study from 1980 to 2012 time series data uses. Findings: Co- integration results show that the variables are co- integrated. That long stable equilibrium relationship has ended. Error correction results a dependent variable and inflation, income gap, investment money supply (M-2) independent variable, Auto- regressive distributive share to the integration interval (ARDL) bound testing approach to long- term equilibrium relationship between the variables included in the model to check is used to examine short -run relationship between money and economic growth. Recommendations: This study open new directions for further research.
P33|Globalization And Foreign Direct Investments|Much discussed and analyzed globalization is a multidimensional and complex process having today a significant magnitude as compared to the past, manifested through various forms of internationalization of production, foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, transnational corporations (TNCs), technology transfers, capital movements, migration flows, amplifying competition between investors and the connections between markets. The complexity phenomenon of globalization contributes to the diversification of opportunities for the development of national economies through effects in economic, political, social, technological, cultural sphere, intensifying the economic and financial relationship between economies and the interdependence between them. The purpose of the current attempt of research is to analyze the link between FDI and globalization, the paper focusing on FDI as one of the most powerful evidence of economic globalization.
P33|Orosz befektetések a visegrádi országokban. Az elméletek temetője?<BR>[Russian investment in the Visegrád countries - a cemetery for extant theories?]|A tanulmány az orosz cégek visegrádi országokban végrehajtott beruházásainak fő jellemzőit és motivációit vizsgálja. Fő következtetése, hogy a nemzetközi befektetések meglévő elméletei - Dunning eklektikus paradigmájának kivételével - kevéssé képesek megmagyarázni az orosz multinacionális vállalatok visegrádi országokbeli tevékenységét. Ezért az orosz befektetők tulajdonosi előnyeit elsősorban a dunningi eklektikus paradigma segítségével elemzi, megfelelően igazítva azt az adott vállalati kör sajátosságaihoz. A cikk a statisztikai jellemzőkön túl a legfontosabb, visegrádiakba befektető, orosz cégeket is bemutatja. Ezek között a kőolaj- és földgáz-, az acélipari és atomenergetikai, valamint a piac- és erőforrás-orientált állami tulajdonú vagy államhoz közel álló orosz vállalatok hajtják végre a legjelentősebb beruházásokat. Továbbá - bár jóval kisebb számban - jelen vannak innovatív orosz magánvállalatok is, amelyek sokban hasonlítanak a fejlett országok multinacionális vállalataira.

P33|The Role of Democracy and Governance in the Enhancement of Indonesian Exports to the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Countries|The formulation of new OIC Charter at the 11 th OIC Summit in Dakar, 2008, has became the momentum for OIC countries to reassert the importance of democracy and institutional reform in promoting economic and trade cooperation among its members. This study aims to explore the role of democracy and governance in the enhancement of Indonesian exports to the OIC countries during 1998-2012 using augmented gravity model. The results showed that both democracy and governance in Indonesia have positive and significant effect in enhancing Indonesian exports to the OIC countries. While the governance in OIC countries also has positive and significant effect in improving Indonesian exports. On the other hand, democracy in OIC countries has negative and significant effect on the same matter, because lower income OIC countries tend to implement closed trade policy.
P33|The Analysis Of The Financial Possibilities On The Life Insurance Market After Economic Crisis - Case Of Republic Of Croatia|The global economic crisis has caused a series of changes in the markets around the world. Following such an occurrence, the planning of future trends has become essential in order to appropriately use more modest financial possibilities available. The period after the global economic crisis has set different trends in motion characterised by low growth rates. Such trends have also affected the life insurance market. New economic circumstances which swept through the life insurance market require different analysis and forecasts. In planning the movements and financial possibilities in the life insurance market, it is necessary to identify specific qualities which have been created in the market following the economic crisis. Scientific statistical and mathematical methods were used in order to develop a model which meets the said prerequisites. The aim of this paper is to show the method of creation and implementation of the model for the life insurance market for the period following the global economic crisis. The implementation of the model is illustrated for the Republic of Croatia life insurance market. The information obtained has multiple application. It provides prognostic information about the future annual financial values of the life insurance market. The course of future market trends is determined by using the financial trend analysis in the forecast periods, as well as by comparison with the values realised in previous years. The information obtained by the model is useful for stakeholders in the life insurance market as additional information for business strategy and income planning.
P33|Nachhaltiges Investieren Mit Fonds - Auswahlstrategien Und Erste Hinweise Zur Erfolgsmessung|The issue of sustainability is becoming increasingly important, especially in Germany. Besides the classical financial investment objectives such as return, risk and liquidity, sustainability funds need to fulfill also ethical, social or environmental criteria. Sustainability funds perform at least no worse than traditional funds and have a reasonable risk-return ratio. Overall, sustainable investing provides a good opportunity for citizens to make their own contribution to creating a more socially and environmentally responsible society.
P33|Determinants Of Export Performance Of Ukrainian Firms|Following the new strand in the new trade theory literature that focuses on firm heterogeneity, in this paper we investigate the determinants of a firm’s export performance in Ukraine. The study is based on the BEEPS firm level data compiled by EBRD and the World Bank. The study covers the period starting in 2005 and ending in 2013. We estimate the probit regressions for each year of our sample as well as for the pooled dataset that includes all years. Our pooled estimation results indicate that the probability of exporting is related to the level of productivity, the firm size, innovation, the share of university graduates in productive employment, as well as the internationalization of firms.

P33|Methods for regionalizing input-output tables|The present paper introduces the most common methods of regionalizing national input-output tables. First we describe the different groups of methods based on our review of the international literature regarding regionalization. Then we focus on particular methods that can be applied for Hungarian counties highlighting their advantages and disadvantages and synthetize the empirical results of them again based on the literature. On the basis of these experiences we attempt to create a complex method fitted to the available Hungarian regional data. For better understanding in the end we apply our method on an illustrative example consisting of three regions with hypothetical sectors and data.
P33|Economic Institutions and the Location Strategies of European Multinationals in their Geographical Neighbourhood|This paper investigates how the location behaviour of Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) is shaped by the economic institutions of the host countries. The analysis covers a wide set of geographically proximate economies with different degrees of integration with the ‘Old’ 15 European Union (EU) members: New Member States, Accession and Candidate Countries, as well as European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) countries and the Russian Federation. The paper aims to shed new light on the heterogeneity of MNE preferences for the host countries’ regulatory settings (including labour market and business regulation), legal aspects (i.e. protection of property rights and contract enforcement) and the weight of the government in the economy. By employing data on 6,888 greenfield investment projects, the randomcoefficient Mixed Logit analysis here applied shows that, while the quality of the national institutional framework is generally beneficial for the attraction of foreign investment, MNEs preferences over economic institutions are highly heterogeneous across sectors and business functions.
P33|Merchandise Import Demand Function in Saudi Arabia|Merchandise imports in Saudi Arabia is growing steadily and very rapidly, at an average growth rate of 10.04 percent/year during 1975-2011. So, this study is very important to know the merchandise imports determinants in Saudi Arabian economy. This study empirically estimates the critical parameters of merchandise import demand determinants for Saudi Arabia by using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) approach and Error Correction model during the period (1975-2011). The empirical results obtained show that, in both long run and short run, there are positive and significant relationships between the demand for merchandise import and real gross domestic product, gross capital formation expenditure, private consumption expenditure, government consumption expenditure and the relative price of imports to domestic price. On the other hand, there are positive but insignificant relationship between the demand for merchandise import and international reserves either in the long run or the short run.

P33|Again on trade elasticities: evidence from a selected sample of countries|This paper focuses on trade elasticities by analysing the case of China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, and the USA over the period 1990–2012. While the empirical setting mainly refers to panel data techniques for non-stationary data, the VECM model complements the analysis at single-country level. After having shown that long-run relationships are stable to any structural break, it is found that exports and imports are price inelastic for most of the countries in the sample. Furthermore, exports and imports are determined by domestic and foreign income, with asymmetric income elasticities. This helps to explain why global trade imbalances are persistent.

P33|Mixed Prospects: Consumption Leads Fragile Recovery in the CESEE Core – CIS Stumbles|Summary The economic outlook in the countries of Central East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) will improve in 2015–2017 with the forecast average economic growth rate close to 3% – some 1.5 pp. higher than the expected euro area average growth. Only the CIS countries and Ukraine will be an exception to this trend. Household consumption, aided by labour market improvements and low inflation, will be the main driver of growth. These are the main results of the newly released medium-term macroeconomic forecast by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw), revising slightly upwards the growth projections relative to the Spring 2015 forecast. Sub-regional growth trends vary greatly. At one end of the spectrum, the Central European countries are expected to continue their robust recovery with growth rates in the order of 2-4% per annum over the forecast horizon (2015–2017). At the other end, the prospects facing the CIS countries are particularly poor unless global commodity prices recover, both Russia and Belarus already tumbling into a deep recession (expected growth in 2015 -3.7% and -3.8%, respectively), while Kazakhstan is following suit with a deceleration in growth (1.5% in 2015). Whereas economic activity in the Baltic countries suffered this year on account of their exposure to Russia, they appear to be resilient and recovery is still on track with growth in the medium term expected to be in the range of 1.5-3%. Overall, Southeast Europe displays improving, but irregular growth tendencies, in many cases accompanied by macroeconomic imbalances and deep structural problems. Serbia and Croatia, the worst performers in the group, will enjoy hardly any growth at all in 2015 (0.1% and 0.7%, respectively), while growth in other countries will be in the order of 2-4%. The situation in Ukraine remains particularly fragile and serious downside risks persist, although there are signs that the recession, much deeper than originally anticipated (with output projected to drop by -11.5% this year), might be bottoming out. Net exports are providing only a limited, if at all positive, contribution to growth, while household consumption, supported by labour market improvements and low inflation due to weak commodity prices, is coming to the fore as the main engine of growth across most of the CESEE region; consumption is expected to remain among the key drivers in the medium term as well. At the same time, private investment remains the much-needed missing link in the mechanism essential to rekindling sustainable output growth in the CESEE region, and public investment may prove to be an important complementary factor. In this regard, the EU structural and investment funds under the 2014–2020 Multiannual Financial Framework will be instrumental as a source of co-funding. Inflation remains very weak across the CESEE region, hovering at near-zero levels on account of low commodity prices, with the exception of the CIS countries, Turkey and Ukraine, whose inflation spiked owing to exchange rate pass-through effects that followed sharp currency depreciations in 2014–2015, as well as country-specific factors, such as the food embargo in Russia and the rise in utility tariffs in Ukraine. The external environment is only moderately supportive. As the multi-speed recovery of the world economy continues in 2015, driven primarily by advanced economies and accompanied by poor performance in large emerging market economies, manifold external risks also arise that could jeopardise the recovery of the CESEE region, including geopolitical tensions associated with the situation in Ukraine and the Middle East, a slowdown in major emerging markets, normalisation of monetary policy in the USA and low commodity prices (a negative shock for the CIS group). Special sections of the forecast report focus on some of the potential risks that have attracted much attention since the beginning of the year, including the refugee crisis in Europe, recession and import-substitution policy in Russia, the Volkswagen scandal, the economic slowdown in China and the implications of the Greek crisis. With the exception of the CIS countries and Ukraine, however, the CESEE countries appear to be rather resilient to date.
P33|A Time of Moderate Expectations|Growth in the CESEE region will follow the unimpressive pattern displayed by the euro area. The longer-term convergence of income levels in the CESEE countries can no longer be expected to be as rapid as was assumed a decade or so ago. Growth in the period 2015-2017 is not going to deviate substantially from the pace recorded in 2014. For the new EU Member States growth is expected to remain slightly below 3% in the years to come. This implies an average growth differential of about 1.5 percentage points as compared to the euro area – about half of what it was before the global financial crisis. On the other hand, most of the countries in the region are also expected to evade the dangers of runaway inflation, fiscal deficits or excessive foreign borrowing that often plagued them in the past. These are the main results of the newly released medium-term growth forecast for the region by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw). Depressed aggregate domestic demand has been the major factor behind anaemic growth. This is evidenced by disinflation (or even mildly deflationary tendencies) across much of the region, as well as the persistence of fairly high unemployment. There is some evidence of a ‘race to the bottom’ in terms of wage setting. While wage moderation strengthens profitability and external competitiveness, it also weakens disposable household incomes and thus slows down growth in domestic demand. Apparently, there is a trade-off between improvements in the trade balance and more rapid growth in domestic demand. Overall, GDP growth is being held ‘on a short leash’. Growth in public investment may be supporting economic growth, especially in those new EU Member States (NMS) that have access to EU funds. However, a proper rebound in private-sector investment is still lacking. Weak private-sector investment cannot be attributed to a ‘profit squeeze’ in the corporate sector. On the contrary, the corporate sector has been doing very well, at least in those NMS for which relevant data are available. The corporate sector as a whole still tends to lend rather than borrow. The means available to the corporate sector appear to be plentiful at present – but the sector still prefers to lick its wounds inflicted by former excessive borrowing or extend loans (primarily to the public sector) rather than to invest productively. Loans are stagnant even in those instances where interest rates are relatively low. With a few exceptions (largely on the region’s periphery) the stocks of loans to the non-financial corporate sector increased marginally at best in 2014. This may reflect firms’ pessimistic assessment of future growth in demand, increased ‘liquidity preference’ or the relative abundance of the means at their disposal. Non-performing loans are linked to a high share of borrowing in foreign currencies. The recent strengthening of the Swiss franc will bear some negative consequences for those firms and households that borrowed heavily in that currency in the past. New evidence supports the claim that the countries with floating exchange rates fare better in the medium to long term. They tend to avoid irreversible currency overvaluation, whereas the countries with fixed exchange rates do not quite avert it. It is argued, however, that despite the rigidity of the exchange rates, overvaluation can be avoided – at least in the medium term. All the CESEE countries are running up fiscal deficits. Current account deficits are still depressed. Net national lending in the NMS tends to be positive. This is a consequence of current savings in the private sector in the NMS generally running ahead of gross fixed capital formation in that sector. On average, output growth across the NMS will become more uniform in 2015 – albeit not any faster. Average growth will remain at 2.7% in 2015. Some acceleration in marginal growth is to be expected in the biennium 2016-2017. Unemployment in the NMS will recede only gradually. Low inflation will prevail in 2015, but it will gradually return to more normal levels in 2016. Under sustained – albeit rather anaemic – growth, the current account balances will deteriorate (although they will still remain comparatively low). Growth is hardly accelerating in the (current and potential) EU candidate countries either. Output in those countries is not expected to grow faster than in the NMS. Turkey, Macedonia and Kosovo may fare slightly better than the rest of the group, with growth rates of above 3% in 2015. However, with the exception of Turkey, those countries seem to have put high inflation behind them. Nonetheless, their unemployment figures continue to be dismal (less so only in Turkey). They will also run high (or even very high) current account deficits. Most of the successor states to the Soviet Union will perform rather badly in 2015. Ukraine’s output will continue its free fall as many of the country’s industrial centres have become battlefields. A drop of 5% in economic growth is expected for 2015. The decline in world market prices for energy carriers will negatively affect both Kazakhstan and Russia, with real output in the latter country dropping sharply by almost 4% in 2015. A similar fate will befall Belarus a country that relies heavily on exports to Russia and Ukraine. However, assuming a peaceful resolution to the Ukrainian conflict in 2015, it is expected that all the successor states will resume moderate growth in 2016 or 2017.
P33|Aufwind im Westen Mittel-, Ost- und Südosteuropas: Wichtige Wachstumsimpulse für Österreich|Zusammenfassung Aufwind im Westen der MOSOEL In den mittel-, ost- und südosteuropäischen Ländern (MOSOEL) klafft der Ausblick für das Wirtschaftswachstum auch weiterhin auseinander für die meisten der neuen EU-Mitgliedstaaten (NMS) wird eine langsame Beschleunigung des BIP-Wachstums beginnend mit diesem Jahr erwartet. Für 2015 soll das Wachstum durchschnittlich auf 3% ansteigen, um 0,2 Prozentpunkte mehr als im Vorjahr. Die Erholung erfolgt um ein Jahr früher als erwartet. Wesentlicher Faktor ist die bessere Entwicklung in der Eurozone. Auch am Westbalkan wird eine (wenn auch weniger dynamische) Verbesserung der Wachstumsaussichten für die gesamte Prognoseperiode 2015-2017 erwartet. Die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung 2015 in Weißrussland, Kasachstan, Russland und der Ukraine wird düster ausfallen und zum Teil noch schlechter sein als bisher erwartet. Für diese Länder sind die mittelfristigen Wirtschaftsaussichten auch mit substantiellen Risiken behaftet. Insgesamt sollte aber das verstärkte Wachstum in den MOSOEL für die österreichische Wirtschaft als Nachfrageimpuls dienen. Insbesondere die NMS sind für Österreich von zunehmender Bedeutung. English Summary Western CESEE countries in the ascendant The outlook for GDP growth in the Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) region remains divergent we expect a gradual acceleration of GDP growth for most of the EU’s new Member States (NMS) starting this year. For 2015 growth is expected to increase to 3% on average, by 0.2 pp more as compared to last year. The recovery comes a year earlier than expected mainly based on favourable developments in the euro area. In the Western Balkans growth prospects will also improve over the whole forecast period 2015-2017, though slightly less dynamically. Growth performance in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine in 2015, however, will be dismal and partly worse than expected; the medium-term outlook for these countries is also fairly uncertain with considerable downside risks. Overall though, we should expect stronger CESEE growth to act as a demand stimulus for the Austrian economy. The NMS in particular are of increasing importance for Austria.
P33|"""Auslandsinvestitionsrecht und Entwicklungspolitik: Derzeitiges bloßes internationales Investitionsschutzrecht vertieft Armut"". Tückische Widersprüche, falsche Grundannahmen - Beispiele Investitionen in Land, Landmanagementreform in Ghana"|[Vorwort] Heute verengt internationales Investitionsrecht ein ursprünglich weites Feld ausschließlich auf Schutz ausländischer Eigentumspositionen in einem investitionsaufnehmenden Gaststaat. Diese einseitige Lesart vernachlässigt solchem Schutz entgegenstehende öffentliche Interessen und führt aus Sicht Milliarden armer Menschen zu untragbaren Ergebnissen. Wenige sprechen noch, wie Sornarajah in seinem Lehrbuch1, von multinationalen Unternehmen und deren Pflichten gegenüber Gaststaaten und seinen Menschen. Aus der Perspektive von verletzbaren Bevölkerungsgruppen hält die derzeitige Investitionsrechts-Architektur im Zusammenspiel ihrer verschiedenen Ebenen tückische Widersprüche bereit, und sie beruht auf der falschen Grundannahme: Recht und Rechtsdurchsetzung in kapital-aufnehmenden Gastgeberländern erfüllten die ihnen auf unterster Ebene zugedachte Aufgabe, Investitionen sozial einzuhegen. Die Arbeit argumentiert aus entwicklungspraktischer Sicht. Sie zeigt am komplexen Beispiel eines Projekts zur Stärkung von land governance in Ghana, dass in Gaststaaten Recht und Rechtsdurchsetzung Investitionen eben nicht einhegen und so die globalen Investitionsregeln arme Menschen im Stich lassen. In Kenntnis der inneren Widersprüche globalen Wirtschaftsrechts sollte Entwicklungspolitik die Anliegen ihrer Zielgruppen gerade auch in wirtschafts- und investitionsrechtlichen Kreisen deutlicher vertreten und die Investitionsrechts-Gemeinschaft ihr Fachwissen und juristische Kreativität für gerechte Lösungen zum Einsatz bringen.
P33|Aid on Demand: African Leaders and the Geography of China's Foreign Assistance|This article investigates whether China's foreign aid is particularly prone to political capture by political leaders of aid-receiving countries. Specifically, we examine whether more Chinese aid is allocated to the political leaders' birth regions and regions populated by the ethnic group to which the leader belongs, controlling for indicators of need and various fixed effects. We have collected data on 117 African leaders' birthplaces and ethnic groups and geocoded 1,650 Chinese development finance projects across 3,097 physical locations committed to Africa over the 2000-2012 period. Our econometric results show that current political leaders' birth regions receive substantially larger financial flows from China than other regions. On the contrary, when we replicate the analysis for the World Bank, our regressions with region-fixed effects show no evidence of such favoritism. For Chinese and World Bank aid alike, we also find no evidence that African leaders direct more aid to areas populated by groups who share their ethnicity, when controlling for region-fixed effects.
P33|"When the Floodgates Open: ""Northern"" Firms' Response to Removal of Trade Quotas on Chinese Goods"|Using the dismantling of the Multi-fibre Arrangement quotas on Chinese textile products in conjunction with China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), within firms adjustments to intensified low-wage competition is analyzed. Employing Danish employer-employee matched data covering from 1995 to 2007, the analysis shows a significant change in the workforce composition of firms in response to heightened competition. Competition is found to negatively affect employment, value-added, and intangible assets of the Danish firms, and firms refocus away from products, where China's competitive advantage becomes higher. The results show an important role of the distributional impact of low-wage competition within firms in restructuring the industry.
P33|The Global Welfare Impact of China: Trade Integration and Technological Change|"This paper evaluates the global welfare impact of China's trade integration and technological change in a multi-country quantitative Ricardian-Heckscher-Ohlin model. We simulate two alternative growth scenarios: a ""balanced"" one in which China's productivity grows at the same rate in each sector, and an ""unbalanced"" one in which China's comparative disadvantage sectors catch up disproportionately faster to the world productivity frontier. Contrary to a well-known conjecture (Samuelson 2004), the large majority of countries experience significantly larger welfare gains when China's productivity growth is biased toward its comparative disadvantage sectors. This finding is driven by the inherently multilateral nature of world trade."
P33|Intangible Capital, Innovation, and Growth in China| We study the relationship between industry-level investments in intangible capital (IC) and three key economic indicators in China. We find that investments in IC are productivity-enhancing among Chinese enterprises—more so in domestically owned than in foreign invested enterprises. Consistent with other research, we find that China’s IC generates new patents, but fewer than in major industrialized economies. Among domestically owned enterprises, we find that IC growth has been associated with increasing export-competitiveness, while among foreign invested enterprises, it has been oriented more toward improving domestic sales.
P33|Do export price elasticities support tensions in currency markets? Evidence from China and six OECD countries|The empirical literature on trade imbalances does not make currency tensions easy to understand, because tensions across traders originate from the assumption that export-price elasticity is high. This paper provides new evidence by analysing the export-behaviour of China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, and the USA from 1990 to 2012. Estimates of export-price elasticities have been made using panel data techniques for non-stationary data. Long run relationships are stable to any structural break and indicate that exports are heavily dependent on world income, with long run income elasticity significantly higher than unity in many cases (China, Japan, Germany, UK and USA). Conversely, exports are price inelastic for most of the countries in the sample, in both the long and short runs. The exception is France, whose exports in the long run would increase by 2 percent if the country experienced a 1 percent depreciation of its real exchange rate.
P33|Impact Of Economic Crisis On Fdi|The economic crisis has had a severe impact on the economy worldwide. The investment activity has strongly felt the crisis and caused dramatic changes in the hierarchy of large investors. The financial system did not have availability for credits and funding from companies' own resources was extremely limited in terms of reducing profits. The purpose of the paper is the analysis of global foreign direct investment under the effect of the largest financial and economic crisis. The research results show a dramatic decline in foreign direct investments flows perceived and generated in 2009, and the fact that since 2010 there has been an easy comeback.
P33|Fdi - Important Form Of Business’ Internationalization|Investments play a central role in the economy of a country, both in the production of goods and services and in the sphere of consumption, being a factor which influences not only the demand, but also the supply. The purpose of this research is to identify the effects of FDI on the economy of a country and analyze their evolution in Romania. The research results show that FDI inflows have fluctuated in the period 1990 - 2012, being influenced by certain internal and external factors. The FDI stock generally had an increasing tendency, except for the years 2010 and 2011.
P33|New Actors In Global Development Cooperation: The Russian Federation|International Development Assistance (IDA) architecture is rapidly changing and becoming more complex as new providers of assistance enter the scene. These new providers of assistance, while not members of the traditional club of donors, nonetheless make meaningful contributions, both financial and in-kind, to key development and humanitarian challenges. New providers of assistance such as the BRICS countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa – or Turkey, South Korea, are important for international assistance not only because of their financial and human resources, but also for the value they bring as regional leaders in their respective parts of the globe and contribute with their own unique experience and success in addressing development challenges at home as well as how best to cooperate with traditional donors.
P33|Condiciones y determinantes de la internacionalización de las empresas industriales colombianas: una aproximación cuantitativa en el ámbito de la firma|En los últimos diez años se ha visto un impulso por parte de las empresas colombianas en el ofrecimiento de sus productos en los mercados internacionales en coordinación con los demás países de América Latina. En este sentido, el objetivo de este trabajo es explorar cuantitativamente las condiciones y los determinantes que han permitido esta expansión internacional de las empresas industriales colombianas entre el 2006 y 2010. Para efectos metodológicos se utiliza un modelo logit sobre una muestra de diez mil empresas. Las estimaciones muestran que los activos específicos tales como la capacidad tecnológica y las características sectoriales de las empresas, son los factores que mayor influencia han tenido en el resultado exportador en los años de estudio.

P33|Transition and FDI: A Meta-Analysis of the FDI Determinants in Transition Economies|In this paper, we conduct a meta-analysis of studies that empirically examine the relationship between economic transformation and foreign direct investment (FDI) performance in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union over the past two decades. More specifically, we synthesize the empirical evidence reported in previous studies that deal with the determinants of FDI in transition economies, focusing on the impacts of transition-factors. We also perform meta-regression analysis to specify the determinant factors of the heterogeneity among the relevant studies and the presence of publication selection bias. We find that the existing literature reports a statistically significant non-zero effect as a whole, and a genuine effect is confirmed in the study area of the determinants of FDI beyond the publication selection bias.
P33|EU Innovation Activity and Competitiveness on the International Market in Relation to the other Competitors|This paper tries to analyse some important and present aspects of the European Union situation in the innovation activity, relatively to its main competitors on the global market: USA, Japan and China. The study shows that, although EU has been for many years behind USA and Japan and before China, from the point of view of innovation performances, the reflection of this situation in the international trade with high-tech products - one of the most significant indicators for a country or group of countries competitiveness on the international market â€“ the report is reversed, China holding the first place and EU the second one (a good position if we consider the recent years crisis of some Union Member States). This articleâ€™s author wants to clarify most concisely the cause of this evolution, as well as the conclusions detached from the interaction of the two economic fields: innovation (and of course research and development) and high-tech products trade (especially export).
P33|Human Capital and Export Decisions: The Case of Small and Medium Enterprises in Kosovo|Following the propositions of firm internationalization theories including the Melit’z dynamic model of export participation, this paper investigates the effects of human capital on the export decisions of Kosovo’s firms. Using a unique dataset of around 500 Small and Medium Enterprises, econometric estimates show mixed indications regarding the relationship between the propensity to export and longevity in export markets and human capital variables, measured by the education of the workforce, and investment in training. While education generally has a negative effect on exporting decisions, the latter shows a consistent positive effect. In the context of Kosovo, this dichotomy may reflect in part the effect of the underperforming education system in Kosovo, which does not produce the right level and/or mix of skills required by the private sector; this, in turn, forces SMEs to invest in increasing workforce capacities. Another explanation may indicate the lack of demand for a better skilled workforce, either because of associated high costs, or because a significant number of firms in Kosovo operate in low-value activities that do not require advanced skills and knowledge. Other factors that affect the decisions of firms to enter and serve export markets are found to be firm size, experience, growth, and adoption of quality standards.
P33|Chinese outward FDI in Europe and the Central and Eastern European region within a global context|The paper analyses Chinese OFDI to Europe by presenting its main trends, patterns and motivations with a special focus on the impact of these investments on the EU and Central and Eastern European region, respectively. In order to assess the role and importance of OFDI from China towards Europe, the authors evaluate it within a global context. The authors will conclude their investigation by arguing that although the majority of Chinese investments are directed to the developing world, European countries are at the forefront of Chinese OFDI to developed countries, complemented by a growing trend of Chinese OFDI to the Central Eastern European region in the post-crisis period.
P33|Chinese investments and financial engagement in Hungary|The paper analyses the partnership between China and Hungary and gives a thorough overview of Chinese investment in Hungary before and after the crisis, with a special focus on Chinese financial engagements and promises in this regard. The authors examine the realized investmentsas well as the reasons for failure or non-realization of Chinese financial involvement in Hungary. Finally, they conclude their investigation by arguing that although Hungary currently receives the majority of Chinese investments within the Visegrad region, it can easily lose this position.
P33|Promoting And Attracting Foreign Direct Investment|FDI is an important element of the economic development of any country and its functioning on market principles. They have a great importance for strengthening the economy of countries in transition and their integration into the world’s economy. The modernization of national economies occurs with FDI help, by implementing advanced technologies, know-how sites, the most powerful equipment and the new quality standards by switching to a higher type of growth. The purpose of this research is to identify of the policies to attract and promote FDI, adopted by host countries for foreign investors and are highlighted beneficial aspects of foreign investments flows on recipient economies. The research results show that policies aimed at ensuring access to foreign markets, those that are considering providing commercial facilities and last, but not least, policies focused on tax incentives are very important for foreign investors.
P33|Export behaviour of SMEs in transition countries|Melitz’s dynamic model of export participation is the basis of our empirical specification that accounts for a wide range of internal and external factors affecting the export behaviour of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Transition Countries (TCs). Using firm-level data, our estimates highlight the particular importance of the human and technology-related factors to the export behaviour of SMEs in TCs. Other important factors for SME exporting activities are productivity-enhancing spillovers from industry—especially vertical—linkages, firm size, ownership type, type of activity, the availability of external finance, networking through business associations, and market share. In addition, significant period and country differences are identified. This paper contributes to the transition literature by filling an important gap in the understanding of the SME internationalisation process and by identifying a comprehensive set of variables to explain firms’ export behaviour in TCs.

P33|“The New Season of Chinese Economic Miracle” and its Challenges|The investment and export-driven economic model followed by Chinese governments after 1978 served very well their catching-up vision, but China’s unprecedented race to the top had its flaws and drawbacks, leading to negative externalities and multiple structural imbalances. The global economic crisis and the interventionist package implemented to countervail its impact triggered a host of unwanted, negative outcomes which further aggravated the imbalances of the Chinese economy and created some new ones. It therefore became more obvious than ever that the old economic model had reached its limits and it needed to be changed. This task rests with the new cabinet led by premier Li Keqiang who launched a blueprint of bold reforms, but their implementation will presumably meet the strong opposition of powerful vested interests. The paper looks at the structural imbalances of the Chinese economy, highlighting the needed rebalancing processes. It also looks at the reform blueprint designed by the new leadership, disclosing and discussing some of its main implementation challenges.
P33|Current State of European Hotel Chains|The importance of selecting the appropiate brand for a hotel resides in the impact it will have on the market where the hotel is positioned and the potential benefits of the chain's distribution channels. Accor, for example, is the world's number-one and Europe's leading hotel operator. It has more than 3.600 hotels in 92 countries and provides a comprehensive range of options from luxury to economy, with brands like Sofitel, Novotel, Ibis, Hotel F1. With over 170.000 people working for Accor brands around the world, the Group has 45 years of experience in serving its customers and partners. Accor's vision is to be world's most innovative, best performing and most valued hotel company. Its new strategic roadmap, which has redesigned its business model around two divisions - HotelServices and HotelInvest - will boost operational efficency and sustainable growth.
P33|Liberalisation reform and export performance of India|This paper examines the impact of liberalisation reform on export performance of India. The empirical analysis involves estimating an export demand-supply model for manufacturing and merchandised exports, applying ARDL approach to cointegration using annual data for the period 1975-2008. The main advantage of this approach is that, apart from providing robust estimations in small sample sizes, it needs no prior knowledge of the integration properties of the variables. The results suggest that manufacturing and merchandise export demand are mainly determined by world demand, while manufacturing export supply is determined by domestic manufacturing output, FDI and overall liberalisation- initiated in the early 1990s. Contrary to the received view, this study failed to detect a significant negative impact of trade protection on export performance; however, overall liberalisations reforms seem to have positive impact in India’s manufacturing export performance but this is not true in the context of merchandised export performance.
P33|What determines firms’ innovation in Eastern Europe and Central Asia|By employing a rich sample of firm-level data in seven Eastern Europe and Central Asian countries from Europe and Central Asia, our paper investigates core as well as some specific determinants of firm innovation. We find that the likelihood of engaging in innovation for a firm increases with its core socio-economic characteristics such as size, age, capacity utilization, domestic competition and foreign ownership. In addition to the estimates of these socio-economic covariates, the ultimate purpose of our study is to obtain more in-depth knowledge about the policy implacable factors for firm innovation that the countries could focus on. These policy-related factors are: (i) access to finance, (ii) human capital, and (iii) foreign trade. In this respect, our study finds that firm’s innovation increases with better financial inclusion, greater human capital and engagement in foreign trade. We argue that these analysis and results, coupled with inclusive and targeted policies, can be used to enrich the process of private sector innovation in the region’s countries.
P33|Globalization And Human Development In Post-Transition Countries: Empirical Evidence From Panel Data|In this paper we investigate empirically the relationship between globalization and human development in post-transition countries using annual panel data for the 1971-2010 period. We show that there exists a positive and statistically sig-nificant relationship between globalization and human development in the case of unconditional regressions. This relationship remains positive and significant once the process of European and regional integration is controlled for. Howev-er, when differences in the level of economic development are taken into account the globalization variable loses its statistical significance.
P33|Do Export Price Elasticities Support Tensions In Currency Markets? Evidence From China And Six Oecd Countries|The empirical literature on trade imbalances does not make currency tensions easy to understand, because tensions across traders originate from the assumption that export-price elasticity is high. This paper provides new evidence by analysing the export-behaviour of China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, and the USA from 1990 to 2012. Estimates of export-price elasticities have been made using panel data techniques for non-stationary data. Long run relationships are stable to any structural break and indicate that exports are heavily dependent on world income, with long run income elasticity significantly higher than unity in many cases (China, Japan, Germany, UK and USA). Conversely, exports are price inelastic for most of the countries in the sample, in both the long and short runs. The exception is France, whose exports in the long run would increase by 2 percent if the country experienced a 1 percent depreciation of its real exchange rate
P33|Why Give it Away When You Need it Yourself? Understanding Public Support for Foreign Aid in China| In this study we examine the determinants of public support for foreign aid in China. We find that while political ideology and sense of national identity are the most important determinants of support for foreign aid, several demographic characteristics, such as age, gender and income, are also important. We also find that those living in the lower income western provinces and in provinces with higher poverty rates express less support for giving foreign aid. We draw policy implications from the findings for better targeting engagement strategies designed to garner support for foreign aid.
P33|The Gravity of Institutions in Resource-Rich Country|This research will analyze the effects of the similarities in economic size and institutional level on bilateral trade. It is interested whether similarities at the country size and institutional level encourage international trade between countries. Using panel data of the bilateral trade of Azerbaijan with 50 different countries from 1995 to 2012 estimating by the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) method, it is expecting that similarity at the income size is not necessary for increasing bilateral trade across countries, on the contrary, country has interest to trade with dissimilar economic-size countries. Institutional similarity is expecting plays pivot role in international relationships and it has positive impact on bilateral trade.
P33|“Trade Liberalization with Chinese Characteristics”: Few Notes on PRC’s WTO Membership|There is a significant amount of published empirical studies that describe the relation of the People’s Republic of China with the World Trade Organization as the vehicle through which this country has reached the goal of opening further its domestic economy by freeing its foreign trade. If those ruling the Chinese people’s destiny saw in the WTO accession, along with the acceptance of its basic rules, a path that will lead them to the benefits and opportunities offered by some sectors’ liberalization, this judgment raises several concerns. An obvious one could be: Why not doing this unilaterally? Benefits might have been consistent. Not only that this would have been much easier, if the will of the Party, but the effects of opening market to other nations, within or outside the WTO, could have spurred earlier and stronger. Noteworthy is that many much economically freer countries are not yet members of the WTO. Then, if it is considered that the accession to this organization, by the values, rules and principles that it promotes, will allow any domestic economy to thrive, why do we assist to China’s failure in fulfilling all the WTO membership criteria and in complying with all the rules? In our opinion, Chinese authorities tried to accommodate pragmatically some liberalization to inspire trustworthiness for FDI with a boost for national companies still benefiting from public support and newly opened markets, thus seeking not pure freedom, but wise access to the workings of managed world trade.
P33|Managing the State Aid in Romania According to European Union’s Policy|The importance of state aid has gradually increased in the recent decades. Aid allocations in the EU Member States vary depending on the national priorities as they are set by each state. Starting from those facts, this paper presents the trends in Romania, as well as those at the European Union level, as a whole. The research is based on data analysis provided by Scoreboard reporting systems and, as a result, presents authors conclusions and recommendations for managing the State Aid in Romania.
P33|India-Africa Trade: Current Trends and Policy|India-Africa trade has gathered pace over the past few years characterized by a remarkable rise in Africa’s exports to India. Interestingly, India’s exports and imports of products belonging to minority sectors (low share in total exports) exhibit dramatic growth in the recent years than the products in majority sectors (high share in total exports). Broadly, India’s trade basket is heavily dominated by mineral products with very little diversification in the recent past. Along with tariff liberalization, India is lowering different forms of non-tariff barriers (NTBs) which would pave the way for higher trade between India and African economies and help the country withstand the Chinese competition in the African markets.
P33|R&D Intensity and Market Valuation of Firm: A Study of R&D Incurring Manufacturing Firms in India|This study examines the impact of R&D expenditure on market valuation of firm proxied by Tobin’s q using firm level data for manufacturing firms in India. To accomplish the research objective this study obtained data from Prowess database of Centere for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) over the period of 2001-2010. The study forms an unbalanced panel comprising 2382 firm-year observations and employs Pooled-OLS and fixed effects models to analyze the relationship between R&D intensity and firm value as measured by Tobin’s q. The findings reflect an inverted U-shaped relationship between R&D intensity and firm value indicating the diminishing marginal return to each unit spent on R&D. The result implies that R&D investment have a positive impact on the market value of firm at the beginning, however, after a point these investments lower the market performance of firms.
P33|Trade integration and business cycles synchronization of Poland (Integracja handlowa a synchronizacja cykli koniunkturalnych Polski i Unii Europejskiej)|Analysis of the synchronization of economic fluctuations has become nowadays a key issue in the debate on the process of economic integration. Special interest of economists are related to the issue of the analysis of convergence and divergence processes of business cycles in the European Union. One of the factors determining the convergence of business cycles of economies is the intensity and structure of foreign trade. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of international trade on the synchronization of business cycles between Poland and the European Union in the period 1995-2011. In the study were used a research methods based on literature studies in macroeconomics and international finance and econometric methods (Vector Autoregression Model). The results of empirical studies indicate that the increase in trade does not necessarily lead to increase of business cycles synchronization in analyzed economies. The impact of external trade on the business cycles synchronization depends not only on the intensity of trade, but mainly on the commodity structure of foreign trade.
P33|On Thin Ice: CESEE Core Resilient in the Face of EU Stagnation and the Ukraine Crisis|Summary Despite near stagnation in the euro area and the negative impact of the Ukraine crisis, in most of the NMS economies and some of the Western Balkan countries growth prospects are viewed as positive. While the NMS economies will preserve their positive growth differential vis-à-vis the EU-28, Russia and Ukraine are facing a deterioration of their economic performance. External factors have had a major impact on growth performance in the CESEE region. Financial transfers from the EU have lent essential support to economic growth in the European Union’s new Member States (NMS). Investment and operational costs funded via those transfers have become an integral and increasingly important part of aggregate demand in the NMS economies. 2013 and 2014 have been among the strongest years in terms of transfers in the framework of the EU cohesion policy. Their impact is comparable to that of fiscal stimuli, albeit better inasmuch as they do not give rise to new debt. A possible disadvantage compared to classic fiscal stimuli is that transfers have no steerable relation to business cycles. In the eastern part of the CESEE region, the Ukraine conflict has had a pronounced negative impact on economic growth. 25 years after the fall of the Iron Curtain, the current crisis in relations between Russia and the West is evolving into a dangerous geopolitical conflict. In Ukraine, the main victim of the conflict, the economy may decline by 8% over the current year. In Russia, the costs of the conflict are estimated to be to the tune of about 1% of GDP, primarily on account of increased investment risks and the financial sanctions. The impact on the individual EU countries differs according to their exposure to the Russian market. The Baltic States and some other NMS will be those most affected on account of their trade channels with estimated losses in the order of up to 0.4% of GDP. The global financial crisis has shattered the rapid expansion of financial intermediation in nearly all of the countries in the region; recovery of crediting activities is still fragmentary and weak. High levels of non-performing loans are a major concern throughout much of the region. There seems to be a justified concern over the region having entered a period of ‘creditless recovery’ which threatens to be much slower than a recovery with strong credit growth. The outlook for GDP growth in the CESEE region is again fairly diversified. Compared to 2013, the growth performance is expected to improve in twelve and deteriorate in nine of the twenty-one countries in the region in 2014. The general medium-term trend for the NMS as a whole is seen to be positive in most of these countries, we expect a gradual acceleration of GDP growth; exceptions are Hungary and Slovenia where a deceleration is forecast, and Poland where the relatively high GDP growth rate will remain practically unchanged. For the current year, the assumption is that the NMS will grow by 1.8 percentage points higher than expansion in the euro area and 1.3 pp above the EU-28 average. In 2015, the gap in favour of NMS growth performance will become somewhat narrower 1.5 pp relative to the euro area and 1.1 pp to the EU-28 average. For some of the countries in the Western Balkans, growth prospects will only improve over the period 2015-2016, closely related to the damage caused by the floods this summer. Turkey will continue to register remarkable economic growth. Growth performance in Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine will worsen in the current year compared to 2013; the medium-term outlook in Russia and Ukraine is, depending on the evolution of the political crisis, fairly uncertain with considerable downward risks. As for our forecasts for 2015 and 2016, a further weakening of performance in the euro area poses a downward risk, while a longer lasting drop in oil prices will represent an upward risk, except for energy exporters Russia and Kazakhstan.
P33|Investment to the Rescue|The Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw) expects GDP in Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) to pick up speed and grow on average by 2-3% over the forecast period 2014-2016 a major driving force rooted in an upward reversal of public and private investment. The question remains, however, whether investment-led growth in the CESEE countries is merely a statistical base effect of a few replacement investments or an indication of a profound paradigmatic shift. Increasing evidence suggests the latter for a number of reasons. During the ongoing economic crisis, public investment was severely reduced. However, in times of extreme uncertainty, the private sector is hesitant to invest. Hence, the public sector has to take the lead. It seems that the time for action has now come. This holds especially true for the New Member States, where towards the end of the previous year additional efforts were made to raise the absorption rate of the funds allocated within the context of the EU multiannual financial framework for 2007-2013 that was about to come to a close. Over the remaining disbursement period of the biennium 2014-2015 substantially higher amounts of EU-funded investment are to be expected. Given that, in practically all cases, national co-financing is also required, CESEE public capital investment will increase, with private investors likely following in its slipstream. Apart from a number of transport infrastructure projects, a host of thermal power plant projects are in the pipeline, as are several major investments in the construction and expansion of nuclear power plants across the region. Apart from public and semi-public infrastructure investment initiatives that have the potential to spur subsequent private investment, improving growth prospects in the euro area, the CESEE economies’ main trading partner, are likely to encourage export industries in the region to modernise and increase their capital stock. This should help avert a lapse into a deflationary spiral and foster a shift towards better equilibrium with lower unemployment rates over the medium term. However, substantial downward risks include possible effects from the current Russia-Ukraine conflict; in particular the interruption of energy supplies, potential trade embargoes or additional interest rate risk premia. All this could adversely affect investment-led growth in CESEE.
P33|Wachstumsbeschleunigung dank Investitionswende in Mittel-, Ost- und Südosteuropa|Das Wirtschaftswachstum wird sich in den mittel-, ost- und südosteuropäischen Ländern (MOSOEL) 2014 bis 2016 verstärken und durchschnittlich 2% bis 3% erreichen. Wesentlicher Wachstumsimpuls ist eine Wende in den öffentlichen und privaten Investitionen.
P33|Trade Liberalization and Embedded Institutional Reform: Evidence from Chinese Exporters|If trade barriers are managed by inefficient institutions, trade liberalization can lead to greater-than-expected gains. We examine Chinese textile and clothing exports before and after the elimination of externally imposed export quotas. Both the surge in export volume and the decline in export prices following quota removal are driven by net entry. This outcome is inconsistent with a model in which quotas are allocated based on firm productivity, implying misallocation of resources. Removing this misallocation accounts for a substantial share of the overall gain in productivity associated with quota removal.
P33|Capital Controls with International Reserve Accumulation: Can This Be Optimal?|Motivated by the Chinese experience, we analyze an economy where the central bank has access to international capital markets, but the private sector does not. The central bank is modeled as a Ramsey planner who can choose the domestic interest rate and the level of international reserves. Consumers are credit-constrained as in Woodford (1990). We find that a rapidly growing economy has a higher welfare without capital mobility. In the Chinese context, we argue that the domestic interest rate should be temporarily above the international rate and that there should be more foreign asset accumulation than in an open economy.
P33|The special economic zone in the Kaliningrad region: development tool or institutional trap?|In this paper we examine the special case of the “degenerated” Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in the Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea — the Kaliningrad region. The ‘compensation Vs. development’ policy dilemma associated with the SEZ in the exclave is elaborated using modified ERP and ETR techniques. Factual results and consequences of more than 20 years of ongoing SEZ institutional instability (a transitional shift from customs tariff to profit taxation preferences) are examined. We show how transfer pricing and formation of hybrid structures reinforce the import-substitution bias of exclave economics. Some concerns about the trade-off between stimulation policies and economic efficiency in the context of the SEZ are discussed.
P33|Soviet foreign trade and the money supply|This study uses newly available data in a quantitative examination of the relationship between Soviet special foreign trade earnings (SFEs) and changes in the money supply. During the Soviet era, SFEs were effectively taxes on imports and exports. They generated as much as 7-15% of state budget revenues in the 1970s and 1980s. The results show that changes in net foreign assets and the money supply accounted for around 10% of SFEs. The remaining 90% of SFEs involve redistribution of existing domestic funds within a constellation of government agencies and state-owned enterprises. The lack of data precluded further exploration of this redistribution. JEL Classification: E66, N14, P33, P34 Keywords: Soviet, foreign trade, money, state budget, flow of funds
P33|Régimes de change et commerce Chine-Afrique|This article studies the effect of exchange rate regimes on the dramatic growth of the trade between China and Sub-Saharan Africa. A real exchange rate augmented gravity model shows that the exports of China’s manufactured goods are stimulated by the real depreciation of the renminbi against many African currencies, while its imports of raw materials from Africa are not affected. Thus, the Chinese competition risks handicapping the development of the industry in the countries which meet a real appreciation of their currency against the renminbi, either because they peg it to the euro or because of the scale of their exports of raw materials, themselves stimulated by the Chinese demand.

P33|Chinaâ€™s Regulatory Framework for Outward Foreign Direct Investment|China has become the worldâ€™s third largest outward investor, behind the United States and Japan. A growing body of literature suggests that Chinaâ€™s regulatory framework for outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) is a determinant of the countryâ€™s rising OFDI. This paper presents a holistic review of that framework, including some possibilities for its improvement. Overall, Chinaâ€™s framework serves two objectives : to help Chinese firms become more competitive internationally and to assist the country in its development effort. In pursuing these objectives, the regulatory framework has moved from restricting, to facilitating, to supporting, to encouraging OFDI; but there are still strong elements of administrative control that make it cumbersome. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) seem to benefit particularly from the current framework when internationalizing through FDI.
P33|Paying a visit: The Dalai Lama effect on international trade|Is political compliance a precondition for healthy trade relations with China? The Chinese government frequently threatens that meetings between its trading partners' officials and the Dalai Lama will be met with animosity and ultimately harm trade ties. We run a gravity model of exports to China from 159 partner countries between 1991 and 2008 to test the extent to which bilateral tensions affect trade with autocratic China. In particular, we empirically investigate whether countries that receive the Dalai Lama despite China's opposition experience a significant reduction in their exports to China. In order to account for the potential endogeneity of meetings with the Dalai Lama, the number of Tibet Support Groups and the travel pattern of the Tibetan leader are used as instruments. Our empirical results support the idea that countries officially receiving the Dalai Lama at the highest political level are punished through a reduction of their exports to China. However, this ‘Dalai Lama Effect’ is only observed for the Hu Jintao era and not for earlier periods. Furthermore, we find that this effect is mainly driven by reduced exports of machinery and transport equipment and that it disappears in the second year after a meeting took place.
P33|Institutional reforms, productivity and profitability: From rents to competition?|This paper explores the divergent effects of institutional reforms on firm’s productivity and profits. To assess this empirically, we investigate the impact of various components of economic liberalisation on the performance of firms from Central and Eastern European countries from 1998 to 2006. The impact of reforms on profitability vis-à-vis productivity differs, which we interpret as an indication that profitability is an ambiguous measure of performance: one needs to distinguish between unproductive rents and productivity-based quasi-rents. We find that competition-enhancing liberalisation measures have more impact on state owned firms as compared with domestic and foreign owned firms.
P33|China’s Economic Diplomacy and Sino-EU Relations|Economic cooperation and trade relations are the cornerstones in EU-China relations. For several decades, their cooperation in economy and trade developed much more rapidly than their political relations. Dialogue at different levels covering a broad range of issues help institutionalize bilateral ties, regularize bilateral exchange and strengthen communication and mutual understanding. The EU stays as China’s largest trading partner and China the EU’s second largest trading partner. Economic diplomacy serves as an important part in Sino-EU relations. Yet, in recent years, along with China’s rise and the euro crisis, there are new challenges to bilateral economic and trade relations. China’s economic diplomacy needs to be revised in order to deal with the changes and meet the challenges. This paper will be composed of the following parts: after a review of EU-China relations, it will define China’s economic diplomacy and its features and analyse four cases of China’s economic diplomacy in its relations with the EU. In the conclusion, it will examine the challenges for the partnership.
P33|Post-communist Country Assistance Programs: Some Approaches to Evaluation of Factors Affecting Their Efficiency|It is for nearly half a century that the problem of measuring efficiency of provision of assistance by more developed countries to less developed ones has been in the center of attention of economists. Notably, in the period after World War II the world has witnessed several stages (models) of assistance that appeared different both in terms of countries-recipients of that and by forms of the assistance provided.

P33|Macroecnomic Impacts of FDI in Transition Economies: A Meta-Study|In this paper, we conduct a meta-analysis of the literature that empirically examines the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic growth in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. We found that existing studies indicate a growth-enhancing effect of FDI in the region as a whole. The results of our meta-regression analysis suggest that the effect size and statistical significance of the reported estimates strongly depend on study conditions. In particular, the estimation period, data type, estimator, and type of FDI variable are important factors that explain the heterogeneity in the empirical results. The degree of freedom and the research quality greatly affect estimates of the FDI variable as well. We also found that the relevant studies fail to present genuine evidence of a non-zero FDI effect due to the presence of publication selection bias and insufficient numbers of empirical evidence. More research is necessary to identify the true effect.
P33|A Gravity Model of Russian Trade: The Role of Foreign Direct Investment and Socio-Cultural Similarity|In this paper, we estimated a gravity model of Russian trade using panel data from Russia and 23 OECD member countries. Our estimation results indicate that foreign direct investment and socio-cultural similarity are determining factors in the trade volume between Russia and these developed economies. We also found that the trade and investment activities of Russian firms differ considerably from their counterparts in developed economies.
P33|Spillover versus Ownership: A Meta-Analysis of Transition Literature|In this paper, we conduct a meta-analysis of the literature that empirically examines the microeconomic impacts of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The meta-synthesis of estimates collected from relevant studies shows that both the effect size and the statistical significance of the indirect effect of FDI, namely the productivity spillover effect, are obviously lower than those of the direct effect caused by foreign participation in company management through ownership. Moreover, the meta-regression analysis reveals that, probably due to the presence of publication selection bias, previous studies have not yet provided empirical evidence of a non-zero productivity spillover effect in the region. Further research efforts are required to capture the true effect.

P33|The Rising Importance of South-South Cooperation in Asia-LAC Economic Relations|It is often argued that the current pattern of ‘complementary’ Trans-Pacific economic cooperation between East Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is not sustainable in terms of trade and investment. Typically LAC economies export low value-added commodities to Asia-Pacific in exchange for high profile manufactures. Although this pattern has pros and cons for both regions, it is being operated in unbalanced fashion. Trans-Pacific investment shows also a unidirectional pattern. From 2003 to 2011, investments from Asia to LAC rose from US$13 to 17 billion, but most of these are Asian investments to a few large economies like Brazil and Mexico. Development cooperation between economies in Asia and LAC is an increasingly important pillar of bilateral economic relationships. It is also the area that offers measurable evidence of interregional cooperation. Nevertheless, the trend here is also the typical unidirectional pattern of cooperation with Asian resources mobilized towards LAC. Therefore, this paper will suggest South-South Cooperation (SSC) including Triangular Development Cooperation (TDC) as a newly rising mechanism for sustainable Trans-Pacific relations after assessing existing practices between three Asian countries: China, Japan and Korea, and LAC. In conclusion, the paper emphasizes two directions for future cooperation: first, the strengthened role of multilateral framework for active interactions among non-traditional partners; second, the contribution of SSC towards more balanced relations between Asia and LAC. Unlike typical Asia-LAC development cooperation of channeling Asian resources and experiences to LAC, equally rich experience and development practices of the latter must be viewed as critical resources for Asian developing countries.
P33|Boosting Vocational Training and Skills Development : A Case of Triangular Cooperation among Brazil, Germany, and Peru|Cooperation agreements based on Triangular Cooperation are gaining momentum in the development community and are widely recognized as tools to promote development effectiveness. Although there is no globally agreed definition of Triangular Cooperation (as it has several modalities depending on the actors involved), there is a common understanding that it involves at least one provider of knowledge and facilitates the sharing of experiences with other developing countries. In Latin America, Brazil has emerged in recent years as an important provider of knowledge and technical cooperation. The Brazilian National Service for Industrial Apprenticeship (SENAI), in partnership with the Peruvian Vocational Training Institute (SENATI) and the German Cooperation Agency (GIZ), entered into a cooperation agreement that resulted in the creation of the Center for Environmental Technologies (CTA), based in Peru. The Center aims at training professionals in areas related to clean production and environmental conservation. Its establishment shows that Triangular Cooperation succeeds when the institutions involved share ownership, have similar strategic interests, and expect to derive mutual benefits from the partnership.
P33|South-South Cooperation and Companies in Brazil and Chile|This article analyzes the participation of companies in the South-South Cooperation (SSC) of Brazil and Chile during the last decade. It proposes that economic interests attract the private sector into SSC -no exclusion being made of solidarity reasons- and that such interests are in line with the foreign policy objectives set by both governments. As Brazil and Chile have implemented very similar economic programs -the Brazilian one inspired in German neoliberalism, whereas the Chilean one, in the Chicago school, with less State intervention (Ramírez, 2012, p. 77)-, their companies’ participation enables us to observe whether the economic model has any impact on the role they play in SSC. During the last decade, Brazil’s and Chile’s SSC has pursued political and economic goals that form part of their respective national interest within a realistic approach to international relations. This interest is reflected in their economic policies, whereby companies can accumulate resources (capital, knowledge, expertise) to reach the international market; therefore, business strategies are rooted in national economic policies (Goldstein, 2007). In both cases, SSC is a foreign policy instrument helping Brazil and Chile attain their economic goals and overcome their neighbors’ mistrust and the new stratification of the Global South, according to which they are at an intermediate level close to the developed countries (Vieira Alden, 2011). Moreover, SSC serves as a mechanism to gain recognition and support (Brazil, at the WTO and the UN; Chile, among its regional priority partners), without necessarily representing a contradiction between solidarity for development and national economic advancement (Burges, 2012). This encourages business involvement, despite the differences as to the mechanisms used by either government to boost it and the type of business that participates (large-sized companies in Brazil, SMEs in Chile). In Brazil and Chile, private companies reap benefits from SSC, which have a positive impact on the governments’ political interests. Furthermore, SSC relies on the competitive advantages (technology, domestic savings, etc.) that these companies create as government policies favor their interests. In this sense, the economic model in Brazil and Chile is relevant for these countries’ SSC, as it gives the private sector a fundamental role in supporting their foreign policy goals. Overall, SSC and companies appear to supplement and support each other in both countries, without discrediting the benefits brought to third countries.

P33|La creciente importancia de la Cooperación Sur-Sur en las relaciones económicas entre Asia y ALC|Suele argumentarse que el actual esquema de cooperación 'complementaria' en el ámbito transpacífico entre países de Asia Oriental y de América Latina y el Caribe (ALC) no es sustentable en términos de comercio e inversión. Básicamente, las economías de ALC exportan materias primas de bajo valor agregado a la región del Asia Pacífico, a cambio de bienes manufacturados de alto valor agregado. Si bien este esquema presenta aspectos positivos y negativos para ambas regiones, funciona en base a un desequilibrio. Además, la inversión transpacífica muestra un patrón unidireccional. En el período 2003-2011, la inversión de Asia a ALC creció de US$13.000 millones a US$17.000 millones, pero en general se trataban de inversiones asiáticas colocadas en unas pocas economías grandes, tales como las de Brasil y México. La cooperación para el desarrollo entre las economías de Asia y ALC se está convirtiendo en un pilar cada vez más importante de las relaciones económicas bilaterales. Asimismo, esta área proporciona datos cuantificables sobre cooperación interregional. No obstante, se observa una tendencia hacia el mismo tipo de esquema de cooperación unidireccional según el cual las inversiones son recursos asiáticos en ALC. Así, tras analizar las prácticas actuales entre China, Japón y Corea -del lado asiático- y ALC, el presente trabajo postula que la Cooperación Sur-Sur (CSS), incluida la Cooperación Triangular para el Desarrollo (CTD), es un mecanismo novedoso de creciente relevancia para lograr relaciones transpacíficas sustentables. A modo de conclusión se recomiendan dos vías de acción para cooperaciones futuras: en primer lugar, fortalecer el papel desempeñado por el marco multilateral para fomentar la interacción entre socios no tradicionales y, en segundo lugar, apoyar la CSS para lograr un mayor equilibrio en las relaciones entre Asia y ALC. A diferencia del esquema típico de cooperación para el desarrollo entre Asia y ALC, según el cual los recursos y las experiencias de Asia se vuelcan en ALC, los países asiáticos emergentes deberían considerar como recursos importantes las experiencias y prácticas de ALC, que son igualmente enriquecedoras en materia de desarrollo.
P33|La promoción de la capacitación profesional y del desarrollo de habilidades : Un caso de Cooperación Triangular entre Alemania, Brasil y Perú|La investigación empírica demuestra que los acuerdos de cooperación técnica son herramientas de política exterior que contribuyen a afianzar las alianzas bilaterales, sobre todo entre los países en desarrollo. De acuerdo con Barros Leal (2013), los acuerdos de cooperación técnica se centran en la transferencia voluntaria de conocimiento y no tienen condicionalidades. La Cooperación Técnica entre Países en Desarrollo (CTPD) o la Cooperación Sur-Sur ha ganado terreno en el diálogo global sobre la efectividad del desarrollo. La Cooperación Triangular también gana impulso por cuanto los socios para el desarrollo buscan alternativas al enfoque tradicional Norte-Sur de la cooperación para el desarrollo. Existe consenso en cuanto a que la Cooperación Triangular debe involucrar, al menos, a un proveedor de cooperación para el desarrollo o a una organización internacional y a uno o más proveedores de Cooperación Sur-Sur para facilitar el intercambio de conocimiento y de experiencias con otros países en desarrollo (OCDE, 2012). En América Latina, en los últimos años, Brasil se ha convertido en un proveedor importante de cooperación técnica y de conocimiento. El Servicio Nacional para el Aprendizaje Industrial (SENAI) de Brasil, en asociación con el Servicio Nacional de Adiestramiento en Trabajo Industrial (SENATI) de Perú y la Agencia Alemana para la Cooperación Internacional para el Desarrollo (GIZ), firmaron un acuerdo de cooperación que dio lugar a la creación del Centro de Tecnologías Ambientales (CTA), con sede en Perú. El Centro apunta a formar profesionales en áreas relacionadas con la producción limpia y la preservación del ambiente. Su creación demuestra que la Cooperación Triangular es posible cuando las instituciones involucradas asumen un compromiso compartido, tienen intereses estratégicos similares y esperan obtener beneficios mutuos de su alianza. La relación institucional positiva entre el SENAI, la SENATI y la GIZ brindó bases sólidas para la implementación del acuerdo de Cooperación Triangular y la creación del CTA. Las tres partes trabajaron en estrecha colaboración para crear el Centro con el fin de formar una base de personas calificadas para responder a las necesidades de las industrias en temas relacionados con la protección ambiental y la producción limpia. El SENATI asumirá la plena responsabilidad de la gestión del Centro a la finalización del proyecto triangular, momento en el que las partes podrán evaluar los resultados obtenidos y su impacto. Esta iniciativa se sustenta claramente en una sólida alianza en áreas estratégicas de interés para todos los socios y con beneficios para el sector industrial. Por estas razones, el CTA podría convertirse en un centro de excelencia en su campo y en un centro regional de conocimientos.

P33|Corruption, Networking and Foreign Ownership: Recent Evidence from CEE Countries|The present paper argues that the effect of corruption on foreign ownership is not necessarily linear and depends on the level of host corruption. So long as the expected returns from foreign investments exceed its expected costs, higher host corruption will be associated with higher foreign ownership. However, costs may exceed or exactly compensate the returns to foreign investment at very high level of corruption, giving rise to negative or even an insignificant relationship when positive and negative effects outweigh each other. Further, we argue that this non-linear corruption effects may arise from multinational firms' attempts to investing in countries with similar environment and/or ensuring some formal networking with host countries in a bid to limit the damages caused by high level of host corruption. Panel fixed effects estimates (after correcting for foreign entry selection) using a recent large home-host matched panel data from central and eastern European host countries provide some support to these hypotheses: (i) higher corruption is associated with significantly higher foreign ownership unless corruption is at its fourth quartile value. (ii) There is also some confirmation that this non-linear corruption effects is linked to parent firms' attempts to ensure institutional similarity while investing in corrupt host countries: in particular, foreign multinationals from EU/OECD home countries tend to hold higher ownership in EU/OECD host countries and also when the home-host relative corruption distance is small.
P33|Intangible Knowledge Capital and Innovation in China|"Intangible knowledge capital (IKC) â€“ technology produced by workers but not embodied in them â€“ can offset the ""middle income trap"" as China exhausts the benefits of international technology transfer. IKC is productivity-enhancing among Chinese enterprises â€“ more so in domestically owned than in foreign invested enterprises. Consistent with other research, we find that China's IKC generates patents in China, but fewer than in major industrialized economies. Among domestically owned enterprises, IKC growth has flowed more toward higher-tech, export-oriented industries, while among foreign invested enterprises, it has been oriented more toward domestic sales."
P33|Globalization And Foreign Direct Investments|Mobilizing financial resources to cover investment needs is a concern of all countries, developed or developing ones, of consolidated market economies or emerging ones. A distinctive characteristic of Global Economy over the last few decades has been the rising rate and impressive increase in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The purpose of this research is to analyse global FDI inflows in Europe and in Romania. The results of the research support the idea that the balance of economic power is changing in the world economy and the countries that own a stable and solid industrial base are at an advantage. The new trends determined by the economic crisis in the field of FDI refer to the growing percentage of developing and emerging countries in the global flows of FDI.
P33|Determinants Of Foreign Direct Investment Development|FDI had a strong impact in the last three decades on economic growth, foreign trade and production structures in almost all countries. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the main factors that contribute to attracting foreign direct investment flows and also the competitiveness of the business environment in Romania and its implications on investment decisions and economic growth. Research results show that the presence of FDI goes to those areas that can provide efficiencies investment factors: skilled and qualified labor, educational and research institutions etc.
P33|Central Asian Trade Relations in the Post-Soviet Era|By looking at post colonial trade relationships of the world countries for period of 1948-2006, Head and Mayer (HM [Head et al. (2010)]) conclude that a country's trade with the colonizer, typically, erodes by 60% after 30 years of independence. However, the CAR (Central Asian Republics(CAR) arehave been independent from itstheir colonizer, Russia for over 22 years, but their trade since 1995 has been is steady and increasing. As a highly-specific application of Head and Mayer's (HM[Head et al. (2010)]) study of post-colonial ties, CAR-Russia trade may appear to contradict the predictions or imply that there are interesting factors at work. We aimed to investigate what is explaining CAR-Russia trade based onn the CAR's' bilateral trade forin the Post-Soviet period under a gravity framework according to in terms of a combination of monadic (country-specific) effects, such as national GDP, and dyadic (bilateral) effects associated with relative trade costs. We find that (1) dyadic time-varying “RTA” and time-invariant “Landlockedness”, and monadic “importer's GDP” are highly significant in trade with the Central Asian Republics while “Tariffs” have low importance; (2) the CAR-Russia pair unobservable trade costs that are sensitive to global shocks had increased by 20%, their trade continued to be steady and increasing which is due to monadic effects (i.e., GDP growth, following the recovery in wWorld oil prices increase); (3) dynamics analysis of 185 country pairs trade show that 3/4 cases of observed changes in country pair trade is explained by country-specific features and 1/4 cases by bilateral trade relationships. Additionally, we find that country pair trade of the less liberal CARs (Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan) forwas 96% driven byexplained by a monadic effect, while for the more liberal CARs (Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan), trade for 50% is influenced by a dyadic effect.
P33|Distance to default and the financial crisis|This paper analyses contingent-claims based measures of distance to default (D2D) for the 41 largest global banking institutions over the period 2006H2 to 20011H2. D2D falls from end-2006 through to end-2008. Cross-sectional differences in D2D prior to the crisis do not predict either bank failure or bank share prices decline, but D2D measured in mid-2008 does have some predictive value for failure by end-year. The ‘option value’ of the bank safety net remains small except at the height of the crisis and there is little indication of bank shareholders consciously using the safety net to shift risk onto taxpayers.
P33|Un modèle social-démocrate pour la Chine ? Remarques critiques sur la voie chinoise : capitalisme et empire de Michel Aglietta et Guo Bai|This article was written for a collective book published by Delga Publ., gathering together contributions on contemporary China, in particular those presented during a conference organized at the French National Assembly in March 2013. It proposes critical comments on La Voie chinoise written by Michel Aglietta and Guo Bai. After having presented the interpretation of the Chinese “sui generis capitalism” given by the authors, then our own interpretation, we discuss some of the themes examined in this book, among others: the analysis of the imbalances of the Chinese economy, the issues of the allocation of factors and their prices, those of the management of natural resources and of access to land, the rules to be applied to the bond and stock markets, the internationalization of the currency and monetary sovereignty, the specificities of the state-owned enterprises, the conception of the public services, strategic planning, the question of power and “Chinese-type socialism”
P33|Property Rights As A Factor Of Foreign Direct Investment. The Case Of Poland|Clearly defined property rights enable people and business to make contracts over such property, and thus to engage in business – most business transactions concern the transfer of some sort of property, or rights to property. It seems that property rights have huge influence on foreign direct investment inflow, especially in the Polish economy. Therefore, the aim of this article is to verify the hypothesis that property rights are an important factor for foreign direct investment flow. The object of the research is the Polish economy in the years 1994-2011. The first part of this paper shows the dynamics and structure of FDI inflows to the Polish economy in the years 1994-2011. Next two parts clarify the idea of property rights, their transformation, importance to the growth and foreign direct investment inflow. Verification of the hypothesis will be made on the basis of domestic and foreign literature.
P33|Bridging the Institutional Void: An Analytical Concept to Develop Valuable Cluster Services|Public policy and cluster management face a common challenge in developing sustainable clusters. Many clusters report difficulties acquiring membership fees once the governmental subsidies come to an end, which brings doubts as to the cluster management’s capabilities and likewise to the public policy design. This paper applies the theory of institutional voids and elaborates a theoretical framework to identify cluster services. It shows that analyzing the specific institutional environment of the cluster enables the identification of valuable cluster services. As the identified institutional voids impose a competitive disadvantage on the companies, such services will increase their willingness to pay. Therewith, the article combines cluster literature and institutional theory to draw synergies on participation incentives.
P33|Aid effectiveness and imperfect monitoring: EU development aid as Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma|This paper analyzes the effectiveness of EU development aid to the economies of the former Soviet Union under conditions of imperfect monitoring. Transnational sovereignty partnerships (TSPs) suggest a novel type of aid recipient and an institutional component of the TACIS program. TSPs are composed of distributive planners and developmental entrepreneurs. Distributive planners set the development strategy and developmental entrepreneurs implement it based on EU development aid. I model the delivery of EU development aid to the former Soviet Union as an infinitely repeated Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma with private signals. Aid effectiveness occurs when the European Commission signals that it will finance another TSP, without reducing its expected profit from aid implementation.
P33|Determinants of Economic Growth: Bounds Testing Approach|In this study, the effects of foreign direct investments and exports on Turkeyâ€™s economic growth are analyzed via bounds testing approach by using 1992:Q1-2012:Q3 period data.

In the long and short run analysis, the effect of export on the economic growth is statistically significant; however effect of foreign direct investment on the economic growth is positive but statistically insignificant. The modelâ€™s error correction mechanism has been worked.
P33|China’s fare share? The growth of Chinese exports in world trade|The growth of Chinese exports in market share over the past two decades is a singular event in the history of world trade. Using data from 1995–2010, we document this growth in a variety of ways. We show that the expanded trade is pervasive. Virtually every country in the world has seen China claim a larger share of its import market. Then, we use Constant Market Share analysis to determine which country or countries have lost market share as China’s trade has grown. Contrary to much discussion in the popular press, we find strong evidence that other developing countries have not seen export shares fall as a result of China’s gains. Rather, our results suggest that China’s share growth has come largely at the expense of exporters based in developed countries, especially Japan and the United States. Copyright Kiel Institute 2013
P33|Double-dip Recession over, yet no Boom in Sight|Summary The protracted recession in the euro area will continue to be a drag on the economic growth of most CESEE countries in 2013. By and large, those countries are small open economies held hostage to the excessive fiscal austerity pursued in the euro area and the sluggish progress on the part of its policy-makers in adequately addressing the structural roots of the crisis. At the same time, the private sector demand in the CESEE countries is unlikely to recover substantially in the near term either. Wherever there will be an increase in investments, it will be primarily funded via public money, with EU transfers playing an increasingly important role. In general, the prospects for 2013 are only marginally better than the previous year; any significant improvement will be unlikely before 2014 – in line with the projected recovery in the euro area. These are the main results of the newly released medium-term growth forecast for the region by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw). Weak exports and suppressed domestic demand pushed nearly half of the Central, East and Southeast European (CESEE) economies into recession in 2012, including the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and nearly all Western Balkan countries. Elsewhere in the region, growth remained positive but was generally unspectacular, with the notable exceptions of Kazakhstan and Latvia. Also in countries that hitherto had been relatively immune to the euro area crisis (such as Russia, Poland, Ukraine and Turkey), growth dynamics progressively decelerated in the second half of the year. On the whole, 2012 was a disappointing year for the CESEE economies, confirming fears of a double-dip recession in the euro area adversely impacting large parts of the CESEE region. This rather poor performance stands in sharp contrast to the better dynamics in other ‘emerging markets’ in Asia and Latin America, and underscores the dependence of large parts of the CESEE region on the troubled euro area (not least in terms of policies pursued) and the structural weakness of many CESEE economies. The crucial factor behind the disappointing CESEE growth performance has been the weakness of domestic demand. Import demand generally lagged behind export growth, and net exports contributed positively to GDP growth in 2012 – despite the anaemic external environment. High unemploymentand stagnant wages, coupled with fiscal austerity and the ongoing (albeit in some cases decelerating) household deleveraging, continue to weigh heavily on the dynamics of private consumption in most CESEE countries, with the exception of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and the Baltic states. In turn, investment activity is suppressed by the lasting, and in some cases even deteriorating, perception of uncertain future prospects and by underutilized capacities in an environment characterized by weak demand – even though large parts of the corporate sector are awash with liquidity. In these circumstances, the investment dynamics in the region has been shaped by public investment projects, frequently supported by EU transfers (first of all in Estonia and Romania). The expected marginal improvement in economic performance in some CESEE countries in 2013 is largely due to the somewhat less restrictive fiscal policy (e.g. the Czech Republic) or a better performance of agriculture (Serbia, Romania). However, in Poland and Slovakia economic growth will decelerate, while Slovenia and Croatia will be unable to avoid another recession this year – notwithstanding the likely beneficial impact of inflows of EU funds in the latter case. The near-term economic prospects are generally better on the ‘fringes’ of the CESEE region the Baltic states, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey, which are less dependent on the troubled euro area and are in no rush (or need) to pursue fiscal consolidation. In Ukraine, economic prospects are dependent on a timely and ‘controlled’ currency devaluation, which would be crucial for the badly needed growth re-balancing. Even under the most optimistic scenario, in the medium and long term the CESEE countries will be generally unable to replicate the growth rates observed prior to the 2008-2009 crisis. In the Western Balkans, the bleak growth prospects and the high levels of unemployment may eventually imperil the fragile social and political stability of these countries. The newly released wiiw Forecast Report also contains ‘special topics’ dealing in-depth with (1) regional and EU-wide fiscal policy issues, (2) the extent of deleveraging in the household, corporate and banking sectors, and (3) the patterns of structural adjustment and unit labour cost developments in the CESEE countries. Last but not least, it includes for the first time a country report and statistical information on Kosovo.
P33|Animal Spirits still Dimmed: Slow Recovery Expected|Summary Continued weak external demand and uncertain recovery of investments will allow for only modest growth prospects for the countries of Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) this year. Slovenia, Croatia and the Czech Republic will remain in recession. Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic countries will experience a slowdown of growth. Over the next two years, growth will speed up, but will remain below potential for most CESEE countries except Kazakhstan and likely Turkey. The emerging institutional and policy framework in the EU that reflects unresolved dilemmas about the process of deepening may put in question the model of convergence growth. Widening of the EU is, in contrast, proceeding with Croatia acceding and the intention to start negotiations with Serbia being announced. However, given the worsening labour markets, social and political risks may be on the rise. These are the main results of the newly released medium-term growth forecast for the region by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw). wiiw expects slow recovery this year within a mostly restrictive policy framework. Some acceleration, due in part to an improved external environment for EU and CESEE economies and in part to growth of investments, is forecast for the medium term. However, the set of better performers has shrunk, with Poland’s and Slovakia’s performance coming more in line with the growing number of slowly recovering economies. Recovery is slowing down in the Baltic region. There are still some countries that are struggling with recession, such as Slovenia and Croatia and also the Czech Republic within the CESEE group. Stability issues are also still being faced in a number of Balkan countries, e.g. Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina; by contrast, Albania and Kosovo are managing to stay out of recession and on a relatively elevated growth path. Russia and Ukraine are seeing either a slowdown of growth or prospects for stagnation and slow recovery, while positive news keep coming from Kazakhstan and faster growth resuming in Turkey. By and large, Central European countries are relying on a positive contribution from net exports and investments, the Balkan countries on recovery of industrial production and exports, Russia and Ukraine, and perhaps also Turkey, rely on a continued positive contribution of household consumption, and Kazakhstan on receipts from sales of oil and gas. None of these factors is particularly strong – hence weak GDP growth expectations prevail. Last but not least, the contribution of public consumption and investments tends to be rather limited throughout the whole of Europe. Monetary policy has been stabilising due to the assertive communication rather than action by the European Central Bank (ECB) and due to mostly relaxing actions by the other central banks in CESEE. However, these have affected recovery to a lesser extent because of the continuing process of consolidation in the financial sector. While sovereigns have seen a decline in the spreads of their yields, a similar calming down of interest rates in the private sector has been insufficient to support stronger credit activity, especially when it comes to small and medium-sized enterprises. This can be expected to continue to be a drag on growth of investments and thus also on overall GDP growth. Within the institutional and policy framework geared towards elimination of external and internal macroeconomic imbalances, the bulk of the structural adjustment is happening in the labour markets. Employment rates have declined in most countries while unemployment in particular among the youth and the long-term unemployed is on the rise. This is particularly damaging in the Balkans where the labour markets have been in depression even before the eruption of the crisis. There are few if any indications of a turnaround in the labour markets in the medium term. The strengthened emphasis on the correction of imbalances, reflected in the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure of the EU, may turn out to be harmful for the countries benefiting from EU transfers due to increased stress on using these funds as a disciplining device. In addition to fiscal imbalances, which should prove less of a problem to many CESEE countries, the correction of external and labour market imbalances may turn out to be more difficult to address. Moreover, balanced growth, implying less reliance on cross-border financing, may be a problem for countries that cannot move to a new growth model by mobilising more domestic savings. The processes of deepening and widening of the EU are proceeding, with deepening being more at a project- and institution-building stage while widening is getting a new boost by the accession of Croatia and by the start of accession negotiations with Serbia early next year. Croatia’s accession to the common market also means its departure from the regional free trade area, the CEFTA. Estimates of trade and welfare effects point to relatively mild overall negative consequences for Croatia in the short run. Those should be outweighed by more general positive effects of EU membership in the medium and long run. In a nutshell the CESEE region faces a slow recovery in the short and medium term with unclear prospects for long-run growth and economic convergence.
P33|Impact of Croatian EU Accession on Regional Trade Patterns|Summary This report aims to analyse the regional trade effects of Croatia’s accession to the EU and simultaneous exit from the CEFTA agreement on 1st July 2013. The Global Simulation Model (GSIM) as proposed by Francois and Hall (2003) is being applied. As the change in Croatian tariff protection is rather small, price and output changes for most CEFTA countries are expected to be mostly negligible. Only for Croatia the simulation suggests that overall consumer prices might fall by as much as 0.39% and real output by 0.41%, in the short run. However, it can be expected that EU support funds will offset that loss many times over. The share of Croatian exports to the EU is expected to increase by 2.2 percentage points, while the share of exports to the CEFTA countries and to the rest of the world is expected to drop by 0.7 and 1.5 percentage points, respectively.
P33|Auswirkungen der Arbeitsmarktöffnung am 1. Jänner 2014 auf den Wirtschafts- und Arbeitsstandort Österreich|Summary Impact of opening full labour market access to Bulgarians and Romanians as of 1 January 2014 the case of Austria The study analyses the migration potential and the impact on Austria’s economy that is to be expected after the lifting of access restrictions for Bulgarian and Romanian nationals as of 1 January 2014. Estimates show that in the years 2014 and 2015 net migration from the EU-2 to Austria will account for 5700 and 5300 additional migrants, respectively, solely due to the full liberalisation of the labour market. About three quarters of EU-2 migrants are expected to come from Romania. The macroeconomic impact of opening the labour market in January 2014 is being assessed by using the general equilibrium model TaxLab. Given the fact that persons with a higher educational level may work in Austria already now under certain conditions, it can be expected that after the liberalisation larger shares of persons with a lower level of education will migrate to Austria. The simulations reveal that in the years following the opening of the labour market, employment will be by about 6700 persons higher than it would be without liberalisation in 2014 and by about 10,300 persons above that level in 2015. The employment effect results not only from the higher population flows but also from the activation of a part of those Bulgarian and Romanian migrants who have been resident in Austria already before the liberalisation. The additional labour force supply together with labour market frictions cause a temporary marginal increase in the overall unemployment rate by only 0.03 percentage points in both 2014 and 2015. The additional labour supply will have a very minor dampening effect on wage growth. As compared to a scenario where the current restrictions are maintained, wages will rise by about 0.2 percentage points more slowly. The strongest losses in wage growth will occur for the low-skilled and the smallest losses in the case of the high-skilled workforce. As a result of the rise in employment and the increased capital stock, value-added will rise as well. The simulation shows that gross domestic product in 2014 and 2015 will be higher by about 0.09% and 0.13%, respectively, than it would be without labour market liberalisation.
P33|The Rise of Middle Kingdoms: Emerging Economies in Global Trade|In this paper, I examine changes in international trade associated with the integration of low- and middle-income countries into the global economy. Led by China and India, the share of developing economies in global exports more than doubled between 1994 and 2008. One feature of new trade patterns is greater South-South trade. China and India have booming demand for imported raw materials, which they use to build cities and factories. Industrialization throughout the South has deepened global production networks, contributing to greater trade in intermediate inputs. A second feature of new trade patterns is the return of comparative advantage as a driver of global commerce. Growth in low- and middle-income nations makes specialization according to comparative advantage more important for the global composition of trade, as North-South and South-South commerce overtakes North-North flows. China's export specialization evolves rapidly over time, revealing a capacity to speed up product ladders. Most developing countries hyper-specialize in a handful of export products. The emergence of low- and middle-income countries in trade reveals significant gaps in knowledge about the deep empirical determinants of export specialization, the dynamics of specialization patterns, and why South-South and North-North trade differ.
P33|Aggregate Savings and External Imbalances in China|Over the last decade, the internal and external macroeconomic imbalances in China have risen to unprecedented levels. In 2008, China's national savings rate soared to over 53 percent of its GDP, whereas its current account surplus exceeded 9 percent of GDP. This paper presents a unified framework for understanding the structural causes of these imbalances. I argue that the imbalances are attributable to a set of policies and institutions embedded in the economy. I propose a unified framework for understanding the joint causes of the high savings rate and external imbalances in China. My explanations first focus on an array of factors that encouraged saving across the corporate, government, and household sectors, such as policies that affected sectoral income distribution, along with factors like incomplete social welfare reforms, and population control policies. I then turn to policies that limited investment in China, thus preventing the high savings from being used domestically. Finally, I will examine how trade policies, such as export tax rebates, special economic zones, and exchange rate policies, strongly promote exports. Moreover, the accession of China to the World Trade Organization has dramatically amplified the effects of these structural distortions. In conclusion, I recommend some policy reforms for rebalancing the Chinese economy.
P33|Romania Foreign Trade in Global Recession, Revealed by the Extended Method of Exchange Rate Indicators|In this article the authors propose an extended method for assessing foreign trade, which is capitalized on in the analysis of foreign trade/external marketing, under the influence of two of the most difficult recession of the Romanian economy, placed in the last interwar decade and in the first decade of the new millennium. The selection of the periods for the analysis, despite and beyond the methodological shortcomings concerning the provision of statistical comparability, which is relatively overcome by the advantages of the method, was dictated by the regulator impact of the major recessions in Romanian foreign trade, which offers the possibility to identify a national profile of economic behaviour. The structure of the article includes, after an introductory reference to approaching external marketing in the main economic theories, the first section dealing with the repertoire of foreign trade theories, with main emphasis on the specific contemporary issues and trends, but also a section for detailing the extended method proposed and the original statistical tools that are proposed (from the spread of the mobile rates of the contrary flows, to the indices and coefficients of the Hirschman and Gini-Struck type in curve ABC), and of the databases. Once applied in the results section, the extended method manages to quantify the broad outline of a reactive profile, slightly lagging and inertial, of the external marketing / foreign trade of the national economy, in relation to crisis or recession in both time analyses, which is relatively stable for eight decades, providing space for comments that allow greater macro-economic self-awareness. The main final remark shows that a small starting gap, apparently favourable, of Romanian foreign trade, in response to crisis or recession type phenomena, cannot however compensate the inertial trend of these cyclic phenomena, which is slightly longer than one year, and whose negative impact is strongly felt and amplified.
P33|Speed Dating or Serious Courtship? Canada and Foreign State-Owned Enterprises|Two acquisition bids by foreign state-owned enterprises (SOEs) for Canadian resource companies have raised an array of concerns about their potential impact, ranging from worries about national security and governance standards to reciprocal access to markets. While Ottawa’s current screening rules and guidelines are mostly adequate to address these concerns, mechanisms should be created to more explicitly address possible anti-competitive impacts of SOE investments and to review whether SOEs keep their good governance commitments. If Canada wants to benefit from Asia’s long-term growth potential, there is no getting around the need to facilitate trade, investment and other exchanges with China – and with other economies where the state currently plays a determining role.
P33|Impacts of crime and violence in Southern provinces of Thailand on border trade|This study aims to examine the factors of crime and violence in southern border provinces of Thailand. It also attempts to investigate other factors that affect Thailand - Malaysia border trade. The Binary Choice Model has been used to analyze the relationship on each variable. The independent variables consist of the attitude of entrepreneurs on group of crime and violence; group of social; group of economics; and group of politics, while the dependent variable is the income of entrepreneurs in Thailand - Malaysia border line. The data correlated in this study is the primary data, collected from local business units in southern border provinces of Thailand including Yala, Pattani, Songkla, and Narathiwat. The questionnaire has been collected from 400 respondents from each province aforementioned. The results of this study indicate that each variable in this model has statistical significant relationship. The results show that group of crime and violence factor, group of social factor, group of economics factor, and group of politics factor have impacted on the income of entrepreneurs in Thailand - Malaysia border line. From the analysis, it has been founded that group of crime and violence, group of social, group of economics, and group of politics are impacted on border trade.
P33|Russland und die Ukraine: Zwei neue Global Player auf dem Weizenmarkt|Russland und die Ukraine haben sich in den letzten Jahren in den TOP 10 der Weizenexporteure etabliert. Beide Länder verfügen zudem noch über nicht ausgeschöpfte Produktionspotenziale. Russland und die Ukraine könnten ihre aktuellen Exportmengen durch eine Erhöhung der Bodenproduktivität sowie durch die Rekultivierung der seit Beginn der 90er Jahre brachgefallenen Flächen mehr als verdoppeln. Dies erfordert allerdings institutionelle Reformen, die dazu beitragen, dass die Unternehmen in der Landwirtschaft und der Agrarindustrie verstärkt auf Marktsignale reagieren. Die Exportbeiträge beider Länder hatten in den letzten Jahren tendenziell einen dämpfenden Effekt auf den Anstieg der Weltmarktpreise für Weizen. Dementsprechend sind die Exportrestriktionen Russlands und der Ukraine von großer Bedeutung für das Entstehen der Preisspitzen auf den Weltweizenmärkten, die von einem Anstieg der Preisvolatilität begleitet werden. Ein Vergleich der länderspezifischen Exportpreise legt darüber hinaus den Schluss nahe, dass Russland in den Hauptabsatzregionen (Kaukasus und Maschrek) in der Lage ist, durch Preisdiskriminierung seine marktbeherrschende Position auszunutzen.
P33|Russland und die Ukraine: Zwei neue Global Player auf dem Weizenmarkt|Russia and Ukraine have established themselves in recent years as the top 10 exporters of wheat in the world. Both countries also have not reached their full production potential. Russia and Ukraine could double their current export volumes by increasing the soil productivity, as well as the utilization of land, abandoned since early 90s. However, this requires institutional reforms that help the agribusiness companies respond better to market signals. The export subsidies in both countries in recent years tended to have a dampening effect on the rise in world wheat prices. Accordingly, the export restrictions in Russia and Ukraine which created the price spikes in global wheat markets are of great importance to research, as they were accompanied by an increase in price volatility. Due to the fact that there are different country-specific export prices, there should be a country-specific comparison conducted, which would contribute to an argument that in Russia's main export regions (Caucasus and Mashreq), price discrimination is exercised.

P33|Foreign investment and bribery: A firm-level analysis of corruption in Vietnam|Among the concerns faced by countries pondering the costs and benefits of greater economic openness to international capital flows is the worry that new and powerful external actors will exert a corrupting influence on the domestic economy. In this paper, we use a novel empirical strategy, drawn from research in experimental psychology, to test the linkage between foreign direct investment (FDI) and corruption. The prevailing literature has produced confused and contradictory results on this vital relationship due to errors in their measurement of corruption which are correlated with FDI inflows. When a less biased operationalization is employed, we find clear evidence of corruption during both registration and procurement procedures in Vietnam. The prevalence of corruption, however, is not associated with inflows of FDI. On the contrary, one measure of economic openness appears to be the most important driver of reductions in Vietnamese corruption: the wave of domestic legislation, which accompanied the country's bilateral trade liberalization agreement with the United States (US-BTA), significantly reduced bribery during business registration.
P33|Integration in the absence of institutions: China–North Korea cross-border exchange|Theory tells us that weak rule of law and institutions deter cross-border integration, deter investment relative to trade, and inhibit trade finance. Drawing on a survey of more than 300 Chinese enterprises that are doing or have done business in North Korea, we consider how informal institutions have addressed these problems in a setting in which rule of law and institutions are particularly weak. Given the apparent reliance on hedging strategies, the rapid growth in exchange witnessed in recent years may prove self-limiting, as the effectiveness of informal institutions erode and the risk premium rises. Institutional improvement could have significant welfare implications, affecting the volume, composition, and financial terms of cross-border exchange.
P33|Institutions and FDI location choice: The role of cultural distances|Using an extensive data set on foreign invested enterprises (FIEs) in the Chinese mainland, we compare the sensitivities of the location choice of foreign direct investment (FDI) from six major source countries/areas (Hong Kong, Taiwan, US, EU, Japan and Korea) toward the variation in the strength of economic institutions across China's regions. It is found that FIEs from the source countries/areas that are culturally more remote from China often exhibit a stronger aversion to regions with weaker economic institutions. Moreover, this pattern is often more salient when FDI takes the form of fully-owned enterprises (FOEs) than when it takes the form of joint ventures (JVs).
P33|Domestic value added and employment generated by Chinese exports: A quantitative estimation|We develop an input–output methodology to estimate how Chinese exports affected the country's total domestic value added (DVA) and employment in the years 2002 and 2007. For every US$1000 dollar of Chinese exports in 2007 (2002), DVA and employment are estimated to be US$591 (US$466) and 0.096 (0.242) person-year, respectively. To implement these estimations, we use hitherto unpublished Chinese government data to construct several completely new datasets, including an input–output table with separate input–output and employment-output coefficients for processing exports, non-processing exports, and output for domestic use. We hypothesize that, in comparison with the export sector, China's domestic sector would be relatively autarkic due to China's history of central planning. We expect that exports would generate less DVA and employment than output for domestic use. Processing exports, which are highly dependent on imported inputs, would similarly generate less DVA and employment than non-processing exports. Our findings support these expectations. For both 2002 and 2007, the DVA and employment effects of domestic final demand were higher than those of non-processing exports, which were in turn higher than those of processing exports. However, with the progress of economic reforms, we found that the total DVAs of exports and domestic final demand have converged from 2002 to 2007.
P33|Effect of oil prices on trade balance: New insights into the cointegration relationship from Pakistan|Global oil price shock waves and continuous trade imbalance have raised serious alarms among the policy makers around the world, because of its aggressive impacts for the net oil‐importing economies. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of rising oil prices on the trade balance of Pakistan by using ARDL approach. Further, this study explores the causality direction between trade balance and oil price shocks in the context of Pakistan over a period of 1975–2010. The result shows that there is a significant negative relationship among oil prices, exchange rate and trade balance in Pakistan, i.e., if there is 1% increase in oil prices and exchange rate, the trade balance decreases by 0.382% and 0.342% respectively. This infers that oil prices and exchange rate induces trade imbalance in Pakistan. In addition, there is a positive relationship between output gap and trade balance which infers inefficient resource allocation and utilization in production. In the short run, there is a positive relationship among exchange rate, output gap and trade balance in Pakistan which shows that an increase in oil prices increases the net income flow in terms of huge cost payments for imports and increases the trade deficit in an economy. The result of Granger causality indicates that there is a bidirectional causality between oil prices and exchange rate in Pakistan which infers that Pakistan has to invest in alternative energy projects to reduce its dependence on oil imports, while there is a unidirectional causality running from oil prices to trade imbalance. This implies that the high oil prices are more appropriate than output gap because it covered all range cause of trade imbalance. The usage of oil in both forms as a fuel and energy can be substituted by solar energy, hydropower, coal energy, and wind energy and high oil demand can be reduced by the establishment of transport infrastructure. The intense need is to redefine and adopt practical step in energy conservation. Regulations, standards, and targets are important in order to provide direction of efficient level of utilization of oil as a fuel.
