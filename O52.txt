O52|Do the ECB’s monetary policies benefit emerging market economies? A GVAR analysis on the crisis and post-crisis period|This paper studies the spillover effects of the ECB’s monetary policies on non-euro area countries over the period 2004-2016, using a GVAR methodology, applied to a large sample of countries and an ample set of variables. Monetary policies are proxied by short-term interest rates and the Wu and Xia’s (2016) shadow rates in the euro area, the US and the UK. Identification is performed via a Cholesky decomposition in the euro area only. An increase in the euro area shadow interest rate triggers a broad-based and persistent output decline abroad, especially strong in Central Eastern and South-Eastern European economies. The euro area shadow rate increase is also transmitted to the short-term interest rates of a number of countries, although such rises are short-lived and not as widespread as the GDP spillovers. There is evidence that differences in countries’ responses to the euro area monetary shock depend on their characteristics. The spillover effects are transmitted mainly through the trade channel and also, to a lesser extent, the short-term interest rate channel.
O52|Do Unit Labor Costs Matter? A Decomposition Exercise on European Data|From the introduction of the Euro up to the 2008 global financial crisis, macroeconomic imbalances widened among Member States. This divergence took the form of strong differences in the dynamics of unit labour costs. This paper asks why this happened. Is it the result of distortionary public spending, or the consequence of economic integration? To answer this question, this paper builds a theoretical framework that is able to provide a decomposition of unit labour costs growth into various effects of economic integration and policy intervention. Using a novel dataset, it then measures the contribution of each effect to the dynamics of unit labour costs in 12 countries of the Euro area from 1995 to 2014. Results show that trade and financial integration are significant drivers of unit labour costs divergence. Before the global financial crisis, in Greece and Portugal for example, trade and financial integration explain up to 30% of the increase in unit labour costs relative to core countries. On the contrary, distortionary public spending plays a minor role. These results suggest that, in peripheral economies, increasing unit labour costs reflect more the process of real convergence than fiscal profligacy.
O52|Commanding Nature by Obeying Her: A Review Essay on Joel Mokyr’s A Culture of Growth|Why is modern society capable of cumulative innovation? In A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy, Joel Mokyr persuasively argues that sustained technological progress stemmed from a change in cultural beliefs. The change occurred gradually during the seventeenth and eighteenth century and was fostered by an intellectual elite that formed a transnational community and adopted new attitudes toward the creation and diffusion of knowledge, setting the foundation for the ethos of modern science. The book is a significant contribution to the growing literature that links culture and economics. This review discusses Mokyr’s historical analysis in relation to the following questions: What is culture and how should we use it in economics? How can culture explain modern economic growth? Will the culture of growth that caused modern prosperity persist in the future?
O52|The Sources of British Economic Growth since the Industrial Revolution : Not the Same Old Story|This paper updates the classic growth accounting research of the early 1980s taking account of improved data that has subsequently become available. The picture of long-run growth which results from incorporating many revisions is considerably different. The long-run path of productivity growth is now that of a roller-coaster with twin peaks in the third quarters of the 19th and 20th centuries rather than a U-shape. Productivity growth appears to have been very slow to accelerate in the Industrial Revolution, the notion of an Edwardian climacteric is not persuasive and the current productivity slowdown stands out as unprecedented.
O52|The Industry Anatomy of the Transatlantic Productivity Growth Slowdown|"By merging KLEMS data sets and aggregating over the ten largest Western European nations (EU-10), we are able to compare and contrast productivity growth up through 2015 starting from 1950 in the U.S. and from 1972 in the EU-10. Data are provided at the aggregate level, as well as for 16 industry groups within the total economy and 11 manufacturing subindustries. The analysis focuses on outcomes over four time intervals: 1950-72, 1972-95, 1995- 2005, and 2005-15. We interpret the EU-10 performance as catching up to the U.S. in stages, with its rapid growth of 1950-72 representing a delayed adoption of the inventions that propelled U.S. productivity growth in the first half of the 20th century, and the next EU-10 stage for 1972-95 as imitating the U.S. outcome for 1950-72. A striking finding is that for the total economy the ""early-to-late"" productivity growth slowdown from 1972-95 to 2005-15 in the EU-10 (-1.68 percentage points) was almost identical to the U.S. slowdown from 1950-72 to 2005-15 (-1.67 percentage points). There is a very high EU-U.S. correlation in the magnitude of the early-to-late slowdown across industries. This supports our overall theme that the productivity growth slowdown from the early postwar years to the most recent decade was due to a retardation in technical change that affected the same industries by roughly the same magnitudes on both sides of the Atlantic."
O52|Fiscal distress and banking performance: The role of macroprudential regulation|Fiscal fragility can undermine a government's ability to honor its bank deposit insurance pledge and induces a positive correlation between sovereign default risk and financial (bank) default risk. We show that this positive relation is reversed if bank capital requirements in fiscally weak countries are allowed to adjust optimally. The resulting higher requirements buttress the banking system and support higher output and welfare relative to the case where macroprudential policy does not vary with the degree of fiscal stress. Fiscal tenuousness also exacerbates the effects of other risk shocks. Nonetheless, the economy's response can be mitigated if macroprudential policy is adjusted optimally. Our analysis implies that, on the basis of fiscal strength, fiscally weak countries would favor and fiscally strong countries would object to banking union.
O52|New Trends in the Social and Solidarity Economy Regarding Agriculture and Food: A Comparison between France and India|On the question of food and livelihood, international institutions and States call for efforts towards food security under the form of help in subsidies or better access to the market for farmers. Such efforts rely on large scale solutions and make food security depend on tall vertical institutions aiming at bringing change in a very large area at a time. On the other hand, small initiatives are born everywhere and take up on the question of access to healthy sustainable food. Farmers’ self-help groups, shared gardens, community supported agriculture, cooperative supermarket and other organisations make up this landscape and are being born everywhere. Such initiatives are often missed by observers as case studies of single organisations can not bring into light the global effort of such initiatives. Nevertheless, they can be put together and showed as being part of the same global movement. If their juridic forms, organisations, and goals are somewhat different, some trends can be established in the justification they offer to their action (Boltanski, Thévenot, 1991). In order to discover these justifications and establish trends, a study of the discourse and practices of such initiatives is offered in the following article. Namely, our study takes 20 initiatives dealing with agriculture and food. In order to find out trends, this article elaborates on the fieldwork of about 500 hours spent within said initiatives, and 50 interviews with project planners, coordinators, and motnitors. In order to show global trends, these initiatives have been chosen in two vastly different social and economic contexts: one takes place in Nancy, a medium French town, the other takes place in Ahmedabad, a very large Indian city. The results of the study show three major common trends between France and India, and between initiatives pertaining with small farmers, shared gardens, cooperatives and other social and solidarity initiatives. Firstly, there is a general call for localized, short food circuits, namely producers and consumers ask for a direct connection to each other, and even to grow the food they eat and eat the food they grow. Secondly, participants in said initiatives do not claim to be part of a recent innovative wave, but rather fall back on traditional ways to grow, sell, and cook food. Thirdly, despite the small size of such initiatives – with 200 participants at most and sometimes as small as 2 members – the ambition of these organisations is to change things on a global scale, make people from every path of life ask themselves questions and change their behaviour, and even, struggle against global climate change through small localized actions.
O52|Of Trees and Monkeys. The evolution of technological specialization of European regions|The question about how regions develop and evolve along their productive and technological path is central in many scientific fields from international economics, to economic geography, from industrial economics to regional science. Within an evolutionary perspective, we believe that a region is most likely to develop new industries or new technologies, which are closer to its pre-existing specialization. Our research builds on an empirical stream of literature, started by Hausmann and Klinger (2007) and Hidalgo et al. (2007), aimed at tracing the evolution of industrial specialisation at the country level following the evolution of export portfolios. We refocus this line of analysis on the regional European technology/knowledge space along the research avenue started by Kogler et al. (2017). We aim at investigating the pattern and the evolution of regional specialisation in the EU in terms of the interaction of (i) endogenous processes of knowledge recombination and localised technological change, (ii) exogenous technological paradigm shifts and (iii) trans-regional spatial and technological spillovers and networking dynamics. More specifically, our paper maps the technological trajectories of 198 EU regions over the period 1986-2010 by using data on 121 patent sectors in the NUTS2 regions of the 11 most innovative EU countries, plus Switzerland and Norway. We map the knowledge space following two approaches: a micro level one, based on co-classification information contained in patent documents (Engelsman and Van Raan, 1992; Kogler et al., 2017), and a macro level, based on conditional co-specialisations of regions in the same patent classes (Hidalgo et al., 2007). These two representations of the knowledge space serve as a basis for understanding the evolution of regional technological specialization, measured in terms of the sector-region relative technological advantage (RTA), and for modelling its dynamics as a function of spatial, technological and socio-cognitive proximity. Preliminary results show that regional technological paths display a significant level of path dependence in, which the technological specialization is significantly shaped by both localised technological change and recombinant innovation. We also find evidence of local spillover spillovers induced by both geographic and technological proximity.
O52|Problemas Burocráticos Y Económicos De La I+D Universitaria En España Y Europa, 2003-2018|"Analizamos los principales problemas burocráticos y económicos de la investigación científica en las universidades españolas, comparando la situación de menor apoyo a las áreas de Economía y Otras Ciencias Sociales en comparación con las áreas experimentales. También comparamos las universidades españolas con las de otros países de la OCDE, constando un mayor nivel de insatisfacción laboral y dificultades en el caso de España. Destacamos manifestaciones promovidas, en favor de la I+D, por destacadas Asociaciones Científicas, y otras instituciones, en el período 2003-2018, con un apoyo generalizado al incremento de la financiación, a la simplificación burocrática y a un mayor protagonismo de la Ciencia frente al exceso de poder de las Administraciones Públicas (en España, sus Comunidades Autónomas y Unión Europea). También mencionamos otros problemas que requieren una atención urgente: 1) Aumentar el apoyo, no sólo a las Ciencias Experimentales sino también a las Ciencias Sociales y a otras áreas, especialmente cuando contribuyen al desarrollo e y calidad de vida. 2) Apoyar a toda la investigación de calidad suficiente e interés social, y evitar que en nombre de la ""excelencia"" se apliquen criterios burocráticos inadecuados que perjudican a muchos equipos de calidad. 3) Promover la comunicación entre las Asociaciones Científicas y los representantes políticos, en busca de apoyo parlamentario frente a los obstáculos burocráticos. 4) Promover la transferencia y comunicación social de la investigación, especialmente en temas de interés general para el desarrollo, a través de libros electrónicos, videos, televisión prensa y otros medios. 5) Permitir que los Sindicatos de profesores puedan intervenir en apoyo de los investigadores cuando los obstáculos burocráticos generan un deterior del ambiente laboral en las universidades y una indefensión de las personas afectadas. We analyze the main bureaucratic and economic problems of scientific research in Spanish universities, comparing the situation of less support to the areas of Economics and Other Social Sciences compared to the Experimental Sciences areas. We also compared Spanish universities with those of other OECD countries, showing a higher level of job dissatisfaction and difficulties in the case of Spain. We emphasize promoted manifestations, in favor of R & D, by outstanding Scientific Associations, and other institutions, in the period 2003-2018, with a generalized support to the increase of the financing, the diminution of bureaucratic problems, and to a greater protagonism of the Science in front of to the excess of power of the Public Administrations (in Spain, its Autonomous Communities and European Union). We also mention other problems that require urgent attention: 1) Increase support, not only to Experimental Sciences but also to Social Sciences and other areas, especially when they contribute to the development and quality of life. 2) Support all research of sufficient quality and social interest, and avoid that in the name of ""excellence"" inadequate bureaucratic criteria are applied that harm many quality teams. 3) Promote communication between the Scientific Associations and political representatives, in search of parliamentary support in the face of bureaucratic obstacles. 4) Promote the transfer and social communication of research, especially in topics of general interest for development, through electronic books, videos, television press and other media. 5) Allow the Teachers' Unions to intervene in support of the researchers when the bureaucratic obstacles generate a deterioration of the work environment in the universities and a defenselessness of the affected people.

O52|A macroeconomic vulnerability model for the euro area|Macroeconomic imbalances increase the vulnerability of an economy to adverse shocks, which in turn can lead to crises with severe economic and social costs. We propose an early warning model that predicts such crises. We identify a set of macroeconomic indicators capturing domestic and external imbalances that jointly predict severe recessions (i.e. growth crises) in a multivariate discrete choice framework. The approach allows us to quantify an economy's macroeconomic vulnerabilities at any point in time. In particular, the model would have pointed early on to emerging vulnerabilities in all the euro area countries that registered severe recessions in the years after 2007. We also show that the model can be applied beyond the euro area crisis in that its main results remain robust to changes in assumptions and sample composition. JEL Classification: E37, E44, F47, O52
O52|The European Framework for Regulating Telecommunications: A 25-year Appraisal|Abstract The European telecommunications sector has been radically transformed in the past 25 years: from a group of state monopolies to a set of increasingly competitive markets. In this paper we summarize how this process has unfolded—for both fixed and mobile telecommunications—by focusing on the evolution of the regulatory framework and by drawing some parallels with the evolution of the sector in the US. Given the major strategic importance of the sector, we highlight some of the challenges that lie ahead.
O52|What Fosters Firm-Level Labour Productivity In Eastern European And Central Asian Countries?|This study examines labour productivity performance and its determinants in Eastern European and Central Asian (EECA) firms using micro-level data. We find significant differences in labour productivity among members of the European Union in Eastern Europe and other Eastern European and Central Asian countries. We also confirm the important impact of foreign ownership, exporter status, and highly skilled workers on productivity levels. However, we reveal a non-linear relationship between firm age and their labour productivity. Additionally, significant differences in labour productivity determinants between the services and manufacturing are found. The productivity of service firms, unlike manufacturing firms, is much more sensitive to changes in productivity factors.
O52|On a low-competitiveness country joining the Eurozone: Are there lessons from Greece?|Seven remaining states are presently on the Eurozone’s enlargement agenda: Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Sweden. Except Sweden, all these countries tend to have low competitiveness not only relative to Germany but also to most of the Eurozone countries (especially, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands). For countries adopting the euro, issues of political economy may have a decisive effect on the eventual outcome and largely determine their economic prospects within the Eurozone. The Greek experience shows that the intensity of partisan strife is certainly an important element to be taken into account in a far from easy assessment of how entry will likely affect the country's economic progress. The crucial issue that needs to be considered is whether entry will improve or worsen the prospects for a substantial gain in competitiveness. It is the assessment of how entry will affect the forces favoring reforms relative to those opposing them that should ultimately determine the decision to opt for early or delayed entry.
O52|Subjective health status and immigration: Evidence across Europe|Background: Subjective health status and migration are critical issues in healthcare policy and strategic decision making. There are many health challenges to resolve and at the same time, migration has reached to historic highs, leading to different views among immigrants and natives, policy makers and habitants. Objective: Our research focuses on the subjective health status reported by European habitants, on its differentiation with respect to participants origin, and on whether various demographic, macroeconomic and other factors, such as the foreigners’ presence in a country, affect it. Setting and participants: Using survey data of 227,200 respondents from 22 countries and over the period 2002-2016, and employing logit estimation techniques, we analysed the effect of demographic, macroeconomic and other factors in shaping respondents’ subjective health status. Results: Our results demonstrate the important role of all demographic factors in shaping respondents’ subjective health status. Immigrants report a higher subjective health status, while macroeconomic conditions and foreign presence in a country do play an important role. A country healthcare provision state and health expenditures can moderate the negative effect of foreigners’ presence and thus the reported health status of natives. Conclusions: The factors influencing subjective health status are complex and interdependent. However, government policies should increase social cohesion, since, the latter is not only related to health care outcomes but also can be a tool for disseminating social inequalities.
O52|Euro Area Accession and its Effect on Manufacturing|A single currency could bring both benefits and challenges, hence, this paper examines one of the various dimensions of euro adoption. Moreover, although previous studies have illuminated the euro effect on inflation and trade, the research on manufacturing remains limited. The paper aims to make an assessment of whether euro area accession has an impact on industrial output in the context of the manufacturing sector, as this sector is considered to have a crucial role for sustainable economic growth. The research fits a panel regression model for seven-euro area member states from Central and Eastern Europe and covers a 16-year period from 2003 to 2018. The findings suggest that the participation in the monetary union might increase manufacturing turnover for its members.
O52|Has Regulatory Capital Made Banks Safer? Skin in the Game vs Moral Hazard|The paper evaluates the impact of macroprudential capital regulation on bank capital, risk taking behaviour, and solvency. The identication relies on an exogenous policy change in bank-level capital requirements across systemically important banks in Europe. A one percentage point hike in capital requirements leads to anaverage CET1 capital level increase of 13 percent improving their loss absorption capacity.
O52|Re-examining the debt-growth nexus: A grouped fixed-effect approach|This paper uses panel data for 116 countries over the period 1995-2016 to investigate the heterogeneity of the debt-growth nexus across countries and the factors underlying it. In the first step, the grouped fixed effects (GFE) estimator proposed by Bonhomme and Manresa (2015) is used to classify countries into groups, with group membership being endogenously determined. In the second step, a multinomial logit model is used to explore the drivers of the heterogeneity detected, among them the quality of institutions, the composition of debt-funded public expenditure, the relative public and private indebtedness, and the maturity of debt. Finally, the underlying factors explaining the time-varying impact of public debt on growth in the country groups identified is also investigated.
O52|Talent Misallocation in Europe|We use microeconomic data on wages and individual characteristics across twenty European economies for the period 2004 to 2015, to detect patterns of misallocation arising in these economies based on individuals’ gender, immigrant status, or private versus public sector affiliation. We develop a theoretical model where being relatively isolated, e.g., due to gender, immigrant status, or private sector affiliation, leads to lower wages and talent misallocation. Our empirical results suggest that being a female or immigrant, and working in the private sector, exert a negative impact on one’s wages beyond that explained by their economic characteristics, suggestive of persistent talent misallocation in Europe during the period under study. Notably, countries such as Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Spain are systematically found at the top of the overall talent misallocation index we construct year-after-year for the period under study. Our work provides new cross-country micro-econometric evidence about the importance of various forms of talent misallocation for aggregate economic outcomes.
O52|The Structural Dynamics of Income Distribution:Technology, Wages and Profits|In the last four decades, an increasingly skewed income distribution has favored capital at the expense of labour and has been coupled with ever growing inequalities. Merging a Neo-Schumpeterian approach to innovation with a Post-Keynesian theoretical framework, this work contributes to the analysis of the structural determinants of functional income distribution. Building on Pianta and Tancioni (2008), we propose a simultaneous model on wage and profit dynamics identifying technological change, offshoring strategies and role of trade unions as key factors which shape the power relations between capital and labour. On the empirical ground, we perform an industry-level analysis extending and improving the Sectoral Innovation Database (SID), which accounts for 38 manufacturing and service sectors for six major European countries (France, Germany, Italy,Netherlands, Spain and United Kindgom) from 1994 to 2014. We find that, despite the structural asymmetries between industries? patterns of evolution, labour productivity growth and product innovation have a positive impact on both distributive components, while a rather negative effect of process innovation on wages is detected. Offshoring processes generally emerge as profit-enhancing while represent a reliable firms? weapon to reduce labour costs, although a remarkable heterogeneity arises when the technological nature of offshoring strategies is accounted for; finally, union density tends to be positively associated with wage dynamics, suggesting the relevance of labour market institutions in conditioning the patterns of income distribution.
O52|Moving Into the Slow Lane|Growth in much of CESEE will remain healthy by post-crisis standards, but has passed its peak. We expect most economies to slow from here, reflecting weaker external demand and domestic capacity constraints. Global trade tensions, structural weakness in the eurozone and Brexit all pose downside risks to our forecasts.
O52|Georgia’s Economic Performance: Bright Spots and Remaining Challenges|Georgia has long been one of the most trade-open economies in the world. It joined WTO in 2000 and currently has a free trade agreement with the EU and EFTA, as well as with Turkey, the CIS and China. Georgia has been also one of the most business-friendly countries. The basic objectives of Georgia’s trade policy are integration, liberalisation, diversification and transparency. The Association Agreement (AA) with the EU signed in June 2014 and in force since July 2016 lays the foundations for far-reaching political and economic cooperation with the EU and serves as a backbone for reforms. The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) agreement that represents a part of AA envisages a gradual implementation of reforms in areas such as trade, environment, agriculture, tourism, energy, transport and education with the aim to bring Georgia in line with EU standards. The DCFTA sets a path for further reforms in trade-related policies, such as hygiene standards for agriculture products, the approximation of regulations for industrial products, enforcement of intellectual property rights at the border, rules on public procurement and approximation to EU rules in the services area. However, there is no prospect for EU membership in the Agreement. Georgia has been suffering from chronic goods trade and current account deficits; the export base has been very narrow. Foreign trade has been regionally focused on its neighbouring partners. Russia is the largest export market, ahead of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Turkey and China. Among the EU countries, the biggest markets for Georgian exports are Bulgaria and Romania. Exports are highly concentrated and there has not been much export diversification yet. The key exports to the EU include copper ores (39% of the total), nuts, nitrogen fertilisers and mineral oils. The DCFTA apparently has not had much positive effect on Georgian exports to the EU so far, despite some spectacular increases by individual products. Rather than in goods exports, Georgia has a competitive advantage in services, especially in tourism and transit transport. Georgia has been also relatively successful in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) cumulated inward FDI stocks amounted to about EUR 4,000 per capita as of mid-2018. A development strategy combining existing competitive advantages of tourism with domestic agriculture (using the excellent domestic wine and delicious local food), supported by structural reforms in the agricultural sector and targeted FDI policies, could be a viable option to foster inclusive economic growth and mitigate external vulnerabilities.
O52|Osteuropa trotzt dem globalen Gegenwind|This publication is available in German language only. For a brief English summary see further below. Die Konjunktur in den mittel-, ost- und südosteuropäischen Ländern (MOSOEL) kühlt sich zwar ab, aber viel weniger als noch im Frühjahr erwartet Die Prognosen für heuer wurden für die Mehrheit der Länder nach oben revidiert. Vor allem in der EU-MOE-Region hat sich das Wachstum vom Abschwung im Euro-Raum recht deutlich abgekoppelt. In einigen Ländern mehren sich sogar die Anzeichen einer Überhitzung, die allerdings nur in Rumänien Anlass zur Sorge gibt. Die Westbalkanländer profitieren von steigenden FDI-Zuflüssen, mehrere GUS-Länder von der expansiven Fiskalpolitik. In Russland dagegen hat der restriktive fiskalpolitische Kurs die Wirtschaft an den Rand einer Rezession gebracht. Die Wirtschaftskrise in der Türkei erwies sich zwar tiefer als früher erwartet, dürfte aber spätestens 2020 überwunden sein. Insbesondere die Visegrád-Staaten gehören zu Österreichs wichtigsten Wirtschaftspartnern. Ihnen waren im Jahr 2018 mehr als 10% des österreichischen Güterhandels, 20% der Einkommen aus Direktinvestitionen sowie 40% der Auslandsforderungen österreichischer Banken zuzurechnen. Gleichzeitig sind sie auch EU-Mitglieder mit brisanten politischen und wirtschaftlichen Herausforderungen, von welchen auch Österreich nicht unberührt bleiben wird. English Summary Eastern Europe standing firm in face of global headwinds The economy in the Central, East and Southeast European countries (CESEE) is cooling down, but much less than expected in the spring the forecasts for this year have been revised upwards for the majority of countries. Particularly in the EU-CEE region, growth has decoupled quite clearly from the downturn in the euro area. In several countries there are even signs of overheating, although only in Romania this is a cause for concern. The Western Balkans are benefiting from rising FDI inflows, while several CIS countries from expansionary fiscal policy. In Russia, on the other hand, the restrictive fiscal policy has brought the economy to the brink of recession. Although the economic crisis in Turkey proved to be deeper than previously expected, it should be overcome by 2020 at the latest. The Visegrád countries, in particular, prove very important for the Austrian economy. In 2018, they accounted for more than 10% of Austrian goods trade, 20% of income generated by Austrian investment abroad, as well as 40% of foreign claims of Austrian banks. At the same time, they are among the EU Member States facing increasing political and economic challenges, by which Austria will not be unaffected.
O52|Research for REGI Committee – Externalities of Cohesion Policy|The study investigates the effects of Cohesion Policy (CP) which occur in a country other than the one in which CP resources were actually spent. The study estimates that macroeconomic spillovers significantly contribute to the impact of CP. Spillovers directed to EU countries represent around 9% of the total annual CP expenditure. Other spillovers to Non-EU countries are around 8% of the CP expenditure. Macro and micro spillovers together arrive at 21% of the annual CP expenditure, 67% of which is distributed among EU countries. Around 20% of the CP expenditure can trigger sectoral spillover effects in the environment, transport and higher education sectors. The analysis demonstrates that externalities reinforce EU growth and competitiveness without CP deserting its convergence objective.

O52|Wer gewinnt? Wer verliert? Die Entwicklung auf dem deutschen Arbeitsmarkt seit den frühen Jahren der Bundesrepublik bis heute|Seit der Gründung der Bundesrepublik Deutschland haben verschiedene Megatrends die Entwicklungen auf dem deutschen Arbeitsmarkt maßgeblich beeinflusst. Insbesondere die voranschreitende Globalisierung hat zur weiteren Öffnung der deutschen Volkwirtschaft geführt und den sektoralen Strukturwandel, das heißt den Wandel von der Industrie- zur Dienstleistungsgesellschaft beschleunigt. Gleichzeitig hat das durchschnittliche Wirtschaftswachstum seit den 1950er-Jahren bedeutend nachgelassen. Auf dem Arbeitsmarkt wurden zudem schon Jahrzehnte vor der Einführung der Hartz-Reformen Flexibilisierungsmaßnahmen durchgesetzt, um einem Anstieg der Arbeitslosigkeit entgegenzuwirken. Insgesamt unterlag der Arbeitsmarkt in den vergangenen 60 Jahren einem starken Wandel. Wir identifizieren Gewinner und Verlierer dieser Entwicklung in einer multidimensionalen Betrachtung der Entwicklung in den Bereichen Bildung, Arbeitsmarkbeteiligung, Qualifikationsniveau der Beschäftigung und Einkommensentwicklung. Die Analyse wird mit harmonisierten Mikrodaten (Mikrozensus 1962-2013) auf Individualebene und auf dem Haushaltslevel durchgeführt.
O52|Investment, Autonomous Demand and Long Run Capacity Utilization: An Empirical Test for the Euro Area|This paper reviews and empirically tests the validity and policy conclusions of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model (SSM) and the modified Neo-Kaleckian model after the inclusion of autonomous components of aggregate demand. First, we theoretically assess whether the SSM may constitute a complex variant of the Neo-Kaleckian model. In this sense, it is shown that results compatible with the SSM can be obtained by implementing a set of mechanisms in a modified Neo-Kaleckian model. Second, the paper empirically tests the main implications of the models in the Euro Area, based on Eurostat data. In particular, the discussion outlines the short and long-run relation between autonomous demand and output, by testing cointegration and causality with a VECM model. Moreover, the role accounted by both theories to the rate of capacity utilization is empirically assessed, through a time-series estimation of the Sraffian and Neo-Kaleckian investment functions. While confirming the theoretical relation between autonomous demand and output in the long run, the results show that capacity utilization still plays a key role in the short-run adjustment mechanism. Therefore, admitting that Keynesian results may hold even after the traverse, our work suggests to be Kaleckian in the short run and Sraffian in the long run.
O52|The European economic crisis from 2007 onwards in the context of a global crisis of over-production of capital - a Marxian monetary theory of value interpretation|This paper attempts to clarify how the European economic crisis from 2007 onwards can be understood from the perspective of a Marxian monetary theory of value that emphasizes in-trinsic, structural flaws regarding capitalist reproduction. Chapter two provides an empirical description of the European economic crisis, which to some extent already reflects the struc-tural theoretical framework presented in chapter three. Regarding the theoretical framework Michael Heinrich's interpretation of 'the' Marxian monetary theory of value will be presented. Heinrich identifies connections between production and realization, between profit and inter-est rate as well as between industrial and fictitious capital, which represent contradictory tendencies for which capitalism does not have simple balancing processes. In the context of a discussion of 'structural logical aspects' of Marx's Critique of the Political Economy, explana-tory deficits of Heinrich's approach are analyzed. In the following, it is argued that Fred Mose-ley's view of these 'structural logical aspects' allows empirical 'applications' of Marxian mon-etary theories of value. It is concluded that a Marxian monetary theory of value, with the characteristics of expansive capital accumulation and its limitations, facilitates a structural analysis of the European economic crisis from 2007 onwards. In this line of argument, expan-sive production patterns are expressed, among other things, in global restructuring processes, while consumption limitations are mitigated by expansive financial markets and shifts in ex-port destinations.
O52|Handelspolitische Schutzinstrumente zum Umgang mit Wettbewerbsverzerrungen durch China: Status Quo und Perspektiven|Reichen die handelspolitischen Schutzinstrumente der EU aus, um EU-Produzenten gegen die vielfältigen Wettbewerbsverzerrungen durch China mit seiner immer innovativer werdenden staatskapitalistischen Volkswirtschaft schützen zu können. Bei der Analyse dieser Fragestellung ist zu beachten, dass die EU vor kurzem ihr Antidumping- und Antisubventionsrecht in zwei Schritten reformiert hat, nicht zuletzt, um die Herausforderung durch China besser zu meistern. Damit soll zum einen verhindert werden, dass Schutzzölle gegenüber gedumpten Importen aus China sinken, falls China als Marktwirtschaft anerkannt werden muss. Zum anderen ging es darum, etwas höhere Schutzzölle als üblich erheben zu können, da die EU in der Regel deutlich geringere Zölle ansetzt als die USA und als die WTO erlaubt. Die WTO-Vorgaben sind so gestaltet, dass ein Schutzinstrumente-Verfahren sehr aufwendig ist. Damit ist nicht immer gewährleistet, dass die von den Wettbewerbsverzerrungen betroffenen EU-Produzenten ein Verfahren anstrengen. Dies gilt vor allem für KMU und für den Fall, dass es zu einem Koordinationsversagen kommt. Darüber hinaus weisen die WTO-Regeln erhebliche Lücken auf. So kommen China und viele andere WTO-Mitglieder ihrer Pflicht nur unzureichend nach, die eigenen Subventionen vollständig und zeitnah zu melden. Das erschwert aus Sicht der EU die Nutzung von Antisubventionsverfahren. Ferner wirken Schutzinstrumente nur auf dem EU-Markt und nicht gegen Wettbewerbsverzerrungen auf Drittmärkten und im Herkunftsland der Importe selbst. Außerdem gibt es im WTO-Rahmen keine Regeln, um sich vor Wettbewerbsverzerrungen durch Dumping im Dienstleistungshandel zu schützen. Der Königsweg, um diese Lücken zu schließen, führt über eine Reform der multilateralen WTO-Regeln, die sich jedoch bislang aufgrund einer weitgehenden Blockadehaltung Chinas als sehr schwierig erweist. Daher stellt sich die Frage, was die EU innerhalb des WTO-Rahmens aus eigener Macht tun kann, um sich gegen Wettbewerbsverzerrungen durch den chinesischen Staatskapitalismus zu schützen. (...)
O52|European office markets, user costs and speculative bubbles|"Over the last years, prices for European office space have reached new peaks. This naturally provokes discussion about a possible overheating in the market. One approach to assess price development of real estate markets is the so-called ""user cost approach"". Typically, this approach is applied to housing markets, but it can also be applied to commercial markets. The model follows the idea of no-arbitrage. If one kind of tenure is economically more attractive than another, households or corporates will shift demand, so that both tenures - buying and renting - should equalise over time. Thus, major differences between buying and renting indicate a possible over- or undervaluation of properties. In this contribution, user costs for offices have been calculated for 18 European capitals. The results indicate that in most European office markets, further price appreciations are likely. In Paris, Helsinki, Prague, Berlin, Stockholm, Amsterdam, Oslo and Luxembourg in particular, huge gaps between prime rents and user costs indicate further price increases, whereas in Madrid, Lisbon, Rome, London and Budapest further price decreases seem plausible. However, these likely price decreases do not follow the typical pattern of a correction of a speculative bubble, but are more or less the result of falling prime rents that have not been fully captured in prices, yet. The user cost approach has some predictive power, but can only provide an initial pointer towards under- or overvaluations. For instance, structural breaks such as Brexit can change long-term expectations, which cannot be captured properly in a model. However, the approach appears valuable in providing a first assessment. In future, the German Economic Institute will do further research on this topic in order to strengthen its understanding of commercial property markets."
O52|Revisiting Intangible Capital and Labour Productivity Growth, 2000-2015: Accounting for the Crisis and Economic Recovery in the EU|This paper aims to revisit the relationship between intangible capital and labour productivity growth using the largest, up-to-date macro database (2000-2015) available to corroborate the econometric findings of earlier work and to generate novel econometric evidence by accounting for times of crisis (2008-2013) and economic recovery (2014-2015). To achieve these aims, this paper employs a cross-country growth accounting econometric estimation approach using the largest, up-to-date database available encompassing 16 EU countries over the time-period 2000- 2015. The paper accounts for times of crisis (2008-2013) and of economic recovery (2014-2015). It separately estimates the contribution of three distinct dimensions of intangible capital: i) computerized information, ii) innovative property and iii) economic competencies. First, when accounting for intangibles, the paper finds that these have become the dominant source of labour productivity growth in the EU, explaining 56 percent of growth. Second, when accounting for times of crisis (2008-2013), in contrast to tangible capital, the paper detects a solid positive relationship between intangibles and labour productivity growth. Third, when accounting for the economic recovery (2014-2015), the paper finds a highly significant and remarkably strong relationship between intangible capital and labour productivity growth. This paper corroborates the importance of intangibles for labour productivity growth and thereby underlines the necessity to incorporate intangibles into today's national accounting frameworks in order to correctly depict the levels of capital investment being made in European economies. These levels are significantly higher than is currently reflected in official statistics.
O52|The Evolution of Tradable and Non Tradable Employment: Evidence from France|The objective of this paper is to investigate the evolution of employment in the tradable and non-tradable sectors in France over 1999-2015. We find that tradable employment makes up the minority of French employment and has decreased over this period, dropping from 27.5% to 23.6% of total employment. There has been significant restructuring within the sector: tradable services jobs now make up the majority of tradable jobs and have grown sharply, while employment has declined in the rest of the tradable sector (manufacturing, agricultural and mining industries). We also identify a large wage and labor productivity gap between tradable and non-tradable sectors. Finally, we examine the distribution of tradable jobs across French local labor markets, and how their development affects non-tradable employment locally. Using the empirical approach developed by Moretti (2010), we find that for every 100 tradable jobs created in a French employment area between 2008 and 2016, 80 additional non-tradable jobs were created within the same area.

O52|Real Estate Prices and Corporate Investment: Theory and Evidence of Heterogeneous Effects across Firms|In this paper, we investigate the effect of real estate prices on productive investment. We build a theoretical framework of firms' investment with credit rationing and real estate collateral. We show that real estate prices affect firms' borrowing capacities through two channels. An increase in real estate prices raises the value of the firms' pledgeable assets and mitigates the agency problem characterizing the creditor–entrepreneur relationship. It simultaneously cuts the expected profit due to the increase in the cost of inputs. We test our theoretical predictions using a large French database. We do find heterogeneous effects of real estate prices on productive investment depending on the position of the firms in the sectoral distributions of real estate holdings.
O52|Economic Development in Spain, 1815-2017|In assessments of modern Spain’s economic progress and living standards inadequate natural resources, inefficient institutions, lack of education and entrepreneurship, and foreign dependency are frequently blamed for the poor performance up to mid-twentieth century, but no persuasive arguments are provided to explain why such adverse circumstances reversed, giving way to the fast transformation of the last half a century. It makes sense, hence, to inquire firstly how much economic progress has Spain achieved and what impact had on living standards and income distribution since the end of the Peninsular War to the present and, only then, to provide an interpretation. Recent research supports the view that income per person has improved remarkably, driven by increases in labour productivity, which derived, in turn, from a more intense and efficient use of physical and human capital per worker. Exposure to international competition represented a decisive element behind growth performance. In European perspective, Spain underperformed up to 1950. Thereafter, Spain’s economy caught up with advanced countries until 2007. Although the distribution of the fruits of growth did not follow a linear trend, but a Kuznetsian inverted U pattern, higher levels of income per capita are matched by lower inequality suggesting that Spaniards’ material well-being improved substantially during the modern era.
O52|Capital Flow Bonanzas as a Fundamental Ingredient in Spain’s Financial Crises, 1850-2015|Among the characteristics of Spanish financial crises over the last 165 years, we highlight their relatively high frequency and, since 1973, their severity (including 2008, the most severe crisis yet). By analysing monetary policy regimes, financial structure, and the main crisis determinants (factors associated with crises), as well as the resolution to the crises, we can conclude that capital flow bonanzas are a key factor in most financial crises; when a capital flow bonanza occurred, it increased both the probability of a subsequent crisis and its severity.
O52|Russia’s economy and regional spillovers|This paper looks at how the Russian economy has developed under the leadership of Putin and how it spills over to its neighbours in the CIS region. It stresses the importance of international oil prices as a determinant of policies and outcomes in Russia and highlights how this has impacted macroeconomic performance during Putin’s different terms in office. Although Russia is not an economic superpower globally, the size and importance of Russia for the CIS region is significant and thus oil price changes also drive the economic development of non-fuel exporting CIS countries to a significant degree.
O52|Russia’s macroeconomy—a closer look at growth, investment, and uncertainty|This paper looks at economic growth and its fundamental determinants in Russia over the last decades. It starts by showing that, contrary to the views of some political commentators, growth is highly important for the popularity of president Putin. Furthermore, regular models of growth are relevant to Russia and other transition countries over the last two decades and one important determinant of growth is investments in physical capital. This in turn is correlated with FDI, which is also key for Russia’s strategy to modernize and diversify its economy away from oil, gas and minerals extraction. However, FDI is negatively impacted by the policy uncertainty that Russia generates both by domestic and foreign policy. Reforming institutions on paper will not be enough to reverse the trend of declining FDI but has to be accompanied by a regime that refrains from policy actions at home and abroad that add to the significant macroeconomic volatility that is already created by large swings in international oil prices.
O52|The Swedish Fiscal Framework – The Most Successful One in the EU?|This paper discusses the history and future of the Swedish fiscal framework. First, we claim that the fiscal framework has contributed to a sharp decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio, from one of the highest to one of the lowest in the European Union. Next, we focus on the future. Despite its success, we argue that the framework is unsustainable. Running large surpluses over the long run is not a steady-state solution. We recommend two changes to the framework. First, that the public pension system is excluded, and second that the Swedish fiscal authorities shift attention from maintaining a budget surplus of 1/3 percent of GDP over the business cycle to sustaining a stable debt-to-GDP ratio of 25 percent of GDP +/- 5 percentage points. A debt anchor at this level will provide sufficient insurance in case of a future major economic crisis judging from recent cross-country evidence. In addition, a debt anchor around 25 percent of GDP would contribute to political stability in time of crises. In a world, where populism and austerity fatigue are rampant, we stress the importance of a fiscal framework allowing successful consumption and tax smoothing in case of major negative shocks to the fiscal space. We conclude with a set of recommendations for the fiscal governance of the EU.
O52|Measurement Of Digital Activity In Medium, High-Tech And Low-Tech Manufacturing Industries|The spread of digital technologies changes production processes and business models, which has important effects for diversification of the economy. The fourth industrial revolution and the Industrial Internet of Things open up new opportunities for the introduction of technologies, having a significant impact on the production cycle, starting with highly automated production lines and ending with the large-scale implementation of technological solutions designed to improve productivity, optimize costs, quality and reliability. Defining digital transformations, primarily in the manufacturing industry as a strategic imperative for the entire economy, for the first time, based on opinions and intentions of entrepreneurs (short and medium-term), key aspects of the digitalization process in Russian medium, high-tech and low-tech manufacturing industries are revealed. A set of tendencies in the development of digital technologies by their main types is presented, the level of industry participation in digital transformation is shown, as well as many other important digital transformation processes in enterprises that are not measured by quantitative statistics. For all the studied industries, factors hindering digital transformation are identified and ranked.
O52|The 2019 PREDICT Key Facts Report. An analysis of ICT R&D in the EU and beyond|The 2019 PREDICT Key Facts Report provides a detailed analysis of the state of ICT R&D activities in the EU. This is the twelfth edition of a series that is published annually. As the previous editions, an online version is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/predict. The report covers the period between 1995 and 2016, providing a long-term analysis of the European Union (EU) ICT sector and its R&D, covering a whole cycle from the initial expansion years, to the double recession that began in early 2008, and the most recent evolution up to 2016. Whenever possible, the report includes nowcasted data for 2017 and 2018. The statistical information provided by the figures allows the comparison between: the ICT sector and the total economy; the ICT manufacturing sector and the ICT services sector; the four ICT manufacturing sectors, two ICT services sectors, and MC and RS sectors; EU countries; the EU and the international context (including the most relevant countries in the world economy). The report is focused especially on the ICT R&D macroeconomic dynamics.
O52|Re-examining the debt-growth nexus: A grouped fixed-effect approach|This paper uses panel data for 116 countries over the period 1995-2016 to investigate the heterogeneity of the debt-growth nexus across countries and the factors underlying it. In the first step, the grouped fixed effects (GFE) estimator proposed by Bonhomme and Manresa (2015) is used to classify countries into groups, with group membership being endogenously determined. In the second step, a multinomial logit model is used to explore the drivers of the heterogeneity detected, among them the quality of institutions, the composition of debt-funded public expenditure, the relative public and private indebtedness, and the maturity of debt. Finally, the underlying factors explaining the time-varying impact of public debt on growth in the country groups identified is also investigated.
O52|The Past and Future of Manufacturing in Central and Eastern Europe: Ready for Industry 4.0?|In this paper we determine the industry 4.0 (I4.0) readiness of eight Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs): Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. We outline the nature of manufacturing in the region, describe three distinct time periods of industrialization since 1990, and explain the nature of I4.0. Using measures reflecting three key dimensions of I4.0-readiness, namely technological, entrepreneurial and governance competencies, we find that the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Hungary and Slovenia are most I4.0-ready, and that Bulgaria, Slovakia, Romania and Poland are the least ready of the CEECs. We make a number of recommendations. All the countries in the region could do more to promote entrepreneurship; to diversify and grow manufacturing export markets through focused trade facilitation and competitive exchange rates; and to cooperate regionally on industrial policy - through for instance establishing a regional CEEC I4.0 Platform.
O52|Has regulatory capital made banks safer? Skin in the game vs moral hazard|The paper evaluates the impact of macroprudential capital regulation on bank capital, risk taking behaviour, and solvency. The identification relies on an exogenous policy change in bank-level capital requirements across systemically important banks in Europe. A one percentage point hike in capital requirements leads to an average CET1 capital level increase of 13 percent improving their loss absorption capacity. The paper does not find evidence of costs due to reduction in assets. The paper documents robust evidence on the existence of substitution effects toward riskier assets. Consistently with arguments on agency costs and gambling for resurrection, the risk taking behavior is predominantly driven by large and less profitable banks. Large wholesale funded banks show less risk taking. In terms of overall impact on solvency, the higher risk taking crowds-out the positive effect of increased capital.

O52|Income Inequality Convergence Across EU Regions|Economic inequality has increased in many EU countries in the last decades. Yet, efforts assessing economic disparities across the EU regions mostly concentrate on convergence in average per capita incomes, offering much less evidence on how regional income is distributed. Using data from Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) over the 1989-2013 period, this study contributes to fill this gap, focusing on whether there has been convergence of income distribution among EU regions, and on to what extent regional initial conditions and the Cohesion Policy affect the convergence process. Crosssection and panel convergence regressions, after a number of robustness checks, indicate that NUTS 2 regions are converging to higher level of income inequality, so becoming equally more unequal. This process is significantly faster when regions share similar structural characteristics. Finally, the implementation of the Cohesion Policy seems to have significantly accelerated the pace of convergence.
O52|Reference Forecasts for CO2 Emissions from Fossil-Fuel Combustion and Cement Production in Portugal|"We provide reference forecasts for CO2 emissions from burning fuel fossil and cement production in Portugal based on an ARFIMA model approach and using annual data from 1950 to 2017. Our ""business as usual"" projections suggest a pattern of decarbonization that will cause the reduction of 3.3 Mt until 2030 and 5.1 Mt between 2030 and 2050. This scenario allows us to assess effort required by the new IPCC goals to ensure carbon neutrality by 2050. For this objective to be achieved it is necessary for emissions to be reduced by 39.6 Mt by 2050. Our results suggest that of these, only 8.4 Mt will result from the inertia of the national emissions system. The remaining reduction on emissions of 31.2 Mt of CO2 will require additional policy efforts. Accordingly, our results suggest that about 79% of the reductions necessary to achieve IPCC goals require deliberate policy efforts. Finally, the presence in the data of long memory with mean reversion suggests that policies must be persistent to ensure that these reductions in emissions are also permanent."
O52|ARFIMA Reference Forecasts for Worldwide CO2 Emissions and the National Dimension of the Policy Efforts to Meet IPCC Targets|We use an ARFIMA approach to develop reference scenario projections for CO2 emissions worldwide and for seven different regions. Our objective is to determine the magnitude of the policy efforts necessary to achieve the IPCC emissions reductions goals. For worldwide emissions, the aggregate policy effort required to achieve the 2050 goals is equivalent to 97.4% of 2010 emissions. This policy effort is frontloaded as about 60% of such efforts would have to occur by 2030. In order to achieve the IPCC target the policy efforts in the cases of the USA, EU(28), Russia, and Japan - which account for 32% of worldwide emissions, are lower and less frontloaded than the IPCC goals themselves. In the case of China, India and the ROW, which account for 68% of worldwide emissions, additional policy efforts are necessary to achieve reductions in emissions of 105.0%, 156.0% and 111.4%, of the 2010 levels, respectively. In the case of India, policy efforts are not only rather severe but also rather dramatically frontloaded, as about 74% of the policy efforts would have to occur by 2030. Our results suggest that the policies toward decarbonization must consider the specific regional characteristics of emissions. Given the differences in the inertia of emissions in the different regions a one-size fits all approach is not the best approach.
O52|Change and Persistence in the Age of Modernization: Saint-Germain-d'Anxure 1730-1895|Using a unique, comprehensive household-level dataset for a single French village from 1730 to 1895, we study the process of modernization during a period of rapid institutional and demographic transformation. We document changes in fertility, mortality, human capital and intergenerational mobility, looking for structural breaks associated with the French Revolution and paying close attention to the sequencing of changes associated with various aspects of modernization in the village. We find that the fall in fertility preceded the rise in education by several decades. Demographic change is plausibly associated with institutional and cultural change rather than with changes in the opportunity cost of children. The rise in education occurred mostly as the result of an increase in the supply of schooling due to the Guizot Law, rather than demand side forces. All these changes occurred in the absence of industrialization in and around the village. We conclude that institutional and cultural changes originating outside the village were likely the dominant forces explaining its modernization.
O52|The Industry Anatomy of the Transatlantic Productivity Growth Slowdown|By merging KLEMS data sets and aggregating over the ten largest Western European nations (EU-10), we are able to compare and contrast productivity growth up through 2015 starting from 1950 in the U.S. and from 1972 in the EU-10. Data are provided at the aggregate level, as well as for 16 industry groups within the total economy and 11 manufacturing sub-industries. The analysis focuses on outcomes over four time intervals: 1950-72, 1972-95, 1995-2005, and 2005-15. We interpret the EU-10 performance as catching up to the U.S. in stages, with its rapid growth of 1950-72 representing a delayed adoption of the inventions that propelled U.S. productivity growth in the first half of the 20th century, and the next EU-10 stage for 1972-95 as imitating the U.S. outcome for 1950-72. We show that both the pace of aggregate productivity growth during 1972-95 for the EU-10 as well as its industrial composition matched very closely the growth record of the U.S. in the previous 1950-72 time interval. A striking finding is that for the total economy the “early-to-late” productivity growth slowdown from 1972-95 to 2005-15 in the EU-10 (-1.68 percentage points) was almost identical to the U.S. slowdown from 1950-72 to 2005-15 (-1.67 percentage points). There is a very high EU-U.S. correlation in the magnitude of the early-to-late slowdown across industries. This supports our overall theme that the productivity growth slowdown from the early postwar years to the most recent decade was due to a retardation in technical change that affected the same industries by roughly the same magnitudes on both sides of the Atlantic.
O52|Commanding Nature by Obeying Her: A Review Essay on Joel Mokyr's A Culture of Growth|Why is modern society capable of cumulative innovation? In A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy, Joel Mokyr persuasively argues that sustained technological progress stemmed from a change in cultural beliefs. The change occurred gradually during the seventeenth and eighteenth century and was fostered by an intellectual elite that formed a transnational community and adopted new attitudes toward the creation and diffusion of knowledge, setting the foundation for the ethos of modern science. The book is a significant contribution to the growing literature that links culture and economics. This review discusses Mokyr’s historical analysis in relation to the following questions: What is culture and how should we use it in economics? How can culture explain modern economic growth? Will the culture of growth that caused modern prosperity persist in the future?
O52|Investment, autonomous demand and long run capacity utilization: An empirical test for the Euro Area|In recent years, the role attached to the autonomous components of aggregate demand has attracted rising attention, as testified by the development of the Sraffian Supermulti plier model (SSM) and the attempts to include autonomous demand in the Neo-Kaleckian model. This paper reviews and empirically tests the validity and the policy conclusions of the two models in the Euro Area. First, we theoretically assess whether the SSM may con stitute a complex variant of the Neo-Kaleckian model. In this sense, it is shown that results compatible with the SSM can be obtained by implementing a set of mechanisms in a modified Neo-Kaleckian model, leading to the convergence towards a desired rate of utilization. Furthermore, the chief diffierence between the models is recognized to be the role attached to the rate of capacity utilization in the long run. Second, the paper empirically tests the main implications of the models in the Euro Area, based on Eurostat data. In particular, the discussion outlines the short and long-run relation between autonomous demand and output, by testing both the cointegration and the direction of causality between the two with a VECM model. Moreover, the role accounted by both theories to the actual rate of capacity utilization and its discrepancies from the normal rate is empirically assessed, through a time-series estimation of the Sraffian and Neo-Kaleckian investment functions. While confirming the theoretical relation between autonomous demand and output in the long run, the results show that the dynamics of the rate of capacity utilization still plays a key role in the short-run adjustment mechanism - despite its stationary behaviour in the long term. Therefore, admitting that Keynesian results may hold even after the traverse, our work suggests to be Kaleckian in the short run and Sraffian in the long run.
O52|Institutional integration and economic growth in Europe|The literature on the growth effects of European integration remains inconclusive. This is due to severe methodological difficulties mostly driven by country heterogeneity. This paper addresses these concerns using the synthetic control method. It constructs counterfactuals for countries that joined the European Union (EU) from 1973 to 2004. We find that growth effects from EU membership are large and positive, with Greece as the exception. Despite substantial variation across countries and over time, we estimate that without European integration, per capita incomes would have been, on average, approximately 10% lower in the first ten years after joining the EU.
O52|Gender Biases in Bank Lending: Lessons from Microcredit in France|Abstract The evidence on gender discrimination in lending remains controversial. To capture gender biases in banks’ loan allocations, we observe the impact on the applicants of a microfinance institution (MFI) and exploit the natural experiment of a regulatory change imposing a strict EUR 10,000 loan ceiling on microcredit. Descriptive statistics indicate that the presence of the ceiling is associated both with bank-MFI co-financing and with harsher treatment of female borrowers. To investigate causal links, we develop an econometric approach that addresses the concerns of selection biases, multicollinearity, and endogeneity. Our empirical findings suggest that the change in the MFI’s gender-related attitude was triggered by banks through co-financing. Hence, we speculate that co-financing pushes ceiling-constrained MFIs to import whatever biases in loan granting that the banks are prone to. Overall, this paper stresses that apparently benign regulations such as loan ceilings can significantly harm the women’s empowerment efforts made by MFIs.
O52|From Soviets to oligarchs: inequality and property in Russia 1905-2016|Abstract This paper combines national accounts, survey, wealth and fiscal data (including recently released tax data on high-income taxpayers) in order to provide consistent series on the accumulation and distribution of income and wealth in Russia from the Soviet period until the present day. We find that official survey-based measures vastly under-estimate the rise of inequality since 1990. According to our benchmark estimates, top income shares are now similar to (or higher than) the levels observed in the United States. We also find that inequality has increased substantially more in Russia than in China and other ex-communist countries in Eastern Europe. We relate this finding to the specific transition strategy followed in Russia. According to our benchmark estimates, the wealth held offshore by rich Russians is about three times larger than official net foreign reserves, and is comparable in magnitude to total household financial assets held in Russia.

O52|A heterogeneous coefficient approach to the knowledge production function| Past literature has used conventional spatial autoregressive panel data models to relate patent production output to knowledge production inputs. However, research conducted on regional innovation systems points to regional disparities in both regions’ ability to turn their knowledge inputs into innovation and to access external knowledge. Applying a heterogeneous coefficients spatial autoregressive panel model, we estimate region-specific knowledge production functions (KPFs) for 94 NUTS-3 regions in France using a panel covering 21 years from 1988 to 2008 and four high-technology industries. A great deal of regional heterogeneity in the KPF relationship exists across regions, providing new insights regarding spatial spillin and spillout effects between regions.
O52|Economic convergence and exchange rate misalignments in the European Union|We investigate (i) the characteristics of real economic and price convergence, (ii) the relationship between economic growth (convergence) and real exchange rate (RER) misalignments within the European Union (EU) during the period 1995–2016. In addition to the relative external price level of GDP, we quantified an alternative indicator for the RER: the internal relative price of services to goods, as measured from the expenditure side of GDP. We interpreted RER-misalignments as deviations from levels consistent with levels of economic development among EU countries. Regarding real convergence, the “catching up” of the less developed member states to the more affluent ones within the EU was expressly rapid in terms of relative per capita growth measured at current PPPs; it was less impressive if measured at constant PPPs, and rather modest in terms of relative real GDP-growth. As for price levels and the relative price of services to goods, a rapid convergence could be observed until the international financial crisis, but this process halted in 2008. Using pooled OLS and dynamic panel techniques, we found that within the EU there is a negative relationship between the contemporaneous sign of RER-misalignment (based on both the external price level and internal relative prices) and economic growth: over- (under-) valuations are associated with lower (higher) growth. This is mainly due to developments in countries operating under fixed exchange rate regimes. Our results indicate that the level of development does not influence the strength of the growth-misalignment relationship within the EU. These results are robust to the applied panel estimation method. Regarding the external price level, we find that the positive relationship between undervaluation and growth diminishes with increasing size of undervaluation. The aggregate effect of misalignments is significantly negative on both export market shares and the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to GDP: both the competitiveness and the investment channel play an important role in the relationship between growth and RER misalignments. As an extension, we analyse the relationship between growth and the misalignment of wages from productivity levels; “wage-misalignments” are also negatively associated with economic growth. Although our study carries policy messages – in particular, mild real exchange rate undervaluations are positively, while overvaluations are negatively associated with growth and real economic convergence – the RER is an endogenous variable, which is not under direct policy control. Our results point to the importance of a growth strategy avoiding overvaluation on the one hand, and to the futility of aiming at excessive undervaluation, on the other.
O52|From Convergence to Divergence: Portuguese Economic Growth, 1527–1850|We construct the first time-series for Portugal’s per capita GDP for 1527-1850, drawing on a new database. Starting in the early 1630s there was a highly persistent upward trend which accelerated after 1710 and peaked 40 years later. At that point, per capita income was high by European standards, though behind the most advanced Western European economies. But as the second half of the eighteenth century unfolded, a phase of economic decline was initiated. This continued into the nineteenth century, and by 1850 per capita incomes were not different from what they had been in the early 1530s.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O52|Towards a Holistic Innovation Policy: Can the Swedish National Innovation Council Serve as a Role Model?|A holistic innovation policy is defined in this article as a policy that integrates all public actions that influence or may influence innovation processes. The Swedish National Innovation Council (NIC) was created by the Swedish Prime Minister, Stefan Löfven, in February 2015. It is personally chaired by the Prime Minister, which is unusual for similar councils in other countries. Another atypical characteristic of the Swedish NIC is that it has a dominant and wide focus on innovation policy. In other countries, such councils focus predominantly on science and/or research policy and treat innovation policy, if at all, as an “appendix” to research policy. The purpose of this article is to answer the following four questions: A. Has Swedish innovation policy recently been moving in the direction of a more holistic innovation policy? If so, how and in what respects? B. Has the Swedish National Innovation Council (NIC) had an influence on Swedish innovation policy and has it played a role in the transition towards a holistic innovation policy? Which role and how? C. Have conceptual specifications and advancements, such as innovation systems (in a broad sense), functional public procurement, additionality, and holistic innovation policy played a role in the changes in Swedish innovation policy? D. Can Sweden serve as a role model for other countries in these respects?
O52|Revisiting public support for the euro, 1999-2017: Accounting for the crisis and the recovery|This paper explores the evolution and determinants of public support for the euro since its creation in 1999 until the end of 2017, thereby covering the pre-crisis experience of the euro, the crisis years and the recent recovery. Using uniquely large macro and micro databases and applying up-to-date econometric techniques, this paper revisits the growing literature on public support for the euro. First, we find a majority of citizens support the euro in nearly all 19 euro area member states. Second, we offer fresh evidence that economic factors are the main determinants of change in the level of support for the euro: crisis reduces support while periods of recovery from unemployment bode well for public support. This result holds for both macroeconomic and microeconomic factors. Turning to a broad set of socio-economic variables, we find clear differences in support due to education and perceptions of economic status.
O52|Gender inequality and the gender job satisfaction paradox in Europe|Although women are paid less than men, face worse working conditions, lower promotion opportunities, and work-place discrimination, they typically report job satisfaction higher or similar to men's. Twenty years ago Clark (Clark, 1997) suggested that the reason behind women's higher job satisfaction are their lower expectations, driven by a number of factors related to current and past positions of women on the labour market. Although this hypothesis is one of the leading explanations of the gender differences in the job satisfaction, cross-country research investigating the relationship between the gender inequality and gender job satisfaction gap are rare and only descriptive. In this paper we use the data from EU-SILC module on subjective well being from 2013 to analyse adjusted gender job satisfaction gaps in 32 European countries and relate them to the country differences in gender inequalities. Results provide extensive and robust evidence of a relationship between exposure to more gender equal settings in the early stages of life and smaller gender gaps in job satisfaction, once all other possible drivers are controlled for. This suggests that women who experienced higher gender equality have expectations increasingly aligned to those of their male counterparts. Our results also show that this alignment is further favoured by being employed in typically male occupations, whereas higher levels of education do not play a similar effect.
O52|The 2018 PREDICT Key Facts Report. An analysis of ICT R&D in the EU and beyond|The 2018 PREDICT Key Facts Report provides a detailed analysis of the state of ICT R&D activities in the European Union. This is the eleventh edition of a series that is published annually. Like the previous editions, an online version is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/predict. The report covers the period between 1995 and 2015, providing a long-term analysis of the European Union (EU) ICT sector and its R&D, covering a whole cycle from the initial expansion years, to the double recession that began in early 2008, and the most recent evolution up to 2015. Whenever possible, the report includes nowcasted data for 2016 and 2017. The statistical information provided by the figures allows comparing the ICT sector with the total economy; the ICT manufacturing sector with the ICT services sector; each of the four ICT manufacturing, two ICT services, MC and RS sectors’ behaviour; the pace followed by each EU country; and the pattern of the EU in an international context, including the most relevant countries from the perspective of the role they play in the world economy today, especially from the ICT R&D perspective.
O52|Is a Blockchain-based conveyance system the next step in the financialisation of housing? The case of Sweden|This paper investigates the social and economic mechanisms of a blockchain technology in the area of land administration. In particular, it focuses, first, on an emerging blockchain-based solution in Sweden to change and improve its land administration system (LAS), and, second, on the 'upgraded' LAS' potential impacts to create more complex financial derivatives based on land and the built environment. We investigate how these changes influence housing markets at the interface with financial markets and how these changes impact on the economic organisation of the different stakeholders involved in these processes. The argument is developed using the case of Sweden, where Lantmäteriet, a government agency, is pioneering the use of blockchain technology for real-estate conveyance.
O52|Resource Misallocation in European Firms: The Role of Constraints, Firm Characteristics and Managerial Decisions|Using a new survey, we document high dispersion of marginal revenue products across firms in the European Union (EU). To interpret this dispersion, we develop a portable framework to quantify gains from better allocation of resources. We demonstrate that apart from direct measures of distortions, firm characteristics, such as demographics, quality of inputs, utilization of resources, and dynamic adjustment of inputs, are predictors of the marginal revenue products of capital and labor. We emphasize that some firm characteristics may reflect compensating differentials rather than constraints and the effect of constraints on the dispersion of marginal products may hence be smaller than has been assumed in the literature. We show that cross-country differences in the dispersion of marginal products in the EU are largely due to differences in how the business, institutional and policy environment translates firm characteristics into outcomes rather than to the differences in firm characteristics per se. Removing distortions could raise EU aggregate productivity by 40 percent or more.
O52|Employment Shocks and anti-EU Sentiment|Euroscepticism and the rise of populist parties have often been linked to economic insecurity. This paper identifies regional employment changes as causal factors for forming attitudes towards the European Union and voting for eurosceptic parties in European Parliament elections. To do so, I combine industry-specific employment data for roughly 260 European NUTS II regions with individual-level Eurobarometer survey data for the past 20 years and regional voting results. I apply panel data and instrumental variable methods; for the latter I construct a Bartik-style instrument, which predicts employment changes on the basis of regional industry specialization and Europe-wide sector specific employment growth rates. The effect of employment changes on attitudes towards the EU is particularly strong for unemployed and low-skilled workers in regions with a high share of migrants from other European member states, which supports the narrative that ‘losers of globalization’ tend to be more skeptical towards economic and political integration.
O52|Virtuous or Vicious? Development Banks in Europe|In the aftermath of the economic and financial crises, European policy makers have manifested a renewed interest on the role played by development banks in mitigating market failure by supporting financial programs set up to reverse the low level of investment by EU firms and stimulating innovation paths. This interest is coupled with an increasing awareness of the need to ensure the financial sustainability of these institutions, by securing reasonable levels of efficiency. In this paper, we analyze the performance and self-sustainability of European development banks with the aim of assessing whether they pursue their mandate retaining financial soundness without entailing an undesirable absorption of public resources. The empirical analysis leverages on a unique manually collected dataset including all the development banks headquartered in Europe. We introduce specific regression models aimed at quantifying the difference in financial performances between development banks and the banking industry, also investigating their different responses across the business and political cycles. Our main finding is that the profitability of development banks over the period 2000-2015 is only slightly lower than that of their benchmark. However, the difference is not statistically significant when focusing on Western Europe or on the period after the 2008 crisis. Besides, development banks appear to be more resilient when the economy slows down, while in Eastern Europe they also play a countercyclical role. During election years, differences exist between development banks in Western and Eastern Europe, with the former virtuous and the latter still accommodating. A battery of robustness tests confirms our results. These new findings point to the characteristics of contemporary development banks in Europe and provide insights to member states that are evaluating to provide additional financial funds to development banks or to promote the setting up of new promotional banks.
O52|The Input-Output Analysis Of Blue Industries: Comparative Study Of Estonia And Finland|The paper focuses on examining the role of blue industries in the national economies of Estonia and Finland as two neighbouring countries that have a sea border. We exploit the Input-Output (I-O) methodology to analyse inter-industry linkages relying on the OECD I-O tables. The OECD database comprises information on 34 sectors of the national economy over the period 1995–2011. The results of the analysis show that despite rather weak overall backward and forward linkages of aggregated blue industries within the national economies, they play a remarkable role in the economic activities of maritime regions, and to a large extent drive the economic success of Estonian and Finnish regional and national economies in generating new growth and employment. The weak backward and forward linkages indicate that negative dynamics within the blue economy yield rather weak negative externalities for the overall economy, and by contrast, if the national economy as a whole is suffering under a crisis, the potential impact on industries is not particularly remarkable. These findings suggest that blue industries are relatively independent within national economies having a remarkable role in socio-economic development of maritime regions, and thereby, create good preconditions for the stable development of cross-border cooperation between the maritime regions of both countries.
O52|Resource Misallocation in European Firms: The Role of Constraints, Firm Characteristics and Managerial Decisions|Using a new survey, we show that the dispersion of marginal products across firms in the European Union is about twice as large as that in the United States. Reducing it to the US level would increase EU GDP by more than 30 percent. Alternatively, removing barriers between industries and countries would raise EU GDP by at least 25 percent. Firm characteristics, such as demographics, quality of inputs, utilization of resources, and dynamic adjustment of inputs, are predictors of the marginal products of capital and labor. We emphasize that some firm characteristics may reflect compensating differentials rather than constraints and the effect of constraints on the dispersion of marginal products may hence be smaller than has been assumed in the literature. We also show that cross-country differences in the dispersion of marginal products are more due to differences in how the business, institutional and policy environment translates firm characteristics into outcomes than to the differences in firm characteristics per se.
O52|Techies, Trade, and Skill-Biased Productivity|We study the impact of firm level choices of ICT, R&D, exporting and importing on the evolution of productivity and its bias towards skilled occupations. We use a novel measure of the propensity of a firm to engage in technology investment and adoption: its employment of workers with STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) skills and experience who we call “techies”. We develop a methodology for estimating firm level productivity that allows us to measure both Hicks-neutral and skill-augmenting technology differences, and apply this to administrative data on French firms in the entire private sector from 2009 to 2013. We find that techies and importing of intermediate inputs raise skill-biased productivity, while imports also raise Hicks-neutral productivity. We also find that higher firm-level skill biased productivity raises low-skill employment even as it raises the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers. This is because of the cost-reducing effect of higher productivity. The techie and trade effects are large, and can account for much of the aggregate increase in skilled employment from 2009 to 2013.
O52|Boosting productivity and preparing for the future of work in Germany|This paper reviews policies to strengthen Germany’s productivity growth and prepare for changes in labour markets brought about by new technologies. This paper also discusses how social protection and the bargaining framework should be reformed for the future of work. Germany enjoys a relatively high labour productivity level but productivity growth has been modest in recent years. There is room to boost productivity growth by accelerating the diffusion of new technologies throughout the economy. Vigorous entrepreneurship and innovation by small and medium enterprises are key for such technology diffusion while strong broadband and mobile networks widen the scope of data-intensive technologies that can be exploited to increase productivity. Widespread use of new technologies will bring about significant changes in skill demand and work arrangements. As in many countries, Germany saw a decline in the share of middle-skilled jobs in employment. A relatively high share of jobs is expected to be automated or undergo significant changes in task contents as a result of technological change. New technologies are also likely to increase individuals engaging in new forms of work, such as gig work intermediated by digital platforms. Such workers are less covered by public social safety nets such as unemployment insurance than regular employment.
O52|The diffusion of a policy innovation in the energy sector: evidence from the collective switching case in Europe|This paper investigates the factors that influence the dissemination of an energy policy innovation, the collective switching, adopting the business ecosystem as unit of analysis. Collective switching is a new phenomenon that recent literature has not yet investigated. It is characterised by a group of people with common characteristics that, through an intermediary, negotiates with the energy suppliers and, thanks to its bargaining power, is able to obtain advantageous contracts. The 6C framework is adopted in order to perform a cross-country analysis oriented to single out differences in the collective switching ecosystems. Through a comparative case study analysis, which examines in rich detail 11 European countriesâ€™ collective switching campaigns, this work provides an accurate description of the collective switching business ecosystem and the ways it reacts to a policy innovation. Semi-structured interviews, conducted with consumer associations that organised collective switching campaigns, provide insights for the definition of some policy interventions.
O52|Assessment of national waste generation in EU Member States’ efficiency|Waste generation and management may be considered as either a by-product of economic actions or even used as input to economic activity like energy recovery. Every country produces different amounts of municipal solid waste (MSW) and with different composition. This paper deals with the efficiency of 28 EU Member States for the years 2008, 2010 and 2012 by employing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and by using eight parameters, namely waste generation, employment rate, capital formation, GDP, population density and for the first time SOx, NOx and GHG emissions for the relevant countries. With these parameters six environmental production frameworks have been designed each with different inputs and outputs. The empirical analysis shows that overall the more efficient countries according to all frameworks include Belgium, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway. These results were then reviewed against the recycling rate of each country for the examined time periods. The recycling rate actually depicts the DEA results, namely more efficient countries seem to have a higher recycling rate too. Moreover the DEA efficiency results were contrasted to the overall treatment options used in the countries under consideration. Overall it is noticed that countries employing all four treatment options with high use of more sustainable ones and decrease in the use of landfill are the ones that also proved to be efficient according to DEA.
O52|Mobility of Highly Skilled Individuals and Local Innovation Activity|This paper studies the drivers of highly skilled migrants across space as well as their impact on local innovation activity. We focus on patent inventors, a specific typology of skilled and innovative individuals who are deeply involved in the production of innovation and are important vehicle of knowledge circulation. Employing patent data to track their moves, we use a gravity model to examine whether geographic, technological and cultural proximities between countries and country level factors and policies shape the flows of these talented individuals. As a comparison, in the same framework, we also analyze the flows of non-inventor migrants. Our evidence shows that proximity matters for migration. Gravity emerges everywhere; in the mobility of inventor and non-inventor migrant workers; the former, however, are less geographically restricted. Similarity in technological production structure between countries is the main driver of inventor moves - especially for inventors from the most innovative countries, whereas cultural proximity matters more for non-inventor migrants. Attractive country features are the quality of institutions and job opportunities at the destination as well as trade linkages between origin and destination country. Finally, the knowledge and skills that move with the inventors have an important positive impact on local innovation production.
O52|If France Continues This Strategy, Taxes Will Destroy Domestic Investment And Economic Growth|The aim of this article is to study empirically the nexus between tax revenue, domestic investment and economic growth in France, since it's never been done before. In addition, there were many problems and repercussions that criticized France's tax policy and its danger to the economic structure, which encourages us to do this research. To attempt this objective, annual data for the period 1972 - 2016 was tested by using correlation analysis and estimation based on vector error correction model. Our results suggest that in the long run there is a negative relationship between tax revenue, domestic investment and economic growth. It is seen that the strategy tax policy of France is not safe for domestic investment and economic growth. For this reason, immediate intervention should be encouraged to carry out the necessary measures before the situation becomes more disastrous.
O52|Research and innovation policy in Italy|Italy’s research and innovation are examined in this article moving from the structure of the country’s economy and innovation system, examining the dynamics of private and public activities and the impact of policies. As a result of the long recession started in 2008, industrial production and investment experienced dramatic reductions, weakening business performances in R&D and innovation; policies have relied on ‘horizontal’ tax incentives for R&D, patenting and new machinery, with limited effects. Austerity-driven reduction of public expenditure has led to major cuts in public R&D and university budgets, combined with new rules for evaluation and merit-based financing. As a result, gaps between Italy’s research and innovation and EU average performances have increased. Four key policy questions are identified: the possibility for Italians firms to grow with modest technological activities; the longer term impact of underfunding the public R&D and university system; the consequences of a low presence of university graduates in the labour force; the sustainability of the increasing regional divergence within Italy’s research and innovation system.
O52|Studiu retrospectiv privind comerțul exterior al României în ultimii 100 de ani<BR>[A retrospective study on Romania’s external trade in the past 100 years]|Throughout the last century, Romania's economy has suffered major adverse costs, especially caused by external factors, with an adverse impact both on the volume of foreign trade and its commodity structure and geographical orientation. The study focuses on the evolution of Romania's foreign trade over the past 100 years trying to highlight the main features and trends in the different stages of the Romanian economy development, covering the periods 1918-1947, 1948-1989 and 1990-2017, marked by the the interwar economy particularities, the socialist political and economic regime, and the Romania's transition to the market economy, in the context of pre-accession and integration in the European Union. The presentation of the main coordinates of Romania's trade policies precedes the foreign trade quantitative and qualitative analysis for each of the above mentioned periods.
O52|Evoluția capitalului în România în secolul 1918-2018 de la Marea Unire la tranziția la economia de piață<BR>[Romania’s capital developments during 1918-2018 century from the Great Union to the market economy transition]|The paper focuses on the evolution of the capital in Romania, in three extremely different periods during the last century, under the changes of internal / international context and political regimes, with special emphasis on the relationship with the country economic development. In the years 1918-1945, the share of foreign capital in the capital of joint-stock companies was higher compared to domestic capital, which is explained by the interest of foreign investors to seek relatively cheap resources and production factors in Romania. A certain role of foreign investments in this period to the development of several industrial sectors is broadly recognized in the special literature. In the socialist period, 1948-1989, characterized by the insignificant size of foreign capital in Romania (excepting some few failed joint venture companies), the accelerated accumulation of capital and the fast increase of fixed assets led to an excessive development of production overcapacities, with relatively low efficiency, energy-intensive and polluting, what created severe economic and financial imbalances, ended with the collapse of the system. During the transition period to the market economy, 1990-2018, marked, in the first decade, by a certain degradation of the domestic capital due to the bankruptcy and/or unsuccesful privatization of state-owned companies, after the year 2000, at the same time with the gradual integration in the euro-atlantic structures, the foreign investors have increased significantly their presence in Romania, entering in a competitive relationship with the domestic capital and production.
O52|The potential of the EU economies in attracting FDI – A composite index based approach|The paper presents a composite index which measures the potential of the 28 European Union (EU) member countries in attracting foreign direct investments (FDI), for the period 2000 – 2012. Several new variables (in respect to other aggregated Indices) linked to the latest development policies of the European Union are considered in the construction process of the proposed index. By comparing several versions of the constructed index with some of the most notorious indicators used to measure the FDI attractiveness, we find that the PCA (principal component analysis) version of our index shows the best performance in tracking the FDI activity of the EU economies. The empirical results show that the FDI activity is concentrated in the developed economies, confirming therefore previous results presented in the literature. The construction methodology of our index allows the identification of the main characteristics of the European economies which should be taken in consideration by the national governments when forging policies for increasing the FDI attractiveness of their economies. Among other practical applications of the proposed index, it can be used as a starting point for identifying benchmark economies which can help policymakers identify best practices and innovative approaches for the areas where their economies are lagging behind.
O52|Riforme e Investimenti. Europa e Italia. By Marco Fortis and Alberto Quadrio Curzio. An analysis|This paper is an analysis of the book by Marco Fortis and Alberto Quadrio Curzio, Riforme e investimenti. Europa e Italia, Il Mulino, 2017.
O52|Exploitation of Research Findings as a Source of Well-being|Abstract In Finland, universities have the explicit mandate to support the transformation of high-quality knowledge into profitable business, as well as to promote the creation of new businesses and workplaces within the boundaries of their so-called third mission. This report looks at how Finnish universities perform in the task. The results point at a clear lack of dedicated resources. The underlying reason is systemic: performance is not linked to incentives in the form of public university funding. Currently, resources for the implementation of the third mission are largely obtained via competition from external sources, endangering the continuity of the technology transfer function and creating disincentives to invest in its development. The lack of incentives is echoed among researchers: Nearly half of the scientists who, according to their own view, have made economically valuable findings state they do not find the time to promote their exploitation. The report proposes several remedies: (1) the performance of universities in their third mission needs to be metered. (2) These metrics need to be linked to earmarked public university funding; (3) Individual-level metrics concerning the exploitation of their findings should encourage researchers and promote their academic careers. In order to support more rapid cultural change, universities could (4) recruit professors directly from the business world; and (5) set up cooperative, joint laboratories with industry in their respective strategic research areas.
O52|Convergenta macroeconomica si regionala|The study is mainly focussed on the analysis of real convergence process in EU and inside of each of three conventional groups of countries (western, southern, and eastern). Moreover, the structural convergence (evaluated by the shares of main sectors of economy in total employment) and regional convergence (inside of each country) are analysed. Generally, dynamics of the estimated specific indicators of convergence after 2000 shows a strong real and structural convergence, both at the level of EU and inside of each groups of countries. However, the study demonstrated a more complex process in case of the regional convergence.
O52|Macroeconomic Effects of the Adoption of the Euro in Serbia|In 2009, Serbia applied officially for EU membership; in 2014, membership negotiations started. After joining the EU, Serbia will have to adopt the euro as legal tender as soon as it fulfils the relevant Maastricht criteria. By means of simulations with a macroeconometric model of the Serbian economy, we examine likely macroeconomic effects from Serbia?s membership of the EU and the Euro Area. We show that EU accession and the introduction of the euro bring about higher real GDP, more employment, and more sustainable public finances. The benefits of joining the Euro Area are mainly due to increases in productivity.
O52|Expanding to online platform business models for grocery retailers ? Insights from case studies|This paper examines the requirements of German, owner managed grocery retailers when expanding their business model by including online platforms to their distribution channels. Fourteen guided interviews with German grocery retailers were conducted, focusing on the status quo of their business models as well as their individual needs when it comes to online distribution. The contribution with this paper are twofold. First, we provide practical insights from real case studies in the way business models from small and medium enterprises in grocery retailing are structured. Second, we point out technological and non-technological requirements when small grocery retailers try to change their business model concerning to the engagement in online platforms. The paper finishes with suggestions on opportunities how to address these requirements.
O52|Does FDI crowd out domestic investment in transition countries?|The aim of this paper is to empirically investigate the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and domestic investment in a sample of 10 Central and Eastern European countries over the period 1995–2015. We find FDI to lead to a creative destruction phenomenon, with a short‐term crowding out effect on domestic investment, followed by a long‐term crowding in. Greenfield FDI develops stronger long‐run complementarities with domestic investment, while mergers and acquisitions do not show a significant effect on domestic investment. Financial development seems to mitigate crowding out pressures and even foster a crowding in for mergers and acquisitions.
O52|Loan-to-value ratio limits: an exploration for Greece|We study the role of the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio instrument in a DSGE model with a rich set of financial frictions (Clerc et al., 2015). We find that a binding LTV ratio limit in the mortgage market leads to lower credit and default rates in that market as well as lower levels of investment and output, while leaving other sectors and agents largely unaffected. Interestingly, when the level of capital requirements is in the neighborhood of its optimal value, implementing an LTV ratio cap has a negative impact on welfare, even if it leads to greater macroeconomic stability. Furthermore, the availability of the LTV ratio instrument does not impact on the optimal level of capital requirements. It seems that once capital requirements have been optimally deployed to tame banks’ appetite for excessive risk, the use of the LTV ratio could prove counterproductive from a welfare point of view.
O52|BREXIT and FDI: Key Issues and New Empirical Findings|Summary This contribution takes a new look at the gravity equation model in relation to foreign direct investment of leading industrialized countries which presents a useful basis for assessing certain potential impacts arising from BREXIT. The gravity equation estimated allows considering the case of BREXIT and the broader role of EU membership and other variables. Looking at the period from 1985 to 2012 for a dataset which contains 34 OECD countries: The PPML dyadic fixed estimations take into account a broad set of approaches and variables, respectively. Besides the traditional variables of the EU/EU single market membership of the source country and of the host country, we further consider the role of trade openness as well as corporate tax rates and the ratio of inward FDI stock to total capital stock. The analysis shows that trade openness is a variable which can be largely replaced by the inward FDI stock/capital stock ratio so that gravity FDI modeling with a strong emphasis on trade openness is likely to overstate the role of trade and to understate the role of relative FDI accumulation effects. The implication for BREXIT analysis is that the UK will face three impulses for FDI inflows: (1) leaving the EU single market will strongly reduce FDI inflows; (2) if foreign ownership in the UK capital stock should strongly increase in the run-up to the BREXIT year 2019, part of the dampening effects of leaving the EU will be mitigated by the increase of the FDI stock/capital stock ratio which in turn is likely to reflect a Froot-Stein effect related to a real Pound deprecation 2016-2018; (3) to the extent that the UK government will want to reinforce output growth through higher FDI inflows, a reduction of corporate taxation could generate high effects – but could also stimulate a downward international corporate tax reduction game. Zusammenfassung: Dieser Artikel leistet einen neuen Beitrag zur Analyso von Direktinvestitionsflüssen führender Industrieländer mithilfe des Gravitationsmodells, was eine nützliche Grundlage für die Bewertung bestimmter potenzieller Auswirkungen von BREXIT darstellt. Die Gravitationsgleichung ermöglicht die Berücksichtigung des BREXIT-Falles, der umfassenderen Rolle der EU-Mitgliedschaft und anderer Variablen. Betrachtet wird der Zeitraum von 1985 bis 2012 für einen Datensatz, der 34 OECD-Länder enthält: Der dyadische PPML-Fixed-Effects Schätzer berücksichtigt eine breite Palette von Ansätzen bzw. Variablen. Neben den traditionellen Variablen der Mitgliedschaft der EU bzw. des EU-Binnenmarktes im Herkunfts- und im Empfängerland, betrachten wir die Rolle der Handelsoffenheit sowie der Körperschaftssteuersätze und des Verhältnisses der FDI-Bestände zum gesamten Kapitalbestand. Die Analyse zeigt, dass die Handelsoffenheit eine Variable ist, die weitgehend durch die FDI-Aktien- / Kapitalstock-Quote ersetzt werden kann, so dass die FDI-Modellierung mit Schwerpunkt auf Handelsoffenheit die Rolle des Handels überbewerten und die Rolle der relativen kummulierten FDI-Effekte unterbewerten. Die Analyse zeigt, dass der BREXIT für das Vereinigte Königreich drei Effekte für die FDI-Zuflüsse haben wird: (1) wenn der EU-Binnenmarkt verlassen wird, werden die FDI-Zuflüsse stark sinken; (2) Sollte die ausländische Beteiligung am britischen Kapitalstock im Vorfeld des BREXIT-Jahres 2019 stark ansteigen, wird ein Teil der dämpfenden Auswirkungen des EU-Austritts durch die Erhöhung der FDI-Aktien-/Kapitalstockquote gemildert, dies reflektiert einen Froot-Stein-Effekt, der sich auf eine reale Pfund-Abwertung 2016-2018 bezieht; (3) In dem Maße, in dem die britische Regierung das Produktionswachstum durch höhere FDI-Zuflüsse verstärken will, könnte eine Senkung der Unternehmensbesteuerung hohe Auswirkungen haben – könnte aber auch eine Senkungsspirale des internationalen Steuersatzes stimulieren.
O52|What Happened to CIT Collection? Solving the Rates-Revenues Puzzle|Despite sharp reductions in corporate income tax (CIT) rates worldwide, CIT revenues have not fallen dramatically in the last two decades. This paper investigates the recent developments in CIT in the European Union, by taking a closer look at the potential driving forces behind this puzzle. Using a unique dataset of national sectoral accounts, we decompose the CIT revenue to GDP ratio for the EU and find that while the decrease in the statutory rates has driven down tax collection, the effect was more than offset by a broadening of the taxable base and a slight increase in the size of the corporate sector. However, this result holds for the period 1995-2015 but not for the last decade where base broadening has not been able to match further cuts in rates.
O52|Knowledge Remittances: Does Emigration Foster Innovation?|Does the emigration of skilled individuals necessarily result in losses for source countries due to the brain drain? Combining industry-level patenting and migration data from 32 European countries, we show that emigration in fact positively contributes to innovation in source countries. We use changes in the labour mobility legislation within Europe as exogenous variation to establish causality. By analysing patent citation data, we further provide evidence that these positive effects are driven by knowledge flows that are triggered by emigrants. While skilled migrants are not inventing in their home country anymore, they contribute to cross-border knowledge and technology diffusion and thus help less advanced countries to catch up to the technology frontier.
O52|The Greek Justice System: Collapse and Reform|This paper discusses the key structural deficiencies of the Greek justice system and proposes some concrete policy reforms. In the first part, we provide an anatomy of the Greek legal system using cross-country indicators reflecting the formalism, quality, and speed of the resolution mechanisms. The analysis shows that the Greek justice system is failing to protect citizens, as delays in all types of courts exceed five years and in some instances reach a decade. At the same the quality of laws protecting investors, even property, is low. Using comparative data from other EU jurisdictions, we show that the key reasons behind these failures are the absence of information technology, the lack of supporting to judges staff, the absence of specialized courts and tribunals, and a hugely dysfunctional administration. At the same time, there are minimal checks and balances. In the second part, we detail a set of policy proposals. Our proposals consist of immediate measures for clearing the large backlog and a set of more ambitious medium-term reforms (many of which require a constitutional amendment). Our proposals aim to make the Greek justice system professionally administered, less formalistic, suitably flexible, more responsive and more accountable to society at large. Given the strong link between legal institutions and development, justice reform is an absolute priority of the reform agenda and a sine qua non-condition for the much-needed sustainable recovery of the Greek economy.
O52|Female Employment And Quality Of Life In Europe And The United States: The Positive Effects Of Industry On Services Employment And Wages, 2000-2017|This paper presents a short version of some chapters and articles published by the author related with Female Employment and Quality of Life in several OECD countries of Europe and America for the period 1990-2010 as well as an update for the period 2010-2018. We focus on the positive impact that Industry usually has on the development of Services and the real Wage. Those impacts are very important in order to increase total employment and female employment. Regarding quality of life, some factors that have an important impact for women are those related with the quality of working conditions (opportunities for employment, real wage, conciliation of family and work, and other ones) as well as opportunities for social participation (in news, political tasks, instutions and other ones). Many of these factors are also important for quality of life of men. We cite the results of several econometric models in order to explain the main differences of employment rates and real income per capita among the countries of the study.
O52|Macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area: where do we stand?|This occasional paper reviews the macroeconomic developments in the euro area countries over the past 20 years. It analyses the accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances in the first decade of the EMU and their unwinding during the second decade. It shows that while flow imbalances have been corrected to a large extent, stock imbalances persist. The presence of large stock imbalances implies that the adjustment process needs to continue in the years to come. Accordingly, this paper reviews the national responses so far and the importance of well-functioning national economic structures for facilitating the adjustment process within the EMU. It shows that national structural policies are able to stimulate the supply side of the economy, increase adjustment capacity and mitigate the adverse growth effects of high debt and deleveraging. Finally, it gives an overview of the European response to address macroeconomic imbalances, i.e. the establishment of the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP). The MIP has contributed to increasing the general attention given to macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area and to the critical role that structural reforms play in facilitating their adjustment. Looking forward, further steps would appear to be warranted in order to move from greater awareness towards stronger ownership and implementation of reforms. JEL Classification: E02, F45, O52
O52|Real convergence in central, eastern and south-eastern Europe|This paper analyses real income convergence in central, eastern and south-eastern Europe (CESEE) to the most advanced EU economies between 2000 and 2016. The relevance of this topic stems both from the far-reaching implications of real income convergence for economic welfare and the importance of convergence for economic and monetary integration with, and within the European Union. The paper establishes stylised facts of convergence, analyses the drivers of economic growth and identifies factors that might explain the differences between fast- and slow-converging economies in the region. The results show that the most successful CESEE economies in terms of the pace of convergence share common characteristics such as, inter alia, a strong improvement in institutional quality and human capital, more outward-oriented economic policies, favourable demographic developments and the quick reallocation of labour from agriculture into other sectors. Looking ahead, accelerating and sustaining convergence in the region will require further efforts to enhance institutional quality and innovation, reinvigorate investment, and address the adverse impact of population ageing.

O52|Insolvency frameworks and private debt: an empirical investigation|This paper presents new evidence on the importance of insolvency frameworks for private sector debt deleveraging and for the resolution of non-performing loans (NPL). We construct an aggregate insolvency framework index (IFI), which is used as explanatory variable in the empirical analysis. By means of panel estimates over 2003-2016, we show that OECD countries with better IFI deleverage faster and adjust their NPL levels more rapidly than countries with worse IFI. We also show that there is a strong correlation between the level of NPL and IFI, which appears to be state-dependent, i.e. in a situation of high unemployment relative to its historical average the NPL ratio is generally lower for a higher IFI. Finally, our results indicate that better insolvency frameworks lead to faster NPL reductions and to lower NPL increases during economic bad times. JEL Classification: C23, E02, E05, O52
O52|Wealth of the Nation: Scotland’s Productivity Challenge - Technical Appendix|This note provides technical background information on some contents of the report Wealth of the Nation: Scotland’s Productivity Challenge (Kelly et al.,2018). The report shows that Scotland’s productivity performance is only middling in the OECD: Scotland would need to close a productivity gap of 20% to reach the top quartile of most productive OECD countries. It also illustrates that this gap can be attributed to a relatively low capital stock and low Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in equal measure. In this note, we make transparent the data and assumptions underlying these calculations.
O52|Follow the leader: Evidence of the Productivity catch-up of European firms|In this article we characterize Total Factor Productivity (TFP) frontier firms at the industry level within the European Union during the period 2003-2014, and explore the determinants of the firms’ distance to the frontier. We find that larger, more capital-intensive, and more labour skilled firms are closer to the productivity frontier. In contrast, older firms are further away from the frontier. In addition, we obtain that a number of countries' economic and institutional factors, such as tertiary education, trade openness, R&D stock, easiness in getting credit and governance quality, affect positively the catching up of laggards towards the productivity frontier. We also examine the moderating effect of the Great Recession as well as the effect of productivity improvements at the frontier.
O52|Industrial relatedness and regional resilience in the European Union|The 2008 Great Recession prompted interest in the concept of regional resilience. This paper discusses and empirically investigates the relationship between industrial relatedness and economic resilience across European Union regions over the 2008–2012 crisis period. The analysis focuses on two types of industrial relatedness: technological and vertical (i.e., market‐based). The empirical analysis is performed on a sample of 209 NUTS 2 regions in 16 countries. Our results highlight a positive effect of technological relatedness on the probability of resilience in the very short run (i.e., the 2008–2009 period), while the negative effect of vertical relatedness seems to persist for longer. La Gran Recesión de 2008 despertó el interés por el concepto de resiliencia regional. Este artículo analiza e investiga empíricamente la relación entre la relación industrial y la resiliencia económica en las regiones de la Unión Europea durante el período de crisis 2008‐2012. El análisis se centra en dos tipos de relación industrial: tecnológica y vertical (es decir, basada en el mercado). El análisis empírico se realizó sobre una muestra de 209 regiones NUTS 2 en 16 países. Nuestros resultados destacan un efecto positivo de la relación tecnológica sobre la probabilidad de resiliencia a muy corto plazo (es decir, en el período 2008‐2009), mientras que el efecto negativo de la relación vertical parece persistir por más tiempo. 2008年のグレート・リセッションによって、地域のレジリエンスという概念に対する関心が急激に高まった。本稿では、2008年~2012年の経済危機の期間を通しての欧州連合の地域全体における産業間の連関性と経済レジリエンスの関連性を考察し、実証的に検討する。技術的と垂直的 (すなわち、市場ベース)という2つの産業間の連関性のタイプを中心に分析を行う。実証分析は、16カ国における209のNUT2の地域のサンプルを対象に実施する。結果から、技術的な連関性は、垂直的連関性の負の効果はより長く持続するようであるが、非常に短期的 (すなわち、2008年~2009年)なレジリエンスの可能性に対して正の効果を与えていることが明確に示された。
O52|A ‘New Modesty’? Level Shifts in Survey Data and the Decreasing Trend of ‘Normal’ Growth|While the current level of the Economic Sentiment Indicator, which is well above its long-term average, is compatible with expanding economic activity, it has been associated with lower growth rates than those implied in the pre-recession period. Departing from the idea that the relationship between qualitative survey (‘soft’) and quantitative (‘hard’) data might have changed during the Great Recession due to a 'new modesty' of survey respondents, this paper goes one step further and examines to what extent this link might be constantly moving over longer time periods. Using rolling regressions and time-varying parameter models for the euro area, the paper shows that the growth rates typically implied by given survey results did not only fall during the Great recession, but already decreased rather systematically for close to 20 years before the crisis, i.e. since around 1990. This is true for the overall economy (measured by GDP growth), but also industrial production, construction production, and households consumption. Country-specific results for the GDP of the four largest euro-area economies are also presented. Furthermore, the paper suggests that business and consumer survey results can be used, beyond their usual short-term forecasting purposes, to gauge changes in long-term or potential growth. While the results should be interpreted as preliminary and experimental, they might be useful as a contribution to the assessment of post-crisis potential growth, not least since they are less subject to revisions than conventional methods based on production functions
O52|Divergence between the core and the periphery and secular stagnation in the Eurozone|In this paper, we provide empirical evidence about the widening divergence between the macroeconomic performances of core eurozone countries and peripheral economies. We note that, while core economies operate close to full employment, there are evident signs of secular stagnation, i.e. widespread long-term unemployment and reduced growth potential, in the periphery. In such a context, we stress that the unconventional monetary policy implemented by the European Central Bank since 2015 has proved largely ineffective to stimulate investment demand and economic recovery in the periphery. More than this, it may even deepen the existing gap between core and peripheral countries. We suggest that a reform of EU industrial policy, which put emphasis on the productive development of underdeveloped regions in the euro area, stands out as the best strategy against the eurozone core-periphery divide and for improving the functioning and effectiveness of EU macro policies.
O52|Technological Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Productivity in Germany, 1871-2015|Entrepreneurship in Germany has been stagnating. As a result, the effectiveness of technological innovation to improve labor productivity weakened, which has been implicated in rising income inequality and poverty. In this paper we provide an overview of technological innovation and labor productivity growth from 1871. From this we show that over the past three decades the economy has found it increasingly difficult to transform technological innovation into labor productivity growth: in glaring contrast to earlier periods. Despite higher spending on R&D and more personnel than ever working in research labs, labor productivity growth continues to decline. Two interrelated reasons are offered for this phenomenon. The first is that the national innovation system itself has certain weaknesses. The second is entrepreneurial stagnation. We discuss the weaknesses of the innovation system and the nature and causes of entrepreneurial stagnation. We call for policies that will improve the innovation system, educational and managerial capabilities, venture capital investments, and the contestability of markets. Strengthening social protection and raising real wages are important supportive measures.
O52|What Happened to CIT collection? Solving the Rates-Revenues Puzzle|Despite sharp reductions in corporate income tax (CIT) rates worldwide, CIT revenues have not fallen dramatically in the last two decades. This paper investigates the recent developments in CIT in the European Union, by taking a closer look at the potential driving forces behind this puzzle. Using a unique dataset of national sectoral accounts, we decompose the CIT revenue to GDP ratio for the EU and find that while the decrease in the statutory rates has driven down tax collection, the effect was more than offset by a broadening of the taxable base and a slight increase in the size of the corporate sector. However, this result holds for the period 1995-2015 but not for the last decade where base broadening has not been able to match further cuts in rates.
O52|Strong Growth Amid Increased Negative Risks|The outlook for growth in CESEE remains generally positive, but downside risks have increased significantly since our last forecast. The main areas of concern are the developing US-China trade war and the potential for a renewed outbreak of the eurozone crisis.
O52|Riding the Global Growth Wave|Aggregate real GDP growth in CESEE is at its strongest level for six years, and in 2017 all economies in the region expanded for the first time in a decade. External conditions are highly supportive of growth in CESEE. All the big engines of the global economy – the US, China and the eurozone – are expanding strongly together for the first time since 2010. The coordinated global upswing has further to run, and we expect CESEE economies to continue to benefit in the coming years. EU-CEE and Turkey will grow strongly during our forecast period, while activity in the Western Balkans will pick up from recent years. The CIS and Ukraine will remain the regional laggards, but will continue to recover slowly. We do not think that any economy in the region is ‘overheating’, although there are growing risks in Romania and Turkey. We expect inflation to remain very subdued in most of CESEE during the forecast period. In parts of CESEE, large-scale Ukrainian migration is helping to relieve labour market tightness. Wage increases in most of CESEE have been strong, but are concentrated largely in the manufacturing sector, and have been more than offset by rising labour productivity and non-price competitiveness. External competitiveness is not in danger. Across the region, investment will rise faster than headline real GDP growth in 2018-2020, driven by low interest rates, high capacity utilisation, stronger confidence, EU funds and still low base effects. Most countries have seen their export/GDP shares rise in the past decade, which increases their ability to take advantage of the current upswing. Many are moving up the value chain. Banking sectors in CESEE are generally on a much stronger footing than a few years ago. However, the old pre-crisis, highly leveraged model reliant on foreign inflows is mostly a thing of the past, meaning that credit growth will be relatively low by historical standards in the coming years. Downside risks to regional growth emanating from local and global factors are significant. In particular, we are worried about a trade war, the exit of major central banks from extraordinarily loose monetary policy, pockets of high corporate and government leverage, east/west EU splits, the undermining of institutional independence in some countries, geopolitical tensions, the Ukraine crisis, and potential spill-overs from a renewed outbreak of volatility in the eurozone, or a Chinese debt crisis. Convergence with Western European income levels will proceed in the long term. However, there is a risk that specialisation in parts of the supply chain where little value is created will condemn the region to a permanent ‘semi-periphery trap’.
O52|MOSOE: Konjunkturzenit überschritten|This publication is available in German language only. For a brief English summary see further below. MOSOE Konjunkturzenit überschritten Die jüngsten Statistiken deuten auf ein weiterhin robustes BIP-Wachstum in den meisten Ländern Mittel‑, Ost- und Südosteuropas (MOSOEL) hin. Der konjunkturelle Höhepunkt scheint allerdings bereits überschritten zu sein. Einerseits lässt die Dynamik der privaten Konsumnachfrage leicht nach, andererseits dämpft die Konjunkturabkühlung im Euro-Raum die Exportentwicklung vieler MOSOEL. Die Investitionen steigen weiterhin kräftig an, getrieben in erster Linie von EU-Transfers in der EU-MOE-Region und von ausländischen Direktinvestitionen im Westbalkan. Ein deutlicher Wachstumseinbruch ist heuer nur in Rumänien und der Türkei zu erwarten – Ländern, deren Wirtschaft sich bislang in einem Zustand der „Überhitzung“ befand. Vor dem Hintergrund der österreichischen EU-Ratspräsidentschaft und divergierender Handelspolitiken der weltgrößten Volkswirtschaften werden auch die immer engeren wirtschaftlichen Verflechtungen Österreichs mit den MOSOEL analysiert. Insbesondere die Visegrád-Staaten gewinnen für den österreichischen Güterhandel, Tourismus und auch als Investitionsstandorte an Gewicht. Österreich präsentiert sich als Top-10-Exportdestination für sieben der MOSOEL, für acht zählt es zu den zehn wichtigsten Ländern für Importe, und für siebzehn Länder rangiert Österreich unter den Top-10-Investoren. Ausgewählte Indikatoren zu den österreichischen Wirtschaftsbeziehungen mit den MOSOEL können kostenlos über interaktive Visualisierungen erkundet werden. English Summary CESEE Growth has passed its peak The latest statistics point to ongoing robust GDP growth in most countries of Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE). However, the growth peak seems to have already been passed. On the one hand, private consumer demand is weakening slightly; on the other hand, the economic slowdown in the eurozone is dampening the export performance of many CESEE countries. Investment continues to grow strongly, driven primarily by EU transfers in the EU-CEE and by foreign direct investment in the Western Balkans. A significant slump in growth this year can only be expected in Romania and Turkey, countries whose economies have been ‘overheating’. In the context of the Austrian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and diverging trade policies of the two largest economies in the world, we analyse the deepening economic relations between Austria and the CESEE countries. The Visegrád states in particular are gaining weight for Austrian trade in goods, tourism and as FDI destinations. From the perspective of CESEE, Austria represents a top 10 export destination for seven countries, a top 10 source country for imports for eight countries and a top 10 investor for even seventeen countries in the region.

O52|Factors driving wealth inequality in European countries|The Effect of Inheritance and Gifts on Household Net Wealth Distribution Analysed by Applying the Shapley Value Approach to Decomposition This paper analyses how microeconomic factors drive inequality in household wealth across nine European countries when applying the Shapley value approach to decomposition. The research draws on micro data from the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey 2014. Disparity in inheritance and gifts obtained by households are found to have a considerable effect on wealth inequality that is on average stronger than that of income differences and other factors. In Austria, Germany, France, Portugal and Spain, the contribution of real and financial assets received as bequests or inter vivos transfers attains more than 30% to explained wealth inequality. The distribution of household characteristics (age, education, size, number of adults and children in the household, marital status) within countries however also shapes the observed wealth dispersion. The results resemble those obtained in a similar study (Leitner, 2016) based on data from the first wave of the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS 2010).<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O52|Product market integration in the Euro area|The goal of this paper is to determine if the euro area (EA) accession and membership had a significant impact on the product market integration in the EA countries. The paper employs LM and RALS-LM unit root tests with two breaks on the seasonally adjusted monthly Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), from 1996:01 to 2017:05. We find EA-accession related breaks in most of the EA11 countries, but, apart from Malta, no such breaks for the later-EA-joiners. However, EA formation had a significant impact on both EA and non-EA countries at that time. We also find greater product market integration and less adverse effects after negative shocks in the EA member countries. However, based on unit root analysis, we find that EA membership in not a sufficient condition for product market integration and integration is not necessarily related to being an EA member.
O52|Revisiting Public Support for the Euro, 1999-2017: Accounting for the Crisis and the Recovery|This paper explores the evolution and determinants of public support for the euro since its creation in 1999 until the end of 2017, thereby covering the pre-crisis experience of the euro, the crisis years and the recent recovery. Using uniquely large macro and micro databases and applying up-to-date econometric techniques, we revisit the growing literature on public support for the euro. First, we find that a majority of respondents support the euro in nearly all 19 euro area member states. Second, we offer fresh evidence that economic factors are the main determinants of changes in the level of support for the euro: crisis reduces support while periods of recovery bode well for public support. This result holds for both macroeconomic and microeconomic factors. Turning to a broad set of socio-economic variables, we find clear differences in support due to education and perceptions of economic status.
O52|Financial realities for farms in the European Union: Relationships between farming and governmental interactions within the Triple Helix concept|The objective of this study is to analyse the financial realities for the farming sector in European Union countries and their relationships with agricultural investment and public structural subsidies, from a perspective of farming- and governmental relationships as part of the Triple Helix approach. Firstly, the statistical information available within the Farm Accountancy Data Network for the former twenty seven European Union countries, related with the main items of the accounting balance sheet was investigated. Secondly, various financial indicators were calculated to analyse the principal financial constraints in these farms and finally, these findings with the levels of investment and structural support were reported. As a main conclusion, more adjusted structural policies in the European Union will be needed, taking these microeconomic contexts into account.
O52|Vorschläge des französischen Staatspräsidenten Emmanuel Macron zur Reform der Europäischen Union|Der französische Staatspräsident Emmanuel Maron hat in einer Grundsatzrede an der Pariser Sorbonne-Universität im September 2017 Vorschläge zur Reformierung der Europäischen Union unterbreitet. Die Reformvorschläge umfassen die folgenden sechs Schlüsselbereiche: 1. Ein Europa, das Sicherheit in all ihren Dimensionen gewährleistet, 2. Ein Europa, das auf die Herausforderung der Migration reagiert, 3. Ein Europa, dessen Blick auf Afrika und den Mittelmeerraum gerichtet ist, 4. Europa als Vorbild für nachhaltige Entwicklung, 5. Ein Europa der Innovation und der Regulierung, die an die digitale Welt angeknüpft sind, 6. Europa als Wirtschafts- und Währungsmacht. EU-Kommissionspräsident Jean-Claude Juncker hat sich den Vorschlägen weitgehend angeschlossen und diese noch erweitert, indem er für den sechsten Schlüsselbereich neben der Fortentwicklung des Europäischen Stabilitätsmechanismus zu einem Europäischen Währungsfonds und der Einrichtung eines Eurozonenbudgets nebst EU-Finanzminister ein Euro-Vorbeitrittsinstrument für die Mitgliedstaaten fordert, die den Euro noch nicht als Währung eingeführt haben. Die vorgenannten Reformvorschläge werden im nachfolgenden Beitrag einer näheren rechtlichen Betrachtung unterzogen, um zu klären, in welcher Form diese umgesetzt werden könnten.
O52|Ökonomische Effekte der Deregulierung der Handwerksordnung im Jahr 2004|Die deutsche Handwerksordnung regelt die Unternehmensgründung in handwerklichen Berufen durch die Vorgabe verpflichtender Qualifikationsstandards. Im Jahr 2004 wurde der Marktzugang im Handwerk durch eine Novellierung der Handwerksordnung dereguliert, sodass für mehr als die Hälfte aller Handwerksberufe seitdem keine Meisterpflicht mehr gilt. Seit der Reform wird eine politische und wissenschaftliche Diskussion zu den einzel- und gesamtwirtschaftlichen Effekten dieser Deregulierung geführt. Fast fünfzehn Jahre nach der Deregulierung können aus den bisherigen Studien grundlegende Effekte abgeleitet werden und Forschungslücken definiert werden, um die weitere wirtschaftspolitische Diskussion wissenschaftlich zu fundieren. Der vorliegende Artikel fasst dafür die theoretischen Grundpositionen und die empirischen Studien zur Entwicklung des deutschen Handwerkssektors nach der Deregulierung zusammen und formuliert anschließend zu schließende Forschungslücken zur umfassenden wirtschaftspolitischen Bewertung der Handwerksreform.
O52|On the future of the European Union: Normative derivation and restructuring potential in the new Multiannual Financial Framework|The debate concerning the future of the EU has been in full swing ever since Emmanuel Macron’s (2017) Sorbonne speech. New threats to internal and external security in Europe require a stronger EU. In addition, Brexit is ripping a hole in the EU finances. This pressure for reform must be used to establish new priorities in the EU budget when discussions are held about the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027. The European Commission has put forward different options for consideration as part of the discussion process, and this study is based on them. It takes the form of a normative review of EU tasks, which has two evaluation criteria: Firstly, there will be a discussion concerning which political areas should be the responsibility of the EU, and which of the member states. Cross-border spillover effects, economies of scale, preference differences and the subsidiarity principle, all have an important role to play when assessing EU added value on the basis of existing criteria and studies. Secondly, various policy fields will be examined to establish whether, and to what extent, they meet Musgrave's three criteria of public finance policy: allocation/growth, distribution/structural change cushioning, macro-economic stabilisation.

O52|Neue Prioritäten für die Europäische Union: Normative Ableitung und Umschichtungspotenzial im neuen mehrjährigen Finanzrahmen|Neue Gefährdungen bei innerer und äußerer Sicherheit in Europa erfordern eine stärkere EU. Zudem reißt der Brexit eine Lücke in die EU-Finanzen. Dieser Reformdruck muss in der Diskussion über den nächsten Mehrjährigen Finanzrahmen (MFR) 2021-2027 dazu genutzt werden, die Prioritäten im EU-Haushalt neu zu ordnen. Die EU-Kommission hat hierzu verschiedene Optionen in den Raum gestellt, die mit zwei Bewertungsmaßstäben normativ bewertet werden: Erstens wird erörtert, welche Politikbereiche von der EU und welche von den Mitgliedstaaten erfüllt werden sollen. Bei der Prüfung auf einen EU-Mehrwert auf Basis bestehender Kriterien und Studien spielen grenzüberschreitende Spillover, Skaleneffekte und Präferenzunterschiede sowie das Subsidiaritätsprinzip eine wichtige Rolle. Zweitens werden zahlreiche Politikbereiche daraufhin untersucht, ob und in welchem Maß sie die drei Musgraveschen Funktionen der Finanzpolitik erfüllen: Allokation/Wachstum, Distribution/Strukturwandelabfederung, makroökonomische Stabilisierung. Dabei ergibt sich folgende ordnungspolitische Einordnung wichtiger Politikbereiche: Im Bereich Sicherheit - vor allem bei Verteidigungspolitik, Außengrenzensicherung und Terrorbekämpfung - sind EU-Kompetenzen klar begründbar, wenn die EU aus allokativer Sicht öffentliche Güter erbringen. Hier sind im EU-Haushalt deutlich mehr Mittel nötig. In den Bereichen Forschung, Bildung, Infrastruktur und Digitalisierung können gezielte staatliche Ausgaben zwar grundsätzlich das Wachstumspotenzial fördern. Jedoch ist dies primär Aufgabe der Mitgliedstaaten. Eine EU-Kompetenz ist aber begründbar, wenn hinreichende grenzüberschreitende Spillover bestehen. Diese zukunftsorientierten Aufgaben sollten im EU-Haushalt bei grenzüberschreitender Relevanz deutlich aufgestockt werden. Bei der Agrar- und Kohäsionspolitik fällt das Urteil überwiegend kritisch aus. Bei Agrarsubventionen hat die EU weder klar nachweisbare Kompetenzen noch lassen sie sich hinreichend mit den Musgrave-Funktionen rechtfertigen. Auch bei der Kohäsionspolitik für wohlhabendere Regionen ist eine Kompetenz der EU nicht stichhaltig begründbar. Daher sollte die hochdotierte Agrar- und Kohäsionspolitik depriorisiert werden. Durch Umschichtungen sind große Hebel verfügbar. Mit einer rund 2-prozentigen Einsparung könnten alternativ das Programm Erasmus+ verdoppelt, die Ausgaben für grenzüberschreitende Infrastruktur um die Hälfte erhöht oder die von der EU-Kommission vorgeschlagenen zusätzliche Verteidigungsausgaben finanziert werden. Für eine Finanzierung aller hier als prioritär identifizierten Aufgabenposten wäre in einer moderaten Variante nur eine Kürzung der Agrar- und Kohäsionsausgaben von weniger als 12 Prozent im neuen MFR nötig, wenn man ein nominales Wirtschaftswachstum von gut 28 Prozent innerhalb von sieben Jahren annimmt. Die EU-Kommission sollte daher noch mutiger bei ihren Reformvorschlägen sein. Die Bundesregierung mindert den Reformdruck, indem sie schon frühzeitig höhere EU-Beiträge in Aussicht stellt, und ihr fehlt offensichtlich der Mut für eine grundlegende Reform der Agrar- und Kohäsionspolitik.
O52|"Schriftliche Stellungnahme zu einer öffentlichen Anhörung des Bundestagsausschuss für die Angelegenheiten der Europäischen Union - zu der Mitteilung der Europäischen Kommission ""Weitere Schritte zur Vollendung der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion Europas: Ein Fahrplan"" (Ratsdokument 15653/17)"|"Die EU-Kommission hat verschiedene Vorschläge für Reformen der Wirtschaft- und Währungsunion vorgelegt. Während manche Ideen mehr politisch motiviert zu sein scheinen oder anreizspezifische Probleme mit sich bringen, gibt es durchaus Reformvorschläge, die sich ökonomisch begründen lassen und zur gesamteuropäischen Risikominderung beitragen können. Eine Mittelaufstockung für technische Hilfen zur Umsetzung von Strukturreformen ist grundsätzlich zu begrüßen. Eine reine Subventionierung solcher Reformen - nach dem Prinzip ""Geld gegen Reformen"" - droht hingegen starke Mitnahmeeffekte zu erzeugen und das Subsidiaritätsprinzip zu missachten. Dass mit der Schaffung einer neuen Konvergenzfazilität bei der Förderung von Strukturreformen ein besonderer Fokus auf Nicht-Eurostaaten gelegt werden sollte, ist nicht zu rechtfertigen. Die geplante makroökonomische Stabilisierungsfunktion zur Abmilderung der Wirkung asymmetrischer Schocks entbehrt auf europäischer Ebene einer zwingenden ökonomischen Notwendigkeit. Zwar erscheint der Ansatz grundsätzlich nachvollziehbar, dass ein möglicher Fonds nur Kredite vergeben, bei staatlichen Investitionen ansetzen und im EU-Haushalt eng gedeckelt bleiben würde. Doch besteht die Gefahr, dass die Mittelbereitstellung letztlich politischem Druck folgt und die avisierte Ex-ante-Konditionalität aufgeweicht wird. Daher ist dieser Vorschlag abzulehnen. Eine strategische Koordinationsfunktion könnte die EU bei der Organisation der Finanzierung von grenzüberschreitenden Investitionsprojekten einnehmen. Unterfinanzierte Infrastruktur in Grenzgebieten stellt noch immer ein wesentliches Hemmnis für die europaweite Verflechtung von Wertschöpfungsketten dar. Über Projektbonds könnte die Europäische Entwicklungsbank hier einen wichtigen Beitrag zur realen Konvergenz in Europa leisten."
O52|On the relevance and perspectives of commercial construction in the EU|This paper presents the current state of construction investments in the European Union and illustrates its development pre-, during and post- the recent economic and financial crisis. Construction investments were affected strongly by the economic turbulences caused by the crisis. In several EU member states construction investments are not yet back to pre-crisis levels. We further illustrate the importance of construction investments for the EU's gross fixed capital formation and in terms of gross domestic product. The analysis then presents potential challenges for the EU's construction sector. Based on the development of office employment in the past, and its current state, it is likely that demand for commercial construc-tion in the form of office buildings will increase in the future. In addition, infrastructure in-vestments must increase in order to meet the current and future needs.
O52|A proposal for a Brexit deal: Why a free trade area for goods is in the interest of the EU and how to achieve a sound balance of rights and obligations|In the political declaration of the Withdrawal Agreement the EU should leave the door open for a free trade area for goods that has been suggested by the UK's Chequers proposals. The EU would profit from such an arrangement due to its comparative advantage in goods. However, in order to achieve the EU's main objective to avoid bandwagon effects, such a trade agreement must not be depicted as a favourable deal for the UK. The narrative of the four freedoms is not indispensable to prevent bandwagon effects. A narrow interpretation can be even counterproductive, if the EU continues to regard a lesser degree of service trade integration (as suggested by the UK) as a key stumbling block for a free trade area for goods. On closer inspection, less service trade integration is not a real problem, because it would not lead to relevant competitive distortions as feared by the EU, as other areas like labour costs and social contributions are more relevant cost factors which are not (and should not) be harmonised in the EU. Moreover, the UK proposes to agree to binding rules to prevent distortions of a level playing field in terms of environmental regulations, state aid and competition policy. [...]
O52|Brexit: Was kommt auf die deutschen Unternehmen zu?|At present, it is difficult for German companies to foresee future trading conditions with the UK after the withdrawal from the EU. This IW report attempts an initial assessment in order to reduce planning uncertainty. Firstly, the focus is on the short-term effects of Brexit. Due to the devaluation of the British pound against the euro by more than 10 per cent after the Brexit referendum in June 2016, German merchandise exports to the UK plummeted, especially in the second half of 2016. Since exports have largely stabilised since then, the bulk of negative exchange rate effects seems to have been overcome...
O52|Inequality of educational opportunities and the role of learning intensity: Evidence from a quasi-experiment in Germany|Over the 2000s, many federal states in Germany shortened the duration of secondary school by one year while keeping the curriculum unchanged. Exploiting quasi-experimental variation due to the staggered introduction of this reform allows me to identify the causal effect of increased learning intensity on Inequality of Educational Opportunity (IEOp), the share in educational outcome variance explained by predetermined circumstances beyond a student's control. The reform-induced increase in learning intensity had no short-term effect on IEOp. In the medium term, however, IEOp increased as differences in parental resources gained importance through support opportunities like private tuition adapting to the intensified educational process. The effect is stronger for mathematics/science than for reading, implying the existence of subject-dependent curricular flexibilities. My findings point to the importance of accounting for distributional consequences when evaluating reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency of educational systems and to the role of learning intensity for explaining changes in educational opportunities influencing social mobility.
O52|Is there a Long-Term Relationship among European Sovereign Bond Yields?|The integration of financial markets has been a recurring theme in academic and financial research. The majority of the literature has focused on equity markets. Literature on the integration of international bond markets is not as common, specifically regarding that of European bonds since the beginning of the common currency area in 1999. This paper estimates a fixed effects pooled model and then proceeds to undertake panel unit root and cointegration tests to determine the degree of co-movement of European sovereign bond yields. The reported estimates suggest that yields move together over time, thus the benefits of diversification in European government bond portfolios may be limited. The results also have important implications for monetary policy. Given that economic shocks (e.g. inflationary shocks) are transmitted quickly from country to country, then it will complicate the task of monetary policy when it comes to pursuing an independent policy with respect to domestic monetary conditions in the presence of asymmetric economic shocks.
O52|Seeking price and macroeconomic stabilisation in the euro area: The role of house prices and stock prices|We propose an Economic Stability Index (ESI) incorporating house prices and stock prices as components of the measure of the inflation rate in order to allow the European Central Bank (ECB) to achieve both price and macroeconomic stability. We use an optimisation approach to estimate target weights for different sectoral prices in the broader price index, which depend on sectoral parameters other than those used to compute the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices applied by the ECB to gauge price stability in the euro area (EA). Our results suggest that if the ECB had targeted the ESI, it would have implemented a different monetary policy which would had increased stability in the EA’s economic activity and would have helped to create adequate preconditions for sustainable economic growth and job creation.
O52|Nonfinancial debt and economic growth in euro-area countries|In this paper, we analyse the effects of all sources of nonfinancial debt (household, corporate as well as government) accumulation on economic growth in ten euro-area countries during the 1980–2015 period. To this end, we make use of three models (a baseline, an asymmetric and a threshold model) based on the empirical growth literature augmented by debt. By exploring the time series dimension in order to properly account for the historical experience of each country in the sample, we aim to detect potential heterogeneities in the relationship across euro-area economies. Our findings suggest that while public debt thresholds are higher in peripheral than in central countries, private debt thresholds are higher in core euro-area countries. Moreover, while a reduction in nonfinancial corporations’ and public debt has a negligible effect on growth, the response is very relevant in the case of households but clearly differs across countries (the average impact being higher in peripheral than in central countries). Therefore, according to our results, peripheral countries especially should be aware of the adverse consequences of private debt accumulation and a reduction in households’ debt in those countries may be crucial to stimulate consumption and growth.
O52|Public Debt and Economic Growth: Further Evidence for the Euro Area|This paper empirically investigates the short and the long run impact of public debt on economic growth. We use annual data from both the central and the peripheral countries of the euro area (EA) for the 1961–2013 period and estimate a production function augmented with a debt stock term by applying the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach. Our results suggest different patterns across the EA countries and tend to support the view that public debt always has a negative impact on the long-run performance of EA member states, whilst its short-run effect may be positive depending on the country.
O52|Cyclicality of the R&D Share of Investment in the EU over the Period before and after the Crisis|In this paper we investigate the co-movements between the R&D share of total investment and GDP growth in different EU areas over the period 1999-2014. Our empirical analysis shows that only core countries display a common counter-cyclical mechanism leading to an increased share of R&D over prolonged downturns. The lack of any counter-cyclical pattern of R&D share over the evolution of GDP growth in periphery countries makes this area highly vulnerable to persistent recessions, with potentially harmful consequences for longer term growth. For recent EU members the evidence of R&D share pro-cyclicality should be evaluated in the light of the catching-up process still at work in this area. Our analysis suggests that any successful EU innovation policy should not disregard the potential divergence in R&D performance due to the dispersion of the counter-cyclical properties of the share of productivity enhancing activities in the different EU areas.
O52|Is Innovation Destroying Jobs? Firm-Level Evidence from the EU|Using a unique firm-level database comprising the top European R&D investors over the period 2002–2013 and running LSDVC estimates, this study finds a significant labor-friendly impact of R&D expenditures. However, this positive employment effect appears limited in magnitude and entirely due to the medium- and high-tech sectors, while no effect can be detected in the low-tech industries. From a policy point of view, this outcome supports the EU2020 strategy but—taking into account that most European economies are specialized in low-tech activities—is also worrying in terms of future perspectives of the European labor market.
O52|Institutional diversity in the Euro area : Any evidence of convergence?|The institutional characteristics of the 19 Euro countries, such as Government efficiency or undue influence or corporate ethics, have diverged in the period 2006-2015. This endangers the sustainability of the EMU, as institutional characteristics are an important element of competitiveness. We find that the overall inequality in the state of institutions across the EMU, as measured by the Gini coefficient, increased. The institutional changes across Euro area countries are linked both to the differences in the intensity of the financial and economic crisis (likely to have a two-way causality) as well as the policy responses in terms of fiscal consolidation applied. The empirical findings tend to support the call for structural reforms enhancing institutional quality in order to shorten the institutional gap between 'core' and 'periphery' Euro area countries.
O52|CESEE Back on Track to Convergence|GDP forecasts for 2017 have been revised upwards for all Central and East European EU Member States (EU-CEE). Farther east, especially in Russia, but also in the Western Balkans, the post-crisis recovery has been much weaker. Private consumption is the main growth driver, underpinned by rising wages and household incomes. Nonetheless, CESEE labour cost competitiveness is not yet endangered. Gradually, along with expanding private consumption, investments have also gained strength and have increasingly emerged as a driver of growth. Trade balances have improved, and many EU-CEE countries (as well as Russia) also report current account surpluses. Growth is thus becoming broader based, more robust, and probably also more sustainable. Improvements in labour markets are spectacular, with rising employment levels mirrored by declining unemployment. Simultaneously, emerging labour shortages are acting as a potential constraint on future growth. In terms of current GDP growth prospects, the CESEE region is split into three sub-regions the EU-CEE, with average annual growth close to 4% in the forecasting period; the Western Balkans, with GDP growing by around 3% per year; and finally, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Ukraine, where growth will be around 2% annually in the medium term. The EU-CEE region is thus catching up again with Western Europe, and the process of economic convergence has resumed at a greater pace than previously expected. This catching-up process will continue probably for the rest of the decade. Importantly, economic convergence is not expected to resume in Russia, where the lack of structural change, lasting investment climate deficiencies and geopolitical conflicts impose a burden on growth. Meagre growth in Russia adversely affects the growth prospects of her CIS partners. But there are several other CESEE countries where recent political developments are not very conducive to growth and European integration in the medium term. However, for the moment, economic growth seems to be unaffected by domestic political instability. Globally, economic resilience persists, regardless of the elevated geopolitical risks. The Forecast Report also includes three special topics (on income convergence with Western Europe, on euro accession and on higher yields on hard currency sovereign debt in CESEE). The key findings of these reports are Convergence in terms of per capita GDP levels in CESEE is a long-term process; by 2050, most of the region will only have bridged half the current gap with the EU-28 level; during the next decade, no country in the region will catch up with average EU-28 wealth levels, and advanced EU-CEE countries like Poland and Hungary will not even reach the 80% mark. Despite sustained criticism since its inception, the euro may yet survive and attract new members in the EU-CEE; it is in the interests of Croatia and Bulgaria to join, and is potentially advantageous for Hungary and Poland; the case is less clear cut for the Czech Republic and Romania, although in neither case would accession be harmful. Many CESEE sovereigns are not in a markedly better shape to deal with a sharp rise in debt yields than they were 10 years ago, and in some cases they are in a worse position; for countries with heavy debt loads and little apparent prospect of achieving high and sustained growth, bond markets could panic, leading to funding difficulties; Ukraine stands out as particularly vulnerable from a sovereign risk perspective, while we conclude that Belarus and many countries in the Western Balkans are also in a weak position.
O52|Cautious Upturn in CESEE: Haunted by the Spectre of Uncertainty|Summary Growth in the CESEE economies will strengthen gradually, surpassing on average 3% by 2019. This growth will be driven by consumption and increasing investment, amid a largely supportive international economic environment. Despite a rise in ULCs, competitiveness will not be endangered. Although the size of labour forces in CESEE is stagnating, data indicate an improvement in educational levels of workers. Meanwhile the tightness of labour markets will propel wage growth. The CESEE region as a whole is back on a convergence track, with an average positive growth differential of 1.2 pp vis-à-vis the euro area over the forecast horizon. Downside risks are significant, mostly stemming from political factors. The CESEE countries and Europe more broadly, together with the rest of the world, will be haunted by the spectre of political uncertainty; it is only to be hoped that, once fully roused, the ‘animal spirits’ of economic agents will shrug off the gloom. For the economies of CESEE, the international economic environment appears generally positive. In 2017-2018, GDP growth in the euro area is expected to hover around 1.7%. The international financial markets have stabilised and the current economic mood is improving. Because of the global recovery, the US Fed is expected to increase interest rates further in 2017, while oil prices are likely to rise. In the EU, disbursements from the payments cycle of the European Structural and Investment Funds are only just beginning, indicating higher co-financed investments in the EU‑CEE countries from this year onwards. Over recent quarters, GDP growth throughout almost the entire CESEE region has stabilised in positive territory. The only exception is Belarus, where growth is still in negative territory (albeit less so than was the case in 2015). The country is going through a painful adjustment process triggered by accumulated macroeconomic imbalances and its excessive dependence on Russia. Current wiiw CESEE GDP growth forecasts for 2017-2019 point to growth of around 3% for most of the region, with a slightly upward trend. The EU-CEE sub-region and the Western Balkan economies in particular should manage to attain average GDP growth rates of up to 3% and in some countries, such as Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Albania and Kosovo, the levels may be even higher. In Turkey, where growth slowed down markedly in 2016 to below 2% (down from around 6% in prior years) on account of the domestic political turmoil and deterioration in foreign relations, we also expect growth to be closer to 3% by the end of the forecast horizon. The CIS-3 economies will record increasing GDP growth rates, rising from more than 1% in 2017 to over 2% in 2019, given the higher oil prices. Over the same forecast period, economic growth in Ukraine is projected to accelerate gradually to 3% by 2018-2019 – barring all-out warfare in Donbas and abortion of the IMF programme. Private consumption and increasing investment will continue to be the main growth drivers over the forecast horizon. After the investment slump in 2016 attributable to the switch from the previous to the current EU (co-) financing period, investment in the EU-CEE economies will recover in the years ahead. Meanwhile the mood among consumers is improving and, due to changing spending patterns in the EU-CEE sub-region, this trend should prove durable. Tightening labour markets are conducive to major wage increases. Despite the general rise in unit labour costs, competitiveness does not seem to be endangered. Most of the latest industrial production figures for the CESEE countries are encouraging; they point to an ongoing improvement in industry structure and, in several cases, to re-industrialisation. Longer-term FDI trends hold particular promise for the Western Balkans. In Romania and Slovakia the prospects for future FDI increases are also quite good, especially in the automotive sector. Although the size of the labour force in CESEE countries is more or less stagnating, a marked improvement in education levels is evident, as a younger and better educated generation enters the work force. This hints at a potential general increase in labour quality across the region’s economies. Nevertheless, heightened uncertainties following the UK referendum on Brexit in June 2016 and the US presidential elections in November have cast a cloud over the improved economic conditions noted above. A number of worrying scenarios are quite conceivable that could ultimately make our forecasts appear upbeat and overoptimistic. Thanks to US President Donald Trump, a rise in global protectionism is possible, which would harm industry in the region. Mr Trump has also questioned post-war European security arrangements, thus causing consternation in some EU-CEE countries. Meanwhile, the growing irritation with the EU-CEE sub-region among some older EU Member States and the fallout from Brexit could possibly pose a threat to west-east fiscal transfers and the free movement of labour in their current forms. In the Western Balkans, any confrontational interventions by Russia and uncertainties as to developments in Turkey could prove quite disruptive, were the influence of the EU and USA in the region to decline. Increasing uncertainties in the CIS and Ukraine are mostly related to future commodity price developments (most importantly oil prices) and heightened geopolitical tensions. Three special sections of the forecast report shed more light on the issue of heightened uncertainties in the EU-CEE, the Western Balkans and the CIS+UA regions.
O52|Wirtschaftliche Konvergenz trotz politischer Unsicherheit|Zusammenfassung Wirtschaftliche Konvergenz trotz politischer Unsicherheit Das internationale Umfeld für die Wirtschaft der mittel-, ost- und südosteuropäischen Länder (MOSOEL) präsentiert sich als Kontrast zwischen wirtschaftlichem Aufschwung einerseits sowie politischer Unsicherheit und geopolitischen Spannungen andererseits. Kurzfristig setzen sich die positiven Effekte der wirtschaftlichen Erholung im Euroraum und der damit verbundenen Exporte, sowie des relativ niedrigen Ölpreises gegen mögliche negative Effekte politischer Turbulenzen durch. Gegenüber der wiiw-Frühjahrsprognose wurden die Wachstumsprognosen für die MOSOEL größtenteils nach oben auf 2,4% für das laufende Jahr und 2,6% für das Jahr 2018 korrigiert. English Summary Economic convergence despite political uncertainty The international environment for the economies in Central, East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) is characterised by a contrast between economic upswing, on the one hand, and political uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, on the other hand. In the short term, positive effects of the economic recovery in the euro area and related exports, as well as of the relatively low oil price are prevailing over potential negative effects of political turmoil. Compared with the wiiw Spring Forecast, growth projections for the CESEE region were for the most part revised upwards, to 2.4% and 2.6% for the years 2017 and 2018, respectively.
O52|Persistence and stochastic convergence of euro area unemployment rates: evidence from LM and RALS-LM unit root tests with breaks|The goal of this paper is to determine if the euro area (EUA) accession and membership had a significant impact on the unemployment rates of the EUA countries. The hypothesis of the paper is that there is unemployment hysteresis and EUA accession thus contributed to the economic integration and convergence of the unemployment rates in the EUA. The paper employs LM and RALS-LM unit root tests with two breaks to analyze the persistence, test the stochastic convergence and locate structural break(s) in the seasonally adjusted quarterly unemployment rates, covering the period from 1995q1 to 2016q2. The most interesting results are that: (i) there are EUA-related down breaks in unemployment rates with hysteresis, (ii) EUA-related breaks are followed by the periods of convergence to the EUA11 average, (iii) crisis-related breaks are followed by the periods of divergence and (iv) the EUA membership is not a sufficient condition for stochastic convergence.

O52|Treatment-Effect Identification Without Parallel paths An illustration in the case of Objective 1- Hainaut/Belgium, 1994-2006|Imagine a region that has a lower income per head than the rest of the territory, and becomes eligible for a generous EU-funded transfer programme (the treatment). The evaluation of the effectiveness of such a policy can rest on a difference-in-differences analysis (DiD); which in essence consists of comparing the income-level handicap before and after the treatment. Imagine that DiD shows that the handicap has not diminished, or even that it has risen. Most observers would conclude to the inefficiency of the policy. The point we raise in this paper is that second thoughts are needed, because DiD rests heavily on the validity of a key assumption: parallel paths in the absence of treatment. Without EU money the outcome difference between the treated and the controls should be time-invariant; so that any statistically significant change of that difference can be ascribed to the treatment. Parallel paths seems a priori unrealistic in the context of old industrial regions, as one of the reasons they become eligible for treatment is that their income-level handicap is on the rise. Also, from a methodological point of view, when more than one pre-treatment period is available in the data, the parallel-paths assumption can easily be abandoned in favour of more flexible assumptions as to the relative dynamics of treated vs. control entities. This paper illustrates the relevance this approach in the case of Objective 1-Hainaut; an EU-funded transfer policy implemented between 1994 and 2006 in Hainaut, the most economically-deprived province of Belgium; a former bastion of the country’s industrial revolution that has endured decades of decline.
O52|Warum so wenig genutzt? Nationale Hindernisse für eine grenzüberschreitende Patientenversorgung in der EU|Warum wissen so wenige Patienten, dass sie sich auch im EU-Ausland medizinisch behandeln lassen dürfen - zu den gleichen Konditionen wie im Inland und ohne zusätzliche Auslandskrankenversicherung? Und warum wird diese Möglichkeit bisher so wenig genutzt, obwohl die nationalen Gesundheitssysteme davon profitieren könnten? Denn Kostenvorteile, die aus einer medizinischen Behandlung der Patienten im EU-Ausland entstehen, kommen vollständig den inländischen Kostenträgern zugute. Der Grund ist nicht nur in Sprachbarrieren oder Verwaltungsprozessen zu suchen. Denn die Gesundheitssysteme der Mitgliedstaaten sind bisher stark national ausgerichtet. Es finden sich einige Organisationsformen und Gestaltungselemente, die sich im Zusammenspiel mit dem EU-Regelwerk negativ auswirken - beispielsweise die Nutzung von impliziten Rationierungsstrategien oder die Steuerfinanzierung medizinischer Infrastruktur. Um das Potenzial auszuschöpfen, das der gemeinsame Binnenmarkt für das Gesundheitswesen bietet, bedarf es daher eines Umdenkens in der nationalen Gesundheitspolitik. Die gegenwärtige Organisation des jeweiligen Gesundheitssystems ist dahingehend zu überprüfen, ob sie mit einem gemeinsamen Markt vereinbar ist und gegebenenfalls dahingehend zu reformieren. Denn insbesondere der demografischen Wandel, der viele EU-Mitgliedstaaten betrifft, macht es notwendig, das Gesundheitswesen effizient zu gestalten, um eine nachhaltige medizinische Versorgung auf hohem Niveau sicherstellen zu können. Vor diesem Hinter-grund sollten auch die Möglichkeiten genutzt werden, die der gemeinsame Binnenmarkt bietet. Die grenzüberschreitende Versorgung bietet hierzu bislang nicht ausgeschöpfte Potenziale.
O52|Wie tragfähig sind die Staatsschulden der vormaligen Krisenländer in Südeuropa? Analyse und Empfehlungen|Können die Staatsschulden Italiens, Spaniens und von Portugal auch dann noch als tragfähig erachtet werden, wenn das Zinsniveau wieder steigt und eine gemäßigte Rezession zu verkraften ist? Dieser Report kommt zu einem differenzierten Ergebnis für den Betrachtungszeitraum bis 2022, das von den Annahmen in drei relativ realistischen Szenarien abhängig ist. Einerseits bleiben die Staatsschuldenquoten nicht nur im verhalten pessimistischen Szenario (mit einer kurzen Rezession im Jahr 2019) hoch. Auch im Basisszenario (mit eher konservativen Annahmen) sinken sie in Italien kaum sowie in Portugal und Spanien nur in begrenztem Ausmaß. Lediglich im verhalten optimistischen Szenario erfolgt der Abbau der Staatsschuldenquoten etwas schneller. Doch auch hier würde es bei Italien und Portugal deutlich länger als bis zum Jahr 2022 dauern, bis die Marke von 100 Prozent des BIP unterschritten wird. Andererseits laufen die Staatsschuldenquoten unter den gewählten Annahmen, auch im eher pessimistischen Szenario, nicht aus dem Ruder. Wichtige Voraussetzung hierfür ist, dass die Fiskalpolitik vor allem in Italien (etwas abgeschwächt auch in Portugal und Spanien) mit moderatem Sparkurs auf eine schlechte wirtschaftliche Entwicklung reagiert. Die Höhe des zur Stabilisierung nötigen Primärüberschusses liegt mit unter 3 Prozent des BIP in einem durchaus erreichbaren Bereich. Daher besteht bei einem gewöhnlichen Konjunkturverlauf und normaler Politikreaktion kein Anlass für die Finanzmärkte, die Schuldenlasten als nicht tragfähig zu betrachten. Diese verhalten optimistische Einschätzung gilt freilich nicht, wenn es zu einer tieferen Krise, zu sich selbst erfüllenden Prophezeiungen am Finanzmarkt oder zu einer populistisch motivierten Verweigerung der nötigen Konsolidierung kommt.

O52|Bargeld quo vadis?|Nachdem eine Bargeldabschaffung schon vor längerem u.a. von Wissenschaftsvertretern wie Rogoff, Summers und Bofinger diskutiert und im Ergebnis befürwortet wurde, scheint das Thema aufgrund aktueller Entwicklungen sowie bereits vollzogener Maßnahmen verstärkt in Wissenschaft und Praxis angekommen zu sein, wo es kontrovers diskutiert wird. Dabei werden sowohl für als auch gegen Abschaffung bzw. Beschränkung des Bargeldes gewichtige Gründe ins Feld geführt. Aufgrund der großen Aktualität und Relevanz der Thematik wird sie zuerst aus theoretischer Sicht beleuchtet, bevor empirische Entwicklungen aufgezeigt, sowie die gegensätzlichen Argumentationslinien der Befürworter und Gegner einer Abschaffung bzw. Beschränkung des Bargeldes sowie bereits veränderte institutionelle Rahmenbedingungen dargestellt und bewertet werden.
O52|The Roots of a Dual Equilibrium: GDP, Productivity and Structural Change in the Italian Regions in the Long-run (1871-2011)|"This paper explores the evolution of Italy's regional inequality in the long run, from around Unification (1871) until our days (2011). To this scope, a unique and up-to-date dataset of GDP per capita, GDP per worker (productivity) and employment, at the NUTS II level and at current borders, for the whole economy and its three branches - agriculture, industry, services - is here presented and discussed. Sigma and beta convergence are tested for GDP per capita, productivity and workers per capita (employment/population). Four phases in the history of regional inequality in post-unification Italy are confronted: mild divergence (the liberal age), strong divergence (the two world wars and Fascism), general convergence (the golden age) and the ""two-Italies"" polarization. In this last period, for the first time GDP and productivity, as well as workers per capita and productivity, have been following opposite paths: the North-South divide increased in GDP, decreased in productivity."
O52|Real Estate and Corporate Investmeent: Theory and Evidence of Heterogeneous Effects Across Firms|in this paper, we investigate the effect of real estate prices on productive investment. We build a simple theoretical framework of firms’ investment with credit rationing and real estate collateral. We show that real estate prices affect firms’ borrowing capacities through two channels. An increase in real estate prices raises the value of the firms’ pledgeable assets and mitigates the agency problem characterizing the creditor-entrepreneur relationship. It simultaneously cuts the expected profit due to the increase in the cost of inputs. While the literature only focuses on the first channel, the identification of the second channel allows for heterogeneous effects of real estate prices on investment across firms. We test our theoretical predictions using a large French database. We do find heterogeneous effects of real estate prices on productive investment depending on the position of the firms in the sectoral distributions of real estate holdings. Our preferred estimates indicate that a 10% increase in real estate prices causes a 1% decrease in the investment rate of firms in the first decile of the distribution but a 6% increase in the investment rate of firms belonging to the last decile.
O52|Adjustment Costs and Factor Demand: New Evidence From Firms’ Real Estate|Adjustment costs impair the optimal allocation of production factor across firms. In this paper, we use the cost associated with corporate relocation to explore the effect of the adjustment costs of the premises size on factor demand. We rely on the tax on realized capital gains on real estate asset, which entails varying real estate adjustment costs across firms, to empirically study the effect of these frictions on firms' behaviour. We develop a general equilibrium model, with heterogeneous firms, that sheds light on the implication of the level of the fixed costs associated with the adjustment of real estate on the change in firms' labor demand following productivity shocks. This model predicts that employment growth of firms facing positive productivity shocks shrinks with the level of the frictions. Confronting these results using French firm-level data over the period 1994-2013, we find that higher adjustment costs constrain relocation and reduce job creation of the most dynamic firms. The highlighted frictions have noticeable macroeconomic effects.
O52|China's evolving monetary policy rule: from inflation-accommodating to anti-inflation policy|This paper aims to enhance the understanding of China's monetary policy rule since the mid-1990s, focusing on the role of inflation. It investigates the rule followed by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) by considering both the structural economic transformation of China and its evolving monetary policy framework. Our newly constructed monthly composite discrete monetary policy index (MPI), which combines price, quantity and administrative instruments, shows a change in style towards smoother but more contractionary policy moves from 2002 onwards. The estimation of a dynamic discrete-choice model à la Monokroussos (2011) implies that, from this point onwards, the conduct of monetary policy has been characterised by implicit inflation targeting. While the PBoC's behaviour up to 2001 was reminiscent of that in the inflation-accommodating G3 economies of the United States, euro area and Japan up to 1979, it has been characterized since 2002 by a policy rule similar to the post-1979 anti-inflation (forward-looking) policy of the G3. An accurate estimation of the monetary policy rule from 2002 needs to consider China as an open economy, as a result of its rapid liberalisation of trade and finance after its WTO accession. As such, the influence of US interest rates has become increasingly significant for Chinese monetary policy.
O52|The True Cost of BREXIT for the UK: A Research Note|The HM Treasury analysis (2016) of the long-term benefits of EU membership for the UK implicitly argues that the associated output loss of BREXIT is 10%, while Patrick Minford has argued that a 4% output increase could be expected. More recent analysis from Rabobank suggests an output loss of 18 % for the UK in the event of a ‘no-deal’ BREXIT. The subsequent rough estimate presented here shows that real national income is likely to fall by 16% in a no-deal BREXIT – where a 2% income gain from a possible US-UK transatlantic trade and investment partnership treaty and 1% gain resulting from zero tariffs on the import of agricultural products have been included. The cumulated income loss – based on a present value-analysis – is almost three times as large as the UK output decline during the Great Depression; however, the BREXIT-related output decline would be spread over a period of about 15 years. For the lower strata of society serious problems will emerge in such a setting; it is strange that the Remainers in the UK have almost no voice in terms of political party representation. As regards power in Brussels: based on Banzhaf values (game theory), the big countries in the EU will be the winners of BREXIT; even if Scotland joins later.
O52|Techno-Globalisierung, Leitmärkte und Strukturwandel in wirtschaftspolitischer Sicht|Die Globalisierung der Wirtschaftsbeziehungen – inklusive hat in Verbindung mit der Digitalisierung der Wirtschaft neuen Anpassungsdruck erzeugt. Mit der zunehmenden grenzüberschreitenden Entwicklung von Forschungsaktivitäten von multinationalen Unternehmen und der grenzüberschreitenden Kooperation forschender Firmen – der Technoglobalisierung – hat die Globalisierung der Wirtschaft eine zusätzliche Dimension entwickelt. Chinas ökonomischer Aufstieg sorgt dabei für globale Mehrnachfrage, aber auch eine verschärfte internationale Innovationskonkurrenz und zumindest zeitweise wurde u.a. von daher auch der Anreiz zu internationaler F&E-Kooperation gerade in OECD-Ländern gestärkt. Die Internationalisierung gibt einer internationalen Auswahl von Leitmärkten für Produktinnovationen neue Optionen und zugleich stellt sich die Frage, wie die Politik auf die veränderte Dynamik reagieren soll. Am Beispiel Österreichs sieht man mit Blick auf die Technoglobalisierung, dass auch kleine Länder durch gezielte Innovationsinternationalisierung via mehr Direktinvestitionen technologisch und ökonomisch aufholen können – ein möglicher Ansatzpunkt für eine neue Wachstumspolitik etwa der ostdeutschen Länder, aber auch von osteuropäischen EU-Beitrittsländern bietet sich an. Für Deutschlands westliche Bundesländer wäre eine stärkere Weltmarktorientierung und Fokussierung der Innovationsförderung wichtig, insbesondere in NRW. Eine Schwäche Deutschlands ist das Zurückhängen beim digitalen Breitbandausbau. Österreichs Probleme in der EU-Passivhaus-Vermarktung zeigen exemplarisch ökologisch-industriepolitische Defizite im EU-Binnenmarkt bzw. bei der EU-Leitmarktpolitik und der EU2020-Agenda. Innovationsorientierte Beschaffungsprogramme in EU-Ländern sind bislang wenig untersucht, dürften allerdings am ehesten in Verbindung mit Cluster-Initiativen erfolgversprechend sein. Technoglobalisierung erscheint als ein anhaltender Prozess, in den Deutschlands Wirtschaft eingebunden ist – mit besonderen Chancen, wenn es gelingt, mehr Hochtechnologiefirmen aus dem Ausland anzuziehen.
O52|The BREXIT Dynamics: British and EU27 Challenges after the EU Referendum|Summary: The BREXIT dynamics are considerable in a politico-economic perspective. The British referendum of June 23rd, 2016, was a disorderly one as the Cameron government did not include key information in the official government brochure sent to all households across the UK – a study by the Treasury had shown a 10 percent income decline as a consequence of a potential BREXIT, but in the 16-page information brochure distributed to all households/the electorate, this prognosis was not mentioned at all. EU immigration issues played a role not only under Cameron but also under the May government and in the UK government’s White Paper on exiting the EU, respectively. Key issues of BREXIT are related to the potential political instability in the EU. As regards the Global Britain approach of the May government, it is shown here that this is unlikely to work. EU27 reforms are quite important, without adequate reforms and much better leadership in Germany and other EU countries, there will be further disintegration in the EU.
O52|Industry in Britain - An Atlas|"Living near a productive company can have considerable economic benefits. It means the chance of well-paid jobs, creates opportunities for suppliers of goods and services, and can be a boost to local retailers. This common-sense economic logic explains why policymakers consistently worry about the uneven spread of industry in Britain and, from time to time, conclude that it inefficient and unfair and that something new must be done. Now is one of those moments, with the government shortly set to launch a new ""Industrial Strategy"" which looks likely to include a new approach to regional policy. But while there is agreement across Britain's political parties that the distribution of industry is a problem, little new analysis on the location and performance of British firms with an explicitly regional focus has been published recently. This paper, part of ongoing work on the economics of British industry at the LSE's Centre for Economic Performance, starts to fill that gap. We present maps and charts setting out the latest data on firm location, together with geographic measures of employment, productivity, and innovation. Ten stylised facts emerge from our analysis, many of which challenge the prevailing wisdom: Finance is far less London-centric than the creative industries; the South-East is not the country's productivity engine, rather a band stretching west from the capital towards Bristol is; the East of England stands out in terms of R&D intensity; and in addition to the North-South divide, disparities between coastal and inland areas are concerning. This clarification of the starting point is just the first step in a data-driven approach to industrial policy. Bigger questions—in particular analysis of the ideal spread of industry that policy should target, and the best tools to get there—loom large and also require new analysis."
O52|GDP Growth, Private Debt and Monetary Policy|Economic research has considered Private Debt a determinant of GDP growth for years. By keeping this perspective, the objective of this work is to understand how much of the GDP response to a monetary shock is due to the variation of private debt. This is the marginal contribution of private debt, which we relate to an increase of the aggregate demand. We study the USA, the UK and Germany in the period 1980q1-2015q4. Our approach is based on the comparison of one baseline structural VAR with one counterfactual for each country. The analysis is developed using the two main constituents of private debt: households and corporations debt.
O52|Efectos de la migración forzada sobre la confianza y las actitudes hacia inmigrantes en los países destino: evidencia de la crisis de refugiados en Europa|Este artículo estima el efecto de la llegada de refugiados sobre la confianza generalizada en Europa y sobre las actitudes hacia los inmigrantes en los países destino entre 2002 y 2015. Con base en datos recientes de la encuesta social de Europa (ESS, por sus siglas en inglés) y utilizando un enfoque de variable instrumental, se encuentra que un mayor flujo de refugiados afecta negativamente la confianza entre las personas, y que las actitudes que tienen las personas hacia los inmigrantes mejoran entre 2014 y 2015. Se encuentra evidencia de dos mecanismos detrás de los resultados: la incertidumbre laboral y el nivel educativo de las personas, lo cual refleja la percepción que tienen los residentes de los países destino sobre el impacto económico que pueden tener los refugiados. Los resultados encontrados en este documento son robustos a diferentes agrupaciones de la variable de interés, al nivel de actividad económica y a la inclusión de eventos terroristas que podrían afectar la confianza.
O52|The impact of state aid on the survival and financial viability of aided firms|We estimate the causal impact of restructuring aid granted by the European Commission between 2000 and 2012 on the survival and financial viability of aided firms. Using a comprehensive dataset we find that restructuring aid decreases the hazard rate of a market exit by 58–68% and increases firms’ average survival time by 8–15 years, depending on the definition of firm survival. We also find that aid receiving firms have a significantly higher probability to improve their financial viability than the counterfactual group in the longer run.
O52|Measuring Welfare Comparisons of EU Member States Before, During, and After the Financial Crisis: A Dominance Approach|How did the financial crisis affect population welfare in EU member states in key dimensions such as income, health, and education? We seek to answer this question by way of welfare comparisons between countries and within countries over time,using EU-SILC data. Our study is novel in using a multidimensional first order dominance comparison approach on the basis of multi-level ordinal data. We find that the countries most often dominated are southern and eastern European member states, and the dominant countries are mostly northern and western European member states. However, for most country comparisons, there is no dominance relationship. Moreover, only a few member states have experienced a temporal dominance improvement in welfare, while no member states have experienced a temporal dominance deterioration during the financial crisis.
O52|Det koster at være lille. Grønlands hjemtagelser 1980 til 1993 og smådriftsulemper (version 2)|After home rule in 1979 Greenland gradually takes over expenditure of general government from Denmark during the 1980ies. Step by step Denmark gives a subsidy to Greenland covering what were the Danish expenditures. Nearly the entire subsidy comes in four lumps, 1980, 1985, 1987 and 1992. Subsequently the subsidies have been regulated according to the increase in costs for the Danish general government in providing services. Supposing government expenditures being a constant fraction of GDP, we calculate what would have been the hypothetical Danish expenditures to the four areas and then compare these to the actual Greenlandic expenditures in 1994 and 2014. Actual expenditures are much higher than the projected Danish ones. Especially this is true for general public services and education where the level is more than twice the projection. The article’s point of view is that a large part of the overshooting is due to small scale diseconomies.
O52|The Political Economics of Growth, Labor Control and Coercion: Evidence from a Suffrage Reform|In this paper, we analyze how a suffrage reform in 1862/63 that shifted the de jure distribution of political power from landowners to industrialists affected Sweden’s industrialization and economic and social development from the 1860s to the 1910s. Using a newly constructed, comprehensive historical data set of the universe of approximately 2,400 Swedish local governments, we document that the change in suffrage affected a very large number of development and social outcomes at the local level, such as labor coercion, factor price manipulation in the form of entry barriers including investments in local public goods (i.e., schooling) and transportation (i.e., local railways), the real wage structure, technology adoption in both agriculture and industry, labor productivity in both agriculture and industry, changes in the composition of employment and the structure of production, demographic transition, organized labor, and persistence in dysfunctional local political institutions. Our findings are consistent with the idea that political institutions are a key determinant of long-run development and growth. Specifically, our results suggest that politically powerful landowners can block economic development using labor coercion and factor price manipulation, i.e., using entry barriers and other distortionary policies.
O52|Innovation policy for economic resilience: The case of Sweden|This paper provides an overview of the Swedish innovation system and the main strategies for Swedish innovation policy, with specific focus on VINNOVA’s place-based support to specialised areas integrating competences from different sectors in society. The overview reveals a recent shift from place-based specialisation to thematic areas underpinned by a societal challenge driven logic to policy intervention. The analysis indicates that a strong focus on R&D and science-driven innovation serves as a barrier for successful transition, and that the recent shift implies a greater need for policy coordination across different fields and scales. This makes agencies like VINNOVA less autonomous with regard to design as well as implementation of innovation policy and points to the need for reaching a balance between demand-oriented and supply-led strategies in which place-specific context matters and innovation policy must be attuned to and embedded in the particularities of the regional and national economies it aims to target. Linking smart specialisation strategies (S3), EU’s overall industrial and innovation policy for regional diversification and restructuring, with VINNOVAs new system innovation policy approach would be one way of doing this.
O52|Multidimensional Welfare Comparisons of EU Member States Before, During, and After the Financial Crisis: A Dominance Approach|How did the financial crisis affect population welfare in EU member states in key dimensions such as income, health, and education? Using EU-SILC data, we seek to answer this question by way of first order dominance comparisons between countries and over time. The novel feature of our study is that we perform welfare comparisons on the basis of multi-level multidimensional ordinal data. We find that the countries most often dominated are southern and eastern European member states, and the dominant countries are mostly northern and western European member states. However, for most country comparisons, there is no dominance relationship. Moreover, only a few member states have experienced a temporal dominance improvement in welfare, and no member states have experienced a dominance deterioration.

O52|The Business Demography of the ICT Sector in Europe|This report explores the latest available statistics up to 2014 for the business demography of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) economic sector in Europe. It combines relevant databases which provide insights into the Member Statesâ€™ ICT performance. The first four sections of this report take into account information, primarily from Eurostat, on ICT business demography. In the fifth section, radar charts are employed to combine Eurostat figures with information from the project on Prospective Insights in ICT R&D â€“ phase 3 (PREDICT) in order to gain further insights into the association of relevant ICT variables across European countries. Selected economic indicators from Eurostat are also included in the final section in order to reveal patterns of associations between ICT and the economy.
O52|The 2017 PREDICT Key Facts Report. An analysis of ICT R&D in the EU and beyond|The 2017 PREDICT Key Facts Report provides a detailed analysis of the state of ICT R&D activities in the European Union. This is the tenth edition of a series that is published annually. Like the previous editions, an online version is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/predict. The PREDICT dataset 2017 is based on the latest data available from official sources (such as the Eurostat and OECD, National Accounts and R&D statistics). It also includes the novelty of backwards reconstruction of the series from 1995, which allows it to cover the period from 1995 to 2014. Therefore, it provides a long-term analysis of the EU ICT sector and its R&D, covering a whole cycle since the initial expansion years, the double recession that began in early 2008, and the most recent evolution up to 2014.
O52|The 2017 PREDICT Dataset Methodology|This methodological report details the work done in the Prospective Insights on R&D in ICT (PREDICT) project in 2017. PREDICT provides updated indicators for the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector and for its Research and Development (R&D) in the European Union and in the major ICT leaders worldwide. This project is being carried out jointly by the Joint Research Centre, Directorate B and the Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CNECT) of the European Commission. The data and methodologies have been developed in collaboration with the Valencian Institute of Economic Research (IVIE). The 2017 PREDICT Dataset has been deepened and expanded in this latest version in order to include complementary dimensions, such as the Media and Content sector and sub-sectors. An updated methodology for estimating ICT Government Budget allocations for Research and Development (ICT GBARD) has been applied. Furthermore, for the most important indicators, existing PREDICT time series have been reconstructed back to 1995, while figures are now-casted for 2015 and 2016.
O52|The potential and impact of ICT-enabled Social Innovation to promote social investment in the EU|This report presents the results of the JRC-led research on â€˜ICT-enabled Social Innovation to support the implementation of the Social Investment Packageâ€™ (IESI) conducted in partnership with the Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion. The IESI research is set out to help policymakers and practitioners use ICT-enabled social innovation to modernise welfare systems, provide better and more efficient social services, and ultimately increase the wellbeing and quality of life of citizens. The original research design, its theoretical framework and empirical findings contribute to the growing scientific interest on ICT-enabled social innovation in the field of social policy reforms, within the scope of the implementation of the social investment approach. Based on the analysis of evidence gathered through a documented collection of initiatives across the EU, the research also advances a proposal for developing a methodological framework to assess the social and economic impact of ICT enabled social innovation. The approach proposed is expected to support policymakers and relevant stakeholders in designing, monitoring and evaluating ICT-enabled social innovation initiatives, which could be transferred, scaled-up and replicated across Europe. Insights from the research contribute to the policy debate on the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights and the future of the Welfare State in the EU.

O52|Heterogeneity in the debt-growth nexus: Evidence from EMU countries|The objective of this paper is to examine whether the threshold beyond which a public debt change may have a detrimental effect on economic growth changes across euro area countries during the 1961–2015 period. In contrast with previous studies, we do not use panel estimation techniques, but implement a time-series analysis for each country based on the growth literature. The results suggest that in all the countries but Belgium a debt increase begins to have detrimental effects on growth well before the SGP debt ceiling (a debt ratio of around 40% and 50% in central and peripheral countries, respectively) is reached. So, although austerity policies should be applied in EMU countries – since according to our results debt reduction barely exerts any significant beneficial impact on EMU countries' growth – they should be accompanied by structural reforms that can increase their potential GDP. Moreover, as our results suggest that the harmful impact of a debt change on growth does not occur beyond the same threshold and with the same intensity in all EMU countries, a focus on average ratios and impacts may be unsuitable for defining policies. Specifically, our findings suggest that the pace of fiscal adjustment should be lower in Greece and Spain than in the other countries.
O52|Seeking price and macroeconomic stabilisation in the euro area: The role of house prices and stock prices|We propose an Economic Stability Index (ESI) incorporating house prices and stock prices as components of the measure of the inflation rate in order to allow the European Central Bank (ECB) to achieve both price and macroeconomic stability. We use an optimisation approach to estimate target weights for different sectoral prices in the broader price index, which depend on sectoral parameters other than those used to compute the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices applied by the ECB to gauge price stability in the euro area (EA). Our results suggest that if the ECB had targeted the ESI, it would have implemented a different monetary policy which would had increased stability in the EA’s economic activity and would have helped to create adequate preconditions for sustainable economic growth and job creation.
O52|Beyond EU-US Trade Dynamics: TTIP Effects Related to Foreign Direct Investment and Innovation|The international economic debate on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) has focused mainly on trade induced real income gains while the FDI related and innovation induced benefits have been largely neglected, although the EU and the US are leading FDI host countries and FDI source countries. Moreover, from a theoretical perspective a knowledge production function has to be considered in order to analyze FDI and innovation dynamics – and this can then be linked to output and economic growth, respectively. The panel data estimation of knowledge production functions for 20 EU countries between 2002-2012 shows clear empirical evidence that a rise of the FDI stock-GDP ratio will raise patent applications. Additionally, a higher per capita income – that could reflect trade related real income gains in the context of TTIP – also contributes to more patent applications. Time series data analysis for Germany indicates additionally that FDI induced higher innovation dynamics will raise output. Combining trade benefits and FDI/innovation related real income gains plus transatlantic macroeconomic interdependency effects a real income gain of nearly 2% should be expected for both Germany and the EU as a whole: considerably higher than what the official TTIP report for the European Commission has suggested. The approach developed has broad implications for deep regional integration (TPP, TTIP).
O52|Technological Innovation and Inclusive Growth in Germany|Technological innovation has historically contributed to inclusive economic growth in Germany. In more recent decades, however, this contribution has weakened due to the declining impact of technological innovation on labor productivity growth. Fearing that this declining impact would undermine the international competitiveness of the economy, real labor compensation was progressively curbed since the mid-1990s. This occurred inter alia through the government's erosion of the social welfare state, as well as through offshoring and reduced fixed capital investment of the corporate sector. The outcome was rising income and wealth inequalities. Between the mid-1990s and 2010 the rise in wage inequality was faster in Germany than in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. To restore inclusive growth, two broad policy measures are recommended: first, to have appropriate compensatory social welfare policies in place; and second, to improve the effectiveness of technological innovation to raise labor productivity. This paper identifies three reasons why technological innovation has become less and less effective:(i) historical legacies, (ii) weaknesses in the education system, and (iii) entrepreneurial stagnation. Improving the impact of technological innovations on labor productivity growth will require a more diversified education system, a deepening of active labor market policies, better immigration policies, and a greater contestability of markets. Ensuring these recommendations in a coordinated fashion suggests the need for an appropriate industrial-innovation policy.
O52|Upgrading technology in Central and Eastern European economies|The future growth of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) depends on upgrading technology, exporting and coupling domestic technology efforts while improving their position in global value chains. Current policies in the region are not geared to these tasks, despite the availability of huge financial opportunities in the form of EU structural funds. Existing policies are overly focused on research and development (R&D) and neglect sources of productivity growth, such as management practices, skills, quality, and engineering. The challenge is how to design industrial and innovation policies so that they promote modernization and drive structural change.
O52|Economic Integration and the Non-tradable Sector: The European Experience|From the introduction of the Euro up to the 2008 global financial crisis, macroeconomic imbalances widened among Member States. This divergence took the form of strong differences in the dynamics of unit labor costs. This paper asks why this happened. Is it the result of distortionary public spending, or the consequence of economic integration? To answer this question, this paper builds a theoretical framework that is able to provide a decomposition of unit labor costs growth into various effects of economic integration and policy intervention. Using a novel dataset, it then measures the contribution of each effect to the dynamics of unit labor costs in 12 countries of the Euro area from 1995 to 2014. Results show that trade and financial integration are significant drivers of unit labor costs divergence. Before the global financial crisis, in Greece and Portugal for example, trade and financial integration explain up to 20% of the increase in unit labor costs relative to core countries. On the contrary, distortionary public spending plays a minor role.
O52|The Sustainability of Italian Public Debt and Deficit|Abstract In this paper, we analyse the sustainability of Italian public debt using a unique database, reconstructed by Forte (2011), which covers the years 1862–2013. The study focuses on empirical tests for the sustainability and solvency of Italian public finance. The results of unit root and stationarity tests show that public debt and deficit variables are non-stationary at levels, but stationary in first-differences form, or I(1). However, some breaks in the series emerge, given internal and external crises (wars, oil shocks, regime changes, institutional reforms). Therefore, the empirical analysis is conducted for the entire period, as well as two sub-periods (1862–1913 and 1947–2013). In essence, the paper’s results reveal that Italy has sustainability problems in the Republican age (1947-2013). Our Markov-switching dynamic regression model indicates the existence of two distinct states, both for public debt and deficit, with means and standard deviations rather different. Both states are extremely persistent.
O52|What drives export market shares? It depends! An empirical analysis using Bayesian Model Averaging|What drives external performance of countries? This is a recurring question in academia and policy. The factors underlying export growth are receiving great attention, as countries struggle to grow out of the crisis by increasing exports and as protectionist discourses take foot again. Despite decades of debates, it is still unclear what the drivers of external performance are and, importantly, which ones policy makers can influence. We use Bayesian Model Averaging in a panel setting to investigate the drivers of export market shares of 25 EU countries, considering a wide range of traditional indicators along with novel ones developed within the CompNet Competitiveness Research Network. We find that export market share growth is linked to different factors in the old and in the new Member States, with one exception: for both groups, competitive pressures from China have strongly aﬀected export performance since the early 2000s. In the case of old EU Member States, investment, quality of institutions and available liquidity to ﬁrms also appear to play a role. For the new EU Member States, labour and total factor productivity are particularly important, while inward FDI matters rather than domestic investment. Price competitiveness does not seem to play a very important role in either set of countries: relative export prices do show correlation with export performance for the new Member States, but only when they are adjusted for quality. Our results point to the importance of considering the “exporting stage” of a country when discussing export-enhancing policies. JEL Classification: C23, C51, C55, F14, O52
O52|Infrastructure Investment, Labor Productivity, and International Competitiveness: The Case of Portugal|This study analyzes the effects of infrastructure investment on labor productivity at the industry level using a newly developed data set for infrastructure investments in Portugal. We consider twenty-two sectors and twelve infrastructure assets. We focus on the differential effects on traded and non-traded sectors. We find, first, that investment in national roads have positive effects, particularly large for public services, while the effects of investments in municipal roads are mixed, and investments in highways have mostly benefited the non-traded sectors. Second, we find that railroad investments, and to a lesser extent airports have clearly biased labor productivity gains toward the non-traded sectors, while the effects of port investments are more muted and mixed. Third, for social infrastructure investments, the effects tend to be large and again particularly favorable to the non-traded sectors. Fourth, for public utilities the effects are in general small, with the exception of investments in telecommunications, which have large positive effects mainly on non-traded sectors. We conclude that infrastructure investments have contributed to the growth of labor productivity in Portugal but have done so in a way that has benefitted mostly non-traded goods sectors. This may be a matter of concern for a small open economy in a currency union and with a development model greatly reliant on exports.
O52|Why Virtuous Supply-Side Effects and Irrelevant Keynesian Effects are not Foregone Conclusions: What we Learn from an Industry-Level Analysis of Infrastructure Investments in Portugal|We use the industry-specific effects of twelve different infrastructure investments in Portugal to inform about the mechanisms through which such investments affect economic activity. Our main findings are as follows. First, demand-side effects that are approximated by adding the short-term and long-term construction effects are very important. They are over 60% of total effects for airport investments, ports, refineries, and water, and over 45% for national roads, municipal roads, telecommunications, health and education. Second, site-location effects that are approximated by real-estate effects are also very significant, in particular for national roads, highways and railroads, with 30%, 35% and 64% of the total effects, respectively. They are negative for water and electricity, and zero for municipal roads, airports, and refineries, and negligible for ports, i.e., all these are cases in which we would expect adverse or small location effects. Third, the functional channel relating to internationally-traded goods, approximated by the effects on the primary sector, on manufacturing, and on transportation, is much less significant, although we estimate meaningful effects on heavy industry from investments in all types of road infrastructures, ports, health, and education, as well as on light industry from ports. Fourth, a functional effect affecting non-traded industries, mostly private and public services is much more relevant. It accounts for more than 30% of the effects in the cases of municipal roads, airports, and refineries, and in excess of 20% for highways, railroads, telecommunications, health and education. The fact that most functional effects accrue to non-traded industries is likely to affect international competitiveness adversely. Naturally, these results cannot be automatically generalized, as the nature of the effects of infrastructure investments crucially depends on the level of development of the country in question, on the maturity of its existent infrastructure systems, and on the rigor of all decisions pertaining to infrastructure investment. Nevertheless, they establish that, as infrastructure investments are concerned, the dominance of virtuous supply side effects is not a foregone conclusion and, conversely, the relevance of Keynesian effects cannot be dismissed.
O52|Infrastructure Investment in Portugal and the Traded/Non-Traded Industry Mix|Using a newly-developed data set for Portugal, we analyze the industry-level effects of infrastructure investment. Focusing on the divide between traded and non-traded industries, we find that infrastructure investments have a non-traded bias, as these shift the industry mix towards private and public services. We also find that the industries that benefit the most in relative terms are all non-traded: construction, trade, and real estate, among the private services, and education and health, amongst the public services. Similarly, emerging trading sectors, such as hospitality and professional services stand to gain. The positive impacts on traded industries are too small to make a difference. These results highlight that infrastructure-based strategies are not neutral in terms of the industry mix. Moreover, with most of the benefits accruing to non-traded industries, such a development model that is heavily based on domestic demand may be unsustainable in light of Portugal’s current foreign account position
O52|On the Effects of Infrastructure Investments on Industrial CO2 Emissions in Portugal|We estimate how infrastructure investments affect industrial CO2 emissions in Portugal. Using empirical evidence on the economic effects of twelve types of infrastructure investments at the industry level, we consider twenty-two industries and the respective CO2 emission factors. Our conclusions are as follows. First, given the current emission factors for each industry, almost all types on infrastructure investments help the emissions intensity of the economy. Only for investments in airports and in health facilities are such positive effects absent. Second, the relevance of the economic effects of the different types of infrastructure investments on the electrical power industry is central in determining the overall effects on emissions. This is not surprising, given that electric power accounts for nearly 35% of CO2 emissions in Portugal and the extremely high emissions factor of this industry amplifies even small economic effects. Third, under an alternative scenario in which the emissions from the electric power industry have been eliminated – due to the use of renewable energy in production, for example – , or are otherwise ignored, we still see that most infrastructure investments lead to a decline in the CO2 emissions intensity. In this case, however, investments in national roads leave the emissions intensity essentially unchanged, while investments in health infrastructure have adverse effects on emissions. There are several important policy implications of these results when we consider infrastructure investment strategies that are mindful of their CO2 emission effects. Consider, for instance, transportation infrastructures. Given the present electric power generating mix, investment in national roads would be an appropriate policy recommendation from an environmental perspective, while investments in airport infrastructure should be avoided. Under a scenario of aggressive use of renewable energy sources in the production of electricity, however, the best investments would be in railroads and airports, two industries highly dependent on the use of electricity
O52|Health Care Investments and Economic Performance in Portugal: An Industry Level Analysis|We analyze how public and private health care investments affect economic performance in Portugal. With a newly-developed data set for twenty-two industries, we use a vector autoregressive model to estimate the elasticities and marginal products on investment, employment and output. First, every €1 million invested in health care yields significant positive spillover effects, boosting investment and GDP by €24.74 and €20.45 million, respectively, and creating 188 net jobs. Adversely, net exports deteriorate, as most of the new capital goods are imported. Second, while only 28.2% of the total accumulated increase in GDP occurs within a year, investment is front-loaded with a corresponding 73.8%. Over this period, 68 workers are displaced for every €1 million invested. Third, at a disaggregated level, real estate, construction, and transportation and storage are the three industries where output shares increase the most. Employment shares increase the most in professional services, construction, and basic metals. These results have important policy implications. Health investments enhance long-term performance, but are unhelpful counter-cyclically. Also, they will change the industry mix: construction and professional services are the non-traded industries that will benefit the most, while the traded industries of non-metallic minerals, basic metals, and machinery and equipment benefit much less.
O52|On the Impact of the European Union in Citizens’ Perception of Quality of Life|In the 2000s many important events have affected the EU political and economic stage: the adoption of the Euro currency, the enlargement occurred in three waves, the big economic crisis in 2008 and the Brexit referendum in 2016, just to cite a few. It is common opinion that these shocks have contributed to deeply change the average citizens’ attitude towards the EU and have had a strong impact on citizens’ quality of life. The present work aims at analysing the relationship between the EU and EU citizens’ perceived quality of life. This analysis is carried out in two-steps via firstly a nonlinear principal component analysis to extract underlying components of perceived quality of life related to the EU, and secondly using multilevel modelling to take into account country effects influencing the overall quality of life. Specific attention is given to national differences and the connection with the general citizens’ perception of quality of life.
O52|The Trade Effects Of The Eu-South Korea Free Trade Agreement In The Automotive Industry|The EU-South Korea FTA, enforced in 2011, represents a significant case of a trade deal signed between two major developed economies that also belong among the largest car exporters in the world. This paper examines the effects of the EU-South Korea FTA on bilateral automotive industry trade, comparing them to the changes in total bilateral trade. The empirical analysis applies the gravity model framework with its contemporary methodological advancements and estimation techniques. The empirical results show that the trade-enhancing effects of the FTA in the auto trade are substantially higher than in total trade. Additionally, EU bilateral auto exports have increased more than South Korea’s exports. The dynamics of the post-FTA trade flows suggest that the removal of the automotive industry’s non-tariff barriers have played an important role in trade facilitation, especially for EU exports. The enforcement of the FTA has also been followed by notable changes in the structure of EU auto exports with the share of higher value final goods increasing and input goods decreasing.
O52|The profit rate and asset-price inflation in the Spanish economy|The measure of capital profitability in the Spanish economy is relevant because of both a process of capital accumulation since mid-nineties largely driven by asset-price inflation, as well as the deep economic crisis since late 2008. Therefore, in this article a comparative analysis is carried out using different databases and measures of the rate of profit, incorporating the financial sphere and addressing other different countries of the Eurozone. It shows the scope of the underlying valorization crisis in relation to previous decades and in terms of its fall experienced during the years not only of the housing boom, but also throughout the subsequent recession. In addition, this drop in profitability stands out in relation to other economies of the European periphery. Hence, this analysis puts the rate of profit at the center of the debate on the Great Recession in Spain, despite its absence in much of the economic literature, including heterodox approaches.
O52|The lessons of stabilization and prospects of growth: Russia’s economic policy in 2016|Economic growth is the key challenge at the political agenda of the leading countries including Russia. This papers discusses existing hypotheses of “secular stagnation” and “productivity paradox” — demand side problems (cyclical factors); special features of technological innovations (technological factors); anti-crisis policy preventing “creative destruction” (political factors); irrelevance of GDP measurement (statistical problems). Limits of growth contribute to a new global policy trend — emerging of populism, and the paper discusses the prospects of transformation of political populism to economic one. Global challenges provide the basis for further analysis of Russian economic development, and particularly the results of 2015—2016 anti-crisis policy, which helped the national economy to adapt to new economic realities of the post-crisis world.
O52|Innovation and Competitiveness in the Context of the Bulgarian Tourism Industry|Despite the global challenges, international tourism has still achieved dynamic growth and undegone continued expansion. Travel for recreational, leisure or business purposes is an important source of economic growth in many countries. This holds particularly true for Bulgaria as it is a small, less developed and structurally weak country which faces the tremendous challenges of the rapidly changing and highly competitive global market. Without effective and coordinated government policies and actions tourism would not succeed to exploit fully its potential for inclusive and sustainable growth. The financial leakages expressed primarily in loss in revenue from tourism due to the low competitiveness of the sector, can significantly narrow the positive economic benefits of tourism and make the country vulnerable to negative economic, social, cultural and environmental impacts. Competitiveness, as it is evidenced in the literature reviewed in the article, depends on the development of the differentiated capabilities needed to sustain growth which could be created through innovation. According to this article, the industry could be enhanced through the different types of innovation. This applies to the whole country, to the various subnational regions, and to the individual tourism enterprises. Indeed, it is worth emphasizing that enhancing the competitiveness of economies, whose companies are exposed to international competition, depends on innovation. In that context the article aims to identify the types of innovation in tourism and the main areas where they could be applied while searching for possibilities to increase the competitiveness of the Bulgarian tourism industry and to ensure its sustainable growth.
O52|Fostering Productivity for Income Convergence in the Czech Republic|Over the past two decades, the income level of the Czech Republic has converged considerably towards the OECD average. However, after the 2008 global crisis, the convergence process stalled. Shortfalls in labour productivity have developed and are mainly structural. Policies are needed to foster domestic sources of productivity growth. Better targeting of government R&D support and more focused innovation policies that would be aided by a streamlining of policy institutions and interventions are necessary. In particular, tailored policies to increase knowledge-based capital (skills, management capacity, collaboration, etc.) are necessary to increase Czech firms’ productivity. Also, resource reallocation should be facilitated by reforming framework conditions. In particular, bankruptcy rules, competition and regulation policies, access to finance and SME taxation need to be improved to boost SMEs' growth and productivity. Stimuler la productivité pour favoriser la convergence des revenus dans la République tchèque Au cours des deux dernières décennies, le niveau de revenu de la République tchèque s’est nettement rapproché de la moyenne de l’OCDE. Toutefois, après la crise mondiale de 2008, ce processus de convergence a marqué un coup d’arrêt. La productivité n’a pas progressé autant qu’attendu, principalement pour des raisons structurelles. Il est dès lors nécessaire de mettre en place des politiques publiques pour stimuler les sources internes de hausse de la productivité. Rationaliser les institutions chargées de l’élaboration de ces politiques aiderait à mieux cibler le soutien public à la R D et à affiner les politiques de l’innovation. En particulier, des politiques spécifiquement conçues pour développer le capital intellectuel (compétences, capacité de direction, collaboration, etc.) s’imposent pour accroître la productivité des entreprises tchèques. Par ailleurs, il conviendrait de faciliter la réaffectation des ressources en réformant les conditions-cadres en vigueur. En particulier, les règles en matière de faillite, les politiques en matière de concurrence et de réglementation, l’accès aux financement et la fiscalité des PME doivent être améliorés pour accélérer la croissance des petites et moyennes entreprises et doper leur productivité.
O52|Enhancing public sector efficiency and effectiveness in the Czech Republic|Spending on public administration itself is relatively low and so are indicators of its performance. Challenges include wastage in public procurement, insufficient management of the investment cycle and high levels of staff turnover. This paper considers ways of building on recent reforms, including better procedures for EU-financed projects and the new Civil Service Act, to raise the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector. Performance monitoring is underused but could help drive improvements in service delivery. The structure of local government, which includes over 6 200 municipalities, exacerbates the challenges of the public administration by complicating co-ordination and stretching capacity. Accordingly, the second part of the paper focuses on ways of improving the efficiency and quality of public service delivery and realising greater benefits from decentralisation. Rendre le secteur public plus efficient et fonctionnel dans la République tchèque Les dépenses consacrées à l'administration publique proprement dite sont relativement faibles, et il en va de même de ses performances. Parmi les défis à relever, on peut citer notamment des gaspillages dans les marchés publics, une gestion insatisfaisante du cycle d'investissement et une rotation rapide des personnels. Le présent article est consacré aux moyens qui permettraient de prolonger les réformes récentes, en s’appuyant par exemple sur une amélioration des procédures qui régissent les projets financés par l'UE et sur la nouvelle loi sur la fonction publique, qui vise à rendre le secteur public plus efficace et plus efficient. Le suivi des résultats est peu pratiqué alors qu'il pourrait entraîner des progrès dans la prestation des services. La structure des collectivités locales, avec plus de 6 200 communes, aggrave les problèmes d'administration publique en compliquant la coordination et en dispersant les capacités. La deuxième partie de l’article porte donc sur les moyens d'améliorer l'efficience et la qualité de la prestation de services publics ainsi que de mieux tirer parti de la décentralisation.
O52|Getting the most out of trade in Estonia|Estonia is highly integrated into the global trade system: it exports approximately 80% of GDP and around half of domestic employment is sustained by foreign demand. Given that international trade and foreign direct investment are considered as major channels of technology diffusion and productivity growth, this bodes well for reviving income convergence. To capitalize on the country’s high trade intensity, policymakers need to remove remaining trade barriers and improve policies fostering knowledge diffusion as well as talent retention and attraction. At the same time, to ensure that benefits of more trade are shared across the population, the social safety net should be bolstered, and participation in upskilling programmes and their labour-market relevance increased. This Working Paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of New Zealand (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-estonia.htm).
O52|Reviving productive investment in Estonia|Since the crisis, Estonia has experienced one of the most pronounced declines in the ratio of non-residential investment to GDP in the OECD. In addition, investment in intangible capital has remained well below OECD standards, partly explaining the low innovative capacities of typical Estonian firms. Uncertainty created by regional geopolitical tensions has played a role but poor investment performance stems from domestic factors too, such as a normalisation after the boom years, the lack of adequate skills and insufficient incentives for risk-taking. Improving lifelong learning and maintaining skilled mothers in employment can contribute to reducing shortages in skills needed by investors. Restructuring of insolvent firms should be eased to increase credit recovery and redirect capital to the most productive ones. Developing alternatives to bank funding can support investment in small and innovative firms. While there is room to improve the quality of infrastructure further, selection and prioritisation of projects should improve. Incentives for green investment, in particular to reduce pollution emitted by the oil shale industry and to achieve energy efficiency gains, could be strengthened.This Working Paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of Estonia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-estonia.htm).
O52|Boosting productivity in Switzerland|Swiss GDP per capita stands amongst the top OECD performers. However, to face medium-term challenges productivity developments will be key to allow the country to maintain its enviable position. Recent trends have not been favourable, with productivity growth underperforming peer countries. Based on macroeconomic analysis and supported by firm-level data, results point to a significant role for competition, innovation, education, firm characteristics and entrepreneurship. The regulatory environment is a crucial element driving productivity and could explain some of the differences across cantons. It is also an important factor for productivity differences across sectors. Other issues weighing on Switzerland’s future performance include risks from ageing, which can have major consequences on productivity via its influence on economic sectors and also via the age structure and the evolution of productivity through working life. Fully utilising the potential of underrepresented population segments would also be beneficial, notably encouraging full-time participation of women and better integrating immigrants. More enterprise creation could be achieved with increased entrepreneurship education, expanded non-bank financing and a reduced regulatory burden. R&D, while an obvious success in Switzerland, has apparently not produced commensurate returns in output. Diversification, more knowledge sharing, a stronger role for higher education institutions and promotion of start-ups would help reinforce the links from R&D to productivity.This Working Paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of Switzerland (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-switzerland.htm).
O52|Foreign Direct Investment Drivers and Growth in Central and Eastern Europe in the Aftermath of the 2007 Global Financial Crisis|Abstract Our paper provides new insights on the developments and the drivers of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Central and Eastern European countries over the period 1993–2014, whilst taking into account the occurrence of the 2007 and 2011 crises. We apply a panel data general-to-specific approach and show that FDI inflows are driven by both external (i.e. macroeconomic and financial conditions in the euro area, global macroeconomic conditions and global risk environment) and domestic determinants (past FDI, human capital, market size, infrastructure, competitiveness, corporate tax system, risk premium, trade openness, geographical proximity to Western Europe, accession to the European Union and progress in implementing structural reforms). In addition, through a dynamic panel data analysis, we find a positive impact of FDI inflows on economic growth. We show that, despite the severe decline in FDI and real GDP growth rates at the onset of the 2007 crisis, the positive impact of FDI inflows on economic growth has amplified during this crisis, whilst it has become non-significant during the 2011 crisis.
O52|Efficient Implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy Goals: Is Social Equality Achievable Reality or Myth Perhaps?|Economic crisis hit all the European Union Member States hard, the impact of crisis varied considerably. The low growth performance in the EU has increased concerns regarding an increasing wage dispersion, income inequality at large, and social exclusion in line with poverty. Inequality should be seen as a cornerstone of both sustainable and inclusive growth under the Europe 2020 Strategy. Social inequality in the EU is a very real problem which hampers sustainable economic growth. The purpose of this study is to introduce evaluation of social development convergence and divergence trend between EU28 Member States in the context of the Europe 2020 Strategy. The study gives an outline of the issues of labour market and income disparities and poverty. Policy-makers must be clear about what social objectives they are aiming to achieve, therefore special attention is paid to headline national goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy. The main tasks of this study is to assess social dimension and inequalities problems in the EU27 by applying Data Envelopment Analysis method, resp. time-series dynamic efficiency analysis in the form of output-oriented Malmquist Productivity Index. This study contain changes of key social equality indicators related to the Europe 2020 Strategy and compares objectives and general outlines of period 2010-2015, as well as its impact on national economics and living conditions. Results contain elements of typology premises of the EU28 and point to a large diversity in inequality patterns, as author observe both increases and decreases in inequality at the EU level. Recent changes in social inequality have been associated with the business cycle, particularly with the accessibility of the labour market and, of course, with income inequality. Additionally the development challenges are discussed for improvement of the socioeconomic well-being of the EU27 and to avoid social disparities.
O52|Enhancing Polish firms’ innovation activities in comparison to the other Moderate Innovators countries|Faced with circumstances of rapid changes, the crucial is stimulation of actions aimed at enhancing competitiveness. In this regard, the European Union strategy Europe 2020 should be mentioned. Concerning the role of firms’ innovation activities in economic growth of regions and countries, it is important to explore how enhancing Polish firms’ innovation activities differ between the EU countries with a similar to Poland level of innovation. Thus, the particular emphasis was put on the Moderate Innovators countries.The aim of this paper is to investigate enhancing Polish firms’ innovation activities against those from the other Moderate Innovators countries.The study was based on data from the European Innovation Scoreboard 2016 related to firm activities dimensions: firm investments, linkage & entrepreneurship and intellectual assets. The time period was 2008–2015 and was limited by data availability. To study multivariate analysis and the zero unitarization methods were applied. These methods allowed to multivariate analysis of enhancing firms’ innovation activities in Poland and those from the other EU countries with similar to Poland level of innovation.This paper contributes to the existing literature by providing new insight on understanding the issues related to firms’ innovation activities. The results reveal, among others, that although Polish firms’ innovation activities have improved against those from the other Moderate Innovators counties, it requires further enhancing. The findings have practical and policy implications. It is assumed that the obtained results may be useful for firms, regions and country in enhancing competitiveness.
O52|Efficiency Analysis of ERDF and CF Co-financed Programmes Focusing on the Transport in Member States of the European Union|European Union provides financial support to the Member States through various financial tools currently from European Structural and Investment Funds that represent the main instrument of EU Cohesion Policy to sustain territorial development, to increase competitiveness and to eliminate regional disparities. The overall impact of EU Funds depends on the structure of funding and absorption capacity of the country. Efficiency of funding across EU Member States is a fundamental issue for the EU development as a whole. The author considers determining the efficiency of EU Funds as an issue of high importance and therefore this study provides a contribution to the debate on the role of the EU Cohesion Policy in EU Member States. The paper focuses on the territorial effects of selected EU Funds in programming period 2007–2013 in theme of infrastructure through transport efficiency analysis. Efficiency analysis is based on data at country level originating from ex-post evaluation of Cohesion Policy programmes 2007–2013 representing the input and output variables to analyse whether the goal of fostering growth in the target countries have been achieved with the funds provided and whether or not more resources generated stronger growth effects in transport accessibility. Study deals with comparative cross-country analysis, descriptive data analysis and multicriteria approach to Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in the form of output oriented BCC VRS model. The study aims at testing several factors in form of two inputs and five outputs, trying to elucidate the differences obtained by the EU Member States in efficient using of the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund in transport sector. Paper determines if the countries have been more efficient in increasing their levels of competitive advantages linked with transport. Preliminary results reveals that mostly countries with lower amount of funding achieve higher efficiency, especially from the group of EU15.
O52|Does EU cohesion policy work? Theory and evidence|This paper evaluates the effectiveness of European Cohesion Policy in the regions of 12 EU countries in the period 1991â€“2008, on the basis of a spatial growth model, which allows for the identification of both direct and indirect effects of EU funds on GDP per worker growth. We find that â€œObjective 1â€ funds are characterized by strong spatial externalities and a positive and concave effect on the growth of GDP per worker, which reaches a peak at the ratio funds/GDP of approximately 3 percent and becomes nonâ€ significant after 4 percent. â€œObjective 2â€ and â€œCohesionâ€ funds have nonsignificant effects, while all the other funds exert a positive and significant effect, but their size is very limited. EU Cohesion Policy, moreover, appears to have increased its effectiveness over time. In the period 2000â€“2006 Objective 1 funds are estimated to have a median multiplier equal to 1.52, and to have added 0.37 percent to the GDP per worker growth. Overall, in the period 1991â€“2008, funds are estimated to have added 1.4 percent to the median annual growth, and to have reduced regional disparities of 8 basis points in terms of the Gini index.
O52|What Shapes Europeans’ Attitudes toward Xeno-philia(/phobia)?|"Migration has strongly manifested itself to historic highs, creating divisive views among politicians, policy makers and individuals. The present paper studies the Europeans’ attitudes toward immigration and the contextual factors that shape these attitudes. Based on 267,282 respondents from 22 countries and over the period 2002-2014, we find that despite the eventful past years, Europeans, on average, are still positive toward immigrants with the North European countries to be the most xenophile to immigrants of all backgrounds. High educational level and political orientation (right-wing) are among the most important individual characteristics that associate with xenophile and xenophobic sentiments, respectively. Macroeconomic conditions and ethnic diverse environments play a very important role in shaping public attitudes. A salient finding of our analysis is that regardless of the impact of other contextual factors, individuals (and countries) with high social capital do exhibit more positive attitudes toward immigration than the rest of the population (countries). Social capital further moderates the negative effects of any ""perceived threat"" on people’s opinions about immigrants."
O52|Regional development in the context of economic reform: The case of Limassol|Regional development occurs in the larger context of national economies. Thus, the elaboration of regional economic development strategies cannot be separated from higher-level economic policy which frames and conditions opportunities and risks for regional development. As a Southern European country undergoing a process of profound structural economic reform, Cyprus provides a case for a policy context aiming towards the emergence of a new model of economic growth. Within this context, the Limassol region as one of the country’s major economic centers with a number of comparatively strong industries can serve as an example of how to promote regional development in the framework of national reform priorities such as moving the national economy closer towards a knowledge- and innovation-driven model. The present study analyses current reform priorities on the national and supra-national level, takes stock of the regional economic structure of Limassol district, and presents some preliminary ideas that could be further explored if and when a comprehensive regional economic development strategy for Limassol were to be elaborated.
O52|Income Inequality and Growth: New Insights from Italy|This paper investigates the impact of income inequality on economic growth in Italy during the period of 1967 to 2012. Specifically, using a technique that allows us to sort out long-run impacts from short-run impacts, we investigate whether income inequality benefits or harms growth, after controlling for human capital, labour, physical capital and inflation within an augmented growth model. Amid the existing debatable theoretical and empirical studies, our results suggest that income inequality has a negative and significant impact on growth in the long run. The negative impact of income inequality on growth still exists in the short run. However, the coefficient becomes insignificant. Overall, we gather that inequality hurts growth in the country. Based on this finding, we provide some policy implications. Disuguaglianza dei redditi e crescita: nuove evidenze dall’Italia Questo studio esamina l’impatto della disuguaglianza nei redditi sulla crescita economica in Italia durante il periodo 1967-2012. In particolare con l’utilizzo di una tecnica che ci consente di distinguere gli effetti sul lungo periodo da quelli sul breve periodo, si analizza se la disuguaglianza di reddito beneficia o danneggia la crescita, tenuto conto del capitale umano, del lavoro, del capitale fisico e dell’inflazione all’interno di un modello di crescita ampliato. All’interno del dibattito teorico esistente e degli studi empirici, i risultati suggeriscono che la disuguaglianza di reddito ha un effetto negativo significante sulla crescita nel lungo periodo. Tale impatto negativo sussiste anche nel breve periodo, anche se il coefficiente risulta non significativo. In generale vi sono evidenze che la disuguaglianza danneggia la crescita economica.
O52|Bulgaria in the EU Cohesion Process|Cohesion is a precondition for implementing a number of important EU internal and external policies, such as functioning of the single market, the Eurozone, Common commercial policy,Environmental policy, etc. Therefore, achieving stronger cohesion is one of the main tasks of the European institutions. But in order to assess the development of the EU cohesion process and thereof the effectiveness of the ongoing cohesion policy, it is necessary to introduce and assess the results of certain cohesion indicators. The article includes nine such indicators: GDP per capita; Research and development expenditure as percentage of GDP; High-tech exports as percentage of total exports; People at risk of poverty or social exclusion; the Gini Coefficient; Life expectancy at birth; Density of motorway network; Share of trains in total inland passenger transport; Population connected to wastewater collection and treatment system. By using the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), the study establishes that in the decade of 2004-2014 there was enhanced cohesion in the EU in 8 out of the 9 indicators used. Based on comparison between Bulgaria’s individual results and those of the EU as a whole, it concludes that Bulgaria has not yet been able to get fully included in the cohesion process: 7 out of the total 9 cohesion indicators are lower than the average for the EU indicators.
O52|Regional environmental efficiency in waste generation|This paper employs Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to consider waste generation at a regional level in the European Union (EU). By doing so both good and bad outputs are taken into account and different frameworks are designed. Five parameters (waste generation, employment rate, capital formation, GDP and population density) are used for 172 EU regions and for the years 2009, 2011 and 2013. In doing so four frameworks have been designed with different inputs and outputs each time. The results show the more efficient EU regions according to each framework, but it should be noted that results from different frameworks should not be compared to each other. Overall results suggest that the highest performers are regions in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and the UK. Finally the efficiency results from DEA were reviewed against the treatment options employed in the relevant regions. Our findings show that although a country might be efficient according to DEA and by taking many factors into consideration, it is not necessary that regions within a country use sustainable waste treatment options as it is essential to account for trade and shipment of waste between regions and countries as well.
O52|Imbalances and policies in the Eurozone|The present paper highlights the imbalances that have characterized the Eurozone during the crisis. The contribution focuses on the issue of current account imbalances and the factors that caused them. It also examines the banking union as an important step toward a better management of the Eurozone financial imbalances. Furthermore, the paper discusses and assesses the policies, especially monetary policy, implemented in the Eurozone, stressing the limits of the strategy pursued by the European authorities. The main purpose of the paper is to point out possible solutions in order to correct the imbalances and discuss changes in Eurozone policies.
O52|Greece: Still in the woods|Greece went bankrupt in 2009 presumably because it run an exorbitant public deficit and had accumulated a huge public debt. However, in reality Greece went bankrupt because its model of social and economic organization has been surpassed by European and international developments. To avoid this tragedy, Greece had been given by EEC initially and EU later on enough time to prepare before integrating into the Eurozone. From the treaties it signed Greece ought to have introduced structural transformations to render its economy consistent with the four European freedoms. Instead, time and again successive governments procrastinated and employed all sorts of gimmicks to protect the model of state socialism they had erected on the pillars of the 1975 Constitution. But time and circumstances caught up with their policies and now the cost for confronting the challenges that lie ahead has become enormous. Hopefully, sooner than later, those responsible for the bankruptcy of Greece and the hardships that have befell on the Greek people will discover that their self-interest coincides with that of the country and they will take the lead in the replacement of the present hard core statist model with one based on free and open markets and outward looking entrepreneurship.
O52|Are Democratic Regimes Antithetical to Globalization?|In this study we have made an attempt to investigate into the relationship between political regime type (that ranges from authoritarian to democratic) and the extent of globalization, which of late has been considered as a path to development. We have made use of the Democracy index (and its constituent indicators) provided by the Economist Intelligence Unit and the globalization index (and its constituent indicators) of the KOF. Applying canonical correlation analysis on the data we have made an attempt to look into the response of globalization to the quantitative measures of democratic (versus authoritarian) practices of the governments in 116 countries distributed over Asia, Africa, Australia/Oceania, Europe and the Americas. We have also tested the Lee thesis in the context of globalization as a path to development. Our findings indicate that the empirical support to Lee’s thesis if extended to globalization as a path to development is superficial and does not withstand critical analysis. Contrary to Lee’s thesis, democracy promotes globalization. In African countries political discordance (at the national as well as international level) is not much favourable while in the Asian countries, political will, irrespective of regime type, is more or less in concordance with globalization. Therefore, rather illusively, it so appears that democracies thwart development as well as globalization as a means to development by implication, while the reality is very different.
O52|Welfare in Slovakia and the EU — an alternative to GDP per capita|GDP per capita is used as the basic measure of economic development and prosperity across the world. However, it is a limited measure of living standards, focussed on capturing changes in economic output per person and neglecting many things central to quality of life. Several alternative approaches to assessing quality of life have been proposed such as the OECD Better Life Index (2017), the UN Human Development Index (HDI), or Gross National Happiness. One notable contribution is the consumption equivalent welfare measure introduced by Jones and Klenow (2016). Our results from using this measure suggest that the quality of life in most EU countries is higher than suggested by GDP per capita relative to the U.S. The primary reasons for this are that, particularly compared to the U.S., countries in the EU tend to have lower income inequality and longer life expectancy. Implementing this measure for Slovakia, our results indicate that relative welfare is approximately 10 percentage points higher in Slovakia than GDP per capita would suggest. In the medium run, consumption equivalent welfare in Slovakia grew faster than income from pre-crisis levels. Improvements in the quality of living in Slovakia over time have been driven by an increase in life expectancy and consumption, as well as consistently low levels of income inequality. Nevertheless, living standards in Slovakia are still low in comparison to advanced EU economies and the U.S. Lower life expectancy, which reflects the quality of health of the population, accounts for most of the difference in welfare in comparison to these advanced economies.
O52|The Effect Of Agricultural Exports On Economic Growth In South-Eastern Europe: An Empirical Investigation Using Panel Data|The contribution of this paper is investigating the effect of agricultural exports on economic growth in South Eastern Europe Countries since it’s never been treated before. To attempt this aim annual data was collected from the World Bank for the period 2006 – 2016 and was tested by using correlation analysis and the static gravity model. Empirical analyses show that agricultural exports have a positive strong correlation with gross domestic product and have a positive effect on economic growth. These results appear that agricultural exports are a provenance of economic growth in South Eastern Europe Countries. For this reason, it is very important to refine investment in agricultural sector, and create more effective agricultural trade openness policies.
O52|Tourism and agrotourism evolution on an european and national level|In this article we wanted to identify, analyze and present the evolution in the last years of the tourism and agrotourism on an European and national level. In order to do that, the following indicators have been analyzed: the evolution and structure of international arrivals of tourists around the globe, the evolution and structure of international tourism encash, the evolution and share of tourist accommodation in Romania, the evolution and share of the accomodation capacity in Romania, the evolution of arrivals in accomodation units from Romania and the evolution of overnight stays in accomodation units from Romania. Following this analysis that is presented in the article in the rows below, we come to the conclusion that the tourism and agrotourism, on an European and national level, has had a constant growth in the last 5 years, thus representing an important branch with possibilities to develop economy, generating profit.
O52|Islamic Banks, Deposit Insurance Reform, and Market Discipline: Evidence from a Natural Framework|Abstract Although it has been intensively claimed that Islamic banks are subject to more market discipline, the empirical literature is surprisingly mute on this topic. To fill this gap and to verify the conjecture that Islamic bank depositors are indeed able to monitor and discipline their banks, we use Turkey as a test setting. The theory of market discipline predicts that when excessive risk taking occurs, depositors will ask higher returns on their deposits or withdraw their funds. We look at the effect of the deposit insurance reform in which the dual deposit insurance was revised and all banks were put under the same deposit insurance company in December 2005. This gives us a natural experiment in which the effect of the reform can be compared for the treatment group (i.e., Islamic banks) and control group (i.e., conventional banks). We find that the deposit insurance reform has increased the market discipline in the Turkish Islamic banking sector. This reform may have upset the sensitivities of the religiously inspired depositors, and perhaps more importantly it might have terminated the existing mutual supervision and support among Islamic banks.
O52|Real convergence in the euro area: a long-term perspective|In the euro area, there is mixed evidence that the GDP per capita of lower-income economies has been catching up with that of higher-income economies since the start of monetary union. The significant real convergence performance of some of the most recent members contrasts with that of the economies of southern Europe, which have not met expectations. However, attributing all the blame for this outcome to the introduction of the single currency simply misses the point. By taking a “long view” and reviewing the evidence since the 1960s, this paper shows that certain member countries began to face a “non-convergence trap” long before the euro years. We also provide stylised facts on: (i) the central role of total factor productivity in driving real convergence in the euro area over time, alongside other factors; and (ii) the crucial interaction of real convergence with “Maastricht convergence” and institutional quality, the other two key components of sustainable economic convergence. We conclude that it is critical that the euro area countries facing convergence challenges enhance the resilience of their economic structures by improving the relevant institutions and governance.

O52|What drives export market shares? It depends! An empirical analysis using Bayesian Model Averaging|"What drives external performance of countries? This is a recurring question in academia and policy. The factors underlying export growth are receiving great attention, as countries struggle to grow out of the crisis by increasing exports and as protectionist discourses take foot again. Despite decades of debates, it is still unclear what the drivers of external performance are and, importantly, which ones policy makers can influence. We use Bayesian Model Averaging in a panel setting to investigate the drivers of export market shares of 25 EU countries, considering a wide range of traditional indicators along with novel ones developed within the CompNet. We find that export market share growth is linked to different factors in the old and new EU Member States, with one exception: for both groups, competitive pressures from China have strongly affected export performance since the early 2000s. In the case of the old EU Member States, investment, the quality of institutions and liquidity available to firms also appear to play a role. For the new EU Member States, labour and total factor productivity are particularly important, while inward FDI matters more than domestic investment. Price competitiveness does not seem to play a very important role in either set of countries: relative export prices do show correlation with export performance for the new EU Member States, but only when they are adjusted for quality. Our results point to the importance of considering the ""exporting stage"" of a country when discussing export-enhancing policies."
O52|Economic Growth, Renewable Energy and Methane Emissions: Is there an Enviromental Kuznets Curve in Austria?|This paper provides empirical evidence of environmental Kuznets curve for Austria. Using the autoregressive distributed lag method, the relationship between methane emissions (CH4), gross domestic product, electricity production from renewable energy sources (excluding hydro) and trade openness is analyzed; the variables are used in per capita terms except for trade openness. In the long term, cointegration analysis indicates that the variables have a distribution inverted U-shaped and Granger causality test shows unidirectional causality between CH4 and the variables involved. Since CH4 is the second highest greenhouse gas emitted in the world, political and academic implications of this study are relevant to include in planning decisions that aim to mitigate climate change
O52|The impact of the Great Recession on TFP convergence among EU countries| This article provides evidence on the effect of the Great Recession on productivity convergence among European Union (EU) economies. We use firm data, aggregated at the country-year level, to analyse the evolution of beta-convergence on total factor productivity (TFP) for 2003–2014. We obtain a positive impact of the recession on TFP (unconditional and conditional) beta-convergence across EU economies. These results support the existence of a catching-up process within the EU during the recent financial crisis. Other macroeconomic and institutional characteristics are important in fostering TFP growth, namely R&D intensity and quality of governance.
O52|The determinants of firms’ convergence to the European TFP frontier|In this article we characterize Total Factor Productivity (TFP) frontier firms at the industry level within the European Union during the period 2003-2014, and explore the determinants of the firms’ distance to the frontier. We find that larger, more capital-intensive, and more labour skilled firms are closer to the productivity frontier. In contrast, older firms are further away from the frontier. In addition, we obtain that a number of countries' economic and institutional factors, such as tertiary education, trade openness, easiness in getting credit and governance quality, all positively affect the catching up of laggards towards the productivity frontier. We also examine the moderating effect of the Great Recession on these determinants and obtain differentiated patterns.
