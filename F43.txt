F43|Does Trade Reform Promote Economic Growth? A Review of Recent Evidence|Do trade reforms that significantly reduce import barriers lead to faster economic growth? In the two decades since Rodríguez and Rodrik’s (2000) critical survey of empirical work on this question, new research has tried to overcome the various methodological problems that have plagued previous attempts to provide a convincing answer. This paper examines three strands of recent work on this issue: cross-country regressions focusing on within-country growth, synthetic control methods on specific reform episodes, and empirical country studies looking at the channels through which lower trade barriers may increase productivity. A consistent finding is that trade reforms have a positive impact on economic growth, on average, although the effect is heterogeneous across countries. Overall, these research findings should temper some of the previous agnosticism about the empirical link between trade reform and economic performance.
F43|Foreign Reserve Accumulation, Foreign Direct Investment, and Economic Growth|This paper develops a quantitative small-open-economy model to assess the optimal pace of foreign reserve accumulation by emerging and developing countries. In the model, reserve accumulation depreciates the real exchange rate and attracts foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, which promotes productivity growth through endogenous firm dynamics. The economy is also subject to sudden stops in the form of an occasionally binding constraint on foreign borrowing, and accumulated reserves are used to prevent severe economic downturns. The model shows that two factors are the key determinants of the optimal pace of reserve accumulation: the elasticity of the foreign borrowing spread with respect to foreign debt, and the entry cost for FDI entry. The model suggests that these two factors can explain a substantial amount of the cross-country variation in the observed pace of reserve accumulation.
F43|Growth Spillovers in the MENA Region|In this paper, we examine the role of spillovers in economic growth for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region by accounting for spatial effects. Such spatial effects in growth for the MENA countries may arise on the basis of geography, bilateral trade or institutional similarities. We explicitly model such interactions using a spatial econometric approach and ask how much they are likely to matter for growth externalities and spillover effects. To detect spatial dependence in growth rates, we make of the spatial lag model as well as the model with spatially autocorrelated error terms. Using results from the spatial econometrics literature, we test for the existence and type of spatial dependence. Our results indicate that the economic growth of a MENA country is positively affected by the economic growth of countries that are geographically close and that have similar institutional characteristics rather than through the growth of its trade partners.
F43|Euro Area Growth and European Institutional Reforms|Euro area countries have experienced profound economic, financial and institutional changes over the last three decades. GDP growth has been very volatile, and very uneven, across countries. Which factors played a role in stirring growth and/or reducing it? We provide an atheoretical toolkit looking at a large set of real, financial, monetary and institutional variables, as possible factors behind fluctuations and differences in growth rates among euro area countries since 1990. The main outcome stresses the key positive role for long-run growth of higher European institutional integration, overall and for the periphery in specific. This result is robust across specifications and setups. If we split the European institutional integration in its main components, we can see a significant positive role for financial and political integration in the long-run. However the first seems to have beneficial effects for the core only while the opposite holds for the political integration which influences positively the periphery.
F43|The Economic Correlation between China and Southeast Asian Countries: derivative market and real sector analysis|This paper attempts to analyse the economic integration of China and Southeast Asian countries. This paper adopts several methods: One, stationarity for correlation, Error Correction Model (ECM) for short-run relation and Cointegration for long-run relationships. Two, Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) analysis to identify the cause and impact. As stock market index follows real sector performance this paper utilizes: One, elasticity analysis of economic growth between China and these countries as a proxy for real sector economic relations between them and two, descriptive statistical analysis on real effective exchange rate as well as Current Account Balance as a proxy of external economic performance between them. In correlation analysis, this paper found that one, stationarity of each country is the difference at level; two, short-run economic relations (ECM) between China and these Southeast Asian countries and three, they have long-run economic relations. In causality, this paper found that China affects all of these Southeast Asian countries and no causality between Singapore and the Philippines. In term of real sector analysis, this paper found that one, economic growth in China significantly affects all of these countries’ economic growth. Two, the external economic performance of these countries are the difference with special finding on Indonesia’s current account.
F43|Remittances, finance and industrialisation in Africa|The paper assesses how remittances directly and indirectly affect industrialisation using a panel of 49 African countries for the period 1980–2014. The indirect impact is assessed through financial development channels. The empirical evidence is based on three interactive and non-interactive simultaneity-robust estimation techniques, namely: (i) Instrumental Fixed Effects (FE) to control for the unobserved heterogeneity; (ii) Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) to control for persistence in industrialisation and (iii) Instrumental Quantile Regressions (QR) to account for initial levels of industrialisation. The non-interactive specification elucidates direct effects of remittances on industrialisation whereas interactive specifications explain indirect impacts. The findings broadly show that for certain initial levels of industrialisation, remittances can drive industrialisation through the financial development mechanism. Policy implications are discussed.

F43|Remittances, the Diffusion of Information and Industrialisation in Africa|This study examines the role of information and communication technology (ICT) on remittances for industrialisation in a panel of 49 African countries for the period 1980-2014. The empirical evidence is based on three simultaneity-robust estimation techniques, namely: (i) Instrumental Fixed Effects (FE) in order to control for the unobserved heterogeneity; (ii) Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) to account for persistence in industrialisation; and (iii) Instrumental Quantile Regressions (QR) to control for initial levels of industrialisation. Our best estimators are from FE and QR estimations because the GMM regression outputs largely fail post-estimation diagnostic tests. The following findings are established: (i) There are positive marginal effects from the interaction between remittances and ICT in the FE regressions whereas there are negative marginal impacts from the interaction between remittances and ICT; (ii) Interactions between remittances and mobile phone penetration are positive in the bottom and 90th quantiles whereas the interaction between internet penetration and remittances is positive in the bottom and top quantiles of the industrialisation distribution. Overall, the role of ICT in remittances for industrialisation is much more apparent when existing levels of industrialisation are accounted for. The findings contribute to the debates on the importance of external flows and information infrastructure in economic growth as well as the relevance of remittances in driving economic development in environments where institutions are weak. The value of the study to scholars and policy makers also builds on the fact that the potential for ICT and remittances in Africa can be leveraged to address development challenges on the continent such as the low level of industrialisation.
F43|Italy’s Decline and the Balance-of-Payments Constraint: a Multicountry Analysis|According to the literature, the decline experienced by the Italian economy in the last two decades depends on a slowdown of its labor productivity, starting in the Nineties. The supply-side explanations of this slowdown are inconsistent with the major stylized facts. In this paper, we verify whether a better explanation is provided by the effect of a negative demand shock, through Italy’s external constraints, in the framework of Kaldor-Dixon-Thirlwall cumulative growth model. To this end, we use a multi-country generalization of Thirlwall’s balance-of-payments-constrained growth model, which allows us to investigate the contribution of Italy’s main trade partners to Italy’s long-run growth from 1970 to 2010. The trade partners are disaggregated into seven groups: Eurozone core, Eurozone periphery, United States, other European countries, OPEC countries, BRIC, and the rest of the world. The results show that Italy’s long-run growth has been consistent with the Bop-constraint, that its decline can be explained by a progressive tightening of this constraint, that the sudden slowdown of labor productivity in the Nineties corresponds with a major shock on Italy’s external constraint, and that the major contributions to this shock came, through different channels of transmission, from the core Eurozone countries and from OPEC countries.
F43|Nicholas Kaldor’s Insights into the Applied Economics of Growth (or Why I Became a Kaldorian)|We are celebrating today the life and work of Nicholas Kaldor on the thirtieth anniversary of his death on 30th September 1986. Kaldor was one of the most distinguished Hungarian economists of the twentieth century who ought to have more recognition in his native country, even though most of his academic life was spent in the United Kingdom. I knew Kaldor well in the last years of his life between 1979 and 1986. In the mide-1970s, I had already decided that I would write an intellectual biography of him – I found him such an original and interesting economist, and decided there was a Kaldorian economics to be written. In 1979, I spent a sabbatical term in King’s College, Cambridge. I attended Kaldor’s lectures; I talked to him, and finished reading the whole of his published work – over 250 articles and books. Then in the academic year 1985-86, I spent a whole year in Cambridge, working in his house in Adams Road to sort out his papers; read his correspondence with other economists, and to interview him extensively about his ideas and events of long ago. My biography of him was published in 1987 (Thirlwall, 1987). When Kaldor died, undoubtedly economics lost one of its most original and controversial economists of the twentieth century. We are all mortal, of course, but not many live the rich intellectual and political life that Kaldor enjoyed. Below, I give some brief biographical details, and highlights in Kaldor’s academic and political life.
F43|Do Fixers Perform Worse than Non-Fixers during Global Recessions and Recoveries?|There is an important debate about how economies with different exchange rate regimes performed during the Great Recession and its ensuing recovery. While economic theory suggests that economies with fixed exchange rates are more affected and recover more slowly from global shocks than economies with non-fixed exchange rates, the empirical evidence on the most recent global recession has been mixed. This paper examines the exchange rate and economic growth nexus and assesses how this relationship is affected by the four global recessions and recoveries the world economy has experienced post-Bretton Woods. While there is no robust long-term relationship between exchange rate regimes and growth, there is evidence that fixers recover from global recessions at a weaker pace than non-fixers.
F43|Evaluating international impacts of China-specific shocks in an input-output framework|The slowing in China’s massive economy has wide implications. China plays an essential role in international production chains, so disturbances can spill over to other economies in the global production network. We evaluate the international transmission and impact of various China-specific shocks with an input-output framework applied to the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). We consider shocks to Chinese final demand at the aggregate level, bilateral import tariffs between the US and China and sector-specific shocks to Chinese final demand and supply. Our results suggest that aggregate level shocks, as well as certain sector-specific shocks originating in China, may have large impacts elsewhere. Transmission of shocks through the global production network, however, is mitigated by the relatively low import-intensity of Chinese production.
F43|Technology Gaps, Trade and Income|This paper studies the origins and consequences of international technology gaps. I develop an endogenous growth model where R&D efficiency varies across countries and productivity differences emerge from firm-level technology investments. The theory characterizes how innovation and learning determine technology gaps, trade and global income inequality. Countries with higher R&D efficiency are richer and have comparative advantage in more innovation-dependent industries where the advantage of backwardness is lower and knowledge spillovers are more localized. I estimate R&D efficiency by country and innovation-dependence by industry from R&D and bilateral trade data. Calibrating the model implies technology gaps, due to cross-country differences in R&D efficiency, account for around one-quarter to one-third of nominal wage variation within the OECD.
F43|Innovation Union: Costs and Benefits of Innovation Policy Coordination|In this paper, we document large heterogeneity in innovation policy and performance between old and new EU member states, and present firm-level evidence on the close link between foreign direct investment (FDI) spillovers and eastern European _firms' innovation. Guided by these facts and motivated by the pressing debate on further EU integration, we build a two-region endogenous growth model to analyse the gains from innovation policy cooperation in an economic union. The two regions, the West (the old members) and the East (the new post-2004 members), feature firms competing in innovation for market leadership, are integrated via free trade and costly technology transfer via FDI and have different innovation performance and policy. Calibrating the model to reproduce key features of the EU economy, we compare the outcomes of an East-West R&D subsidy war with a cooperation scenario with unified subsidy across regions, and obtain three main results. First, we find that the dynamic gains spurring from the impact of cooperation on the economy's growth rate are sizable and substantially larger than the static gains obtained internalising the strategic motive for subsidies. Second, our model suggests that the presence of FDI and multinational production alleviates the strategic motive and increases the gains from cooperation. Third, separating FDI and innovation policy generates larger gains from cooperation, a policy complementarity driven by the knowledge spillovers carried by FDI.

F43|Trade, Technology and the Great Divergence|"This paper develops a model that captures the key features of the Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence between the industrializing \North"" and the lagging \South."" In particular, a convincing story is needed for why North-South divergence occurred so dramatically during the late 19th Century, a good hundred years after the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution. To this end we construct a trade/growth model that includes both endogenous biased technologies and intercontinental trade. The Industrial Revolution began as a sequence of unskilled-labor intensive innovations which initially incited fertil- ity increases and limited human capital formation in both the North and the South. The subsequent co-evolution of trade and technological growth however fostered an inevitable di- vergence in living standards - the South increasingly specialized in production that worsened their terms of trade and spurred even greater fertility increases and educational declines. Biased technological changes in both regions only reinforced this pattern. The model high- lights how pronounced divergence ultimately arose from interactions between specialization from trade and technological forces."
F43|Structural change in the Chinese economy and changing trade relations with the world|This paper examines the impact of structural change in China, in particular a reduction in the savings rate, an increase in the share of skilled workers, and an increase in productivity in technologically advanced manufacturing sectors targeted by Made in China 2025. Baseline projections until 2040 are generated with the WTO Global Trade Model, a dynamic computable general equilibrium model. With the modelled structural changes the Chinese economy is projected to reorient its focus increasingly onto the domestic economy, raising the share of private household and government consumption in GDP, turning China's trade surplus into a trade deficit, reducing China's share in global exports, raising the share of services in both production and exports, shifting the destination markets of Chinese exports from developed to developing countries, and changing its pattern of comparative advantage away from sectors like light and heavy manufacturing to electronic and machinery equipment. The large bilateral trade surplus vis-a-vis the United States is projected to fall to almost zero.

F43|From Local to Global: A Unified Theory of Public Basic Research|We analyze public investment in basic research in a multi-country, multi-industry environment with international trade. In our economy, basic research generates ideas which private firms take up in applied research to develop new varieties. Such development requires industryspecific know-how. A country's current specialization in international trade thus determines which ideas can be commercialized domestically. We demonstrate that the equilibrium is consistent with key patterns observed from the data. We then compare basic research investments of national governments with optimal investments of a global social planner. We show that national investments are inefficient along three dimensions: (1) There is typically too little total investment in basic research. (2) Basic research is too heavily concentrated in industrialized countries. (3) And basic research is potentially insufficiently directed to support innovation in complex, high-tech industries.
F43|Currency Collapses and Output Dynamics in Commodity Dependent Countries|This paper provides new empirical evidence on the relationship between currency collapses (i.e. large nominal depreciations or devaluations) and real output by paying a specific attention to commodity exporting countries. Using a dataset including 108 emerging and developing economies for the period 1970-2016, we document and estimate what happens to output growth during episodes of currency collapses for commodity-dependent and non commodity-dependent countries. One particular feature of our analysis is to control for war events. We find that currency crises occur more frequently in commodity-dependent countries (one crisis every 17 years versus 30 years for non commodity-dependent countries) and with a larger magnitude (median depreciation about 12 percent points larger for commodity-dependent countries). In both groups of countries, output growth declines in response to the currency collapse. It appears however that output growth starts to slowdown earlier in commodity-dependent countries while the impact is more persistent in non commodity-dependent countries. The magnitude of the output growth slowdown is very close between the two groups of countries. Finally, we find that the output growth-currency collapse relationship differs among commodity-dependent countries according to the category of their main exported commodity.
F43|Financial integration in Europe through the lens of composite indicators|This paper develops composite indicators of financial integration within the euro area for both price-based and quantity-based indicators covering money, bond, equity and banking markets. Prior to aggregation, individual integration indicators are harmonised by applying the probability integral transform. We find that financial integration in Europe increased steadily between 1995 and 2007. The subprime mortgage crisis marked a turning point, bringing about a marked drop in both composite indicators. This fragmentation trend reversed when the European banking union and the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions Programme were announced in 2012, with financial integration recovering more strongly when measured by price-based indicators. In a growth regression framework, we find that higher financial integration tends to be associated with an increase in per capita real GDP growth in euro area countries. This correlation is found to be stronger the higher a country's growth opportunities. JEL Classification: F36, F43, F45, G01, G15
F43|Trade Shocks and the Shifting Landscape of U.S. Manufacturing|Using data over more than a century, we show that shifts in the location of manufacturing industries are a domestic reflection of what the international trade literature refers to as the product cycle in a cross-country context, with industries spawning in high-wage areas with larger pools of educated workers and moving to lower-wage areas with less education as they age or become “standardized.” We exploit the China shock industries as a set of industries that were in the late-stage product cycle by 1990 and show how the activity in those industries shifted from high-innovation areas to low-education areas over the 20th century. The analysis also suggests that the resilience of local labor markets to manufacturing shocks depends on local industries’ phase in the product cycle, on local education levels, and on local manufacturing wages. The risk of unemployment and detachment from the labor force rises most when a shock hits in areas where an industry already has begun phasing out, wages are high, or education levels are low. The results are consistent with the belief that there are long-term, secular trends in U.S. industrial structure driving the movement of industries, which shocks may mitigate or accelerate.
F43|Structural Transformation, Industrial Specialization, and Endogenous Growth|The introduction of new technologies in agriculture can foster structural transformation by freeing workers who find occupation in other sectors. The traditional view is that this increase in labor supply in manufacturing can lead to industrial development. However, when workers moving to manufacturing are mostly unskilled, this process reinforces a country's comparative advantage in low-skill intensive industries. To the extent that these industries undertake less R&D, this change in industrial composition can lead to lower long-run growth. We provide empirical evidence of this mechanism using a large and exogenous increase in agricultural productivity due to the legalization of genetically engineered soy in Brazil. Our results indicate that improvements in agricultural productivity, while positive in the short-run, can generate specialization in less-innovative industries and have negative effects on productivity in the long-run.
F43|Does Trade Reform Promote Economic Growth? A Review of Recent Evidence|Do trade reforms that significantly reduce import barriers lead to faster economic growth? In the two decades since the critical survey of empirical work on this question by Francesco Rodriguez and Dani Rodrik in 2000, new research has tried to overcome the various methodological problems that have plagued previous attempts to provide a convincing answer. This paper examines three strands of recent work on this issue: cross-country regressions focusing on within-country growth, synthetic control methods on specific reform episodes, and empirical country studies looking at the channels through which lower trade barriers may increase productivity. A consistent finding is that trade reforms that significantly reduce import barriers have a positive impact on economic growth, on average, although the effect differs across countries. Overall, these research findings should temper some of the previous agnosticism about the empirical link between trade reform and economic performance.
F43|Public policy reforms to further improve Portuguese export performance|Portugal’s export performance over the past decade has been impressive, helping to reduce external imbalances. This partly owed to a sequence of structural reforms that benefited the productivity of the export sector and led to an increase in its size. Nonetheless, exports as a share of GDP and the stock of foreign direct investment remain below that of other comparable small European economies. Further shifting the orientation of the economy to the external sector is vital for Portugal given the strong link between trade openness and GDP per capita. To do this, policymakers must ensure that policy settings incentivise exporting firms to expand and improve their competitiveness, both through lower price and improved quality. For example, regulatory barriers that reduce competition in professional services should be lowered to improve the cost and quality of intermediate inputs. Increasing the efficiency of domestic infrastructure is also key, especially through competition-enhancing reforms to the port sector. To further differentiate and improve Portuguese export products, skills in the business sector need to be enhanced through better-targeted lifelong learning opportunities. At the same time, there is a need to focus innovation policies on raising the participation of small and medium enterprises in innovative activities.
F43|Financial Integration and the Global Effects of China's Growth Surge|China's financial openness, as measured by cross border flows and asset ownership, peaked during its 2000s growth surge, as did downward pressure on global interest rates and price levels. This was despite China's restriction of financial inflows to approved FDI and tight controls on private outflows. We analyze the global effects of the growth surge and their dependence on these financial policies by employing a global macro model with national portfolio rebalancing, in which flexibility in asset differentiation is used to index financial integration. The results suggest that, globally, the growth surge raised asset prices, reduced yields and bolstered deflationary pressures, while improving aggregate economic welfare. It is shown that, without capital controls, most surge effects on China would have been moderated substantially while the global impacts would have been larger.
F43|Transmission of a resource boom: The case of Australia|This paper presents evidence on the macroeconomic adjustment of a resource-rich country to a resource boom using the effects of Chinese industrialisation on Australia from 1988 to 2016. An SVAR model is specified, incorporating a proxy for Chinese resource demand and commodity prices to identify the effects of commodity supply and demand shocks on the Australian macroeconomy. We develop a multivariate historical decomposition to show how resource sector shocks lead the economy to deviate from a long-run projection. The paper identifies four phases of the transmission of the resource boom before its conclusion in 2015.
F43|Energy Consumption and Economic Growth: Evidence from Vietnam|The importance of non-renewable, renewable and sustainable energy sources and energy consumption in the economic development strategy of a country is undeniable. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the impacts of energy consumption on the economic growth of Vietnam during the 1980-2014 period. By applying the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model of Pesaran et al. (2001), and the Granger causality test of Toda and Yamamoto (1995), the empirical results provide evidence that electricity consumption has positive impacts on Vietnam’s economic growth in both the short run and long run. For public policy prescriptions, the empirical evidence suggests that an exploration of new sources of renewable and sustainable energy is essential for long run economic development.
F43|Exporting and firm performance: Evidence from India|The positive correlation between firm productivity and export status is well established. This correlation can arise from multiple alternative casual models. We investigate these relationships, harnessing the transition of several firms from serving the domestic market to exporting, in a dataset of Indian firms from 1989 to 2015. Each firm which made the transition is matched against a control which did not. The transitions take place across many years, thus permitting a matched event study in firm outcomes. We find there is self-selection of more productive firms into exporting. Firms that make the transition become bigger, but there is little evidence of learning by exporting, of improvements in productivity right after exporting commences. However, there is evidence of mprovement in productivity of export starters a couple of years before they begin to export.
F43|Remittances, the Diffusion of Information and Industrialisation in Africa|This study examines the role of information and communication technology (ICT) on remittances for industrialisation in a panel of 49 African countries for the period 1980-2014. The empirical evidence is based on three simultaneity-robust estimation techniques, namely: (i) Instrumental Fixed Effects (FE) in order to control for the unobserved heterogeneity; (ii) Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) to account for persistence in industrialisation; and (iii) Instrumental Quantile Regressions (QR) to control for initial levels of industrialisation. Our best estimators are from FE and QR estimations because the GMM regression outputs largely fail post-estimation diagnostic tests. The following findings are established: (i) There are positive marginal effects from the interaction between remittances and ICT in the FE regressions whereas there are negative marginal impacts from the interaction between remittances and ICT; (ii) Interactions between remittances and mobile phone penetration are positive in the bottom and 90th quantiles whereas the interaction between internet penetration and remittances is positive in the bottom and top quantiles of the industrialisation distribution. Overall, the role of ICT in remittances for industrialisation is much more apparent when existing levels of industrialisation are accounted for. The findings contribute to the debates on the importance of external flows and information infrastructure in economic growth as well as the relevance of remittances in driving economic development in environments where institutions are weak. The value of the study to scholars and policy makers also builds on the fact that the potential for ICT and remittances in Africa can be leveraged to address development challenges on the continent such as the low level of industrialisation.
F43|The Propagation of Regional Shocks in Housing Markets: Evidence from Oil Price Shocks in Canada|Shocks to the demand for housing that originate in one region may seem important only for that regional housing market. We provide evidence that such shocks can also affect housing markets in other regions. Our analysis focuses on the response of Canadian housing markets to oil price shocks. Oil price shocks constitute an important source of exogenous regional variation in income in Canada because oil production is highly geographically concentrated. We document that, at the national level, real oil price shocks account for 11% of the variability in real house price growth over time. At the regional level, we find that unexpected increases in the real price of oil raise housing demand and real house prices not only in oil-producing regions, but also in other regions. We develop a theoretical model of the propagation of real oil price shocks across regions that helps understand this finding. The model differentiates between oil-producing and non-oil-producing regions and incorporates multiple sectors, trade between provinces, government redistribution, and consumer spending on fuel. We empirically confirm the model prediction that oil price shocks are propagated to housing markets in non-oil-producing regions by the government redistribution of oil revenue and by increased interprovincial trade.
F43|The macroeconomic effects of migrants' remittances in Moldova: a stockâ€“flow consistent model|Migrants' remittances are an essential source of income in many developing countries. In this article, we build a post-Keynesian stockâ€“flow consistent model adapted to Moldova, one of the top recipients of remittances. In addition to increasing household consumption, migrants' transfers have strong effects on economic growth in Moldova. However, remittances are very sensitive to the economic conditions in migrants' destination countries, especially since the 2008 global financial crisis. After including remittances in consumption behavior and lenders' risk, we run simulations to show how shocks in migrants' destination countries (that is, Europe and Russia) impact the Moldovan economy through fluctuations in remittances. First, the increasing instability of remittances explains a significant portion of the economic volatility experienced by Moldova. Second, the high level of imports implies a weak multiplier effect of remittances, leading to an unsustainable pattern of growth.
F43|Unequal vulnerability to climate change and the transmission of adverse effects through international trade|In this paper, we consider the unequal distribution of climate change damages in the world and we examine how the underlying costs can spread from a vulnerable to a non-vulnerable country through international trade. To focus on such indirect effects, we treat this topic in a North-South trade overlapping generations model in which the South is vulnerable to the damages entailed by global pollution while the North is not. We show that the impact of climate change in the South can be a source of welfare loss for northern consumers, in both the short and the long run. In the long run, an increase in the South’s vulnerability can reduce the welfare in the North economy even in the case in which it improves its terms of trade. In the short run, the South’s vulnerability can also represent a source of intergenerational inequity in the North. Therefore, we emphasize the strong economic incentives for non-vulnerable -and a fortiori less-vulnerable – economies to reduce the climate change damages on – more – vulnerable countries.
F43|Baltic Integration and the Euro|Which have been the consequences of the euro for integration and economic performance in the Baltic Sea region? After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the three Baltic states and Poland have been rapidly catching-up with Western Europe. The Great Recession became a great setback for the former, while less so for Poland. A difference is the monetary policy: the Polish zloty depreciated in the critical moment of the crisis, while currency boards with the aim of joining the euro bestowed appreciation for the Baltics and Finland. Contrary to the purpose, monetary integration has not fostered integration in trade, and the share of the Eurozone in Baltic trade has stagnated. A comparison with other countries in the Baltic Sea region suggests that the euro provides “the golden fetters” of our time. Emigration, also a kind of integration, has become a safety valve with severe social and economic consequences for the Baltic states.
F43|The impact of FDI on economic growth in Tunisia: An estimate by the ARDL approach|This paper attempts to examine the impact of foreign direct investment on economic growth in Tunisia using times series data for the period 1980-2015. In this study, we used the ARDL (Autoregressive Lag Distribution) approach to study the short-term and long-term relationship between foreign direct investment and economic growth. The empirical findings show that FDI has positive impact on economic growth in both the short and the long term. For the other determinants of economic growth, we have shown that domestic investment and human capital have had a positive and significant effect on the economic growth of the Tunisian economy in the short run rather than in the long run. On the other hand, the degree of trade openness has a negative effect on short-term and long-term economic growth.
F43|North-South Uneven Development and Income Distribution under the Balance of Payments Constraint|This study builds a North-South trade and uneven development model, and investigates the effects of changes in income distribution (the profit share) on economic growth rates of both countries. How a change in the profit share affects both countries' growth rates differs for the short-run equilibirum and the long-run equilibrium. For example, in the short-run equilibirum, an increase in the profit share of the North deteriorates the terms of trade of the South, and then, decreases the growth rate of the South. On the other hand, in the long-run equilibrium, an increase in the profit share of the North either increases or decreases the growth rate of the South through Thirlwall's law.
F43|Do Fixers Perform Worse than Non-Fixers during Global Recessions and Recoveries?|There is an important debate about how economies with different exchange rate regimes performed during the Great Recession and its ensuing recovery. While economic theory suggests that economies with fixed exchange rates are more affected and recover more slowly from global shocks than economies with non-fixed exchange rates, the empirical evidence on the most recent global recession has been mixed. This paper examines the exchange rate and economic growth nexus and assesses how this relationship is affected by the four global recessions and recoveries the world economy has experienced post-Bretton Woods. While there is no robust long-term relationship between exchange rate regimes and growth, there is evidence that fixers recover from global recessions at a weaker pace than non-fixers.
F43|Natural Resources, Economic Growth and Geography| In this paper we discuss the relationship between economic growth and natural resources at a global level, taking into account geography. With this aim, our model integrates elements of the theories of endogenous growth, natural resources and new economic geography. We find that an increase in the world growth rate can lead to a higher depletion of the natural resources following an increase in the world demand due to expansion in population. However, the consideration of geography and growth mechanisms make the relationship between growth and natural resources more complex, and can even lead to the opposite conclusion when the forces behind growth are different from world demand. Indeed, either a reduction in transport costs or an increase in R&D productivity appears to be able to generate a faster growth compatible with a lower depletion of natural resources.
F43|Patent protection, innovation, and technology transfer in a Schumpeterian economy|This paper analyzes the effects of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection on innovation and technology transfer in a North-South quality-ladder model with innovative Northern R&D and adaptive Southern R&D. The degree of IPR protection in two countries differs in terms of patent breadth, which determines the markups of Northern ﬁrms and their Southern afﬁliates, respectively. In this model, stronger IPR protection in the South leads to a permanent decrease in the North-South wage gap, a temporary increase in the Northern innovation rate, and a permanent increase in technology transfer. By contrast, stronger IPR protection in the North leads to a permanent increase in the North-South wage gap, ambiguous effects on the Northern innovation rate, and a permanent decrease in technology transfer. Finally, we perform a quantitative analysis by calibrating the model to the US-China data, and the numerical results support these policy implications.
F43|Investissements Directs Étrangers Et Croissance Économique En République Démocratique Du Congo (Rdc)<BR>[Foreign Direct Investment And Economic Growth In Democratic Republic Of Congo (Drc)]|The objective of this paper is to analyze the effect of foreign direct investments on economic growth in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) over the period 1980-2016. To achieve this objective, we used the ARDL approach. The results indicate a negative effect of foreign direct investments on the economic growth of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the short and long term.
F43|Time-Varying Exchange Rate Risk Premium|We characterize the exchange rate risk premium on the context of a small open economy with controlled floating exchange rate regime. The data set includes 100 observations on case of Vietnam over 01/2011-04/2019. The risk premium is varying over time. And it is determined by output growth rate, inflation rate, foreign capital inflows and liquidity supply. As one application, the existence of time varying risk premium reduces the effectiveness of foreign exchange market intervention by forward contract.
F43|The Impact of Domestic and Foreign Direct Investment on Economic Growth: Fresh Evidence from Tunisia|This paper aims to analyze the impact of domestic investment and Foreign Direct Investment on economic growth in Tunisia during the period 1976–2017. This study is based on the Auto-Regressive Distributive Lags (ARDL) approach that is proposed by Pesaran et al (2001). Bound testing approaches to the analysis of level relationships. According to the results of the analysis, domestic investment and foreign direct investment have a negative effect on economic growth in the long run. However, in the short run, only domestic investment causes economic growth. The findings are important for Tunisian economic policy makers to undertake the effective policies that can promote and lead domestic and foreign investments to boost economic growth.
F43|The Institutional Dynamics of Colonial Exploitation|This paper focuses on the interaction between the legacy of institutional arrangements and incentives on long-term development. We recalled two studies focusing on the long term effects of geographic discontinuities in colonial practice in India and Peru and we confronted the two historical cases as to emphasise the role of capital accumulation and equality of distribution. Furthermore, we propose an evolutionary game model to capture the evolutionary dynamics of institutional assets defining egalitarian or iniquitous income divisions in a non-cooperative setting. This framework sheds light on the role of the colonial governments in the interaction between local institutions and foreign colonial rule in terms of distribution, resources extraction, social asymmetries and finalised investments.
F43|Domestic Investment, Export, Import and Economic Growth in Brazil: An Application of Vector Error Correction Model|This paper aims to investigate the nexus between domestic investment, exports, imports, and economic growth for the Brazilian economy during the period 1970-2017, using the VECM methodology. In the short-run, our empirical results pointed out that import, exports, and domestic investment cause economic growth. Also, economic growth causes exports. Exports, imports, and economic growth cause domestic investment. However, in the long-run, our results revealed that domestic investment and exports have a positive effect on economic growth. Also, imports have a negative effect on economic growth. The results recorded a positive impact of economic growth and imports on domestic investment. Exports have a negative effect on domestic investment. Finally, we record the absence of significant impact of economic growth, exports and domestic investment on imports, and economic growth, domestic investment, and imports on exports. Due to the importance of these aspects to the economic performance of Brazil, the policymakers are invited to orient these issues towards the sustainability facets to guarantee a sustained growth path.
F43|Impact of Road Infrastructure Investments on the Structural Competitiveness of the Burkina Faso Economy|This article assesses the impact of road infrastructure investments on the structural competitiveness of Burkina Faso's economy. After retaining the period from 1980 to 2015, the estimate of the Model to Error Correction (ECM) revealed that investment in road infrastructure positively and significantly affects the structural competitiveness of the economy. However, this incidence varies over time. In fact, the elasticity of structural competitiveness compared to road investments is 0.06 in the short term and 0.32 in the long term. In view of these results, it appears that the implication of economic policy that emerges is that an increase in investment in road infrastructure is a policy of gaining structural competitiveness of the country's economy.
F43|Non-linear effects of investment in road infrastructure on the structural competitiveness of the economy: the case of Burkina Faso|This paper assesses the non-linear effects of road infrastructure investment on the structural competitiveness of Burkina Faso's economy. After retaining the period from 1980 to 2015, the quadratic and spline estimation revealed a non-linearity between the structural economy competitiveness and investment in road infrastructure. Indeed, the quadratic estimate identified non lineary U-shaped inverted with an optimal threshold of 10.11%. With regard to the spline estimation, it also highlighted this nonlinearity and gave an optimal interval of [5%;15%]. The economic policy implication that emerges from these results is that in order to benefit from optimal structural competitiveness, the investment’s share in road infrastructure in the total investment budget must be between5% and 15%.
F43|2013 – The Finnish Divergence|Abstract In this paper, we use the synthetic control method to analyze the Finnish economic performance after the onset of the Great Recession. Our main interest is to study the slow recovery from the global downturn that began in 2008. We identify the synthetic control with pre-crisis data (1996–2007). It provides the counterfactual response of the Finnish economy to the crisis in the absence of idiosyncratic shocks that affected Finland but not the synthetic control unit. We find that the Finnish GDP growth closely follows the synthetic control until 2013. After that there is a striking divergence in the economic growth of Finland and the expected economic behavior, as represented by the counterfactual. The divergence between the Finnish GDP and its synthetic control is mainly due to underperforming of the Finnish net exports. The consumption expenditures, on the other hand, outperform the synthetic control unit right after the financial crisis, but starting from 2013, they underperform as well. We find that our results are relatively robust to alternative methodological specifications.
F43|Quarterly Forecasting Model for India’s Economic Growth: Bayesian Vector Autoregression Approach|This study develops a framework to forecast India’s gross domestic product growth on a quarterly frequency from 2004 to 2018. The models, which are based on real and monetary sector descriptions of the Indian economy, are estimated using Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) techniques. The real sector groups of variables include domestic aggregate demand indicators and foreign variables, while the monetary sector groups specify the underlying inflationary process in terms of the consumer price index (CPI) versus the wholesale price index given India’s recent monetary policy regime switch to CPI inflation targeting. The predictive ability of over 3,000 BVAR models is assessed through a set of forecast evaluation statistics and compared with the forecasting accuracy of alternate econometric models including unrestricted and structural VARs. Key findings include that capital flows to India and CPI inflation have high informational content for India’s GDP growth. The results of this study provide suggestive evidence that quarterly BVAR models of Indian growth have high predictive ability.
F43|Trends in FDI and its role in Development and Convergence|The empirical study is based on 138 countries (and territories) for which there are available comparable data regarding FDI at UNCTAD, FDI/MNE database (www.unctad.org/fdistatistics) for 2000-2017. In order to analyse the relations between FDI and GDP per capita and the socalled Real Convergence, usually evaluated only based on expressing GDP per capita in international dollars PPP (Purchasing Power Parity), data for the global economy (represented by the group of 138 countries and territories, as W138), are for the period 2000-2018 from World Bank, and for the period up to 2024 from IMFforecast (IMF Report,April 2019).
F43|New Structuralism and the Balance-of-Payments Constraint|Structuralists and Post-Keynesians share the perspective that in the long run economic growth is shaped by the income elasticity of exports and imports, and that such elasticities are a positive function of the degree of diversification and technological intensity of the pattern of specialization. Since the mid-seventies, New Structuralists began to stress the role of two set of variables in driving the pattern of specialization: a stable and competitive real exchange rate, and the relative intensity of innovation / diffusion of technology in center and periphery. In this paper we modify the Balance-of-Payments constrained growth model to include these two set of variables. The model provides a mechanism that ensures the validity of the original Thirlwall’s perspective, namely that adjustment to the Balance-of-Payments-constrained equilibrium takes place through changes in the rate of growth of aggregate demand rather than through changes in relative prices. In addition, it shows that a macroeconomic policy aimed at sustaining a competitive real exchange rate is a necessary complement to an active industrial policy for fostering international convergence.
F43|Does inward foreign direct investment influence macroeconomic performance? A case of Slovakia|Foreign direct investments (FDI) are generally considered as key drivers of economic development of the country. However, studies confirming significant effects of inward FDI on macroeconomic performance especially in conditions of the Central European countries are rather scare. The present paper investigates effects of different types of inward FDI, namely cross-border mergers and acquisitions and greenfield investment projects on the macroeconomic performance measured by GDP per capita in conditions of Slovakia. The results of regression analysis for the period of 2003-2018 show rather negative impact of greenfield investments allocated in Slovakia as well as cross border sales of local companies on the level of GDP per capita of the host country.
F43|Why Export Is Hope For Economic Growth For North Macedonia|The development of international trade today represents one of the priorities of the world economies. Scientific studies dealing with the relationship between foreign trade and economic development are numerous and with no doubt increase the interest among the readers. As a result, researchers make a variety of analyzes and conclusions that presents valuable contributions to the science of economics. North Macedonia in its macroeconomic policy as a priority enlist the development of international trade. However, the trade balance in 2018 year revealed the existing problem of trade deficit, as again reached a very high percentage. This is a signal that warns the country?s economy in the present and in the future. The causes of this situation are various, but some are more fundamental. As one of the most was undoubtedly the global financial and economic crisis that were present especially in the European Union member countries. Countries being in this situation, reduced the demand for goods from the different companies from North Macedonia. But this is not the only reason for the difficult position of North Macedonia. Another unfavorable condition is the economic structure of the North Macedonian economy which perhaps is the most important reason. To get out of this situation, North Macedonia in the future must change its economic structure and should be oriented in producing goods that are required more in the global market. It cannot hope to compete in the world market with the goods that competes nowadays in order to be able to improve the balance of foreign trade.
F43|Competing Gains From Trade|Differences in growth rates across countries imply a strong relation between factor-proportions-based trade and key aggregate economic outcomes. We construct two macro-trade datasets and illustrate that this relation is rather weak empirically. Employing a dynamic two-country model, we propose a simple explanation for this finding. By limiting the substitutability between domestic and foreign tradable varieties, the presence of intra-industry trade implies that pronounced trade specialization patterns culminate in a loss of varieties. Accordingly, intra-industry trade acts to suppress inter-industry trade dynamics, thus realigning the behavior of standard models with the empirical evidence.
F43|Japan's productivity and GDP growth: The role of GBAORD, public and foreign R&D|We analyse the dynamic interaction of Japan's total factor productivity (TFP), GDP, domestic and foreign private and public R&D as well as mission-oriented R&D, GBAORD, in a cointegrated VAR for Japan with data from 1988-2014. Analysis of effects of permanent shocks shows that (i) public R&D, unlike GBAORD, encourages private R&D and TFP, and has high internal rates of return. (ii) Japan's public and private R&D have a statistically significant positive effect on foreign private and public R&D stocks and vice versa. (iii) After transitory GDP shocks, public and private R&D are counter-cyclical and GBAORD is pro-cyclical in Japan.
F43|Financial integration and the global effects of China's growth surge|China’s financial openness, as measured by cross border flows and asset ownership, peaked during its 2000s growth surge, as did downward pressure on global interest rates and price levels. This was despite China’s restriction of financial inflows to approved FDI and tight controls on private outflows. We analyze the global effects of the growth surge and their dependence on these financial policies by employing a global macro model with national portfolio rebalancing, in which flexibility in asset differentiation is used to index financial integration. The results suggest that, globally, the growth surge raised asset prices, reduced yields and bolstered deflationary pressures, while improving aggregate economic welfare. It is shown that, without capital controls, most surge effects on China would have been moderated substantially while the global impacts would have been larger.
F43|Identifying Sri Lanka’s Sources of Growth: The Application of Primal and Dual Total Factor Productivity Growth Accounting Approaches|This study aims to identify how much of economic growth is driven by improvement in Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in Sri Lanka, a small open economy, in comparison to other Asian economies. To examine this, aggregate TFP growth was calculated for Sri Lanka by using both primal and dual growth accounting frameworks. The study covers the period 1980-2016 and eight sub-periods, classified according to distinctive socio-economic-politico changes. For the whole period, TFP growth accounts for 45 percent of the total output growth. The annual average TFP growth rates under the primal and dual approaches are 2.3 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively. Though the growth accounting framework has limitations, the results were robust enough to draw comparative conclusions with those of other Asian countries. Sri Lanka’s TFP growth under both methods has been positive and higher than some Asian countries, except for China. Further, though Indonesia and Sri Lanka have similar per capita GDP levels, Sri Lanka’s TFP growth has been higher than that of Indonesia. Additionally, we show that the two growth drivers in Sri Lanka have been capital accumulation and productivity growth.
F43|SSP Long Run Scenarios for European NUTS2 Regions|In this paper we illustrate the development of a modeling framework aimed at producing detailed quantitative estimates for economic variables, consistent with Shared Socio-economic Pathways, and their assumptions about national income and population. Our model not only provides information on industrial production levels, employment, consumption patterns, trade flows and other macroeconomic variables, but disaggregates them further at the sub-national level, for European NUTS2 regions. Estimates are produced by an especially designed dynamic general equilibrium model (G-RDEM), augmented with a regional down-scaling module. The latter takes into account the different sectoral composition of the regional economies, their endowments of primary resources, as well as the possible existence of structural and agglomeration externalities. After describing the methodology, the paper presents an illustrative sample of results produced by the model, focusing on Italian regions and the Shared Socio-economic Pathway 1 in the period 2011-2051.
F43|Die Handelseffekte der österreichischen EU-Mitgliedschaft 25 Jahre nach der Volksabstimmung|"Am 12. Juni 1994 sprachen sich 66,6% der österreichischen Bevölkerung im Rahmen einer Volksabstimmung für einen Beitritt des Landes zur Europäischen Union aus. Am 1. Jänner 1995 trat Österreich der EU bei. 25 Jahre nach dieser Volksabstimmung versucht die vorliegende Studie die Handelseffekte und die damit einhergehenden Effekte der österreichischen EU-Mitgliedschaft auf BIP, Beschäftigung und Preise empirisch zu quantifizieren. Auf Basis eines Gravitationsmodells werden in einem ersten Schritt die Handelseffekte der österreichischen EU-Mitgliedschaft berechnet. Demnach tauscht Österreich langfristig mit den anderen EU-Mitgliedsländern um etwa 46% mehr Waren aus als in einer hypothetischen Situation ohne den Beitritt. Dieser Handelsimpuls wird in einem zweiten Schritt in das Input-Output-Modell des WIFO ""Adagio"" übertragen. Wie die Modellberechnungen zeigen, induzierte die österreichische EU-Mitgliedschaft durch die Steigerung des Außenhandels einen zusätzlichen jährlichen Wachstumsbeitrag von 0,7% des realen BIP."
F43|Fiscal multipliers and foreign holdings of public debt|This paper explores a natural connection between fiscal multipliers and foreign holdings of public debt. Although fiscal expansions can raise domestic economic activity through various channels, they can also have crowding-out effects if the resources used to acquire public debt reduce domestic consumption and investment. Thus, these crowding-out effects are likely to be weaker when public debt is purchased by foreigners. We test this hypothesis on (i) post-war US data and (ii) data for a panel of 17 advanced economies from the 1980’s to the present. To do so, we assemble a novel database of public debt holdings by domestic and foreign creditors for a large set of advanced economies. We combine this data with standard measures of fiscal policy shocks and show that, indeed, the size of fiscal multipliers is increasing in the share of public debt held by foreigners. In particular, the fiscal multiplier is smaller than one when the foreign share is low, such as in the U.S. in the 1950’s and 1960’s and Japan today, and larger than one when the foreign share is high, such as in the U.S. and Ireland today
F43|Real Exchange Rate Misalignment and Economic Growth : An Update|This paper empirically examines the relationship between real exchange rate misalignment and economic growth by using an updated data set over the sample period 1990-2014 for a large number of countries. Our findings indicate that the measure of real exchange rate misalignment is positively associated with economic growth for the low and middle-income countries whereas no significant relationship between these two for richer countries, implying the more overvalued the currency is over the long run, the lower the long-run growth rate of per capita income in developing countries. A plausible interpretation of this finding is that following the financial liberalization, large capital inflows and lending boom lead to appreciation of real exchange rates in the majority of developing countries. Prolonged real appreciation may result in lower long-run growth because of two channels: first, by changing resource allocation in favour of nontraded-goods sector it may reduce the long-term growth prospects; and second, by promoting private debt denominated in foreign currency it makes economy more vulnerable to external shocks, that is due to contractionary balance-sheet effects, a sudden and sharp real depreciation, which often happens in the boost cycle, may have a negative effect on output and growth.
F43|Uneven growth in the extensive margin: explaining the lag of agricultural economies|This paper documents that growth in the extensive margin is on average lower in the agricultural sector than in other activities. We introduce this new fact into a simple model of trade to show its relevance for regions specialized in the lagging sector. Diversity-loving consumers endogenously reduce the share of their expenditure devoted to that sector. The region specialized in it receives a decreasing share of world income, which results in diverging income and welfare trajectories with respect to the rest of the world. Appropriating a decreasing share of world value pushes downward the relative wage of the agricultural re- gion and lowers the price of its exports relative to that of its imports, resulting in terms of trade deterioration. This result, supported by empirical evidence, separates our theoretical results from those obtained in a similar model of un- even output growth between sectors. We present empirical evidence for the main testable results of the model. Our model is the first replicating these facts with- out the need of heterogeneous consumers or products, nor resorting to political or institutional explanations.
F43|The transmission of international shocks to CIS economies : A Global VAR approach|This paper employs a Global Vector Auto Regressive (GVAR) model to study the evolution of the response of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to foreign output and oil price shocks. During a two-decade observation period, cross-country trade and financial linkages experience no-table changes. We find CIS countries highly sensitive to global and regional shocks, with that sensitivity increasing after the global financial crisis. CIS countries show strongest responses to output shocks originating in the US, Russia and within the region itself, but their sensitivity to euro area shocks also increases substantially. Despite growing trade relations with China, the responses of CIS countries to output shocks originating in China are still relatively moderate.
F43|The Real Exchange Rate Policy Trilemma in Developing Economies|"This paper discusses some of the inter-temporal issues that arise in the pursuit of real undervaluation to achieve rapid development. Policy makers face a trade-off between achieving a capital stock target in a given amount of time on the one hand and boosting real wages and output in the short run, on the other. This generates a trilemma whereby development-focused policy makers can choose to pursue two out of three desirables: (1) use the real exchange rate as an instrument of development policy, (2) meet the development target within a politically relevant time frame, and (3) maintain political stability. The optimal path under a policy with ""unambitious"" aims will resemble the typical electoral business cycle trajectory whereby policy makers maintain real overvaluation over much of the cycle. By contrast, achieving relatively ambitious capital stock targets within a relatively short time requires the potentially unpopular strategy of choosing a highly undervalued real exchange rate at the beginning of the planning horizon and gradually increasing the degree of undervaluation thereafter as wages rise. Relevant structural differences between countries imply different initial levels of real undervaluation, distinct optimal trajectories over time, and hence, varying degrees of political trade-offs."
F43|The serendipity theorem for an endogenous open economy growth model|A Samuelsonian serendipity theorem for an endogenous growth model is derived. The formula for optimal population growth rate deviates from those of the model with exogenous population growth rates in a third best endogenous growth model of the Lucas type with imperfect international capital movements and human capital externalities. Calibration shows that the effect of variation of the exogenous population growth rates on other variables and the deviation of population growth rates from its optimal value are small. The reason is that labour supply, interest rates and technical change are endogenous. There is not much of an incentive for population growth policy unless Frisch parameters change with ageing.
F43|Natural, Effective and BOP-Constrained Rates of Growth: Adjustment Mechanisms and Closure Equations|The interaction between the effective (yE) and the natural rates of growth (yN) is a central partâ€”implicitly or explicitly addressedâ€”in all growth models. A stable equilibrium requires these two rates to converge; otherwise, one or more key macroeconomic variables would be rising or falling without bounds. In addition, the Keynesian tradition stressed the key role of the Balance-of-Payments constraint as a determinant of the equilibrium growth rate in the long run (yBP). This paper discusses alternative mechanisms through which these three growth rates converge and relates them to different theoretical approaches to the determinants of growth. With this objective, we extend the model suggested by Setterfield (2010) to include the evolution of the North-South technology gap and the pattern of specialization as key components of the Kaldorian productivity regime. The importance of the National System of Innovation in shaping the learning parameters and outcomes of the model is stressed, drawing from the Schumpeterian literature. A successful development strategy may emerge when the NSI enhances indigenous technological capabilities that allow the South economy to catch-up with the technological frontier.
F43|Oil Price Changes and U.S. Real GDP Growth: Is this Time Different?|This paper contributes to the large debate regarding the impact of oil price changes on U.S. GDP growth. Firstly, it replicates empirical findings of prominent studies and finds that the proposed oil price measures have a dissipating effect with recent data up to 2016Q4. Secondly, it re-examines the issue and provides evidence that oil price decreases affect the GDP growth, when taking into consideration mixed data sampling technique. Finally, it puts particular focus on nonlinearity and a possible instability and shows that combining Markov switching and mixed data sampling models allows to identify different regimes permanently changing with the Great Moderation.
F43|Attitudes Toward Climate Policies in a Macrodynamic Model of the Economy|In a recent article published in Ecological Economics, Guarini and Porcile (2016) expanded the Balance-of-Payments Constraint (BoPC) growth model in order to address the challenges posed by greenhouse gas emissions suggesting a way in which environmental variables can be included in the structure of this family of models. Building on their set up, we incorporate how people with di¤erent environmental attitudes or sentiments influence each other and contribute to the design of environmental policies. We detail the concept of transition probabilities for the agent's switching from pro- to anti-enviromental positions and vice-versa and discuss the macroeconomic results that follow. Numerical simulations allow us to investigate in more detail the implications of the validity of Porter's hypothesis as well as decoupling conditions.
F43|Impact of Trade Openness on Economic Growth: Empirical Evidence from South Africa|This paper examines the impact of trade openness on economic growth in South Africa. The study employs the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach to investigate the dynamic impact of trade openness on economic growth. Unlike some previous studies, the current study uses four proxies of trade openness, with each proxy addressing a different aspect of trade openness. The first proxy of trade openness is derived from the ratio of trade to gross domestic product (GDP). The second proxy is the ratio of exports to GDP, while the third proxy is the ratio of imports to GDP. The last proxy is an index of trade openness, which captures the effects of residual openness, resulting from taking the country’s size and geography into account. Based on the long run empirical results, this study finds that trade openness has a positive and significant impact on economic growth when the ratio of total trade to GDP is used as a proxy, but not when the three other proxies are employed. However, in the short-run, when the first three proxies of openness are used, the study finds trade openness to have a positive impact on economic growth, but not so when the trade openness index is employed. These results, therefore, suggest that the promotion of policies that support international trade is relevant in the South African economy. L’impatto dell’apertura commerciale sulla crescita: evidenze empiriche dal Sud Africa Questa ricerca esamina l’impatto dell’apertura commerciale sulla crescita in Sud Africa utilizzando il test ARDL (Autoregressive Distributed Lag). A differenza di studi precedenti, il presente lavoro utilizza quattro indici di apertura commerciale, ciascuno dei quali ne rappresenta un aspetto diverso. Il primo si ottiene dal rapporto commercio/PIL. Il secondo è rappresentato dal rapporto esportazioni/PIL, il terzo dal rapporto importazioni/PIL. L’ultimo è un indice di apertura commerciale che esprime gli effetti dell’apertura residuale ottenuta considerando la dimensione e le caratteristiche geografiche del paese. Sulla base di risultati empirici di lungo periodo questo studio rileva che l’apertura commerciale ha un effetto positivo significativo sulla crescita quando si utilizza l’indice ottenuto dal rapporto commercio totale/PIL, mentre tale effetto non emerge quando sono utilizzati gli altri tre indici. I risultati dello studio evidenziano che, nel breve periodo, se si utilizzano i primi tre indici risulta un impatto positivo sulla crescita, mentre ciò non si verifica quando viene impiegato il quarto indice.
F43|G-RDEM: A GTAP-Based Recursive Dynamic CGE Model for Long-Term Baseline Generation and Analysis|We motivate and detail the new GTAP-based recursive dynamic economic model (G-RDEM), a computable general equilibrium tool for long-term counterfactual analysis and baseline generation from given gross domestic product (GDP) and population projections. It encompasses an implicitly directly additive demand system (AIDADS) demand system with non-linear Engel curves, debt accumulation from foreign saving and introduces sector specific productivity changes, endogenous aggregate saving rates, as well as time-varying cost shares for value added and individual intermediates. Parameters for these relationships are econometrically estimated or taken from published work. The core of the model is derived from the Global Trade Anaylsis Project (GTAP) standard model and seamlessly incorporated into the modular and flexible CGEBox modelling platform, allowing for combined applications with various other extensions, such as GTAP-agro-ecological zones (AEZ) or GTAP-Water. G-RDEM maintains the flexible aggregation from the GTAP Data Base. It is open source, encoded in General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) and can be steered by a Graphical User Interface, which also encompasses a tool to analyse results with tables, graphs and maps. Existing GDP and population projections from the Socio-Economic Pathways (SSP) 1-5 can be directly incorporated for baseline construction. A comparison of the generated long-term structural composition of the economy against a simple recursive-dynamic variant, derived from the standard GTAP model, shows that G-RDEM brings about much more plausible results, as well as a more realistic, internally consistent representation of the economic structure in a hypothetical future.
F43|Exploring Long Run Structural Change with a Dynamic General Equilibrium Model|In this paper we present a computable general equilibrium model (G-RDEM), specifically designed for the generation of long run scenarios of economic development, featuring a non-homothetic demand system, endogenous saving rates, differentiated industrial productivity growth, interest payments on foreign debt and time-varying input-output coefficients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model of this kind. We illustrate how parameters of the five modules of structural change have been estimated, and we test the model by comparing its results with those obtained by a more conventional recursive dynamic CGE model. Both models are driven by the same GDP and population data, exogenously provided by the IPCC Shared Socio-economic Pathway 3. GDP levels determine the endogenous productivity parameters. Population affects the definition of per capita income, which in turn affects the household demand system and the variation of input-output coefficients. Information on the demographic structure is also employed to modify the aggregate saving rate parameters. It is found that the two models do produce different findings, both globally and at the regional and industrial level. Understanding the origins of such differences sheds some light on how mechanisms of structural change operate in the long run.
F43|Western Balkans EU Accession: Is the 2025 Target Date Realistic?|The European Commission has set a target date of 2025 for Western Balkan EU accession, while also outlining a broader new strategy which includes Brussels taking a more active role in solving political disputes in the region, and upgrading infrastructure as part of the Berlin Process. We welcome these moves economic underdevelopment in the region is closely tied to political fractures. Aside from resolving political conflicts, improved governance in the region will also be necessary. In terms of meeting economic accession criteria, the region faces a host of challenges, but we believe that a focus on upgrading infrastructure and developing a much bigger and more competitive industrial base should be the priorities. While the economic influence of third parties in the region is not as significant as often portrayed, this is not guaranteed to last, particularly in the case of China, which is set to increase its economic presence in the Western Balkans in the coming years. Even if the region takes a great leap forward towards the EU, there are other barriers in the way which could also hold back accession. Nevertheless, while the 2025 target represents a highly ambitious best-case scenario, it could serve as a powerful incentive for countries in the region to speed up their reform agendas. We do not completely rule out at least Montenegro and Serbia joining the bloc by 2025 or shortly thereafter.
F43|The Propagation of Regional Shocks in Housing Markets: Evidence from Oil Price Shocks in Canada|Shocks to the demand for housing that originate in one region may seem important only for that regional housing market. We provide evidence that such shocks can also affect housing markets in other regions. Our analysis focuses on the response of Canadian housing markets to oil price shocks. We document that, at the national level, real oil price shocks account for 11% of the variability in real house price growth over time. At the regional level, we find that unexpected increases in the real price of oil raise real house prices not only in oil-producing regions, but also in other regions. We develop a theoretical model of the propagation of real oil price shocks across regions that helps understand this finding. The model differentiates between oil-producing and non-oil-producing regions and incorporates multiple sectors, trade between provinces, government redistribution, and consumer spending on fuel. We empirically confirm the model prediction that oil price shocks are transmitted to housing markets in nonoil-producing regions by the government redistribution of oil revenue and by increased interprovincial trade.
F43|Subsahara-Afrika als Zielregion außenwirtschaftlicher Aktivitäten von kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen|Die Studie betrachtet die Wirtschaft der Staaten in Subsahara-Afrika, auf die nur 2 % des weltweiten Bruttoinlandsprodukts entfallen. Unter Nutzung statistischer Daten wird untersucht, ob deutsche Unternehmen Wirtschaftspartner in der Region fanden. Zwar haben mehrere Tausend KMU dahin Auslandsaktivitäten aufgebaut, das sind aber im weltweiten Vergleich und auch im Vergleich zu anderen europäischen Staaten vergleichsweise wenige. Rund 13.000 KMU exportieren Waren, aber lediglich 3.000 importieren Waren oder Rohstoffe aus der Region. Trotz der geringen Kaufkraft in vielen Staaten verfolgen deutsche KMU vorwiegend absatzbezogene Ziele in Afrika.
F43|Financialisation, distribution & the macroeconomic regimes before & after the crisis: A post-Keynesian view on Denmark, Estonia & Latvia|"Since the early 1980s, financialisation has become an increasingly important trend in developed capitalist countries, with different beginnings, speed and intensities in different countries. Rising inequality has been a major feature of this trend. Shares of wages in national income have declined and personal income inequality has increased. Against this background unsustainable demand and growth regimes have developed and dominated the major economies before the crisis: the ""debt-led private demand boom"" and the ""export-led mercantilist"" regime. The current paper applies this post-Keynesian approach on the macroeconomics of finance-dominated capitalism to three Baltic Sea countries, Denmark, Estonia and Latvia, both for the pre-crisis and the post-crisis period. First, the macroeconomics of finance-dominated capitalism are briefly reiterated. Second, the financialisation-distribution nexus is examined for the three countries. Third, macroeconomic demand and growth regimes are analysed, both before and after the crisis."
F43|The determinants of German exports: An analysis of intra- and extra-EMU trade|Since the early 2000s German exports and net exports have grown persistently, generating huge current account surpluses. These surpluses have added to immense current account imbalances within and outside the European Monetary Union (EMU). Contributing to the economic policy debate of whether it is foreign demand or 'world-beating' price competitiveness driving German exports, the present paper econometrically investigates the determinants of German intra- and extra-EMU exports for the period 1995 to 2014. The longterm relationship between real exports, foreign activity and the real effective exchange rate is estimated using different explanatory variables in an error correction framework. The results show that German exports are very sensitive to foreign activity. Germany has benefited from growth dynamics of trading partners and high income elasticities of demand for German exports indicate strong non-price competitiveness. With regard to exchange rate effects, we do not detect a significant impact of the real exchange rate on intra-EMU exports. However, our estimations provide a stable relationship between the real exchange rate and extra-EMU exports. We calculate that the real exchange rate only explains 12% to 25% of our predicted export growth. Moreover, taking into account quantity and price effects caused by changes in the real exchange rate, we observe contrary effects on real and nominal exports. Thus, for the German economy it cannot simply be concluded that the real exchange rate is the indicator to focus on in explaining German export success.
F43|Inequality and growth: Marxian and post-Keynesian/Kaleckian perspectives on distribution and growth regimes before and after the Great Recession|The re-distribution of income from labour to capital, from workers to top-managers, and from low income households to the rich has been an important feature of financedominated capitalism since the early 1980s. After the Great Financial Crisis and the Great Recession in 2007-9, the recovery has been sluggish so far, and this has given rise to a renewed discussion about stagnation tendencies in capitalist economies. In orthodox approaches income distribution only has a restricted role to play, if at all, but the interaction between distribution and growth is at the centre of Marxian and post-Keynesian/Kaleckian approaches when it comes to explaining medium- to long-run trends of economic growth - and stagnation. In this contribution we will thus provide Marxian and Kaleckian assessments of the distribution and growth regimes under finance-dominated capitalism, both before and after the recent crisis. Finally, we also sketch an interpretation of stagnation tendencies in a demand-led endogenous growth model with Kaleckian, Kaldorian and Marxian features.
F43|On the empirics of reserve requirements and economic growth|Reserve requirements, as a tool of macroprudential policy, have been increasingly employed since the outbreak of the great financial crisis. We conduct an analysis of the effect of reserve requirements in tranquil and crisis times on long-run growth rates of GDP per capita and credit (%GDP) making use of Bayesian model averaging methods. Regulation has on average a negative effect on GDP in tranquil times, which is only partly offset by a positive (but not robust effect) in crisis times. Credit over GDP is positively affected by higher requirements in the longer run.

F43|Mercado eléctrico en Colombia: transición hacia una arquitectura descentralizada|El sector eléctrico de Colombia se transformó profunda y positivamente con la reforma de las Leyes 142 y 143 de 1994. La liberalización del mercado, la introducción de formación de precios competitiva en generación, la regulación por incentivos en transmisión y distribución, los avances institucionales en regulación (creación de la CREG) y en supervisión de las firmas reguladas (SSPD) sirvieron de inspiración internacional por lo menos durante cinco años. Con el tiempo se han acumulado problemas y han aparecido oportunidades de mejora del mercado. Hay que aumentar la competencia, diversificar el portafolio de generación, ayudar a monetizar los recursos locales embebidos en las redes de distribución y modernizar la arquitectura de mercado y la regulación. El trabajo consta de cinco capítulos, además de este resumen. El capítulo 1 presenta las características de la electricidad como bien económico y compara la evolución del mercado eléctrico del Reino Unido (la experiencia original) con el de Colombia. El capítulo 2 discute los problemas centrales del modelo colombiano. El capítulo 3 identifica oportunidades. El capítulo 4 compila las propuestas. El capítulo 5 concluye. Los mensajes centrales del trabajo son: • Los precios de generación son crecientes y la competencia es baja. • El portafolio de generación está alejado de la frontera eficiente de costos y riesgos. • El mecanismo de entrada (cargo por confiabilidad) es ineficaz para tecnologías que pueden reducir el riesgo de suministro y los costos de generación. • La arquitectura de mercado y la regulación están desactualizadas. • Las energías renovables, los recursos energéticos descentralizados y el impulso a la generación con gas licuado solucionarán problemas y crearán opciones.
F43|La contribución del petróleo al desarrollo de Colombia. Mirada a las regiones productoras|En los últimos 20 años, el petróleo ha contribuido al desarrollo de Colombia. La contribución de los hidrocarburos a la economía colombiana se da en varios niveles: en el macroeconómico, contribuyen a la dinámica de las exportaciones y de la inversión extranjera, así como a las finanzas públicas; en el mesoeconómico, a través de sus multiplicadores, demanda insumos de otros sectores así como contribuye en la producción de otros bienes y. en el nivel regional, genera actividad y empleo, así como regalías para financiar gasto público.
F43|Evaluación de los impactos causados en las regiones productoras de hidrocarburos y minerales con el actual Sistema General de Regalías|"Este estudio tiene como ""objetivo principal evaluar los impactos causados en las regiones productoras de hidrocarburos y minerales vis a vis las regiones no productoras. Para cumplir los objetivos mencionados este informe está dividido en 6 partes incluyendo esta introducción. El siguiente capítulo presenta el funcionamiento actual del SGR. Primero se presenta las reglas de distribución entre y al interior de los fondos; posteriormente se presentan algunas estadísticas que describen la importancia de las regalías para los entes territoriales (ET); por último, se presentan los hallazgos y percepciones de los actores sobre el funcionamiento del esquema de distribución. Esto último se hace mediante el análisis cualitativo de cerca de 80 entrevistas en todas las regiones del país y sus representantes en la Federación Nacional de Departamentos y Municipios, congresistas y expertos en el tema. El capítulo 3 presenta el núcleo central de la evaluación de impacto y el análisis costo beneficio con el objeto de comparar si los costos están compensados por los beneficios estimados. El capítulo comienza presentando las percepciones que tienen las regiones sobre los impactos de los cambios experimentados a partir del nuevo esquema de distribución desde 2012; con este objetivo se entrevistaron a los secretarios de planeación de las regiones productoras y no productoras para contrastar los efectos no observados entre estas dos tipologías (sección 3.1). La evaluación de impacto cuantitativa recurre a un ejercicio de diferencias en diferencias para comparar la evolución de los municipios productores vis a vis los no productores antes y después de la reforma. Este ejercicio tiene como objeto evaluar la hipótesis de que los municipios productores son “perdedores” de las modificaciones del SGR. Teniendo en cuenta algunas de las críticas que se han hecho al nuevo SGR, en el sentido de la baja ejecución de recursos, el ejercicio se amplía a triples diferencias para conocer el impacto de la reforma sobre los municipios ejecutores de recursos; en este sentido se evalúa si la doble condición de productor y ejecutor tiene efectos positivos sobre las variables de ingresos, empleo, educación y salud de los municipios (variables de desarrollo socioeconómico). Esto último comparando los resultados con i) los productores no ejecutores, ii) no productores ejecutores (ganadores directos), iii) no productores no ejecutores (ganadores que no han aprovechado la reforma Este mismo capítulo presenta un análisis de los costos sociales y ambientales en que incurren los municipios que explotan estos recursos minero-energéticos, a través de la información de la evaluación económica de los impactos que deben presentar todos los proyectos de explotación a la ANLA para recibir las licencias ambientales (sección 3.3). Con los costos reportados a la ANLA se contrasta si las pérdidas del proyecto son mayores a las ganancias (incluidos los impactos estimados mediante el panel de datos mencionados anteriormente). El ejercicio finaliza con las estimaciones de la relación beneficio-costo y la TIR (sección 3.4). Posteriormente se presentan los escenarios de simulaciones cuyo objetivo es identificar aquellas condiciones bajo las cuales la distribución entre fondos alcanza una mayor equidad en la distribución de recursos (capítulo 4). La medición de equidad consiste en sumar a los ingresos tributarios municipales per cápita las asignaciones per cápita de regalías en cada escenario simulado (por ejemplo, al quitarle un porcentaje a un fondo y transferirlo a otro) y recalcular el coeficiente Gini de la distribución original de ingresos tributarios. Así mismo, se hacen simulaciones modificando las condiciones de NBI, población y desempleo que se utilizan al interior de los fondos (por ejemplo, que sucedería con el nuevo Gini si todos los recursos se entregaran por la condición de NBI sin tener en cuenta a la población). El capítulo 5 presenta un análisis comparativo de la compensación a las regiones productoras frente a experiencias internacionales y el capítulo 6 presenta las conclusiones más relevantes del estudio."""

F43|Transacciones internacionales de energía eléctrica: oportunidades de crecimiento con vistas a la integración eléctrica colombo – centroamericana|El presente documento constituye una primera búsqueda sobre las potencialidades del crecimiento del sector eléctrico en Colombia encaminado a la exportación continua y creciente de energía eléctrica a los mercados de Centroamérica. Para empezar, se realiza una descripción sobre el panorama en materia de oferta y demanda de energía a nivel centroamericano con el fin de encontrar vacíos en la oferta del mercado que pudiesen ser suplidos por el sector eléctrico nacional. En seguida, se realiza una descripción sobre el estado actual de la generación y la transmisión de energía eléctrica a nivel nacional. En este apartado se incluye la mención al proyecto de transmisión de energía Colombia – Panamá. Tercero, se estudian algunas ventajas económicas que el país podría tener en términos comerciales y posibles marcos regulatorios ya existentes. Por último, se presentan algunas conclusiones.
F43|Determinantes de la productividad multifactorial: los casos de las principales economías latinoamericanas y emergentes de Asia (1960 - 2015)|Resumen: El objetivo de este trabajo fue explicar el mayor o menor ritmo de crecimiento de la productividad total de los factores (PTF) en las principales economías del este asiático y latinoamericanas entre 1960 y 2015. Encontramos evidencia econométrica favorable a una hipótesis: el aumento del gasto público de consumo, dada la evolución de otros factores, tiene un efecto negativo sobre la PTF. Otros resultados del ejercicio econométrico, aquellos relativos a hipotéticos efectos positivos de la inversión pública y de las importaciones sobre la PTF, no fueron, unos, tan robustos, ni, otros, tan confiables como hubiésemos esperado. / Abstract : The objective of this paper was to explain the greater or lesser growth rate of total factor productivity, TFP, in the main East Asian and Latin American economies between 1960 and 2015. We found econometric evidence favorable to this hypothesis: the increase in public consumption expenditures, given the evolution of other factors, reduces the TFP. Other results of the econometric exercise, those that are related to hypothetical positive effects of public investment and imports on TFP were not as robust or as reliable as we would have expected.
F43|Mercado eléctrico en Colombia: Transición hacia una arquitectura descentralizada|El sector eléctrico de Colombia avanzó notablemente con la reforma de las Leyes 142 y 143 de 1994. Se introdujeron mecanismos de mercado en generación, se regularon las actividades de transmisión y distribución, y se llegó a la solvencia económica de las empresas sectoriales. Por lo menos durante cinco años, el mercado eléctrico sirvió de modelo para reformas internacionales. Con el paso del tiempo, los mercados y la regulación eléctrica han avanzado en Colombia con menos velocidad que en muchos otros países y se han acumulado problemas. Se debe aumentar la competencia en generación, se debe promover la configuración de un portafolio de generación más diversificado, se deben promover con mayor vigor las energías renovables no convencionales y preparar el camino para una arquitectura de mercado en que convivan el sistema de potencia centralizado y descentralizados, sin restricciones a la comercialización de excedentes de recursos distribuidos. El trabajo consta de cinco capítulos, además de este resumen. El capítulo 1 presenta las características de la electricidad como bien económico y compara la evolución del mercado eléctrico del Reino Unido (la experiencia original) con el de Colombia. El capítulo 2 discute los problemas centrales del modelo colombiano. El capítulo 3 identifica oportunidades. El capítulo 4 compila las propuestas. El capítulo 5 concluye. Las medidas específicas más importantes que surgen del presente trabajo son: (i) la introducción de un mercado de contratos estandarizados y anónimos, (ii) la introducción de planificación integrada de recur-sos, con un enfoque de portafolio, (iii) la construcción de una planta regasificadora en la Costa Pacífica, (iv) introducción de medidas habilitantes para la adopción de recursos energéticos descentralizados, que incluye la introducción de medidores inteligentes, precios nodales, entre otras; y (v) realización de pilotos con operadores de distribución y con agregadores de recursos descentralizados.
F43|The US Gains from Trade: Valuation Using the Demand for Foreign Factor Services|About eight cents out of every dollar spent in the United States is spent on imports. What if, because of a wall or some other extreme policy intervention, imports were to remain on the other side of the US border? How much would US consumers be willing to pay to prevent this hypothetical policy change from taking place? The answer to this question represents the welfare cost from autarky or, equivalently, the welfare gains from trade. In this article, we discuss how to evaluate these gains using estimates of the demand for foreign factor services.
F43|The propagation of regional shocks in housing markets: Evidence from oil price shocks in Canada|Shocks to the demand for housing that originate in one region may seem important only for that regional housing market. We provide evidence that such shocks can also affect housing markets in other regions. Our analysis focuses on the response of Canadian housing markets to oil price shocks. Oil price shocks constitute an important source of exogenous regional variation in income in Canada because oil production is highly geographically concentrated. We document that, at the national level, real oil price shocks account for 11% of the variability in real house price growth over time. At the regional level, we find that unexpected increases in the real price of oil raise housing demand and real house prices not only in oil-producing regions, but also in other regions. We develop a theoretical model of the propagation of real oil price shocks across regions that helps understand this finding. The model differentiates between oil-producing and non-oil-producing regions and incorporates multiple sectors, trade between provinces, government redistribution, and consumer spending on fuel. We empirically confirm the model prediction that oil price shocks are propagated to housing markets in non-oil-producing regions by the government redistribution of oil revenue and by increased interprovincial trade.
F43|Innovation and Trade Policy in a Globalized World|How do import tariffs and R&D subsidies help domestic firms compete globally? How do these policies affect aggregate growth and economic welfare? To answer these questions, the paper builds a dynamic general equilibrium growth model where firm innovation endogenously determines the dynamics of technology, and, therefore, market leadership and trade flows, in a world with two large open economies at different stages of development. Firmsâ€™ R&D decisions are driven by (i) the defensive innovation motive, (ii) the expansionary innovation motive, and (iii) technology spillovers. The theoretical investigation illustrates that, statically, globalization (defined as reduced trade barriers) has ambiguous effects on welfare, while, dynamically, intensified globalization boosts domestic innovation through induced international competition.
F43|The real exchange rate, innovation and productivity : regional heterogeneity, asymmetries and hysteresis|We evaluate manufacturing firms' responses to changes in the real exchange rate (RER) using detailed firm-level data for a large set of countries for the period 2001-2010. We uncover the following stylized facts: In export-oriented emerging Asia, real depreciations are associated with faster growth of firm-level TFP, higher sales and cash-flow, and higher probabilities to engage in R&D and to export. We find negative effects for firms in other emerging economies, which are relatively more import dependent, and no significant effects for firms in industrialized economies. Motivated by these facts, we build a dynamic model in which real depreciations raise the cost of importing intermediates, affect demand, borrowing-constraints and the profitability of engaging in innovation (R&D). We decompose the effects of RER changes on productivity growth across regions into these channels. We estimate the model and quantitatively evaluate the different mechanisms by providing counterfactual simulations of temporary RER movements and conduct several robustness analyses. Effects on physical TFP growth, while different across regions, are non-linear and asymmetric.
F43|Evaluating the Economic Cost of Coastal Flooding|Sea-level rise and ensuing permanent coastal inundation will cause spatial shifts in population and economic activity over the next 200 years. Using a highly spatially disaggregated, dynamic model of the world economy that accounts for the dynamics of migration, trade, and innovation, this paper estimates the consequences of probabilistic projections of local sea‐level changes under different emissions scenarios. Under an intermediate greenhouse gas concentration trajectory (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 4.5), permanent flooding is projected to reduce global real GDP by an average of 0.22% in present value terms, with welfare declining by as much as 0.76% as people move to places with less attractive amenities. By the year 2200 a projected 0.79% of world population will be displaced (with a 95% credible interval 0.20%‐1.51%). Losses in many coastal localities are more than an order of magnitude larger, e.g., 10% of 10 x 10 coastal cells lose more than 8% of real GDP in present discounted value terms.
F43|Structural transformation to manufacturing and services: what role for trade?|Understanding how and why economies structurally transform as they grow is crucial for sound national policy making. Typically analysts of this issue focus on sectoral shares of GDP and employment. This paper extends that to include exports, including of services. It also considers mining in addition to agriculture and manufacturing, and recognizes some of the products of those four sectors are nontradable. The theory section’s general equilibrium model provides hypotheses about structural change in different types of economies as they grow, and tests them econometrically with annual data for a sample of 117 countries for the period 1991-2014. The results point to the futility of adopting protective policies aimed at slowing de-agriculturalization and subsequent de-industrialization in terms of sectoral shares, since those trends inevitably will accompany economic growth. Fortuitously governments now have far more efficient and equitable ways of supporting the adjustments needed by people choosing or being pushed to leave declining industries.
F43|International Relocation of Production and Growth|The relocation of production and exports from the North to the South has been a central feature of economic globalization. Using data on approximately 5,000 products, this paper describes this process over the 1996-2014 period and assesses its impact on cross-country growth. Although increased competition from lower income countries tended to have a significant negative effect on the previous exporting countries of the relocated products, most rich countries were able to upgrade their export baskets and avoid a negative aggregate impact. A one-standard negative deviation in a country's export relocation index tended to reduce the country's annual growth by 0.3 percentage points at the median country income but had zero impact at the top of the country income distribution. Medium and low income countries were the most negatively affected by the increased competition from their pair countries.
F43|Long Run Growth in Haiti|In this paper, we first assess the historical evolution of total factor productivity in Haiti and then consider alternative scenarios related to accelerating growth. Specifically, we focus on issues of intertemporal coordination between population growth, TFP (Total Factor Productivity), capital accumulation, foreign debt, output, and consumption. To that end, we developed a model of the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans type. This class of models are the workhorse of most contemporary work in modeling the long and very long term growth of countries (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004 and Acemoglu 2009). In doing so, we make two contributions to the empirical economic analysis of developing countries such as Haiti: (a) we estimate Haiti’s capital stock and perform a growth accounting exercises using data that goes back to the 1950s; and (b) we built a 2016 macro consistent dataset and use it to calibrate a long-run growth model for a small open economy such as Haiti.
F43|Tokenomics: Dynamic Adoption and Valuation|We provide a dynamic asset-pricing model of (crypto-)tokens on (blockchain-based) platforms, and highlight their roles on endogenous user adoption. Tokens intermediate transactions on decentralized networks, and their trading creates an inter-temporal complementarity among users, generating a feedback loop between token valuation and platform adoption. Consequently, tokens capitalize future platform growth, accelerate adoption, and reduce user-base volatility. Equilibrium token price increases non-linearly in platform productivity, user heterogeneity, and endogenous network size. The model also produces explosive growth of user base after an initial period of dormant adoption, accompanied by a run-up of token price volatility. We further discuss how our framework can be used to discuss cryptocurrency supply, token competition, and pricing assets under network externality.
F43|Follow the leader: Evidence of the Productivity catch-up of European firms|In this article we characterize Total Factor Productivity (TFP) frontier firms at the industry level within the European Union during the period 2003-2014, and explore the determinants of the firms’ distance to the frontier. We find that larger, more capital-intensive, and more labour skilled firms are closer to the productivity frontier. In contrast, older firms are further away from the frontier. In addition, we obtain that a number of countries' economic and institutional factors, such as tertiary education, trade openness, R&D stock, easiness in getting credit and governance quality, affect positively the catching up of laggards towards the productivity frontier. We also examine the moderating effect of the Great Recession as well as the effect of productivity improvements at the frontier.
F43|Frankel and Romer revisited|Frankel and Romer (1999) proposed an instrument variable for trade intensity to robustly assess the causal impact of international trade on standards of living. The instrument is based on OLS estimates of the gravity equation and has been widely used in the literature. In this note I show that the instrument is unrelated to income in the mid-2000s. Re-estimating the gravity equation using PPML, I show that the resulting instrument is strongly related to GDP per capita, but weakly correlated with trade, suggesting that what is captured may be a direct link between geography and income.
F43|Agricultural Productivity and Structural Change: Is Relative Sectoral Price the Mirror Image of Relative Sectoral Productivity?|We have examined the role of sectoral productivity in explaining the process of structural change and relative sectoral prices. Our simple two- sector general equilibrium model demonstrates that an improvement in agricultural productivity can relocate labour away from this sector. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that relative sectoral prices are a mirror image of relative sectoral productivities, we showed a U-shaped relation- ship between them. We estimated our model parameters using the simu- lated method of moments. Our model could largely replicate the farm versus non-farm relative price movement and the agricultural labour share of US economic history. JEL Classification: F43, O11, O41. Key Words: Agricultural productivity, Structural transformation, manufacturing productivity, Terms
F43|Women empowerment and good times: Which one leads to the other?|Does substantial women empowerment lead to significant output, or do good times lead to women empowerment? Using a panel VAR study as well as a comprehensive gender gap index and its sub-indices from the World Economic Forum, this study investigates the association between gender gap and per capita output for OECD countries, developing countries, as well as Latin American and African countries. Results confirm the existence of bidirectional Granger causality between gender gap and output. On the one hand, good times encourage equity for both sexes. On the other hand, women empowerment helps middle- and low-income countries prosper and significantly improve their human capital, which, in turn, drives long-run economic growth. Moreover, the Latin American and African nations show qualitatively similar but quantitatively greater responses compared with developing nations. By contrast, closing the gender gap negatively affects OECD output. For the sample of developing countries, the aforementioned results are robust to sub-indices measured by gender gap in economic participation as well as opportunity, educational attainment, and political empowerment. We recommend that gender policies specifically aim at eliminating gaps in female education.
F43|The Growth Slowdown and the Working of Inflation Targeting in India|The paper presents a variety of indicators to show that demand constrained output during the period of growth slowdown 2011-17. It also draws on research to show the macroeconomic structure of the economy is such that a policy induced demand contraction affects output more than it affects inflation. In this context it evaluates the application and working of inflation targeting. The framework agreed to was flexible inflation targeting but it was too narrowly and strictly implemented initially, although there are signs of moderation in 2018. There was too much emphasis on a weak aggregate demand channel to reduce inflation. Since inflation forecasts were biased upwards the more effective expectations anchoring channel of inflation targeting was under-utilized. Space available due to positive commodity shocks was not made use of so that the negative output gap further widened, even as potential output itself fell. The output sacrifice imposed was therefore higher than necessary. Finally, possible mechanisms to ensure IT is implemented flexibly as required in the Indian context are discussed.
F43|The role of openness in economic growth of regions. The perspectives of economic growth and new economic geography theory and empirics|The bond between economic growth and openness of regions is a complex and to some extent ambiguous both from theoretical and empirical perspectives. The relationship becomes even more blurred if we take into account spatial nonlinearity into account. In the present paper we critically review the theoretical and empirical literature in the two strands – economic growth and new economic geography. It seems that thee analysis of the impact of openness on economic growth of regions should take into account the various potential channels, try to prove the direction of causality and acknowledge the presence of spatial interlinkages between regions. This is in particular important for mid-size and large-size economies with a significant number of regions and large regional heterogeneity frequently due to more deep-rooted factors. It implies the use of spatial econometric techniques.
F43|The KOF Globalisation Index â€“ Revisited|In this paper we present and describe the revised version of the KOF Globalisation Index, a composite index measuring globalisation for every country in the world along the economic, social and political dimension. The original index was introduced by Dreher (2006) and updated in Dreher et al. (2008). This second revision of the index introduces the differentiation between de facto and de jure measures along the different dimensions of globalisation, the differentiation between trade and financial globalisation within the economic dimension of globalisation and time-varying weighting of the variables entering the index. Finally, the revised version incorporates several additional variables in the construction process. At the aggregate level, we show that a bidirectional relationship between de facto and de jure globalisation exists.
F43|Highly Skilled International Migration, STEM Workers, and Innovation|This paper studies the implications of highly skilled labor international migration in a two-country Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model. The model considers hree types of workers: STEM workers, non-STEM college educated workers, and non-college educated workers. Only high skilled workers can move internationally from the relative low productivity (sending) country to the high productivity (host) country. Aggregate productivity in each economy is a function of innovations, which can be produced only by STEM workers. The model predicts i) the existence of a wage premium of STEM workers relative to non-STEM college educated workers, ii) this wage premium is higher in the destination country and increases with positive technological shocks, iii) a reduction in migration costs increases output, wages and total labor in the destination country, with opposite effects in the country of origin, and iv) high skilled immigrants reduce skilled native labor and do not affect unskilled labor.
F43|Deviations in real exchange rate levels in the OECD countries and their structural determinants|We study the validity of an augmented Balassa-Samuelson theory in a panel of real exchange rate levels across 17 OECD countries between 1970 and 2012 using a unique panel of levels of total factor productivity (TFP) across sectors. We find that real exchange rates can be explained by relative sectoral TFP levels both across countries and over time in the direction predicted by Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis. We also show that drivers of labour wedges such as structural labour market differences are important in explaining real exchange rate levels. Nevertheless, large average conditional deviations in real exchange rate levels remain across countries in our sample.
F43|Inflation-Growth Nexus in Botswana: Can Lower Inflation Really Spur Growth in the Country?|Does inflation affect economic growth in Botswana over the short-run and long-run? In applying bounds procedure for modelling ARDL cointegation effects applied to empirical data collected between 1975 and 2016 we find that this hypothesis does not hold true for Botswana as inflation is found to be insignificantly related with economic growth over both the short and long-run. Our growth equation estimates point to exports (positive), government size (negative) and an Pula/Dollar exchange rate (negative) as being significantly correlated with steady-state GDP growth. Further empirical exercises show that an appreciated Pula/dollar exchange rate increases inflation whilst bearing no effect on economic growth. Conversely, a depreciated Pula/Dollar exchange simultaneously decreases inflation and economic growth for the Botswana economy. Policymakers should be this aware that attainment of lower inflation rates which occurs through a depreciated Pula/Dollar currency will only retard economic growth.
F43|Highly Skilled International Migration, STEM Workers, and Innovation|This paper studies the implications of highly skilled labor international migration in a two-country Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model. The model considers three types of workers: STEM workers, non-STEM college educated workers, and non-college educated workers. Only high skilled workers can move internationally from the relative low productivity (sending) country to the high productivity (host) country. Aggregate productivity in each economy is a function of innovations, which can be produced only by STEM workers. The model predicts i) the existence of a wage premium of STEM workers relative to non-STEM college educated workers, ii) this wage premium is higher in the destination country and increases with positive technological shocks, iii) a reduction in migration costs increases output, wages and total labor in the destination country, with opposite e¤ects in the country of origin, and iv) high skilled immigrants reduce skilled native labor and do not a¤ect unskilled labor.
F43|Natural Resources, Economic Growth and Geography|In this paper we discuss the relationship between economic growth and natural resources at a global level, taking into account geography. With this aim, our model integrates elements of the theories of endogenous growth, natural resources and new economic geography. We find that an increase in the world growth rate can lead to a higher depletion of the natural resources following an increase in the world demand due to expansion in population. However, the consideration of geography and growth mechanisms make the relationship between growth and natural resources more complex, and can even lead to the opposite conclusion when the forces behind growth are different from world demand. Indeed, either a reduction in transport costs or an increase in R&D productivity appears to be able to generate a faster growth compatible with a lower depletion of natural resources.
F43|Does financial sector development affect the growth gains from trade opennes?|A sizeable literature suggests that financial sector development could be an important enabler of the growth benefits of trade openness. We provide a comprehensive analysis of how financial development can affect the relationship between trade openness and growth using a dynamic panel threshold model and an extensive dataset for a large sample of countries for the 1970-2015 period. We find that there is a financial development threshold in which trade openness has a positive and significant effect on economic growth. We also find that when splitting the sample into industrialized and non-industrialized countries, the financial development threshold that enables the growth benefits of trade is higher in the former group of countries than in the latter. This finding is consistent with the fact that the export composition of industrialized countries is tilted towards more capital-intensive finance-constrained goods.
F43|The tourism and economic growth enigma: Examining an ambiguous relationship through multiple prisms|The current literature on the tourism-economic growth causal relationship is rather contested. Thus, the aim of this paper is to revisit this ambiguous relationship from a more holistic view, providing a comprehensive study of destinations across the globe which takes into account the key dynamics that influence tourism and economic performance. More specifically, we focus on 113 countries over the period 1995â€“2011, grouped into clusters based on six criteria, which reflect their economic, political and tourism dimensions. A Panel Vector Autoregressive model is employed to reveal the tourismâ€“economy interdependencies across these clusters. Overall, the economicâ€“driven tourism growth hypothesis seems to prevail in most cases, although some shortâ€“lived bidirectional causalities are also identified. Thus, depending on the economic, political and tourism status of a destination, different policy implications apply.
F43|Does FDI crowd out domestic investment in transition countries?|The aim of this paper is to empirically investigate the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and domestic investment in a sample of 10 Central and Eastern European countries over the period 1995–2015. We find FDI to lead to a creative destruction phenomenon, with a short‐term crowding out effect on domestic investment, followed by a long‐term crowding in. Greenfield FDI develops stronger long‐run complementarities with domestic investment, while mergers and acquisitions do not show a significant effect on domestic investment. Financial development seems to mitigate crowding out pressures and even foster a crowding in for mergers and acquisitions.
F43|The Transmission of International Shocks to CIS Economies: A Global VAR Approach|This paper employs a Global Vector Auto Regressive (GVAR) model to study the evolution of the response of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to foreign output and oil price shocks. During a two-decade observation period, cross-country trade and financial linkages experience notable changes. We find CIS countries highly sensitive to global and regional shocks, with that sensitivity increasing after the global financial crisis. CIS countries show strongest responses to output shocks originating in the US, Russia and within the region itself, but their sensitivity to euro area shocks also increases substantially. Despite growing trade relations with China, the responses of CIS countries to output shocks originating in China are still relatively moderate.
F43|Financial Dollarization in Emerging Markets: An Insurance Arrangement|Households in emerging markets hold significant amounts of dollar deposits while firms have significant amounts of dollar debt. Motivated by the perceived dangers, policymakers often develop regulations to limit dollarization. In this paper, I draw attention to an important benefit of dollarization, which should be taken into account when crafting regulations. I argue that dollarization repre- sents an insurance arrangement in which the entrepreneurs that own firms pro- vide income insurance to households. Emerging market exchange rates tend to depreciate in a recession so that dollar deposits in effect provide households with income insurance. With their preference for holding deposits denominated in dol- lars, households effectively starve local financial markets of local currency, which raises local interest rates. By raising local currency interest rates, they cause entrepreneurs to borrow in dollars. Consistent with my argument, countries in which the exchange depreciates in a recession have a higher level of deposit and credit dollarization. In those countries, I verify that the premium of the local interest rate over the dollar interest rate is higher. This premium is the price paid by households for insurance.
F43|Simulating U.S. Business Cash Flow Taxation in a 17-Region Global Model|This paper uses the Global Gaidar Model to simulate replacing a territorial corporate income tax with a wealth tax imposed in the form of a destination-based Business Cash Flow Tax. According to the model, the reform produces, over a decade, increases in the capital stock, GDP, and pre-tax wages for high- and low-skilled workers of 20.5 percent, 6.8 percent, 6.3 and 7.5 percent, respectively. Young workers benefit greatly from the change, and welfare loss for retirees is limited. The initially revenue neutral tax reform raises enough additional revenue over time to permit a reduction in personal income tax rates.
F43|Oil price volatility, financial institutions and economic growth|Theory attributes finance with the ability to both promote growth and reduce output volatility, and therefore increase energy security. But evidence is mixed, partly due to endogeneity effects. For example, financial institutions themselves might be a source of volatility, as the events of 2008 suggest. We address this endogeneity issue by using periods of extreme oil price volatility as a source of nearly exogenous volatility, to study the effect of finance. To do this, we develop a quasi-natural experiment and study the effect of the dramatic decline of oil prices in 2014, using a synthetic control methodology. Our hypothesis is that the ability of oil-rich countries to mitigate the effects of this decline rested on the quality of their financial institutions. We focus on 11 oil-rich countries between 2006Q1 and 2016Q4 that had “poor” measures of financial development (treatment group) out of 20 such countries and synthetically create counterfactuals from the remaining (control) group with “superior” financial development. We subject both to the oil price shock of 2014 and find evidence that better financial institutions do indeed reduce output volatility and mitigate its negative effect on growth in the year that showed a sustained decline in oil price. To address any remaining potential endogeneity between oil prices and finance, we use a cross-sectionally augmented autoregressive distributed lag model with data on 30 oil-producing countries over the period 1980–2016, and confirm that the effects of oil volatility on growth is mitigated with better financial institutions. Our results make a strong case for the support of the positive role of financial development in improving energy security and fostering growth.
F43|"A Comment on Oulton, ""The UK Productivity Puzzle: Does Arthur Lewis Hold the Key?"""|"In Version One of his new paper, Oulton merges supply-side and demand-side theoretical models as a means better to understand why, since the financial crisis that broke in 2007, the UK’s productivity growth has not only been negligible but also a very poor outlier judged by international experience. Drawing on Arthur Lewis’s famous model of development, Oulton concludes, ""rapid rates of immigration in conjunction with low rates of growth of export demand in the aftermath of the Great Recession can explain the UK productivity puzzle"". According to Oulton, the UK's relatively poor productivity performance is attributable to a combination of the export demand constraint and of the continued growth of labour supply, which led to capital shallowing - a reduction in the rate of growth of capital services per hour worked. Bill Martin concludes, alas, that Arthur Lewis does not hold the key. The dominant, proximate ""explanation"" of the UK's relatively poor performance is relatively weak Total Factor Productivity (TFP), not relatively weak capital intensity. Moreover, the UK was not relatively more exposed to export demand shocks but delivered relatively worse output growth outcomes. Oulton nevertheless articulates the profound idea that full-employment capacity has adjusted to weak effective demand arising from adverse global developments. If this deep insight is correct, TFP would be a ""measure of our ignorance"" of the mechanisms that drove productive capacity to align with low aggregate demand."
F43|Does Real Exchange Rate Undervaluation Really Promote Economic Growth?|This article seeks to reassess the empirical literature on real exchange rate misalignment and growth in light of the extensive discussion about the relationship between income distribution and growth in developing economies. We state that the relationship between changes in the real exchange rate and growth can be characterised by two conflicting partial effects, as follows: i) undervaluation stimulates technological change and knowledge spillovers, thus affecting positively output growth; ii) undervaluation raises income inequality and hence harms output growth. Though there are a vast number of empirical studies presenting robust evidence of a positive relationship between currency undervaluation and growth for developing economies, none has yet explicitly considered the potentially negative distributional effects of undervaluation on growth. Our empirical model adds to this literature by suggesting that, once both functional income distribution and the level of technological capabilities are explicitly taken into account, the direct impact of real exchange rate misalignment on growth becomes statistically non-significant for a sample of developing countries. Further, based on our results, we state that the real exchange rate only affects growth indirectly through its impacts on functional income distribution and technological innovation. Our estimates have shown that the indirect impact of undervaluation on growth in developing countries is negatively signed.
F43|The KOF Globalisation Index – revisited|Abstract We introduce the revised version of the KOF Globalisation Index, a composite index measuring globalization for every country in the world along the economic, social and political dimension. The original index was introduced by Dreher (Applied Economics, 38(10):1091–1110, 2006) and updated in Dreher et al. (2008). This second revision of the index distinguishes between de facto and de jure measures along the different dimensions of globalization. We also disentangle trade and financial globalization within the economic dimension of globalization and use time-varying weighting of the variables. The new index is based on 43 instead of 23 variables in the previous version. Following Dreher (Applied Economics, 38(10):1091–1110, 2006), we use the new index to examine the effect of globalization on economic growth. The results suggest that de facto and de jure globalization influence economic growth differently. Future research should use the new KOF Globalisation Index to re-examine other important consequences of globalization and why globalization was proceeding rapidly in some countries, such as South Korea, but less so in others. The KOF Globalisation Index can be downloaded from http://www.kof.ethz.ch/globalisation/ .
F43|Long run analysis of trade openness on economic growth for Pakistan; Evidence from standard and optimal time series tests|This study examines the long run effect of trade openness on economic growth for Pakistan using annual data for the period 1972-2016. The long run model is estimated using several standard and optimal single equation estimates. The standard long run elasticities provide significant positive long run effects of trade openness on economic growth. The autoregressive distributive lag model optimal estimate by accommodating structural break in the series validate the cointegration among variables providing weak or no support for the long run effect of trade openness on economic growth. The estimate of the model using generalized method of moments technique and its rolling window estimation overwhelms the evidence of weak or no support by providing significantly positive long run effects of trade openness on economic growth. The results appear to support the new growth theories for Pakistan in which increasing openness helps domestic economy to grow.
F43|Current Account Balance in Emerging Asia|The current account balance is an important indicator which reveals information on a country’s economic situation such as investments, capital flows, and indebtedness. The main purpose of this study is to examine the current account balance conditions in emerging Asian countries. In this respect, the long-run and causality relationship between current account balance, economic growth, government expenditure, real interest rates, and foreign direct investment was examined. The panel data analysis was applied using the data dated 1986 to 2015. Our results revealed a causal effect from economic growth and government expenditure to current account balance mainly dependent on saving tendency.
F43|The UK (and Western) productivity puzzle: does Arthur Lewis hold the key?|I propose a new explanation for the UK productivity puzzle. I graft the Lewis (1954) model onto a standard Solow growth model. What I call the neo-Lewis model is identical to the Solow model in good times. But in bad times foreign demand for a country’s exports is constrained below potential supply. This makes labour productivity growth depend negatively on the growth of labour input. I also argue that the neo-Lewis model can explain the fall in TFP growth, in the UK and elsewhere, after 2007. The predictions of the neoLewis model are tested on data for 23 advanced countries and also on a larger sample of 52 countries and find support.
F43|Growth Accelerations Strategies|Setting a country’s structural growth rate on a higher path, i.e. sparking and sustaining a growth acceleration can have quantitatively huge implications for national income and, more broadly, for people’s wellbeing. We develop a novel statistical framework to identify systematically the set of binding constraints that were unlocked before the 135 growth acceleration episodes that took place between 1962 and 2002 worldwide. We employ this information to characterise the acceleration process, which tends to be preceded by a deep recession and major economic policy changes. Once we combined this information with a set of counterfactual analyses, we find however that successful acceleration strategies should not contain off-the-shelf approaches or necessarily all-encompassing “shock therapy” solutions. On the other hand, they call for a careful tailoring to local conditions. Richer countries tend to experience fewer accelerations, but once these have been ignited, they are better positioned to make the most out of them. Despite standard growth determinants doing a fairly good job at characterising successful accelerations, we note how take-offs remain extremely hard to engineer with a high degree of certainty.
F43|Currency misalignments and economic growth: the foreign currency-denominated debt channel|"The literature on the growth effects of currency misalignments, although prolific, revolves around two main axes: one the one hand, the export-oriented growth literature which attributes positive effects to undervaluations (competitiveness gains) and, on the other hand, the Washington Consensus view according to which any deviations from equilibrium hamper economic growth. In this paper, we show that there is no ""one size fits all"" relationship in this regard. Indeed, relying on a panel of 72 developing and emerging countries, we evidence the existence of a foreign currency-denominated debt channel through which misalignments impact growth. Compared to the ""traditional"" competitiveness channel, this channel works in the opposite direction. The paper therefore reconciles the two strands of the literature: undervaluations may have indeed a positive growth effect, but it is crucial to take into account the possible costs related to this undervaluation to have a clearer picture of the net total effect."
F43|Output Costs of Currency Crisis and Banking Crisis: Shocks, Policies and Cycles|Abstract This paper studies output declines during currency crises based on the theoretical currency crisis model, highlighting the role of shocks that trigger crises. Using panel data on 49 developing countries, we find that both productivity shocks in the real sector and shocks to the country’s risk premium in financial markets affect the output costs of currency crises, which are 4% of GDP on average and 8% for severe crises. Output costs of banking crises are 6–7% of GDP. During severe currency crises in Asian and Latin-American countries, both productivity shocks and exchange rate overvaluation were found to be important factors in explaining large output losses.
F43|Choix du régime de change et croissance économique : Une analyse empirique sur des données de panel africaines<BR>[Exchange Rate Regime Choice and Economic Growth: An Empirical Analysis on African Panel Data]|The story of the choice of exchange rate regimes has not yet come to a consensus. Between early works on the subject (Mundell, 1961; McKinnon, 1963) and the most recent (Frenkel, 2017; Guzman et al., 2017), no superiority of a foreign exchange regime on the others is established ad vitam aeternam. It’s case by case. The purpose of this paper is then twofold. It first tests on panel data concerning 30 African countries the thesis of currency neutrality and attempts to rank, in case of rejection of this thesis, exchange rate regimes according to their economic performances by referring to economic growth rate. Next, it aims to list the internal structural characteristics of the panel countries which, by crossing them with exchange rate regimes, are the most favorable to economic growth. The paper concludes the absence of currency neutrality in case of African countries and an outperformance of intermediate regimes. The latter are more conductive to economic growth in the case of countries experiencing positive terms of trade shocks and benefiting from FDI inflows. On the other hand, the opening of capital account is incompatible with intermediate regimes, and external indebtedness doesn’t favor economic growth regardless of the exchange rate regime adopted. These results remain robust by testing several alternative econometric specifications (long-term estimate on five years’ window data, estimates by controlling regional effects and by adopting finer aggregations of exchange rate regimes).

F43|The Effect of Exports in SACU Countries: An Empirical Analysis Using Panel Data|Simultaneity bias is an issue that does arise in most cases when all variables in a model are interdependent. The study responds to this challenge by employing panel data models to analyse the effects of exports in SACU countries. The study applies stationary data estimation techniques to a sample of five (5) SACU countries over the period 1980-2016. The study finds that exports positively and significantly affect GDP per capita in SACU region. In addition, the fixed effects and random effects models show that heterogeneity effects are significant, while the time effects are not significant in explaining the GDP per capita in the SACU region. This implies that country differences such as institutional, political and economic policy systems, among others, not included in the models are significant in explaining GDP per capita in SACU region. Finally, the study finds that SACU countries are enjoying increasing returns to scale. On the policy front, it should be noted that the long-standing trade liberalization and trade openness agendas of SACU have had a significant impact on economic growth and this has led to an upsurge in exports. Therefore, the SACU region must focus more on structural transformation which involves moving their specialisation patterns to more sophisticated goods and services to bolster their comparative advantage in international markets which affect economic growth through exports.
F43|Analysis of the “Dutch Disease” effect and public financial management: the case of Mongolia|This paper aims to diagnose Mongolian economy on whether the economy has suffered from the Dutch Disease by applying a vector auto-regression model for the period from 1993 to 2016 under the current market-based regime including resource-booming times. From the outcomes of a VAR model estimation, it was found that there is a great possibility that Mongolian economy has been suffering from the Dutch Disease through the resource movement effect and the spending effect such that the boom in the mining sector has crowded out manufacturing activities; and that the boom in the mining sector has not contributed to, or even deteriorated the capital accumulation effect that alleviates the Dutch Disease. The strategic policy implications for the current Mongolian public financial management are that the part of the existing resource fund should be used for public investment to facilitate capital accumulation, specifically, for the projects on education, health and economic infrastructure to promote industrial diversification.
F43|Balance-of-payments-constrained Cyclical Growth with Distributive Class Conflicts and Productivity Dynamics|This study builds a dynamic balance-of-payments-constrained (BOPC) model that incorporates the endogenous determination of the economic growth rate, conflictive wage/price distribution, and employment rate. Following the Kaleckian--Marxian literature, wages and commodity prices are determined by the reserve army effect and employment is determined by the reserve army creation effect. The relative strength of these two effects generates different outcomes for the transitional dynamics and comparative statics analysis. In particular, the model shows stability, instability, and a cyclical nature, the latter of concurs with the evidence reported by previous empirical studies.
F43|Cointegration of Economic growth and External balance in Colombia: 1963-2016|In this paper is analyzed the relation between GDP growth and External balance in Colombia for the study period (1963-2016) by using a VECM. Supposing everything else unchanged, we conclude that Colombian external balance granger caused GDP growth and there was indeed a long run relation between both variables. This outcome helps to explain the Colombian GDP growth dynamics over the last fifty years and the impact of trade policy on economic growth.
F43|North-South Trade and Uneven Development in a Classical Conventional Wage Share Growth Model|This study presents a model of North-South trade and uneven development, and investigates the growth rates of both countries under the trade pattern such that the North specializes in investment goods while the South specializes in consumption goods. In contrast to existing studies, we close the model by fixing each countries' income distribution, specifically, the ratio of labor share to capital share. Using the model, we conduct the following two analyses. First, assuming that both countries already engage in international trade and that the North specializes in investment goods while the South specializes in consumption goods, we investigate the dynamics of both countries' growth rates and the terms of trade. Second, we investigate the condition under which such a trade pattern holds, and compare equilibrium variables under autarky and equilibrium values under free trade. From the first analysis, it follows that both countries grow at the same rate in the long run. From the second analysis, however, it follows that in the first place, the terms of trade must lie within the interval between the relative prices of both countries and that both countries' growth rates may not equalize as long as both countries engage in trade.
F43|Trade Balance Analysis in Zimbabwe: Import and Export Examination Using Vector Auto-Regression Model|Zimbabwe, just like many other developing nations have failed to register a positive trade balance for the past decade. Zimbabwe, is then labelled a net-importer or a permanent net-importer, since imports have always been greater than exports. Despite differences in value of imports and exports, quality is also essential to determine the country’s development path. The trade balance is affected by both international and domestic events. Chief exports for Zimbabwe remains primary products which are unprocessed, while the country imports finished products which have been value-added. The study seeks to analyse the trade balance over the years 1980 to 2017, paying particular attention to the periodic trends. The study also explore the relationship between the trade balance components, being imports and exports. The study employed a trend analysis and a statistical analysis to attain its study objectives. The study noted a general rise in both exports and imports, however imports significantly above imports for the entire study period, whether for merchandise or non-merchandise. ADF unit root tests were applied to time series data and variables were found to be integrated of order one. Imports have been found to Granger cause exports while exports Granger cause imports as well. Johansen Cointegration test shows that exports and imports are cointegrated, however using the VAR model, the error correction term was insignificant, discarding the existence of a longrun relationship. Exports levels are affected by its past values and also past values of imports significantly. Imports are also affected by historical exports significantly. Improvement in export policy is critical, value addition to exports, market fetching through regionalism and import substitution is essential to manage the trade balance.
F43|The long-run and short-run effects of foreign direct investment, foreign aid and remittances on economic growth in African countries|This paper investigates the long-run and short-run effects of foreign direct investment (FDI), foreign aid and migrant remittances on economic growth in 36 African countries over the period 1980–2016. Empirical evidence is based on Pooled Mean Group (PMG) approach. The following findings are established. First, while there is a positive and significant long-run relationship between foreign direct investment and economic growth in Africa as a whole, the effect of remittances and foreign aid is insignificant. Second, in the short-run there is no evidence of any significant impact of FDI, remittances and foreign aid on economic growth. Third, results are still robust in the short-run when the panel is divided in three subsamples. However, in the long-run the effects of FDI, remittances and foreign aid on economic growth depend on the income level.
F43|Does the size of the informal economy impede the impact of remittances on economic growth? Evidence from Sub-Saharan African countries|The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between remittances and economic growth. Additionally, it examines whether the size of the informal economy alter negatively the effect of remittances on economic growth, which surprisingly has received less attention in the literature. The paper applied the Ordinary Least Squared (OLS) and system Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) by Arellano and Bond (1991) and Arellano and Bover (1995). The sample include 30 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries over 1991-2015. The results show that: first, remittances have a positive and significant effect on economic growth. Second, the impact of remittances on economic growth decreases with the size of the informal economy.
F43|International Capital Flows in Club of Convergence|We explain U-shape pattern of international capital inflows by one multi-country OLG economy and one cross-section data sample. The theory proves that capital inflows are decreasing on distance to frontier, which is measured by ratio of domestic productivity level over United States’ level. The evidences not only confirm the theory but also reveal that growth is decreasing on distance to frontier for club of convergence but increasing for club of unconvergence. Therefore, Neo-Classical growth model’s implication, that capital inflows are positively correlated to growth, applies for club of convergence. However, Allocation puzzle, that capital inflows are negatively correlated to growth, works for club of unconvergence. The turning point of U-shape pattern is the productivity growth rate at world technology frontier.
F43|A multinacionális vállalatok szerepe a gazdaságban és a munkaerőpiacon<BR>[The Role of Multinational Companies in the Economy and the Labor Market]|The role of multinational companies is significant in each of the national and thus in the global economy. The longstanding debate in the literature is whether the economic growth is more likely to be driven by the large-scale enterprises or small and medium-sized enterprises, especially if the high proportion of dependent, suppliers SMEs is taken into account. 45.6% of the value added by the Hungarian business sector - without financial sector - was generated by only 906 large companies. This ratio is one quarter of the country's total GDP and 10 percent just for the automotive industry. In its proportions it represents only 0.13% of enterprises, yet it employs 33.1% of employees (850.000 people) in the business sphere. The leverage and labor productivity of large and multinational companies are significant. In the EU's economic policy, the principle of growth that benefits everyone should be a decisive goal. The paper deals with the following topics: wages adjusted to the productivity level; sectoral domestic and EU minimum wages; stronger employee protection and trade union system; state and EU subsidies; dual product quality practices.
F43|Does financial sector development affect the growth gains from trade openness?|A sizeable literature suggests that financial sector development could be an important enabler of the growth benefits of trade openness. We provide a comprehensive analysis of how financial development can affect the relationship between trade openness and growth using a dynamic panel threshold model and an extensive dataset for a large sample of countries for the 1970-2015 period. We find that there is a financial development threshold in which trade openness has a positive and significant effect on economic growth. We also find that when splitting the sample into industrialized and non-industrialized countries, the financial development threshold that enables the growth benefits of trade is higher in the former group of countries than in the latter. This finding is consistent with the fact that the export composition of industrialized countries is tilted towards more capital-intensive finance-constrained goods.
F43|How openness to trade rescued the Irish economy|In this paper we examine the performance of the Irish economy over the period 2008 to 2014. In particular we examine whether the recovery observed was due to the successful adoption of structural reforms in labour and product markets or whether the improved performance was due to a rebalancing of the Irish economy, post 2008, away from the disproportionate influence of the construction (non-tradable) sector and back to the more productive tradable sector? Prior to 2007 had seen the emergence of a significant, property-related credit boom which resulted in the Irish economy being increasingly influenced by the non-tradable sector. This was in sharp contrast to the earlier period of the Celtic tiger, which had mainly relied on export-orientated growth. We use a small open economy DSGE model with a tradable and a non-tradable sector to examine this issue. Our results suggest that the financial crisis acted as a rebalancing mechanism for the Irish economy, with the tradable sector contracting less and recovering quicker than the non-tradable sector. Our model-based simulations indicate that the Irish recovery is mostly export-driven with structural reforms playing a very minor role in stimulating growth in the immediate period after the crisis.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F43|A new causality test for the analysis of the export-growth nexus|This paper proposes a new causality test or a Fisher-type causality test to examine empirically the export-growth nexus. To empirically demonstrate this new causality test procedure, the Fisher causality test is used to examine the exports-growth nexus in four Asian economies, namely Indonesia, Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan. The new causality test could detected a complex situation in the export-growth nexus in Asia. The Fisher causality test clearly pointed out that there are unidirectional causality from economic growth to exports in Indonesia, bidirectional causality between exports and economic growth in Philippines, no causality relationship between exports and economic growth in Hong Kong and Japan.
F43|The potential of the EU economies in attracting FDI – A composite index based approach|The paper presents a composite index which measures the potential of the 28 European Union (EU) member countries in attracting foreign direct investments (FDI), for the period 2000 – 2012. Several new variables (in respect to other aggregated Indices) linked to the latest development policies of the European Union are considered in the construction process of the proposed index. By comparing several versions of the constructed index with some of the most notorious indicators used to measure the FDI attractiveness, we find that the PCA (principal component analysis) version of our index shows the best performance in tracking the FDI activity of the EU economies. The empirical results show that the FDI activity is concentrated in the developed economies, confirming therefore previous results presented in the literature. The construction methodology of our index allows the identification of the main characteristics of the European economies which should be taken in consideration by the national governments when forging policies for increasing the FDI attractiveness of their economies. Among other practical applications of the proposed index, it can be used as a starting point for identifying benchmark economies which can help policymakers identify best practices and innovative approaches for the areas where their economies are lagging behind.
F43|Back in Business: Industrial Policy for Emerging Economies in the New Globalization|We explore the potential roles of industrial policy in the transition from middle-income to high-income status, and the actual experience of industrial policy in emerging economies. Guided by the conceptual framework of the neo-Schumpeterian approach, we look at industrial policy in the context of structural transformation, i.e., in transforming economic structures as well as the institutions supporting these structures. Today’s emerging economies face a dual structural transformation challenge: (i) to move closer to the current world technology frontier (traditional catch-up), and (ii) to adjust to technological change in advanced economies and increasingly binding environmental and social constraints. The feasible set of industrial policy is constrained by state capacity. The paradox of industrial policy is that it is most straightforward when state capacity is the most constrained. We suggest that emerging economies still should explore what we denote as sector-based horizontal policies addressing market and state failures in individual industries.
F43|Skewed Credit and Growth Dynamics after the Global Financial Crisis|A large empirical literature finds that financial development is beneficial for economic growth, although some recent evidence suggests otherwise. The paper contributes to the financeâ€“growth literature by examining the role of credit growth skewness and long-run growth. Earlier literature found that credit growth skewness is negatively associated with economic growth. It revisits this relationship using a large and recent panel dataset that encompasses Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economies and the impact of the global financial crisis. While the results reconfirm an association between credit skewness and growth, the relationship is more nuanced than previously thought. It finds that the beneficial effects from lower skewnessâ€”systemic financial risksâ€”were evident only prior to 2000. The findings help explain why boomâ€“bust dynamics were positively associated with economic growth in emerging markets in the past and why the growth of advanced economies has been sluggish since the global financial crisis.
F43|Testing for causality between FDI and economic growth using heterogeneous panel data|In this paper we investigate the causal relationship between the ratio of FDI to GDP (FDIG)and economic growth (GDPG). We use innovative econometric methods which are based on the heterogeneous panel test of the Granger non-causality hypothesis based on the works of Hurlin (2004a), Fisher (1932, 1948) and Hanck (2013) using data from 136 developed and developing countries over the 1970-2006 period. According to the Hurlin and Fisher panel tests FDIG unambiguously Granger-causes GDPG for at least one country. However, theresults from these tests are ambiguous regarding whether GDPG Granger-causes FDIG for at least one country. Using Hanck’s (2013) panel test we are able to determine whether and for which countries there is Granger-causality. This test suggests that at most there are three countries (Estonia, Guyana and Poland) where FDIG Granger-causes GDPG and no countries where GDPG Granger-causes FDIG.
F43|New-Structuralist Exchange-Rate Policy and the Pattern of Specialization in Latin American Countries|The present article critically examines the transmission channels between the real exchange rate and output growth adduced by the so-called New-Structuralist doctrine. It is shown that the assumptions under which the mechanisms work are highly restrictive, and hence, are generally inadequate to ex-plore the problem of economic development in Latin American peripheral countries. In view of this, the potential risks associated with a policy of devaluation are warned.
F43|Market openness and Lithuanian agrifood trade in the context of changing trade conditions|The multilateral trade liberalisation process has gradually transformed into regionalism where countries initiate bilateral, interregional agreements. Regional integration of separate countries, regions or groups of countries has also become stronger. Deeper economic integration of the countries has changed the conditions of international trade. Timely adaptation to the change in the international trade conditions is the essential condition of sustainable development of international trade linked to the more rapid economic growth of countries. The paper performs the Lithuanian agricultural and food sector in the changing international trade conditions during the period of 1999-2014. Analysis of the international trade of Lithuanian agricultural and food products divided into three phases. The first phase covers the period from 1999 to 2003 (before Lithuania's accession to the EU). The second phase covers the period from 2004 to 2008 (trade peak since joining the EU by 2008 the global economic crisis). In addition, the third stage includes the period from 2009 to 2014 (recovery after the crisis period). Market openness effect on agrifood trade of Lithuania measured by Open Trade Index (OTI). OTI formula adopted for agricultural sector performance analysis. The net effect of the EU membership evaluated. Suggested approach shows the complexity of the international trading system and specifies the further development of export direction.
F43|Relationship Between Financial Stability and Economic Growth in Turkey (2002-2017)|This study aims to analyze the relationship between financial stability and economic growth in Turkey as an emerging market. Financial stability, in general terms, is expressed as the resilience of the economy against the unexpected situations that may disrupt the multi-dimensional equilibrium in the financial system. Although a large number of studies have examined the effect of financial deepening on economic growth, there is a little evidence on the effect of financial stability or soundness on economic growth. A present study considering the 2002 ? 2017 period which covers the implementation of inflation targeting monetary policy regime analyses the short and long-run dynamics of financial stability ? economic growth relationship by using co-integration and ARDL techniques. Obtained results show that a steadily functioning financial system is a requirement for economic growth. In particular, financial leverage, capital adequacy, asset quality, and liquidity are important components of financial stability affecting the economic growth. Thus, formulating the efficient policies to support economic growth requires understanding the factors that affect financial stability.
F43|Impact of Remittances on Economic Growth in Developing Countries: The Role of Openness|The paper examines the empirical relationship between remittances and economic growth for a sample of 62 developing countries over the time period 1990-2014. Remittances seem to promote growth only in the ?more open? countries. The study uses a variety of indicators of ?openness? to test the hypothesis that openness of a country increases the growth effects of remittances. The finding, remittances lead to higher growth in open countries, is robust regardless of how ?openness? is defined. Conversely, no significant effect of remittances on growth could be detected in the case of ?less open? countries. That is because remittances are in themselves not sufficient for growth. The extent of the benefit depends on domestic institutions and macroeconomic environment in the receiving country. Unlike the ?less open? countries, ?more open? countries have better institutions and better financial markets to take advantage of the remittances income and channelise them into profitable investments which, in turn, accelerates the rate of economic growth in these countries.
F43|Research and Development Contribution to the Czech Industry Branch Growth|GDP growth is one of the most closely watched macroeconomic aggregates. To predict its growth, it is very important to know the importance and development of individual structural components - this article has been focused on the Czech industry NACE C and its role for GDP growth in the Czech Republic. The research was mainly focused on the impact of research and development, as the revised methodology of the national accounts system in the Czech Republic has been pursuing this factor differently since 2014. For better outlook, the development has also been compared with the Visegrad countries, where the Czech Republic is a member. The years 2005 to 2016 were selected for the period under review, when the effects of the economic crisis were reflected. The end of the survey period has shown a boom in economic growth, so research has covered all the important phases of the business cycle.
F43|The Relation between Trade and Economic Growth A study of the case of Morocco|The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between trade and economic growth in Morocco with emphasis on both the role of exports and imports using yearly multivariate time series data covering the period from 1975 to 2015. Causality is tested within a vector autoregressive (VAR) framework, first using the augmented VAR model proposed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995) for cointegrated series to perform causality testing as described by Granger (1969), then by using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) proposed by Engle and Granger (1987) and analyzing the cointegration, Impulse Response Functions (IRF) and the Factor Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD) of the system. We found a one-way causality between exports and imports, and between Economic growth and Exports. These results re-veal that Morocco Imports are driven by the Exports that create a demand for technology, raw materials and consumable goods. In addition, the results show that Economic growth drives the country?s export, and therefore support the growth-led-exports hypothesis in the case of Morocco.
F43|Endogenous growth and global divergence in a multi-country agent-based model|In this paper we present a multi-country, multi-industry agent-based model investigating the different growth patterns of interdependent economies. Each country features a Schumpeterian engine of endogenous technical change which interacts with Keyneasian/Kaldorian demand generation mechanisms. National trajectories are driven by firms’ accumulation of technological knowledge, which in turn also leads to emergent specialization patterns in different industries. Interactions among economies occur via trade flows, stemming from the competition of firms in international markets. Simulation results show the emergence of persistent income divergence among countries leading to polarization and club formation. Moreover, each country experiences a structural transformation of its productive structure during the development process. Such dynamics results from firm-level virtuous (or vicious) cycles between knowledge accumulation, trade performances, and growth dynamics. The model accounts for a rich ensemble of empirical regularities at macro, meso and micro levels of aggregation.
F43|Deviations in real exchange rate levels in the OECD countries and their structural determinants|We study the validity of an augmented Balassa-Samuelson theory in a panel of real exchange rate levels across 17 OECD countries between 1970 and 2012 using a unique panel of levels of total factor productivity (TFP) across sectors. We find that real exchange rates can be explained by relative sectoral TFP levels both across countries and over time in the direction predicted by Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis. We also show that drivers of labour wedges such as structural labour market differences are important in explaining real exchange rate levels. Nevertheless, large average conditional deviations in real exchange rate levels remain across countries in our sample.

F43|Structural Transformation to Manufacturing and Services: What Role for Trade?|Understanding how and why economies structurally transform as they grow is crucial for sound national policy making. Typically analysts of this issue focus on sectoral shares of GDP and employment. This paper extends that to include exports, including of services. It also considers mining in addition to agriculture and manufacturing, and recognizes some of the products of those four sectors are nontradable. The theory section's general equilibrium model provides hypotheses about structural change in different types of economies as they grow, and tests them econometrically with annual data for a sample of 117 countries for the period 1991-2014. The results point to the futility of adopting protective policies aimed at slowing de-agriculturalization and subsequent de-industrialization in terms of sectoral shares, since those trends inevitably will accompany economic growth. Fortuitously governments now have far more efficient and equitable ways of supporting the adjustments needed by people choosing or being pushed to leave declining industries.
F43| Variegated dependence: The geographically differentiated economic outcomes of resource-based development in Peru, 2001-2015| The economic impacts of resource-based development are distributed unevenly across national space, and not even mining regions experience economic development in the same way. We build on the methodology of Rehner et. al. (2014) to typify resource-based economic development in Peru in the period 2001- 2015 and compare it with the case of mineral-abundant Chile. What we find is a nuanced version of the same dependency-related resource curse phenomenon. With the commodity cycle: (i) export specialization is not the same in all places; (ii) regional growth volatility is much higher in Peru than in Chile; (iii) the Dutch disease does not clearly manifest itself; and therefore (iv) economic dependence within Peru is variegated. At the national level, gold-and-copper-dependent Peru is not as vulnerable as copper-dependent Chile to external shocks. At the subnational level, outside Lima in particular, dependence-related volatility can be very high for clusters of regions. The results of the quantitative analysis are attuned to a theoretical framework of variegated dependence, which, while acknowledging the centrality of the center-and-periphery supranational structure for economic development, attributes variation in resource curse phenomena to subnational differences across space and over time in economic- geography configurations and institutional regimes.

F43|Does the Form Matter? Foreign Capital Inflows and Economic Growth|Empirically, results from time series and cross country studies have identified foreign capital inflows to play a pivotal role in the growth process of host countries. The goal of this article is to examine the impact of three of the four forms of foreign capital inflows (which include foreign aid, foreign direct investment and personal remittances) on economic growth in Ghana. The study employs the ARDL Bounds testing approach to cointegration on an annual time series data for Ghana from 1980-2012. The results of the study indicate that all the three forms of foreign capital inflows have positive and significant impacts on economic growth both in the short and long run. The results also show that of all the three forms of foreign capital inflows, foreign aid is the main driver of economic growth in Ghana both in the short and long run. The study recommends the design and implementation of good fiscal, monetary and trade policies to complement the flow foreign aid to the country for the realization of its full impact on growth.
F43|Chinese resource demand or commodity price shocks: Macroeconomic effects for an emerging market economy|This paper empirically addresses the hypothesis that of the external commodity based sector, Chinese resource demand is the most important driver of emerging market economy business cycles using Brazil as a representative case. Using a structural VAR to examine the effects of Chinese resource demand, world commodity prices and foreign output on domestic macroeconomic variables, we show that shocks to Chinese demand induce an expansion in Brazilian resource exports, the non-tradeable primary commodity sector and other domestic activity. Commodity price shocks are less favorable than Chinese resource demand shocks. Our findings identify the important role of the interest rate in amplifying the real effects of the commodity sector boom, in contrast to the role of the interest rate in developed countries. By incorporating Chinese resource demand in addition to commodity prices, commodity prices play a smaller role in explaining the variance of domestic output than found in previous literature.
F43|The UK (and Western) Productivity Puzzle: Does Arthur Lewis Hold the Key?|I propose a new explanation for the UK productivity puzzle. I graft the Lewis (1954) model onto a standard Solow growth model. What I call the neo-Lewis model is identical to the Solow model in good times. But in bad times foreign demand for a country’s exports is constrained below potential supply. This makes labour productivity growth depend negatively on the growth of labour input. I also argue that the neo-Lewis model can explain the fall in TFP growth, in the UK and elsewhere, after 2007. The predictions of the neo-Lewis model are tested on data for 23 advanced countries and also on a larger sample of 52 countries and find support.
F43|How openness to trade rescued the Irish economy|In this paper we examine the performance of the Irish economy over the period 2008 to 2014. In particular we examine whether the recovery observed was due to the successful adoption of structural reforms in labour and product markets or whether the improved performance was due to a rebalancing of the Irish economy, post 2008, away from the disproportionate influence of the construction (non-tradable) sector and back to the more productive tradable sector? Prior to 2007 had seen the emergence of a significant, property-related credit boom which resulted in the Irish economy being increasingly influenced by the non-tradable sector. This was in sharp contrast to the earlier period of the Celtic tiger, which had mainly relied on export-orientated growth. We use a small open economy DSGE model with a tradable and a non-tradable sector to examine this issue. Our results suggest that the financial crisis acted as a rebalancing mechanism for the Irish economy, with the tradable sector contracting less and recovering quicker than the non-tradable sector. Our model-based simulations indicate that the Irish recovery is mostly export-driven with structural reforms playing a very minor role in stimulating growth in the immediate period after the crisis.
F43|The Growth slowdown and the working of inflation targeting in India|The paper presents a variety of indicators to show that demand constrained output during the period of growth slowdown 2011-17. It also draws on research to show the macroeconomic structure of the economy is such that a policy induced demand contraction affects output more than it affects inflation. In this context it evaluates the application and working of inflation targeting. The framework agreed to was flexible inflation targeting but it was too narrowly and strictly implemented initially, although there are signs of moderation in 2018. There was too much emphasis on a weak aggregate demand channel to reduce inflation. Since inflation forecasts were biased upwards the more effective expectations anchoring channel of inflation targeting was under-utilized. Space available due to positive commodity shocks was not made use of so that the negative output gap further widened, even as potential output itself fell. The output sacrifice imposed was therefore higher than necessary. Finally, possible mechanisms to ensure IT is implemented flexibly as required in the Indian context are discussed.
F43|Innovation and Trade Policy in a Globalized World|How do import tariffs and R&D subsidies help domestic firms compete globally? How do these policies affect aggregate growth and economic welfare? To answer these questions, we build a dynamic general equilibrium growth model where firm innovation endogenously determines the dynamics of technology, and, therefore, market leadership and trade flows, in a world with two large open economies at different stages of development. Firms’ R&D decisions are driven by (i) the defensive innovation motive, (ii) the expansionary innovation motive, and (iii) technology spillovers. The theoretical investigation illustrates that, statically, globalization (defined as reduced trade barriers) has ambiguous effects on welfare, while, dynamically, intensified globalization boosts domestic innovation through induced international competition. Accounting for transitional dynamics, we use our model for policy evaluation and compute optimal policies over different time horizons. The model suggests that the introduction of the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit in 1981 proves to be an effective policy response to foreign competition, generating substantial welfare gains in the long run. A counterfactual exercise shows that increasing tariffs as an alternative policy response improves domestic welfare only when the policymaker cares about the very short run, and only when introduced unilaterally. Tariffs generate large welfare losses in the medium and long run, or when there is retaliation by the foreign economy. Protectionist measures generate large dynamic losses by distorting the impact of openness on innovation incentives and productivity growth. Finally, our model predicts that a more globalized world entails less government intervention, thanks to innovation-stimulating effects of intensified international competition.
F43|Skewed Credit and Growth Dynamics after the Global Financial Crisis|A large empirical literature finds that financial development is beneficial for economic growth, although some recent evidence suggests otherwise. We contribute to the finance–growth literature by examining the role of credit growth skewness and long-run growth. Earlier literature found that credit growth skewness is negatively associated with economic growth. We revisit this relationship using a large and recent panel dataset that encompasses Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economies and the impact of the global financial crisis. While our results reconfirm an association between credit skewness and growth, the relationship is more nuanced than previously thought. We find that the beneficial effects from lower skewness—systemic financial risks—were evident only prior to 2000. Our findings help explain why boom–bust dynamics were positively associated with economic growth in emerging markets in the past and why the growth of advanced economies has been sluggish since the global financial crisis.
F43|Unequal vulnerability to climate change and the transmission of adverse effects through international trade|In this paper, we consider the unequal distribution of climate change damages in the world and we examine how the underlying costs can spread from a vulnerable to a non-vulnerable country through international trade. To focus on such indirect effects, we treat this topic in a North-South trade overlapping generations model in which the South is vulnerable to the damages entailed by global pollution while the North is not. We show that the impact of climate change in the South can be a source of welfare loss for northern consumers, in both the short and the long run. In the long run, an increase in the South's vulnerability can reduce the welfare in the North economy even in the case in which it improves its terms of trade. In the short run, the South's vulnerability can also represent a source of intergenerational inequity in the North. Therefore, we emphasize the strong economic incentives for non-vulnerable - and a fortiori less-vulnerable - economies to reduce the climate change damages on - more - vulnerable countries.
F43|Argentina’s “Missing Capital” Puzzle and Limited Commitment Constraints|Capital accumulation in Argentina was slow in the 1990s, despite high total factor productivity (TFP) growth and low international interest rates. A possible explanation for the “missing capital” is that foreign investors were reluctant to take advantage of the high returns to investment seemingly offered by that small open economy under such favorable conditions, on the grounds that previous historical developments had led them to perceive Argentina as a country prone to external debt “opportunistic defaults.” The paper examines this conjecture from the perspective of an optimal contract between foreign lenders and a small open economy subject to limited commitment constraints. Numerical experiments for a deterministic version of that analytical framework show that limited commitment constraints introduce an asymmetry to the capital accumulation process of small open economies: the responses of investment to positive TFP shocks are muted and shortlived, while those to negative TFP shocks are large and persistent. Furthermore, under some circumstances, a lower international interest rate environment can magnify the asymmetry. A quantitative implementation of the model economy to data from Argentina accounts, in line with asymmetry just described, for the rapid decline that that country’s capital stock experienced, along with a falling TFP during the 1980s, as well as for the lack of any visible recovery of that stock during the significant surges of TFP observed between 1992-1998 and 2002-2008. In the absence of the limited commitment constraint, Argentina’s capital stock in 2008 would have been 50% higher than it actually was.
F43|Export Variety, Productivity, And Country Size In A Multi-Good Ricardian Model Of Export Diversification|This paper addresses the lack of connection between theory and empirics in most export diversification–economic development studies. We provide a Ricardian-based theoretical explanation of countries’ relative export variety as a function of the level of technology and country size assessed with respect to the rest of the world. Relative export diversification is an outcome of two forces: a relative productivity change (technological progress) and a relative country size change (labour force growth). The model predictions are confirmed in a sample of 132 countries (1988–2014), including 53 low-income countries, for which we measure export variety using product-level trade data. The influence of technology differences on export variety is: (i) stronger than is the effect of cross-country differences in size and (ii) non-linear, driving diversification at the beginning of the development process. The results are robust to the measurement of export variety, the inclusion of control variables, and estimation methods.
F43|Granger Causality Between Local Government Expenditure and Economic Growth in Indonesia|Objective - This study examines the causal relationship between government expenditure and economic growth in West Kalimantan between 2009 and 2015. This research resulted in the enactment of Wagner's Law and/or Keynes's Theory in West Kalimantan leading the local government to take the right policies as an effort towards improving economic development. Methodology/Technique - By using panel data that combines time series data and cross-site data, it will be estimated by the Granger causality test which begins with a stationary test and co-integration test. Based on the co-integration tests, the results suggest that there is a long-term relationship between government expenditure and economic growth. Meanwhile, based on the Granger causality test, there is no reciprocal relationship between government expenditure and economic growth. Findings - A direct relationship in the form of the influence of government expenditure on economic growth in West Kalimantan. Novelty - These results are in line with the Keynes's Theory through its national income function.
F43|Have FDI enhanced Growth in Egypt?|Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is usually considered an important catalyst for economic growth in developing countries. FDI plays an important role in transferring technology from developed to emerging economies, it also stimulates domestic investments and enhances human as well as physical capital in the host countries. This paper also aims at identifying the effect of FDI on the Egyptian economy. The analysis is carried out using an OLS regression model with three variables. Time series data for FDI inflows, gross capital formation (GCF) and labor force (LF) were gathered for Egypt over the period 1990-2014. After gathering the results of both the single and multiple regressions, some policy recommendations are suggested to enhance and maximize the effect of FDI on economic growth in Egypt.
F43|Short-run pain, long-run gain: the conditional welfare gains from international financial integration|Abstract This paper aims at clarifying the analytical conditions under which financial globalization originates welfare gains in a simple endogenous growth setting. We focus on an open-economy $$\textit{AK}$$ AK model in which the capital-deepening effect of financial globalization boosts growth in a in permanent but entails an entry cost in order to access international credit markets. We show that constrained borrowing triggers substantial welfare gains, even at small levels of international financial integration, provided that the autarkic growth rate is larger than the world interest rate. Such conditional welfare benefits boosted by stronger growth—long-run gain—arise in our preferred model without investment commitment and they range, relative to autarky, from about $$2\%$$ 2 % in middle-income countries to about $$13\%$$ 13 % in OECD-type countries under international financial integration. Sizeable benefits emerge despite the fact that consumption initially falls—short-run pain—which is, however, shown not to dwarf positive growth changes.
F43|Transferts de fonds, stabilité politique et croissance économique dans les pays de l’ex URSS|Cet article analyse la relation empirique entre les transferts de fonds et la croissance économique dans les pays en transition se situant au sein de l’ancien bloc soviétique. Il cherche également à mesurer si l’effet des transferts de fonds est plus efficace dans les pays où la stabilité politique est plus présente, en utilisant la méthode des moindres carrés généralisés pour des données de panel, afin de contrôler l’hétéroscédasticité et la corrélation sérielle. Les résultats montrent principalement que les transferts de fonds ont un impact négatif sur la croissance et que ce dernier dépend de la stabilité politique des pays concernés. This paper examines the empirical relationship between remittances and economic growth in post-Soviet states, and the role that political stability plays in this context. Using Feasible Generalized Least Squares to tackle group heteroskedasticity and serial correlation in panels, we find that remittances have a significant negative correlation with the receiving countries' economic progress. Besides, this relationship is contingent upon the political stability the country enjoys.
F43|Non-linear pattern of international capital flows|Abstract In a two-country OLG model with interest rate wedges capturing financial frictions, international capital flows can follow a non-linear pattern, depicted as a U-shaped curve, by first decreasing and then increasing in growth. The turning point of the curve is determined by the world average growth rate and these interest rate wedges. The model developed in this paper can reconcile different theories (i.e, the implications of the neoclassical growth model, up-hill capital flows, and the allocation puzzle) on the pattern of international capital flows.
F43|Sector heterogeneity and credit market imperfections in emerging markets|This paper shows that the impact of country interest rate shocks on emerging markets' economic activities can be associated with credit market imperfections affecting principally non-tradable activities. I present novel evidence documenting that tradable and non-tradable activities respond asymmetrically to changes in credit conditions in emerging markets. I show that country interest rate shocks are amplified through non-tradable activities, and that local credit substantially explains their output growth. Unlike the non-tradable sector, tradable activities are not significantly affected by changes in local credit conditions. To rationalize these findings, I introduce a small open economy model with heterogeneous access to international borrowing that accounts for the asymmetric response of tradable and non-tradable activities.
F43|Dutch disease, real effective exchange rate misalignments and their effect on GDP growth in EU|In this article we study the impact of real effective exchange rate misalignments, based on determinants including different types of foreign capital inflows, on GDP growth in the EU. For this analysis, we use a panel of 27 EU countries for the period 1994–2012, with annual frequency.
F43|The real exchange rate and economic growth: Revisiting the case using external instruments|We investigate the impact of movements in the real exchange rate on economic growth based on five-year average data for a panel of over 150 countries in the post Bretton Woods period. Unlike previous literature, we use external instruments to deal with possible reverse causality from growth to the real exchange rate. Our country-specific instruments are (i) global capital flows interacted with individual countries’ financial openness and (ii) the growth rate of official reserves. We find that a real appreciation (depreciation) reduces (raises) significantly annual real GDP growth, more than in previous estimates in the literature. However, our results confirm this effect only for developing countries and for pegs.
F43|International borrowing without commitment and informational lags: Choice under uncertainty|A series of recent studies in economic growth theory have considered a class of models of international borrowing where, in the absence of a perfect investment commitment, the borrowing constraint depends on the historical performances of the country. Thus, a better level of past economic activity gives a higher reputation, thereby increasing the possibility of accessing the international credit market. This note considers this problem in a stochastic setting based on the volatility of the internal net capital. We study how the optimal consumption level and the maximal expected welfare depend on the combined influence of the trajectory of past economic variables and the volatile environment. In particular, we show how the strength of the history effect and the relative weight of the historical performance depend on the degree of risk.
F43|The growth effects of financial openness and exchange rates|This study examines the role of financial openness and international financial integration when choosing an exchange rate regime where the objective is to maximize productivity growth. The discussion begins with a simple generalization of a framework with credit constraints and concludes that the negative effects of exchange rate volatility on productivity growth are reduced the more financially integrated into the international capital flows a country is. Second, an empirical analysis of productivity growth provides thresholds and addresses potential endogeneity problems. Robust and significant results find that a high degree of financial openness can mitigate the negative effect of exchange rate flexibility on growth.
F43|How does banking sector globalization affect economic growth?|The present study examines the impact of banking sector globalization on economic growth for a panel of 138 nations spanning 1995–2013. Employing different econometric models, the study finds greater banking sector openness to reduce economic growth. Such finding holds in both emerging markets and low income countries, and in nations with more than 10 percent foreign banks, but not in advanced economies. The paper also finds foreign banks reduce private credit flows in host nations. This implies foreign banks face informational bottlenecks that hinder them from lending to a large majority of potential client-base in host markets.
F43|Do sovereign wealth funds dampen the negative effects of commodity price volatility?|This paper studies the impact of commodity terms of trade (CToT) volatility on economic growth (and its sources) in a sample of 69 commodity-dependent countries, and assesses the role of Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) and quality of institutions in their long-term growth performance. Using annual data over the period 1981–2014, we employ the Cross-Sectionally augmented Autoregressive Distributive Lag (CS-ARDL) methodology for estimation to account for cross-country heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence, and feedback effects. We find that while CToT volatility exerts a negative impact on economic growth (operating through lower accumulation of physical capital and lower TFP), the average impact is dampened if a country has a SWF and better institutional quality (hence a more stable government expenditure).
F43|Revisiting the commodity curse: A financial perspective|We study the response of a three-sector commodity-exporter small open economy to a commodity price boom. When the economy has access to international borrowing and lending, a temporary commodity price boom brings about the standard wealth effect that stimulates demand and has long-run implications on the sectoral allocation of labor. If dynamic productivity gains are concentrated in the traded good sector, the commodity boom crowds out the traded sector and delays convergence to the world technology frontier. Financial openness by stimulating current demand, amplifies the crowding out effect and may even lead to a growth trap, in which no resources are allocated to the traded sector. From a normative point of view, our analysis suggests that capital account management policies could be welfare improving in those circumstances.

F43|Explaining International Business Cycle Synchronization: Recursive Preferences and the Terms of Trade Channel|Abstract The business cycles of advanced economies are synchronized. Standard macro models fail to explain that fact. This paper presents a simple model of a two-country, two-traded-good, complete-financial-markets world in which country-specific productivity shocks generate business cycles that are highly correlated internationally. The model assumes recursive intertemporal preferences (Epstein-Zin-Weil), and a muted response of labor hours to household wealth changes (due to Greenwood-Hercowitz-Huffman period utility and demand-determined employment under rigid wages). Recursive intertemporal preferences magnify the terms of trade response to country-specific shocks. Hence, a productivity (and GDP) increase in a given country triggers a strong improvement of the foreign country’s terms of trade, which raises foreign labor demand. With a muted labor wealth effect, foreign labor and GDP rise, i.e. domestic and foreign real activity comove positively.
F43|Asia's rebalancing and growth|The paper investigates the impact of Asia's demand rebalancing and supply‐side productivity changes on long‐term economic growth in Asia and worldwide. Results from a panel vector autoregression model show that a productivity–neutral demand‐rebalancing shock has no permanent effect on Asian output, whereas labour productivity shocks have significant, positive and permanent effects. Simulations using a global intertemporal multisector general equilibrium model suggest that labour productivity shocks increase the foreign GDP over time, but rebalancing shocks have a negative international spillover effect. In addition, labour productivity shocks help in rebalancing. Structural reforms promoting labour productivity growth along with rebalancing policies across Asia can achieve higher economic growth worldwide.
F43|Recovery from Dutch Disease|Dutch Disease is thought to have ongoing negative effects on resource rich open economies. There is little evidence on how economies recover. We document the Australian case in the aftermath of the commodities price boom resulting from high input demand from China. We show that where the boom is contained in an export-oriented, small-employment sector of the economy and driven by external demand rather than price shocks, the economy recovers to its equilibrium relatively quickly. To show this we add a new tool to the SVAR toolbox which enables us to assess the source of deviations in the observed outcomes from an empirical steady-state implied by the model.
F43|Commodity booms and busts in emerging economies|Emerging economies, particularly those dependent on commodity exports, are prone to highly disruptive economic cycles. This paper proposes a small open economy model for a net commodity exporter to quantitatively study the triggers of these cycles. The economy consists of two sectors, one of which produces commodities with prices subject to exogenous international fluctuations. These fluctuations affect both the competitiveness of the economy and its borrowing terms, as higher commodity prices are associated with lower spreads between the country's borrowing rate and world interest rates. Both effects jointly result in strongly positive effects of commodity price increases on GDP, consumption, and investment, and a negative effect on the total trade balance. Furthermore, they generate excess volatility of consumption over output and a large volatility of investment. Besides explicitly incorporating a double role of commodity prices, the model structure nests the various candidate sources of shocks proposed in previous work on emerging economy business cycles. Estimating the model on Argentine data, we find that the contribution of commodity price shocks to fluctuations in post-1950 output growth is in the order of 38%. In addition, commodity prices account for around 42% and 61% of the variation in consumption and investment growth, respectively. We find transitory productivity shocks to be an important driver of output fluctuations, exceeding the contribution of shocks to the trend, which, though smaller, is not negligible.

We find transitory productivity shocks to be an important driver of output fluctuations, exceeding the contribution of shocks to the trend, which is smaller, although not negligible.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F43|Political Specialization|This paper presents a theory of political specialization in which some countries uphold the rule of law while others consciously choose not to do so, even though they are ex ante identical. This is borne out of two key insights: for incumbents in each country, (i) the first steps to the rule of law have the greatest private cost, and (ii) steps taken by some countries in the direction of the rule of law make it less attractive for others to follow the same path. The world equilibrium features a symbiotic relationship between despotic and rule-of-law economies: by producing technology-intensive goods that require protection of property rights, rule-of-law economies raise the relative price of natural resources and increase incentives for despotism in other countries; while the choice of despotism entails a positive externality because cheap oil makes the rule of law more attractive elsewhere in the world.
F43|Economic growth and the external sector: Evidence from Korea, lessons for Mexico|In this paper, we have set up an empirical analysis of the Korean external sector between 1980 and 2015, in order to identify the potential relationships between economic growth, exports, imports and foreign direct investment. We chose to study Korea because is a country that has been taken as a reference of the export-led growth hypothesis in order to justify export-promoting policies in Mexico. The results of our four-variable vector autoregressive model suggest that exports and foreign direct investment are not driving economic growth in Korea. Therefore, one should be cautious about policies that promote such investment and export tools to boost economic growth.
F43|Oil, Volatility and Institutions:Cross-Country Evidence from Major Oil Producers|This paper examines the long-run effects of oil revenue and its volatility on economic growth as well as the role of institutions in this relationship. We collect annual and monthly data on a sample of 17 major oil producers over the period 1961. 2013, and use the standard panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach as well as its cross-sectionally augmented version (CS-ARDL) for estimation. Therefore, in contrast to the earlier literature on the resource curse, we take into account all three key features of the panel: dynamics, heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. Our results suggest that (i) there is a significant negative effect of oil revenue volatility on output growth, (ii) higher growth rate of oil revenue significantly raises economic growth, and (iii) better fiscal policy (institutions) can offset some of the negative effects of oil revenue volatility. We therefore argue that volatility in oil revenues combined with poor governmental responses to this volatility drives the resource curse paradox, not the abundance of oil revenues as such.
F43|Role of gender gap in economic growth: Analysis on developing countries versus OECD countries|This study investigates the effects of the gender gap on economic growth by using a composite gender gap index from the World Economic Forum. The index captures the multidimensional aspect of the gender gap, which includes gaps in opportunities and outcomes. Previous studies on the effect of gender inequality on economic growth have focused on the unidirectional aspect of inequality, such as gender-wage inequality. The differential effect of the gender gap is established by comparing three different samples, namely, member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, developing countries, and a combination of South and Southeast Asian countries. According to panel data estimations, policies that promote equity boost the economic growth of developing countries, including those in South and Southeast Asia. The role of export growth in economic growth is also analyzed. Consistent with those in literature, current results indicate that export growth exerts a significant positive effect on the economic growth of all samples.
F43|Industrial Policy and the Timing of Trade Liberalization|In a closed (open) economy with a learning-by-doing externality in the manufacturing sector, Matsuyama (1992) found a positive (negative) link between the level of agricultural productivity and economic growth. We extend that framework by introducing a labor subsidy to induce industrialization. We make three contributions to the existing literature. First, we show that a comparative advantage in manufacturing is not a necessary condition for a small open economy to industrialize. Relative sectoral TFP growth determines whether the fraction of labor in manufacturing increases over time. Second, the timing of trade liberalization determines structural development and the use of a labor subsidy can allow a small open economy to industrialize early. Third, we analyze the labor subsidy when there is trade among two open economies. We find that there exists a unique subsidy which enables both economies to industrialize. Therefore, a country with a comparative advantage in producing the manufactured good could benefit from their trading partner using labor subsidies compared to not trading with them at all.
F43|Foreign Direct Investment, Institutional Framework and Economic Growth|The paper explores the role of institutional quality on economic growth and more specifically the role it plays through foreign direct investment. The paper uses an economic performance relevant indicators of institutional quality (both in aggregate and individual indicators) to evaluate its direct impact on economic growth and an indirect impact on economic growth via foreign direct investment. The paper applied instrumental variable model to a larger dataset of 106 countries and found that besides a strong direct positive effect on economic growth the aggregate institutional quality variable as well as all individual variables except for the rule of law have a small but significant indirect impact on economic that takes place through boosting foreign direct investment.
F43|Inequality and Imbalances : a Monetary Union Agent-Based Model|Our paper investigates the impact of rising inequality in a two-country macroeconomic model with an agent-based household sector characterised by peer effects in consumption. In particular, the model highlights the role of inequality in determining diverging balance of payments dynamics within a currency union. Inequality may drive the two countries into different growth patterns: where peer effects in consumption interact with higher credit availability, rising income inequality leads to the emergence of a debt-led growth. Where social norms determine weaker emulation and credit availability is lower, an export-led regime arises. Eventually, a crisis emerges endogenously due to the sudden-stop of capital ows from the net lending country, triggered by the excessive risk associated to the dramatic amount of private debt accumulated by households in the borrowing country. Monte Carlo simulations for a wide range of calibrations confirm the robustness of our results.
F43|Oil, Volatility and Institutions: Cross-Country Evidence from Major Oil Producers|This paper examines the long-run effects of oil revenue and its volatility on economic growth as well as the role of institutions in this relationship.

F43|Aggregate uncertainty and sectoral productivity growth: The role of credit constraints|We show that an increase in aggregate uncertainty—measured by stock market volatility—reduces productivity growth more in industries that depend heavily on external finance. The mechanism at play is that during periods of high uncertainty, firms that are credit constrained switch the composition of investment by reducing productivity-enhancing investment—such as on ICT capital—which is more subject to liquidity risks (Aghion et al., 2010). The effect is larger during recessions, when financing constraints are more likely to be binding, than during expansions. Our statistical method—a difference-in-difference approach using productivity growth of 25 industries from 18 advanced economies over the period 1985–2010—mitigates concerns with omitted variable bias and reverse causality. The results are robust to the inclusion of other sources of interaction effects, instrumental variable approaches, and different datasets. The results also hold if economic policy uncertainty (Baker et al., 2016) is used instead of stock market volatility as a measure of aggregate uncertainty.
F43|Dutch Disease in Central and Eastern European Countries|Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Romania, Slovenia, and Slovakia have all benefited from an increase of European Union capital transfers of funds since the demand for European integration. At the same time, foreign direct investments have risen, mainly due to the liberalisation of capital movements. The effects of those funds and the reduction of financial costs can be considered as analogous to the phenomenon known as Dutch Disease. That is to say, the inflow of financial transfers is also considered a curse. In order to eliminate this curse we must take into account the two effects associated with Dutch Disease: the ‘spending effect’ and the ‘resource movement effect’. Public policies have not been appropriate and have not prevented the real exchange rate appreciation, thereby contributing to a poor performance in terms of competitiveness and economic growth. After a descriptive analysis of some variables, we estimate a set of equations that take account of the direct and indirect effects of European Union funds and financial costs on the economy where the effects on the real exchange rate play the major role.
F43|Revisiting Finance and Growth in Transition Economies - A Panel Causality Approach|This article provides new evidence on the relationship between financial development and economic growth in 15 Eastern European countries between 1994 and 2014. The analysis employs a panel Granger causality framework that is based on seemingly unrelated regression systems and Wald tests with country-specific bootstrap critical values. By relying on several financial development indicators, we find that finance primarily follows GDP per capita in transition economies, supporting a demand-driven hypothesis. In contrast, financial development in the form of financial monetization and credit extension exerts in the majority of countries a negative impact on economic growth. Moreover, a strong foreign bank presence seems to positively impact growth, presumably driven by more efficiency and prudential lending behavior
F43|Trade Performance of Free Trade Zones|Free trade zones (FTZ) have become widespread with the liberalisation of international trade and investment. They are a key player in the deepening of the global value chain (GVC). However, little is known about their contribution to world trade due to a lack of information on their location and status. This paper sets out to improve knowledge in this area by analysing the trade performance of FTZ countries at macro-level with a focus on FTZ externalities and distortive costs. We have built an original database of FTZs where we define them as processing zones benefiting from import tariff incentives. We show that FTZs raise trade only by easing the negative impact of protection. As importers of components and raw materials, they raise the rest of the world’s exports. This confirms the contribution of FTZs to the GVC. This result is robust to a change in the model specification, errors and bias due to data collection issues and sample composition. _________________________________ Les zones de libre-échange (ZFE) ont proliféré avec la libéralisation du commerce et de l’investissement. Elles jouent un rôle clé dans l’approfondissement de la chaîne mondiale de valeur. Toutefois, leur contribution au commerce international est peu connue, du fait du manque d’informations sur leur localisation et leur statut. Cet article tente d’améliorer leur connaissance en analysant les performances commerciales des pays abritant des ZFE avec un focus sur les externalités et les coûts dus aux distorsions. Nous avons ainsi construit une base de données originale sur les ZFE définies comme des zones de transformation industrielle bénéficiant d’incitations sur les droits de douane. Nous montrons que les ZFE ne contribuent à augmenter le commerce du pays qu’en réduisant l’impact négatif du protectionnisme. En tant qu’importateurs de composants et de matières premières, elles augmentent les exportations des autres pays, ce qui confirme la contribution des ZFE à la chaîne globale de valeur. Ce résultat est robuste avec d’autres spécifications du modèle, les erreurs et les biais dus aux problèmes de collecte des données et de composition de l’échantillon.
F43|Core labour standards and exports|"(english) Core labour standards defined by the ILO in 1998 are universal, but applied very differently across countries. Compliance is much higher in high income countries. However, the causality between improved labour standards and economic growth remains a controversial issue. Export-led growth strategies might encourage developing countries to curb the process of standards improvement. In this way, they can raise the volume of their unskilled labour endowments (child and/or forced labour) in order to strengthen their comparative advantage over compliant countries and pursue ""social dumping"" strategies, which aim more directly at increasing competitiveness. We use a gravity model to assess the trade impact of curbing the level of compliance with core labour standards, distinguishing the effects on bilateral trade (geographical specialization) from the multilateral effects on all exports and imports. We show that, other things being equal, countries that meet the labour standards tend to trade more with each other, while non-compliant countries tend to trade more with compliant countries. These effects are identified mainly with respect to child labour and freedom of association. All other things being equal, countries that meet the labour standards tend to be less open than non-compliant countries, but differently depending on the standards, with a non-linear relationship for some of them. Less compliant countries, frequently the poorest ones, may simultaneously step up their trade and labour standards. For median countries, mainly the emerging countries, the level of compliance with labour standards is “optimal” from a mercantilist point of view. For the most compliant countries, the developed ones, their strict compliance with labour standards implies a trade shortfall. _________________________________ (français) Les normes de travail fondamentales définies par l'OIT en 1998 sont universelles, mais différemment appliquées dans les pays. Leur respect est beaucoup plus élevé dans les pays à haut revenu. Toutefois, la causalité entre l'amélioration des normes de travail et la croissance reste un sujet débattu. Les stratégies de croissance par les exportations pourraient encourager les pays en développement à ralentir le processus d'amélioration des normes. Ils peuvent ainsi accroître leur dotation relative en travail non qualifié (travail des enfants et/ou forcé) pour renforcer leurs avantages comparatifs par rapport aux pays qui les respectent et poursuivre des politiques dites de ""dumping social"" qui visent encore plus directement à accroître leur compétitivité. Nous utilisons un modèle de gravité pour évaluer l'impact du commerce sur le respect des normes fondamentales de travail en séparant les effets sur le commerce bilatéral (spécialisation géographique) des effets sur l'ouverture multilatérale. Nous montrons que, toutes choses égales par ailleurs, les pays qui respectent les normes de travail tendent à échanger davantage entre eux alors que les pays qui ne les respectent pas tendent à échanger davantage avec les pays qui les respectent. Ces effets sont particulièrement nets avec le travail des enfants et la liberté d'association. Les pays qui respectent les normes de travail tendent à être moins ouverts que les pays qui ne les respectent pas, mais avec des différences selon les normes avec une relation non linéaire pour certaines d'entre elles. Les pays qui les respectent le moins, généralement les plus pauvres, améliorent simultanément leur commerce et leurs normes. Pour les pays intermédiaires en terme de respect des normes, principalement les pays émergents, le niveau de respect des normes de travail est “optimal” d'un point de vue mercantiliste. Pour les pays les plus respectueux, ce niveau élevé de normes conduit à réduire leur commerce."
F43|Global Value Chains, National Innovation Systems and Economic Development|Abstract The purpose of this paper is to examine the hypothesis that increased participation in global value chains (GVCs), such as assembly of imported parts for exports, leads to higher economic growth. The focus is particularly on the extent to which this holds for low-income countries, and the role that capability-building, i.e. development of the national innovation system, plays in the possibility of benefitting from GVCs. The analysis is based on evidence from 125 countries over the period 1997–2013. To analyse the issue, a comprehensive framework that allows for inclusion of a range of relevant factors, including GVC participation (measured by the foreign value added embodied in a country’s exports), is applied. The results suggest that countries that increase GVC participation do not grow faster than other countries, when other relevant factors are controlled for. Small countries, and countries with low capabilities, appear to be particularly disadvantaged.
F43|Is the recent low oil price attributable to the shale revolution?|The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that approximately 52% of total U.S. crude oil was produced from shale oil resources in 2015. We examine whether the recent low crude oil price is attributable to this shale revolution in the U.S., using a SVAR model with structural breaks. Our results reveal that U.S. supply shocks are important drivers of real oil price and, for example, explain approximately a quarter of the 73% decline between June 2014 and February 2016. Failure to consider statistically significant structural changes results in underestimating the role played by global supply shocks, while overestimating the role of the demand shocks.
