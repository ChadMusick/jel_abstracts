M20|Corporate Capture of Blockchain Governance| We develop a theory of blockchain governance. In our model, the proof-of-work system, which is the most common set of rules for validating transactions in blockchains, creates an industrial ecosystem with specialized suppliers of goods and services. We analyze the two-way interactions between blockchain governance and the market structure of the industries in the blockchain ecosystem. Our main result is that the proof-of-work system leads to a situation where the governance of the blockchain is captured by a large firm.
M20|Configuration of Organizational Capability to Enhancing Service Performance and Impact on Sustainable Local Enterprise Water Services|Objective – Configuration of organizational capability plays a very important role in creating service performance, and superior and sustainable company performance. The purpose of this study is to propose a conceptual to explain the role between configuration of organizational capability to service performance and its impact on sustainable local enterprise water services in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Methodology/Technique – The data was collected from 100 managers at the local enterprise water service in West Kalimantan Indonesia using a purposive sampling method. The analysis tool used was structural equation modeling partial least square (SEMPLS). Findings – The model in this study was confirmed by the data collected which shows the importance of configuring organizational capability to improve both service performance and sustainability of the local enterprise water services in West Kalimantan. The classification of configuration organizational capability in local enterprise water services includes human capability, information technology capability, system capability, and dynamic capability. Novelty – Most of the previous research focus on western countries. Therefore, this research is novel as it is carried out in the context of developing countries, particularly in local enterprise water services in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Type of Paper: Empirical.
M20|Retail forecasting: research and practice|This paper first introduces the forecasting problems faced by large retailers, from the strategic to the operational, from the store to the competing channels of distribution as sales are aggregated over products to brands to categories and to the company overall. Aggregated forecasting that supports strategic decisions is discussed on three levels: the aggregate retail sales in a market, in a chain, and in a store. Product level forecasts usually relate to operational decisions where the hierarchy of sales data across time, product and the supply chain is examined. Various characteristics and the influential factors which affect product level retail sales are discussed. The data rich environment at lower product hierarchies makes data pooling an often appropriate strategy to improve forecasts, but success depends on the data characteristics and common factors influencing sales and potential demand. Marketing mix and promotions pose an important challenge, both to the researcher and the practicing forecaster. Online review information too adds further complexity so that forecasters potentially face a dimensionality problem of too many variables and too little data. The paper goes on to examine evidence on the alternative methods used to forecast product sales and their comparative forecasting accuracy. Many of the complex methods proposed have provided very little evidence to convince as to their value, which poses further research questions. In contrast, some ambitious econometric methods have been shown to outperform all the simpler alternatives including those used in practice. New product forecasting methods are examined separately where limited evidence is available as to how effective the various approaches are. The paper concludes with some evidence describing company forecasting practice, offering conclusions as to the research gaps but also the barriers to improved practice.

M20|Contradictions in Cost of Capital Approaches|An important business economics category is the cost of capital, which defines the core entrepreneurial purpose in the private ownership-based economy where property owners determine decision-making and investment. The cost of capital includes the estimated price of the capital used (risk-free interest rate) and the required risk premium. Determining the required rate of return depending on the capital structure (WACC) and using it in finance to measure a firm's cost of capital is becoming increasingly widespread. The present study examines how the cost of capital can be approached from business economics and finance perspectives. The paper analyses the comparable factual profitability indicators (return on investment, return on equity, etc.), and the contradictions between them, as well as determining if there are deductible economic meanings behind the comparisons. The study presents the results with a graphic analytical framework.
M20|Momentum and Disposition Effect in the stock market of USA|This paper analyze whether momentum effect drives disposition effect and vice versa during the period of January 1963 to 2017 in the stock market of USA. To examine the relationship, Fama and Macbeth (1973) cross sectional regressions are performed in the study. The results show that disposition effect drives momentum but not the other way around. Furthermore, this relationship is also examined for three sub-samples, and we find that relationship between momentum and disposition effect varies over the time and one possible reason could be crisis as sample is divided on the basis of the dot-com bubble and global financial crisis. Another finding of the study is that along with the disposition effect, size also has an impact on the momentum effect. To further analyze the impact of size on momentum and disposition effect, we test the relationship between momentum and disposition effect on the basis of size deciles. The results demonstrate that relationship does not vary significantly over the size of stocks but it does have an impact on momentum and disposition effect as past cumulative returns, and capital gain varies monotonically with the increase in the size of stocks.
M20|Corruption: Public and Private|Corruption is recognised as a major stumbling block to development and is associated with injustice and abuse of power. The consensus on the detrimental effects of corruption stands in contrast with the lack of agreement on the set of phenomena that fall under the heading Ã«corruptionÃ­ and there is little discussion on whether the economics of corruption should also include corruption in the private sector. This question is relevant since different foci will have different theoretical bases and policy ramifications. We analyse the issue from two complementary perspectives: whether the impacts of corruption are limited to corruption in the public sector and whether a large public sector is associated with more corruption. First, we review theoretical and empirical perspectives on corruption, showing how concern over corruption in the private sector has a long history, dating back to Marshall and Coase. Second, we analyse corruptionÃ­s determinants using a panel data approach. The econometric analysis demonstrates how our indicator of government involvement in the economy is a poor predictor of corruption prevalence. Finally, the paper highlights the policy implications of the one-sided focus on corruption in the public sector and proposes an explicit acknowledgment of the role of corruption in the private sector.
M20|Local Best Practices for Business Growth|Can best practices of successful business peers influence the efficiency and growth of small-scale enterprises? Does it matter how this information is disseminated? This paper conducts a field experiment among urban retail shop owners in Indonesia to address these research questions. Through extensive baseline quantitative and qualitative assessments, we develop a handbook of local best practices that associates specific business practices with performance and provides detailed implementation guidance informed by exemplary local shop owners. The handbook is distributed to a randomly selected sample of shop owners and is complemented with three experiential learning modules: one group is invited to watch a documentary video on experiences of highly successful peers, another is offered light in-shop assistance on the implementation of the handbook, and a third group is offered both. Eighteen months after the intervention, we find no effect of offering the handbook alone, but significant impact on practice adoption when the handbook is coupled with experiential learning. On business performance we find sizable and significant improvements as well, up to a 35% increase in profits and 16.7% in revenues. The types of practices adopted map these performance improvements to efficiency gains rather than other channels. The analysis suggests these interventions are simple, scalable, and highly cost-effective.
M20|Generation Y female students perceived barriers towards entrepreneurship: A comparative study|Entrepreneurship is a critical ingredient for stimulating economic growth and employment opportunities in all societies. Female participation in entrepreneurial venture creation, including Generation Y, in both developed and emerging economies are seen as a key contributor to economic growth. However, entrepreneurs face numerous barriers on the road to success, which may have significant influence on an individual?s motivation to become entrepreneurs. Using a convenience sample of 328 South African and 250 Netherland?s female students, this paper reports on study conducted to compare female generation Y students? perceived barriers towards entrepreneurship, in South African and the Netherland?s. The collected data was analysed using reliability analysis and a two independent-samples t-test. The findings suggest that South African students perceived barriers towards? entrepreneurship is higher than those of their counterparts in the Netherlands.
M20|Two controlling terms: half a century of quiet coexistence|The word control originates from Latin and is currently a popular expression in all European languages. During its development, it gained different meanings. In some cases, the key aspect was comparison, in other corrective action. The German term ?controlling? was put into use in early seventies in business economy, which marks the date of birth of the parallel use of the two terms of controlling. Due to certain conditions, this problem has been hidden. Currently the translation of the German term into English can cause problems. The aim of this conceptual paper is to highlight the issue of using the term controlling in Europe by analyzing the available literature and to propose a possible solution of the problem.
M20|Determinants and dynamics of business aspirations : evidence from small-scale entrepreneurs in an emerging market|Small-scale entrepreneurs are ubiquitous in emerging market economies, yet very few graduate to become larger businesses. This paper asks whether such entrepreneurs aspire to grow and, if so, on which dimensions of the business? What factors influence these aspirations, how realistic are they, and do entrepreneurs dynamically update them based on realized outcomes? A unique panel data set of small-scale retailers in Indonesia is used to show that the average business has strong short- and long-term aspirations for growth in shop size, number of employees, number of customers, and sales. Yet, more than 50 percent of the businesses report no aspirations for growth in the next 12 months, and 16 percent fail to imagine an ideal business over the long term. Entrepreneurs with low profits, business skills, and agency beliefs, as well as those who are older, female, and less educated have significantly lower aspirations. Analysis from a year later shows that most entrepreneurs fail to set realistic aspirations at baseline, but significantly adjust their aspirations to realistic levels with realized outcomes. The analysis also shows that baseline aspirations are a strong predictor of measures of business expansion and innovation, as well as performance outcomes a year later.
M20|Doing Business and Inclusive Human Development in Sub-Saharan Africa|Purpose- This study examines how doing business affects inclusive human development in 48 sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2000-2012. Design/methodology/approach- The measurement of inclusive human development encompasses both absolute pro-poor and relative pro-poor concepts of inclusive development. Three doing business variables are used, namely: the number of start-up procedures required to register a business; time required to start a business; and time to prepare and pay taxes. The empirical evidence is based on Fixed Effects and Generalised Method of Moments regressions. Findings- The findings show that increasing constraints to the doing of business have a negative effect on inclusive human development. Originality/value- The study is timely and very relevant to the post-2015 Sustainable Development agenda for two fundamental reasons: (i) Exclusive development is a critical policy syndrome in Africa because about 50% of countries in the continent did not attain the MDG extreme poverty target despite enjoying more than two decades of growth resurgence. (ii) Growth in Africa is primarily driven by large extractive industries and with the population of the continent expected to double in about 30 years, scholarship on entrepreneurship for inclusive development is very welcome. This is essentially because studies have shown that the increase in unemployment (resulting from the underlying demographic change) would be accommodated by the private sector, not the public sector.
M20|Determinants and Dynamics of Business Aspirations : Evidence from Small-scale Entrepreneurs in an Emerging Market|Small-scale entrepreneurs are ubiquitous in emerging market economies, yet very few graduate to become larger businesses. We ask whether such entrepreneurs even aspire to grow, and if so, on which dimensions of the business? What factors influence these aspirations, how realistic are they, and do entrepreneurs dynamically update them based on realized outcomes?

M20|Price Discrimination in Online Retail|Although newspapers and online blogs provide a variety of anecdotal evidence for price discrimination, they are mostly not based on a scientific and systematic approach. This survey gives a short overview of scientific price discrimination studies in online retail. At first, it contains a short methodological part which shows how price discrimination can be detected. Thereafter, the results of different price discrimination studies are presented, showing that the prevalence of price discrimination varies across studies. Studies who analyze only ‘popular’ websites find a higher rate of prevalence than studies focusing also on ‘unpopular’ websites. As far as scientific evidence is available, online prices hinge on user-based, technical, and location-based features. The dispersion of the price seems to be largest when firms discriminate between users from different countries. Finally, potential reasons why price discrimination is not applied by all retailers are given.

M20|The Value of Being Socially Responsible. A Primal-Dual Approach|This paper models Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as one of the outputs that results from a firm's decisions regarding what and how to produce. The framework developed allows for studying technical efficiency and deriving a system of internal shadow prices to quantify the value of implementing socially responsible activities. The empirical application focuses on the food and beverage manufacturing sector worldwide. The results indicate high levels of technical efficiency in this sector and document a positive average shadow price of CSR activities, implying that the net value of implementing this kind of activities is positive to the firm as their benefit exceeds the cost. In particular, it is shown that increasing the CSR engagement at the margin positively contributes to the creation of firm value, while reducing it has a negative marginal impact.
M20|Time Compression (Dis)Economies: An Empirical Analysis|To investigate time compression dis-economies (TCD), this study estimated time-cost elasticities using 459 oil and gas global investment projects (1997-2010). Results show that the average cost of accelerating investments is negative: a firm could cut $6.3 million in costs of a single project by accumulating asset stocks one month faster. About 88 percent of the projects exhibit negative time-cost elasticities with over 39 percent of unrealized economies of time compression. Only 12 percent of the projects are subject to TCD. These time inefficiencies or frictions do not negate the existence of TCD, but suggest they are less prevalent than assumed in the literature. Management experience, R&D investment, firm size, economic development and political stability are shown to be associated with greater time compression efficiency.
M20|Managing Non-Governmental Organizations to Create Values in the Disruption Era|Objective - This paper explores the challenges faced by the Indonesia National Council on Social Welfare (INCSW) and its 64 organization members from 31 provinces in Indonesia. INCSW is a social organization that is the coordinating agency for social activities by the Government of Indonesia. The analysis includes strategic management of NGOs in the era of disruption, known as the industrial revolution 4.0. Methodology/Technique - This study uses a qualitative methodology procedure to produce descriptive data obtained from verbal answers and observable behavior. The data collection methods used in this study include interviews, surveys, observations, and use of documents as secondary data. Open interviews were conducted with several administrators and staff of the Indonesia National Council on Social Welfare (INCSW). Short questionnaires were given to 64 representatives of NGOs from 31 provinces. The interview and survey included questions that probed their understanding of the industrial revolution 4.0, disruptive innovation, willingness to change, and the readiness of the organization to create values in the era of disruption. Findings - The results show that technology use is still very lacking. The quality of human resources is of minimum concern in digital knowledge. The discussions include observations about the development of management strategies and a variety of programs offered by the Indonesia National Council on Social Welfare (INCSW). Novelty - This research is one of the few studies that examine non-profit organizations in order to create economic and social values in the era of disruption. This study explains the new paradigm of NGOs by changing the platform of NGO work operationalization. This study widens the application of 'network society' theory in the study of NGOs by emphasizing networks to create value for their stakeholders. The managerial implications of this study include the importance of technology use through social media for social sharing, thus communicating social issues more efficiently and effectively.
M20|The Strategic Role of Management of Human Resources to Prevent Corruption|Objective - Corruption is the greatest threat for growth and stability in an organization. The eradication of corruption has been achieved through instruments, law enforcement and inspectorate measures, but corruption levels in Indonesia are still not as low as other ASEAN countries such as Singapore and Malaysia. It is therefore necessary to expand the measures taken to eradicate corruption not only in terms of legal measures, but also within human resource management strategies. Methodology/Technique - This research uses a quantitative explorative technique using SPSS, a dependent variables of Prevent Corruption (Y), and independent variables of Organizational Culture (X1), Competence (X2), Leadership (X3) and Internal Control (X4). The study sample is the Directorate General of a Ministry in Indonesia with a population of 525 people, and a sample of 149 people. Findings - The study found that: (1) The regression equation model is Y = 0.014 + 0.972 X1 + 0,030 X2 - 0,053 X3 + 0,049 X4, RSq = 0,969, F = 1095,574; (2) culture is the most dominant factor in preventing corruption; (3) Competence, Leadership and Internal Control have no significant effect on the prevention of corruption; (4) Novelty - In the absence of improvements to existing policies, the rate of corruption in Indonesia is around 0.014 on a scale of 1-5.
M20|Industry and Financial Crises in Fragile and Zombie Firms: Does Leverage Matter?|Objective - This paper shows how leverage affects firm's fragility and financial soundness during financial and industry crises. Methodology/Technique - Long term inefficient and zombie firms are explored through the effects of leverage in additional tests. Findings - There are two main results obtained from the sample of Indonesian non-financial firms from 2007 to 2016. First, leverage has a statistically significant correlation with firm's fragility. Second, leverage has an effect on firm's financial soundness during industry crisis. Novelty - Unlike the previous paper, this paper demonstrates a significant implication on the need to differentiate fragile firms and firms that are persistently inefficient, such as zombie firms.

M20|Entrepreneurial Optimism and Creative Destruction|We provide empirical evidence that uncertainty (rather than risk) and optimism are distinctive characteristics of high-impact entrepreneurial firms (recently listed firms) relative to old, incumbent firms. Based on this evidence, we construct an entrepreneurial entry predation model with uncertainty. We show that entrepreneurial optimism can mitigate problems associated with strong incumbents' attempts to protect markets using predatory threats. Entrepreneurial optimism can also create a strategic advantage for entrepreneurs since incumbents may react by being less aggressive in product market interactions, which will benefit not only the profitability of the entrepreneur's venture but also consumers via lower prices
M20|What Do You Buy When No One’s Watching? The Effect of Self-Service Checkouts on the Composition of Sales in Retail|Buying items that are unhealthy or are of a private nature may carry a stigma and cause embarrassment. I analyze whether the anonymity provided by self-service checkouts changes customers' shopping patterns in grocery stores. I look at a natural experiment where two stores in a grocery-chain implement self-service checkouts. Using a triple difference estimator, comparing the sales of stigma items to the sales of mundane items and to the sales of a group of control stores, I find that the sales of stigma items increase by 10-15 percent. The increase comes from the product categories candy, chips, soda, ready-made food and alcohol. I find that the increase is caused by existing customers buying more, rather than from self-service checkouts changing the customer base. However, fully converting to self-service seems to scare away some customers and decreases overall sales.
M20|Absorptive Capacity and Firms’ Generation of Innovation - Revisiting Zahra and George’s Model|The firm’s absorptive capacity triggers its propensity to capture external knowledge, spurred by internal levers and cooperation liaisons, stimulating innovativeness. This paper revisits Zahra and George’s model of absorptive capacity and others, analysing the firm’s internal and liaison factors that affect its absorptive capacity, in order to predict their influence on innovation. Being the firm an open system, managers acknowledging such effects can design a more efficient open innovation business model in order to generate more innovation. We analyse firm-level internal indicators measuring firm’s absorptive capacity and a set of liaison factors, using a Portuguese sample of 571 service firms and 562 manufacturing firms that participated in the European Community Innovation Survey (CIS), 2010. Results reveal that internal R&D, acquisition of external R&D, acquisition of external knowledge (i.e., equipment, software, licenses and employee training) affect firms' generation of innovation, according to the different sub-samples, which provides several implications for science and innovation policy.
M20|Diagram bodu zvratu v podnikové ekonomice| Break-even analysis allows a simple way to determine how the changes in sales volume, sales prices, as well as variable and fixed costs influence the achieved profit result. The paper analyzes the relationships valid in break-even analysis and graphically shows the relationships in the form of the break-even point graph with the multi-component assortment and the break-even point graph after the technical assessment of the production capacity of production facility. The paper explains how to use the theoretical basis of the break-even analysis in the practice of business entities. The aim of the paper is to define relations valid for the complex application of the break-even analysis as a managerial tool in business practice. This paper presents mathematical formulations applicable in company practice, namely the mathematical formula applicable to the multi-component assortment structure and the mathematical formula applying the productive time fund to the break-even point graph. Additionally, the paper provides graphical solutions of the mentioned areas.
M20|Adapting Public Services to Citizen Requirements: Trend or Need?|Public services are the basic elements in the evolution of a local administration. They can be developed with the help of IT sector and received by the decision makers in due time, so that citizens can continue their life and evolution in relation to the new standard of living using computer technology. The technological level of a territorial administrative unit, as well as the opening to urban and computer technology, of the urban representatives, are directly proportional to the degree of the area development, either local or national. Thus, an adequate technological equipping of all public institutions can generate both information and a pool of information that will lead to a quicker, better justified and grounded decision that satisfies the needs of the citizen when requesting. Through this paper, the author aims to highlight the need to adapt new information technologies in public services, as well as the benefits of implementing and using them.
M20|Decomposition analysis of corporate carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions in Japan: Integrating corporate environmental and financial performances|Recent empirical studies often support the positive relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) in terms of carbon dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and corporate financial performance (CFP). However, this depends on the measurements of CEP (the absolute and relative CEP) and CFP (accounting‐based and market‐based CFP). To understand the relationship structurally, based on the literature, this study proposes identity models that integrate CO2 and GHG emissions and financial factors. The models decompose CO2 (GHG) emissions into carbon intensity (GHG intensity), energy intensity, the cost‐to‐sales ratio, the total‐assets‐turnover ratio (TATR), leverage, and equity. The model of supply‐chain GHG emissions additionally adopts supply‐chain GHG intensity. As a decomposition method, this study uses the log‐mean Divisia index. As an application example of the CO2 model, this study targets Japanese manufacturing firms in 16 sectors from fiscal years (FY) 2011 to 2015. Results show that the change in CO2 emissions as of 2015 (−802.1 kilotonnes [kt]) is decomposed into 2922.5 kt for carbon intensity, −26036.3 kt for energy intensity, −6350.5 kt for the cost‐to‐sales ratio, −8495.6 kt for the TATR, −7912.3 kt for leverage, and 45070.1 kt for equity. Average values of relative contribution ratios are 20.6% for carbon intensity, 19.1% for energy intensity, and the remaining approximately 60% for financial factors. Among the 16 sectors, as of 2015, the change in total CO2 emission is statistically significantly positive for equity and significantly negative for the TATR and leverage.

У чланку се разматра коришћење двају приступа анализи солвентности предузећа – традиционалног, заснованог на показатељима из биланса стања и биланса успеха, и новог, заснованог на показатељима из извештаја о кретању новчаних средстава. Уз помоћ дисперзионе анализе показано је да та два приступа резултирају значајно различитим оценама солвентности. То омогућује закључак, да за анализу солвентности (превасходно) треба користити и динамичке показатеље. English. The article considers the use of two approaches in the analysis of enterprise’s solvency – traditional, based on balance and profit and loses balance, and new, based on indicators from cash-flow report. With the analysis of variance, on the data for one of the branches of Serbian economy, it was showed, that these two approaches give significantly different estimates of enterprise’s solvency. It makes possible to conclude, that for analysis of solvency it is necessary to use too (at first) dynamic indicators.
M20|Optimization of Inventory Management Logistic Model of the Machine-Building Enterprises|"The aim of this study is to develop the inventory management model based on Economic Order Quantity model using asymptotic perturbation methods. The simple asymptotic formulas for the ""perturbed"" order quantity has been obtained when cost per order, storage cost and product demand change slightly. As the results show, the total costs, which correspond to ""perturbed"" order quantities, are less than ones at economic order quantity. Decrease of logistics costs can improve the market competitiveness of the machine-building enterprises' products. Modeling the nature of cost increase and demand fluctuation using asymptotic formulas the machine-building enterprises will be able to make prompt adjustments to optimize logistics processes."
M20|Contemporary Developments in Behavioral Finance|Investors need not be rational for markets to be efficient. The axiom of efficient market hypothesis that it is not possible to earn excess profits because the available information gets factored in instantaneously fell flat due to influence of human behavior on the investment process. Exuberance of investors escalates asset values unduly on the back of financial irrationality. The intersection of human behavior and the investment decisions has since evolved as “behavioral finance.” Research demonstrates that investment decision-making process is more human than analytical, owing to behavioral biases. Recent studies in prospect theory and heuristic decision-making process focused more on investor behavior causing market anomalies. At a time when irrational behavior is demonstrated not only in security markets but also in other markets such as property, bullion and commodities, this paper explores the contemporary research in behavioral finance.
M20|The conduciveness of the South African economic environment and Small, Medium and Micro Enterprise sustainability: A literature review|Since the early 1980s Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) have been regarded as the driving forces of both developing and developed economies around the world. In a South African dispensation, SMMEs are responsible for adding imperative socio-economic value to the country, particularly in terms of eradicating poverty and diminishing unemployment levels. By doing so, these business entities are believed to contribute at least 50% to the national Gross Domestic Product. Albeit the aforementioned, previous research studies report that up to 75% of South African SMMEs fail after being in existence for only 42 months. Though the latter dispensation has been blamed on many economic factors, over the years the sustainability of South African SMMEs has not improved to a great extent. In order to provide insight on the latter dispensation, this literature review paper was conducted to ultimately formulate two hypotheses for further empirical testing.
M20|Regional Financing Of Msmes In The State Of Guanajuato, Mexico, Financiamiento Regional De Las Mipymes En El Estado De Guanajuato|This research analyzes the characteristics of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMES) financial services according to the territorial distribution of regions. We also identify aspects of geographic and economic factors of influence in the development and growth of enterprises in the state of Guanajuato, MÃ©xico. An empirical analysis was carried out through a survey of 396 MSMES randomly distributed in the regions of the State of Guanajuato during 2015. Data acquired demonstrated differences in regions due to the characteristics of financing of MSMEs across regions. Hence, these regional differences may affect the development and growth of MSMES in the State of Guanajuato, Mexico
M20|Healthy business? Managerial education and management in healthcare|We investigate the link between hospital performance and managerial education by collecting a large database of management practices and skills in hospitals across nine countries. We find that hospitals that are closer to universities offering both medical education and business education have higher management quality, more MBA trained managers and lower mortality rates. This is true compared to the distance to universities that offer only business or medical education (or neither). We argue that supplying joint MBA-healthcare courses may be a channel through which universities increase medical business skills and raise clinical performance
M20|The role of stakeholders in the process of building a competi-tive advantage with the example of development companies|"Research background: Contemporary companies are faced with opportunities as well as dangers resulting from relationships with their environment. It is therefore important to define stakeholders and manage relations with them by implement-ing organizational principles and practices that take into account stakeholders' concerns and objectives, but are also consistent with a company's strategy and its economic goals (Banks, Vera, Pathak, Ballard, 2016, pp. 18-27). Purpose of the article: The aim of this article is a diagnosis of a sort of the theory of stakeholders present in the relevant literature. In addition, stakeholder identifi-cation was presented along with their role in the process of building a competitive advantage of a development company. Methodology/methods: An analysis of secondary sources was verified by empiri-cal studies. An analysis of the role of stakeholders in the functioning of an enter-prise was made using the so-called 'brainstorming method'. The study was con-ducted with the students of faculties at the Faculty of Management of the Bi-alystok Technical University in December 2012 and in the years 2014-2016. Findings & Value added: In the first part of the article, the key assumptions of the stakeholder theory and their impact on the competitiveness of entities are discussed, and the term ""a development company"" is defined. The second part presents conclusions from empirical research. These made it possible to formulate a list of main stakeholders who contribute to building a competitive advantage for developers. These entities are included in several groups: customers, suppliers, strategic partners, regulators and current and potential competitors."
M20|Organizational Resilience of Family Business: Case Study|Organizational resilience, understood as an ability to survive in harsh market conditions, captures increased research consideration in recent years. The same applies to family businesses that attracted significant attention lately. Although the interest in the topic grows, there are still remaining questions to be answered. In the paper we focus on identifying factors affecting organizational abilities to adapt to dynamic, hostile and complex environment especially when disruptive events occur in the environment. Literature studies in the topic allowed development of research proposition - organizational resilience should help to survive negative occurrences in the environment and family business should focus their attention on building resilience capacity while it may allow and facilitate longevity and well-being of an organization. We illustrate this proposition with the use of two family company cases from the Silesian Voivodeship. The first is a case of a large production company that existed between 2010 and 2013, and after receiving increased growth in 2005-2012 period it went bankrupt in 2014 after two large contracts. The second is a case of a developer company from the same region that started its operation in the same period and managed to develop both its market and products in years. We compare the data flowing from interviews with the owners (that are also managers of these companies) using Eisenhardt (1989) methodology and that leads to creation of propositions for future research. Research results indicate there are several factors influencing ability to cope with critical situations. Firstly, we identified that professionalization of management of family business leads to better chances to survive in the environment.

M20|Global consolidation of industries and business failures: insights from brick-and-mortar and online outlets|Although online platforms are increasingly seen as a linchpin for firms competing in the 21st century, our understanding of competition between the traditional brick-and-mortar and online outlets, and how this can lead to different types of business failures, remains limited. In the light of the disjointed nature of the current streams of research, we propose an integrated framework that classifies the differential effects of online and brick-and-mortar competition. Based on a review of the literature, the study identified four competitive dynamics, i.e. bricks vs. bricks; clicks vs. bricks; clicks vs. clicks and brick-and-click, and explores how they can lead to different kinds of business. It is contended that the failure rate is likely to rise for small firms that adopt a sole brick-and-mortar strategy largely due to the risk of becoming “research shops”. The study contributes to comparative strategic management literature by shedding light on the evolution of online and offline management strategies and practices across the globe. In this direction, the study provides insights on some aspects both universal and country-specific features in the evolution of online and offline. The analysis highlights the importance of championing successful blending of both online and offline platforms.
M20|Access to Finance Constraint and SMEs Functioning in Ghana|Well-functioning small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are a fundamental part of the economic fabric in developing countries, and play a crucial role in contributing to GDP growth, reducing unemployment as well as furthering innovation and prosperity. Unfortunately, they are strongly restricted in accessing the capital that they require to grow, expand and function, with nearly half of SMEs in developing countries rating access to finance as a major constraint. This paper examines the link between access to finance and SMEs functioning in Ghana. The study resorts to the current World Bank Enterprise Survey data released for Ghana (2013); and using chi-square, logit and ordered logit analysis, it finds out that access to credit is a major constraint of SMEs in Ghana with implications for their functioning and growth. The study recommends, therefore, that governments should create the enabling environment for SMEs to function effectively by providing financing avenues and improving access to financing.
M20|Social assistance and its importance in economy|Social assistance is an important component of the national and international economy and indicates the degree of development of local and national government, being an important element in the composition of the administration budget. A sensitive and, at the same time, special issue of social policies is the need of social assistants, which over time has led to political confrontations, electoral strategies, but also to the construction and implementation of economic strategies in order to track, guide and diminish the number of social assistants and reduce the budget burden. Local and national budgets are affected by the number of social assistants, and accurately categorizing them in well-defined categories can generate targeted policies with varying degrees of implementation among social assistants, depending on the category they belong to, generating social assistance where appropriate, and a reduction in the number of social assistants who should not benefit from this form of assistance. Through this article we want to highlight the close link between the social aid granted by the state through the social assistance programs offered to the people able to carry out gainful employment, the consequences of these social assistance measures on the labor market and the influence of this phenomenon in the local economy and national.
M20|Italian industrial districts: theories, profiles and competitiveness|The paper is a contribution to the debate about the theoretical aspects, the structure, and the competitiveness of Italian industrial districts. The work first examines the theoretical strand on industrial districts ranging from Marshall to Becattini, and focusing on the contemporary distrettualism of Giacomo Becattini, where the district is essentially a socio-economic construct and an important localized productive system. Furthermore, the paper offers an updated picture of the Italian industrial districts as they are represented in the 2011 Census by the National Statistics Institute. Finally, this study underlines the resilient competitive capacity of this typical form of industrial organization. Then, through empirical literature, it analyzes the Italian district companies, and their performance and success in foreign markets, especially with regard to “Made in Italy” products.
M20|An empirical investigation of factors affecting the performance of women entrepreneurs in Harare: a case of food vendors|Zimbabwe, whose economy is under life support; continues to be characterized by company closures with many workers losing their jobs through retrenchments (Nyathi et al, 2018). This fragile economic situation has resulted in a number of Zimbabweans resorting to entrepreneurship as their last option. We note with kin interest that the growth of women entrepreneurs in Zimbabwe has also increased significantly. This study seeks to empirically investigate the factors that affect the performance of women entrepreneurs in Harare. The study adopts a case study approach, specifically focused on food vendors in Harare. Questionnaires consisting of structured and unstructured questions were used for data collection. The research employed purposive sampling to select the target population and 190 questionnaires were completed and analyzed. While consistent with both the psychological and economic theories of entrepreneurship, the results of this study also indicate that the performance of women entrepreneurs in the food vending sector in Zimbabwe continues to be hindered by a serious lack of adequate financial resources. The study managed to come up with two main policy recommendations that are envisioned to go a long way in improving the performance of women entrepreneurs in Zimbabwe.
M20|Commercial Banks Performance in Ghana: Does Capital Structure Matter?|This study seeks to investigate the relationship between capital structure and commercial banks performance in Ghana. Using a panel data of listed commercial banks spanning from 2010-2015, the Ordinary Least Squares regression model is employed to estimate the functions relating to bank performance (measured by Return on Equity) with measures of capital structure. The findings show statistically significant relationship between commercial banks’ performance and all the capital structure measures (the ratios of short-term debt to total capital, long-term debt to total capital, and total debt to total capital). Whereas total debt and banks’ performance are positively correlated, short-term debt and long-term debt are inversely related to banks’ performance. In essence, using large proportion of debt significantly enhance commercial banks performance in Ghana.
M20|The Effect Of Economic Determinants On Performance Of Dairy Cooperative Societies In Kericho County|This study sought to establish the effect of economic determinants on the performance of dairy cooperative societies in Kericho County. Specifically, the study was to determine the performance trends of the societies and the extent to which economic determinants affect performance. The following economic determinants were examined; capital formation, competition, volatility of prices of milk, capacity utilisation, adoption of technology and entrepreneurship. The study adopted descriptive research design, using census of the entire population of 51 respondents comprising 36 members of management committees, 4 managers and 11 employees of 5 active dairy cooperative societies. Both primary and secondary data were collected for the purpose of the study. Primary data was collected using a questionnaire while secondary data was collected in a schedule. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics which included percentages. Data was presented by use of tables and charts. The findings indicated that the performance of dairy cooperative societies in Kericho County was on decline and were affected by economic determinants. Total turnover for three cooperative societies decreased from Kshs 9, 304,000 in 2008 to Kshs 2,970,000 in 2012, showing 68% decline. Average milk prices paid to members decreased from 80% to 64% of alternative channels prices in 2008 and 2012 respectively. Overall, the dominant economic determinant is capital formation which was considered by 85.7% of respondents to affect performance to a high extent; followed by entrepreneurship (67.4%), capacity utilisation (67.3%), adoption of technology (63.3%), and competition (53.1%). 38. 8% of the respondents considered volatility of milk prices affected performance to a low extent, 40.8% were neutral and 20.4% believed the effect was to a high extent. This study recommends the transformation of dairy cooperative societies in Kericho County from traditional agricultural producer marketing organisations to New Generation Cooperatives, which while preserving the cooperative principles such as one member one vote on policy issues and distribution of earnings according to patronage, focus on value, added processing activities. It is further recommended that dairy cooperative societies prepare and implement strategic and business plans to promote development, growth and performance in a dynamic economic environment faced with industrialization, globalisation and technological changes affecting business organisations. Further research can be done on social factors that affect performance of dairy cooperative societies in Kericho County.
M20|A Legal Effect of European Union's Business Law Policy: Single Member Companies in Turkish Law|The concept of single-member company has been studied in the doctrine by lawyers and economists for more than hundred years. Single-member companies have become widespread by virtue of the European Union?s legal instructions and mostly subsequent acceleration of states? legislation efforts in order to allow foundation of single-member companies pursuant to their national laws. The dangers which single-member companies may generate are matters of discussion as well as the possible benefits of single-member companies to the national and international markets. Authorization of a single-member company foundation is one of the most important changes that were brought by Turkish Commercial Code with its entry into force in 1 July 2012. It is understandable from analysis of company foundation statistics provided by official authorities that incorporation of a company by a single member is widely embraced by market players. Presently, the European Union labours with a directive proposal which aims formation of new and more practical single-member company type. The outcome of these economic policy borne legal efforts will have significant effects on Turkey as a current member of the European Customs Union and a candidate country for the European Union, and foreign investors who plan to invest in Turkey.
M20|Forecasting the Success Rate of Reward Based Crowdfunding Projects|The present paper develops three models that help predict the success rate and attainable investment levels of online crowdfunding ventures. This is done by applying standard economic theory and machine learning techniques from computer science to the novel sector of on-line crowd-based micro- financing. In contrast with previous research in the area, this paper analyzes transaction-level data in addition to information about completed crowdfunding projects. This provides an unique perspective in the ways crowd finance ventures develop. The models reach an average of 83% accuracy in predicting the outcome of a crowdfunding campaign at any point throughout its duration. These ndings prove that a number of product and project specifi c parameters are indicative of the success of the venture. Subsequently, the paper provides guidance to capital seekers and investors on the basis of these criteria, and allows participants in the crowdfunding marketplace to make more rational decisions.
M20|Quality splitting in waste incineration due to non-convex production possibilities|Abstract Using a real case study of waste incineration, we show a new form of non-convexity in the transformation process of the inputs into the outputs. Its consequence is quality splitting, i.e. the separate use of different input qualities, yielding a better result than a homogeneous mix. For waste incineration plants (WIP), this leads to surprising practical implications for strategies of waste collection and supply, as well as for the control of a WIP. The insights are based on the evaluation of a basic model of waste incineration developed for the case study. Thus, the paper also contributes to production research by modelling waste incineration as a central process for the “reduction” of waste from manufacturing and consumption.
M20|Zukunft der Innenstädte? - Auswirkungen zunehmender Online-Käufe auf den stationären Einzelhandel und die Innenstädte|Demographischer Wandel, Innovationen innerhalb der Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologie und die Digitalisierung ändern das Kaufverhalten der Konsumenten zunehmend. Innerhalb der letzten zwei Jahrzehnte ist der E-Commerce in Deutschland ständig gewachsen und hat sich die Struktur des stationären Handels stark verändert. In der Folge nimmt die Versorgungsfunktion des stationären Handels in den Städten ab und macht diese zusehends weniger attraktiv. In einigen Regionen Deutschlands, vor allem in ländlichen Gegenden und in der Umgebung von Großstädten, leiden Kleinstädte unter diesen strukturellen Veränderungen der Handelslandschaft. Immer häufiger wird in der Öffentlichkeit die Frage nach der Verödung der (Innen-)Städte gestellt. Mit diesem Arbeitspapier wird eine breite Informationsgrundlage geschaffen, die Motive für den Innenstadtbesuch bzw. für den Kauf in Geschäftsstätten des stationären Einzelhandels, das gegenwärtige Online-Kaufverhalten, Prognosen zur zukünftigen Entwicklung des E-Commerce und schließlich Handlungshinweise, wie auf diese grundlegenden Änderungen reagiert werden kann, umfasst. Die Handlungshinweise richten sich an Unternehmen des Einzelhandels, ihre Verbände und Interessengemeinschaften, ebenso wie an Kammern, Immobilienbesitzer und an die öffentliche Verwaltung.
M20|Erweitertes Management Reporting mit SAP S/4HANA auf Basis des Universal Journals: Realtime-Ergebnisreporting mit umfassenden Auswertungsmöglichkeiten durch die Weiterentwicklung der Financials-Funktionalität|SAP S/4 HANA schafft mit dem Universal Journal eine Datenbanktabelle (ACDOCA) welche die bisherigen Datenbasen für Accounting (FI) und Controlling (CO) zusammenführt. Damit entsteht eine einheitliche und integrierte Datenbasis (Single Source of Truth), welche die bisher notwendigen Anpassungen und Abstimmungen zur Herbeiführung einheitlicher Auswertungen und Standardreports (Single Point of Truth) überflüssig macht. Die vollständige Erfassung aller Kontierungen und Zusatzinformationen (Attributierungen) zum Zeitpunkt der Transaktion ermöglicht weiterhin eine sofortige Auswertung ('Realtime-Reporting'). Soweit rein transaktionsbasierte Informationen betroffen sind, muss daher nicht auf den Perioden- oder Monatsabschluss gewartet werden. Die Verarbeitung dieser Daten im In-Memory-Computing bedeutet gleichzeitig, dass die Daten jederzeit für Auswertungen zur Verfügung stehen und nicht in Datentöpfen wie einem Business Warehouse o.ä. zwischengespeichert werden müssen. Verbunden mit der enormen Verarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit werden damit den Nutzern entscheidungs- und steuerungsrelevante Informationen in deutlich verbesserter Qualität und wesentlich zeitnäher zur Verfügung gestellt. Die dargestellten technischen Möglichkeiten haben für die Unternehmen weitreichende organisatorische Konsequenzen. Accounting- und Controllingaufgaben rücken näher zusammen. Die Prozesse werden verschlankt. Die operativen Führungskräfte in den wertschöpfenden Prozessen (Vertrieb, Produktion, Einkauf) werden direkt und zeitnah aus den Systemen mit den steuerungs- und entscheidungsrelevanten Informationen versorgt. Controlling und Accounting werden als reine Informationslieferanten zunehmend entbehrlich.
M20|The Role of Decision-making Methods in Business Performance|Decision-making is a central problem, widespread, difficult and an intellectual engagement with responsibility to protect from risk. This paper does not cover all the problems of decision-making in business but it is focused on the impact of decision-making methods in business performance that is characterized by some performance indicators. A few theoritical problems of decision-making are presented in the framework of the paper.

The objective of the paper is to measure the impact of decision-making methods in business performance.
M20|College Textbook Publishing|Based on the authorâ€™s many years of experience in college textbook publishing, this article discusses three topics relevant to the textbook-publishing business: (a) the motivations of the author and publisher regarding revenue maximization versus profit maximization, (b) the reimportation of textbooks as an impediment to the international price-discrimination practices of publishers, and (c) the effects of mergers among publishers. Each of these topics is an application of undergraduate microeconomic theories and principles.
M20|Determinants of Customer Relationship Development|Customer relationship development is the focus of any business. It is increasingly found to be at the top of organisations´ agendas, aiming at creating and enhancing relationships with customers in order to improve both business profitability and satisfaction of customers. Measuring customer focus can be helpful in understanding this effort by providing a valuable framework for customer relations assessment. In this context our research offers an integrated approach for understanding the customer relationships. The aim of our article is threefold: we aim to indicate and explore the determinants for improving customer relationship development in tourist sector, to propose measures for assessing customer focus in tourist organisations in Slovakia and to explain relationship between customer relationship level and business performance. This will be achieved by determining the subcategories of the customer management processes and by identifying determinants affecting business performance. In order to translate customer focus into specific activities designed to increase business performance, the determinants were made operational applying quantitative analysis. Results of the research reveal that tourist companies in Slovakia adopt customer oriented approach and try to optimize their relationships with customers. However, there is a space towards continual improvement. In our article, factors with insufficient performance have been discussed and solutions proposed to improve the results. Finally, a framework for determining the strength of the relationship between business performance and customer focus variables is introduced.
M20|Dimensions Of Expert Report Complexity In Intellectual/Industrial Property. Case Study|The growing number of complex processes with the specific intellectual / industrial property demonstrated the need for highly qualified experts called in solving technical problems in the court files. The expertise in such field obliges to detailed knowledge of domestic and international law. However, those processes have as conjugate subjects: counterfeiting inventions, trademarks, industrial design; unfair competition; calculating damage that leads to highlighting the economic benefits, the latter requiring economic assessment of an intangible asset using in formula,in addition to economic data, micro - and macro-economic risk factors. Conflicts arise in a specific space. It is therefore necessary detailed knowledge of company law, competition law, that relating to interest, insolvency and bankruptcy in their developments. It should be considered domestic and European legal practice, as well as the rapid evolution of the meaning of legal terms and concepts. Experts have to understand solutions given in the prior complaints for correct interpretation of the provisions of the agreements, laws and regulations derived. The paper refersto one of the most complex expertise reports, which forced expert to integrated legislation acquaintances on patents, on insolvency and interest - in their evolution. But fundamentally, the expert had to understand the phenomenon of engineering and how to measure economic efficiency in the case of a divided invention.
M20|Optimizing the allocation of fast charging infrastructure along the German autobahn|Abstract The allocation of fast charging stations is a severe investment for the future mobility system with electric vehicles. The allocation of the first charging stations influences the profitability of all other fast charging stations and should therefore be perfectly arranged. Hence, we applied and extended the flow-refueling location model (FRLM) developed by Capar et al. (Eur J Oper Res 227(1):142–151, 2013) to the German autobahn with a focus on the states Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria with 595 nodes and 3569 highway km. Our model extension comprehends mainly the inclusion of the access distance for traffic participants to their closest network node. In order to analyze the impact of different vehicle ranges and the desired coverage of flows we defined four scenarios. The results indicate the significance of vehicle range and the desired coverage value. 20 optimally allocated fast charging stations along the highways lead already to a coverage of about 62 % (100 km vehicle range) or even 83 % (150 km vehicle range) of all trips. A complete coverage of trips requires at least 50 (150 km vehicle range), 77 (100 km vehicle range) or even 84 (70 km vehicle range) fast charging stations. The last 30 % coverage leads to a tripling of charging stations. Furthermore, a first estimation of the corresponding surcharge for fixed costs per charging process amounts to about 20 % of the total costs for a charging process.
M20|Communication versus (Restricted) Delegation: An Experimental Comparison|This paper reports the results from a laboratory experiment investigating a manager's decision whether or not to delegate authority to a better informed worker whose interests are often, but not always, congruent. Keeping authority implies a loss of information, as the worker communicates his information strategically. Delegating authority leads to a loss of control. A key aspect of our design is that the manager can restrict the worker's choice set when delegating authority. We find that, in case of delegation, managers (as predicted) put tighter restrictions when interests are less aligned. Workers send more informative messages under communication than predicted by the pure strategy equilibria. This finding neither appears to be driven by lying aversion of workers nor by credulity of managers. Qualitatively, our results are in line with a mixed strategy equilibrium under communication, which strictly outperforms optimal restricted delegation and is relatively close to the optimal stochastic mechanism in our setting.
M20|Il contributo dellâ€™attivitÃ motoria nella razionalizzazione della spesa sanitaria. Unâ€™analisi della letteratura riferita ai pazienti cardiopatici|The main goal of any health care organization is to maximize patientsâ€™ health status. However, the issue related to the optimal allocation of scarce resources highlights the need to undertake choices among the available alternatives. In the medical field, physical inactivity has been identified as the fourth leading risk factor, counting the 6% of global mortality. Moreover, physical inactivity is associated to several diseases, including cardiovascular diseases. In particular, costs related to a sedentary lifestyle have a massive impact on health expenditure. Therefore, the need to develop large- scale intervention programs has arisen. Through a systematic literature review, this paper aims at highlighting both the role of physical activity in the rationalization of health expenditure, and its impact on the wellbeing of cardiac patients. It will be particularly emphasized the role of economic valuation methodologies and public policies aimed to increase physical activity levels in the population.

M20|Business Practices in Small Firms in Developing Countries|Management has a large effect on the productivity of large firms. But does management matter in micro and small firms, where the majority of the labor force in developing countries works? We develop 26 questions that measure business practices in marketing, stock-keeping, record-keeping, and financial planning. These questions have been administered in surveys in Bangladesh, Chile, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria and Sri Lanka. We show that variation in business practices explains as much of the variation in outcomes – sales, profits and labor productivity and TFP – in microenterprises as in larger enterprises. Panel data from three countries indicate that better business practices predict higher survival rates and faster sales growth. The effect of business practices is robust to including numerous measures of the owner’s human capital. We find that owners with higher human capital, children of entrepreneurs, and firms with employees employ better business practices. Competition has less robust effects.
M20|Deregulation and the determinants of entry: Evidence from the German interurban bus industry|Two years after the deregulation of the German interurban bus industry in January 2013, two new entrants emerged as market leaders: MeinFernbus (MFB) and FlixBus (FB). We use a comprehensive route-level data set to investigate the determinants of route entry for both providers. Applying survival models, we find that both companies show an increased probability to enter populous, centrally located routes with large shares of young inhabitants; however, they both avoid entries into routes including an airport or with low quality rail connection. Furthermore, both market leaders refrain from entering small and medium-sized routes in which another provider is already operating. In large markets, however, they both show an increased entry probability independent of the presence of a competitor.
M20|Resilience, Risk and Entrepreneurship| Farmers worldwide face an increasingly turbulent environment. Successful farmers are those that adapt to shifts in the environment to capture the opportunities from such disturbance and outperform those who do not adapt. Such farmers, the literature would suggest, are entrepreneurs, catalysts for change with a risk-taking propensity. The paper presents analysis of farmers grouped with respect to their attitude to risk. It identifies that those farmers that are risk seekers would be more accurately described as gamblers based on their performance over six years of volatility. The most successful group of farmers were risk neutral, had a strong business focus and skills, managing quite high levels of debt to good effect. They had a positive attitude to change and an ability to successfully adapt to changing conditions so best fit the broader definition of entrepreneur. The risk averse group carried less debt and also outperformed the risk seeking group with strong cash results and retained earnings. Farmers cannot be assumed to be successful catalysts for change just from their attitude to risk and a belief in their ability to manage risk; instead they are those whose results prove that they are successfully taking risks, have strong business skills and run efficient farm businesses.
M20|A Review Of ‘Brain Computation As Hierarchical Abstraction’|This article is a review of the book ‘Brain Computation As Hierarchical Abstraction’ by Dana H. Ballard published by MIT press in 2015. The book series computational neuroscience familiarizes the reader with the computational aspects of brain functions based on neuroscientific evidence. It provides an excellent introduction of the functioning, i.e. the structure, the network and the routines of the brain in our daily life. The final chapters even discuss behavioral elements such as decision-making, emotions and consciousness. These topics are of high relevance in other sciences such as economics and philosophy. Overall, Ballard’s book stimulates a scientifically well-founded debate and, more importantly, reveals the need of an interdisciplinary dialogue towards social sciences.
M20|Paradigm Of Accounting Change|The words and phrases swop with each other and the apparent stability of a word’s meaning sometimes change in time. This explains why the generic term of accounting is used when referring to the qualities attributed to accounting,but also when it comes to organizing financial accounting function within the entity, and when referring concretely to keeping a double record with its specific means, methods and tools specific, respectively seen as a technical accounting.Speaking about the qualities of accounting, but also about the organizational form it takes, we note that there is a manifold meaning of the word accounting, which is why the purpose of this article is to demonstrate that the paradigm shift aimed at a new set of rules and if the rules changes, then we can change the very purpose of accounting.
M20|THE CORRELATION BETWEEN STRATEGIC PLANNING AND ECONOMIC MOROCCAN SME’s PERFORMANCE|Among management activities, the strategic function retains increasingly attention of authors being interested in SME's (small and medium-sized enterprise) performance. Indeed, there are many authors who think that by following a strategy building formal process, SMEs can increase chances of success, while others consider that by trusting their manager’s intuition, SMEs can stimulate creativity and develop important competitive advantages at the same time. Further to these controversies, we aim through this communication to partake in this debate mattering to both researchers and managers by revising the relation between strategic planning and SMEs' economic performance. So as to handle this matter, we verify nearby 100 Moroccan SMEs, the degree of importance they grant to strategic planning. We also examine how SMEs strategic planning may or not be associated with their economic performance as measured by average variation sales over the last three years.
M20|The Impact Of Ifrs Norms On Internal Governance Mechanisms With Regard To Socio-Economic Context|The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adoption on internal governance mechanisms with regard to socio-economic context. Empirical investigation was conducted to assess whether a company and an individual specifications can be presented as part of a general pattern. The results confirm that IFRS framework has introduced a new design of the accounting formalism facing a more complex activity leading to enlargement the discretionary space. Socio-economic factors explain perfectly the corporate governance behaviors and confirmed that the less powerful members of our firms sample expect and accept that power is distributed unequally, the leaders prefer to act as individuals rather than as members of groups, the management positions are generally held by men than by women, these members are threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations and finally, managers stand for the fostering in a society of pragmatic virtues oriented to future rewards, in particular perseverance, thrift and adapting to changing circumstances.

M20|Study Regarding Management Of Learning And Teaching Process|The paper presents some tendencies of the educational process and the way it is managed. The main objectives are to identify the problems of the nowadays system and propose some solutions in order to increase the outcomes in schools. The research methodology consists in a quantitative study conducted on a number of 156 students from different universities in Romania and also different specializations in June 2016. The results can be useful for researchers and professors interested in improving their teaching methods and adjust them to the students’ needs, but also to managers in the educational system that could improve the process by making better decisions.
M20|Leadership Styles In Smes: An Exploratory Study In Romania|The manager’s leadership styles define the way a manager acts behaves and takes decisions in certain situations and has a direct influence upon the employees’ well-being. In a small and medium enterprise setting, unlike in a large enterprise, the employees are feeling the influence of the leadership style in a much more direct and personal way, due to the small number of hierarchical levels and the constant interaction between the owner/manager and the employees. The present paper focuses on analyzing how the employees of SMEs from Oltenia and Muntenia Regions of Romania perceive their superiors’ leadership styles. In order to meet this goal, we have used a 21 question survey, based on which we could determine the leadership style (Autocratic, Democratic or Laissez-faire) of the superior, as it is perceived by each respondent. The survey has been applied on a sample of cca. 300 employees from small and medium enterprises from Oltenia, and approximately 130 responses have been used in the actual research. The results of this study will be used in a further research, in which we aim to compare the way the managers perceive their own leadership style and how it is perceived by their employees.

The manner to approach this problem is somewhat less used in the literature. We used a research based on a questionnaire applied to a sample of professional accountants in Romania. We watched through the questionnaire to identify how professional accountants in Romania organizations perceive their role and work related to decisions of the various categories of stakeholders, but primarily to assist management decisions.
M20|Individualism Versus Collectivism In Economic Organizations From South-West Oltenia Region|"Starting from the major impact the organizational culture exerts over long-term performance of organizations and on the competitive advantage, in the theory and practice of management the concerns for understanding its multiple facets have intensified worldwide. This is highlighted by the numerous intercultural studies that emphasize the ""invisible force"" of each nation's culture and each organization's culture, which constitutes irrefutable arguments for enhancing the knowledge in this area. In this context, this study highlights how the cultural dimension ""individualism-collectivism"" influences the behavior of employees, in general, but especially that of managers from South-West Oltenia Region. The study results are based on the responses of 1086 respondents from 70 organizations in various fields of economic activity, whose opinions were investigated in two perspectives: current practice and desired practice. This paper presents some of the findings resulted from the research COMOR- Managerial Behavior in the Organizations in Romania, initiated and carried out throughout the country since 2009 by the Management Scientific Society of Romania (SSMAR) in collaboration with the Association of Faculties of Economics in Romania (AFER)."
M20|Mutual Trustworthiness as a Governance Mechanism in Business Relationships – A Dyadic Data Analysis|Based on a literature review, we develop a research profile that illustrates that survey-based, trust-related empirical research has severe limitations. It usually carries out general relationship analysis using single end or quasi two-sided sampling and classic statistical constructs. We designed and carried out an empirical research that was highly situational, applied dyadic operationalisation, pairwise sampling, and dyadic data analysis – a special statistical approach and toolset developed by psychologists and used to analyse interdependencies in relationships. Our main contribution is methodological and theoretical since the paper gives a structured overview on the methodological challenges in analysing mutuality in trust, but also in other relational attributes. The paper not only makes these methodological problems explicit, but also offers a potential solution to overcome some of their limitations.

M20|Assessing the Actual Stage of Social and Environmental Reporting of the Companies Listed at Bucharest Stock Exchange|Transparency is becoming a worldwide necessity determined by the increasing demand of responsible actors regarding certain justification related to the impact of different entities towards the environment. Within an economic environment described by complexity, continuous change and development our paper aims to provide an image of contemporary reporting practices in a developing country with regard to the inclusion of social and environmental aspects within reporting practices. This paper aims at examining the extent to which the Bucharest Stock Exchange listed companies belonging to premium and standard categories report on CSR and the way stock price evolution can be explained through financial profitability, size, leverage, industry and CSR disclosures. The results achieved show that there is a concern among Romanian listed companies to include environmental and social disclosures in their reporting practices during 2001-2014 analyzed period, a significant number of companies reporting on CSR aspects.
M20|Relationship between risk and transparency in the financial statements of professional services entities|The purpose of financial reports is to provide useful information to users; the utility of information is defined through the qualitative characteristics (fundamental and enhancing). The financial crisis emphasized the limits of financial reporting, which has been unable to prevent investors about the risks they were facing. Due to the current changes in business environment, managers been highly motivated to rethink and improve the risk governance philosophy, processes and methodologies. The lack of quality, timely data and adequate systems to capture, report and measure the right information across the organization are fundamental challenges to implementing and sustaining all aspects of effective risk management. Starting from ‘80s, the investors have become more interested in narratives (from the Notes to financial statements), than in primary reports (which disclose financial position and performance). In this research, we aim to identify whether the accounting services entities disclose risk information in their financial statements. The research will use a regression model for the assessment of the relationship between the size, profitability, leverage ratios and risk reporting by the accounting and taxation services providers in Romania during the period 2009-2013
M20|Key Factors for Success of Social Enterprises in Italy: Analysis of Financial and Operating Performance|Assessing social performance is one of the greatest challenges for practitioners and researchers in social entrepreneurship. Even though social enterprises (SEs) have the main goal of achieving social purposes, they should also be able to economically and financially survive to meet their aim and accomplish their tasks. To this purpose, we investigate if the key factors leading to the financial and operating performance are the same as those of for-profit firms, by using Italian data at a firm level during the period 2002-2013. We find that the standard financial and operating factors characterising for-profit firms¡¯ performance play a crucial role for SEs¡¯ results as well. Moreover, territorial and socio-economic variables seem to have a positive impact on financial performance. From a policy perspective, this may imply that further programs (e.g. safety-oriented and those promoting facilities in the territory) should be locally adopted to support the SEs¡¯ activity and development.
M20|Key Logistics Location Selection Factors In Retail Business|Location selection as a methodological basis for determining the rules and criteria of space deployment of production and trade activities represents an important, theoretically-affirmed framework within the contemporary economics literature, as well as the subject of careful research in similar scientific disciplines. Location selection also represents one of the most important, practical business decisions, especially in logistics management.That is precisely the starting point for carrying out the analysis within this paper, by which an intention is expressed to determine what are the most important logistics factors of object location selection with one specific participant of the supply chain, i.e. retail. The entire paper is divided into three parts. Within the first part, a short literature review is given concerning the key analysis dealing with location theory. The second part of the paper is dedicated to the analysis of location selection factors of retail objects with the focus on logistics aspects. Finally, within the last, third part, an analysis is performed of the factor usage of location selection on the precise example of Belgrade retailers. The aim of the paper is to check out to what extent are the theoretically recognized logistics factors of location selection present in the practical positioning of retail objects within the Serbian capital, as well as to determine to what extent there is space for potential improvements in this segment of business, by analysing a precise example from practice.
M20|The Implications Of Ownership Concentration Forshareholder Protection And Strategic Decision-Making|The purpose of corporate governance mechanisms is to prevent opportunistic behaviour by managers, in order to align the interests of owners and managers. Following from this, our research topic is the analysis of ownership concentration as an internal mechanism to protect the interests of shareholders. In the study of the interdependence between ownership concentration and shareholder protection, particular importance needs to be given to the relationship between ownership structure, the role of the board, and strategic decision-making. Starting from this interdependence, our research aim is to examine the impact of ownership concentration on the protection of shareholders’ interests and the board’s responsibility for firm strategy. This paper presents the results of an empirical, pilot study in the Republic of Serbia. The research confirms the interdependence of corporate governance mechanisms and strategic decision-making. Our findings indicate that ownership concentration protects majority shareholder interests and leads to lower board responsibility for strategic decision-making.
M20|The Diffusion of Knowledge via Managers' Mobility|Better managers and managerial practices lead to better firm performance. Yet, little is known about what happens when managers move across firms. Does a firm hiring a good manager improve its performance? If yes is there some valuable knowledge the manager has acquired and successfully diffused to the new firm? In order to answer these questions we use information related to specific activities the manager was involved in when working for previous firms. More specifically, we use information on whether the manager has worked in the past for firms exporting to a specific destination country or a specific product. Our data is rich enough to allow controlling for both manager and firm unobservables and wash out any time-invariant ability of the manager as well as overall firm performance. We find that the export experience gained by managers in previous firms leads their current firm towards higher export performance, and commands a sizable wage premium for the manager. We use several strategies to deal with endogeneity including an exogenous event study: the sudden end of the Angolan civil war in 2002. We further refine our analysis by looking at different types of managers (general, production, financial and sales) and show how specific export experience interacts with the degree of product differentiation and/or the financial vulnerability of a firm's products as well as with rising import competition from China.

M20|Factor market rivalry and interindustry competitive dynamics|We study competitive dynamics by using 10 years of data from the biotech industry on patent infringement lawsuits because they capture offensive actions and defensive responses. Results suggest that larger patent portfolios, long‐term partnerships, and short‐term agreements lead to factor market rivalry. Specifically, long‐term research partnerships are associated with lower proclivity and vulnerability to attack, while short‐term licensing and marketing agreements with increased proclivity and vulnerability to attack. Lastly, although nonbiotech companies attack biotech firms, the proclivity of the latter to launch cross‐industry attacks is not significant. We discuss how the results contribute to competitive dynamics research and theory.
M20|A Probabilistic Approach To Setting Weights In A Weighted-Average Product Evaluation|This paper presents a procedure that estimates how markets perceive a product. A weighted-average approach is used as a model for the product perception. Since this approach requires weights to be assigned to product features, and the weights are unknown and vary among customers, the procedure focuses on estimating expected weights of the entire market – such weights are representative weights. The estimation is performed by constructing a confidence interval for the weights. Further, a more accurate location of the weights in the interval is proposed, the accuracy being based on additional information regarding inferior products. This information suggests that if a product is inferior, its value must be low. Therefore, the weights from the interval which minimize the value of an inferior product are suggested, the minimization serving as an approximation of what low value means. Since a minimization is involved, its existence and uniqueness is discussed.

M20|Effects of perceived product quality and Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability (LOHAS) on consumer price preferences for children's furniture in China|The effects of perceived product quality and orientation toward Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability (LOHAS) on consumer price preferences were studied with the use of survey data of the children's furniture market in two metropolitan cities of China: Shanghai and Shenzhen. Based on the results from a factor analysis and logistic regression, consumers’ perceived product quality of children's furniture was identified as a four-dimensional construct: ‘supplier attributes’, ‘extended product attributes’, ‘basic product attributes’ and ‘environmental quality attributes’. Consumer price preferences were discovered to be negatively influenced by ‘basic product attributes’, but positively influenced by consumer orientation towards LOHAS, gender and education level. In conclusion, China's children's furniture market presents a high-end niche segment with growth potential for both furniture producers and wood material suppliers.

M20|Development of Economic Analysis as a Science in Ukraine: Retrospective and Challenges|The article is devoted to a retrospective study of the development of economic analysis as applied science in Ukraine. The aim of the study is to identify the problems of the development of economic analysis in Ukraine caused by the historical aspects of the formation of economic science, and justification of recommendations for dealing with them. Implemented the periodization of the development of economic analysis, revealed the preconditions of its origin in the Russian Empire. Defined the main shortcomings of the existing courses 'Theory of Economic Analysis' and 'Economic Analysis', taught for students of accounting disciplines in higher education. It was found that increasing the role of the financial component of the enterprise activity and the communicative function of public financial reporting as the main source of information base for the interested entities in making effective management decisions determines the feasibility of replacing in the curriculums of domestic institutions of higher education of these courses with the course 'Financial Analysis'. A promising direction in the development of analytical science is the development of methodological tools for the analysis of integrated enterprise reports containing both financial and non-financial information.
M20|Purchase Decision In Neighborhood Stores And Supermarkets: Evidence Of Consumers By Socioeconomic Strata In Cali - Colombia, Decision De Compra En Tiendas Y Supermercados: Evidencias De Consumidores Por Estratos En Cali - Colombia|Place is a variable on which marketing is planned. Place refers to formal and informal distribution channels. In Colombia, the informal distribution channel, represented by neighborhood stores, is still in force for the purchase of goods for home consumption. These stores have survived despite the growth and expansion of large supermarket chains. This research focused on identifying the factors that influence the decision to buy at the neighborhood store or supermarket. The study was conducted n the city of Cali- Colombia, under a mixed approach including qualitative and quantitative elements. The results allowed us to identify the following relevant variables that motivate consumers to buy in neighborhood stores. Proximity, short presentations of products and the purchase option per unit. The variables for purchase in supermarkets were promotions, product variety and the option for getting everything in one place. The cultural component is highly relevant to the decision to purchase in the neighborhood stores. Consumers have different motivations for shopping at both places, and these support the reasons why both channels coexist in the market of goods

M20|Analysis Of Effects Of Regional Distribution Of Msmes In The State Of Guanajuato, Mexico, Analisis De Efectos De La Distribucion Regional De Las Mipymes En El Estado De Guanajuato|This research is based on analyzing specific characteristics of the spatial distribution of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMES). We examine the region where they are located and how this affects the economic growth at the regional level in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico. The methodology utilizes empirical analysis, through a survey of 396 MSMES randomly distributed in the regions of the State of Guanajuato, during the period of 2015. The results point towards large differences with regard to geographical aspects, population, economic and financial services among the regions were the MSMES are distributed. The central region, which concentrates two-thirds of the population and 70 per cent of economic activity in the State of Guanajuato, presents the best geographical conditions. It has flat areas and an efficient network of road infrastructure. Conversely, regions of the north and south of the State present great geographical contrasts, with small populations (less than 30% in both), limitations in their infrastructure and lower economic growth. The above differences are attributed to population and economic characteristics and the availability of regional financial institutions. We identify how these regional causes can affect the growth and continuity of MSMES in the State of Guanajuato

The paper highlights the role of the register in the area of business statistics, focusing on its potentials in terms of integrability with other sources for complex economic analyses.
M20|Importing, Productivity and Absorptive Capacity in Sub-Saharan African Manufacturing and Services Firms|This paper examines the relationship between importing and firm-level productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using a recent firm-level survey for 19 Sub-Saharan African countries, the paper shows that there is a positive and significant relationship between importing and productivity for both manufacturing and services firms. Using a series of robustness tests, the paper finds that the importer-productivity relationship is robust in the case of manufacturing firms, but the results for services appear sensitive to the presence of extreme values. Finally, the paper shows that manufacturing firms with the highest levels of human capital show the strongest relationship between importing and productivity, a result consistent with a role for absorptive capacity in maximising the benefits of importing.

M20|Corporate takeovers in the US oil and gas sector|We examine corporate takeovers in the U.S. oil and gas sector from 1990 to 2008. We test the hypotheses that energy prices and reserves influence takeovers in the energy market for corporate control. We employ these methods: 1. capital asset pricing model, 2. regression analysis, and 3. Granger causality test. Our results show that oil reserves cause takeover deals and affect the value of the merger. High oil prices propel management to acquire oil firms as well as affect the target value. However, the reverse cause-effect mechanism occurs for natural gas prices. That is, takeover activity causes gas prices to decrease. Acquirers are motivated to purchase reserves; whereas, targets are disposed to sell based on energy prices. Hence, our findings imply that countries can consider policies, which address the motivations of the oil and gas industries to facilitate well-functioning takeover markets.
M20|A cross-sectoral analysis of climate change risk drivers based on companies’ responses to the CDP’s climate change information request|Companies are increasingly concerned with current and future climate change risks that have the potential to generate a substantial change in their business operations, revenue and/or expenditure. Therefore, the paper focusses on the companies’ perspective and aims to create a higher awareness of companies’ risk drivers when it comes to specific challenges of different sectors as well as each company within its sector. Based on companies’ responses to the CDP’s climate change information request 2013, including 125 companies from Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the paper presents a detailed companies´ perspective on climate-related risk-drivers, comprising i) changes in regulation, ii) changes in physical climate parameters and iii) changes in other climate-related developments. Hence, the paper provides insights into climate change and adaptation related risks for companies. Furthermore, the results also facilitate a comparison of risk drivers between and within sectors. This also enables companies to i) position themselves regarding the potential threat they might be facing now and in the future, ii) assess their competitive advantages and disadvantages as well as prioritize risk drivers they have to deal with by evaluating their own position within the sector-specific analysis. Regarding specific threats companies are facing, they furthermore have the possibility to take good practices and innovative ideas from companies out of different sectors into consideration, aiming for an efficient and effective adaptation to climate change. Thus, the study’s findings can also serve as an innovative starting point for further research as well as the practical implementation of adaptation measures.

M20|Do microfinance lenders easily reach an optimal welfare?|Market segmentation characterized by price heterogeneity appears as a failure of classical view of market equilibrium. We suppose that an existence of specific asset pricing determines the wealth level of lenders. In microfinance, we look at the linkages between the welfare of lenders and market segmentation degree. For that, we used a maximization program where a lender utility function is defined. One of the results is that high number of lenders determines their portfolio diversification capacity. In a context of price inelasticity and price discrimination of financial demand for microfinance products, the microfinance market appears as highly segmented but not highly efficient if we consider lenders’ returns. Moreover, an increase of average yield and average amount of initial loans positively improve the utility level of lenders. So, the improvement of microfinance lenders welfare is probable, but highly constrained by the behavior of some important financial factors.

M20|Small Business and Liquidity Constraint|This essay will adapt the life-cycle theory of saving to the case of a small business proprietor who can invest his saving either in his own business or in financial securities, and may face a constraint on borrowing because of the limited liquidity of the business assets. This exercise does not seem to have been done before. For simplicity, certainty is assumed throughout. Thus risk and risk aversion play no explicit part, though it is assumed that there may be a margin between the rate at which the businessperson can borrow and the rate of return that she can obtain on financial capital and that there may be capital rationing by lenders. These elements may be consequences of risk in a more complex model that does allow uncertainty, but those considerations are beyond the scope of this essay, which aims only to extend the life cycle hypothesis to allow for investment in business capital and for a lending margin and capital rationing. The first section introduces liquidity constraint, with some very selective examples from the longstanding literature on the topic; the second presents a formal model, and the third gives a diagrammatic exposition of the model. These sections focus on the application to a small business. A following section discusses application to consumers in general. A brief summary and conclusions follow.

The way we communicate with those around us in the professional activity, but not only, place their mark on the results. Quality of management communication influences the way how the human resource is used and the organizational performance, in particular. Each individual has a certain style of communication formed by education, skills, beliefs and personal goals. It does not always ensure the effective and efficient communication. It can be appreciated the necessity for managers to watch the subordinates, but also to themselves, the change of attitude towards ""science communication"" by realizing the positive and negative effects of their own style of communication and by raising awareness of the necessity to acquire some communication skills"
M20|Empirical Study Regarding the Trust Relationships Established in a Community|The paper that we present aims to address the issue of relationships naturally established in a community through some items that we consider relevant to the proposed topic. In this purpose, we have initiated a quantitative research, developed through a survey, based on questionnaire, self-managed and on line. The recorded answers are statistically interpreted, using IBM SPSS application. The results suggests that the perception of the subjects participating in the study on the relationships established with their communities, on the date of the study, is not clearly contoured.
M20|Global Indicators Analysis and Consultancy Experience Insights into Correlation between Entrepreneurial Activities and Business Environment|Many researches and practical experiences clearly indicate the existence of a strong relationship between entrepreneurial activities and the business environment in which these activities are initiated. Although this topic has been quite ignored until the late twentieth century, a lot of studies and consulting practice have contributed to the fact that there are now a number of theories concerning mentioned correlation. These theories aim to offer a model that would provide better utilization of the possibilities from the business environment which could be very important for the development from both macroeconomic and microeconomic aspects. An increasing number of articles on this topic says enough about its importance, and numerous researches by many reputable globally recognized institutions go in favor of this claim. There are many indicators that observe the economic situation in a country or a region from different aspects, so the analyses of these indicators make it possible to determine the specific relationships between entrepreneurial activities and the local and the global business environment. Given the complexity of these relations, the impact cannot be observed partially, without taking into consideration other important factors, but more detailed analyses, however, result in some useful conclusions, which in the proper context can have a positive impact on many economic factors. It is very important to emphasize the fact that the correlation between the business environment and entrepreneurial activities is bidirectional, since this influence is mutual, so that changes in one of these factors can and usually cause some modifications in the other. Frequent series of such iterations actually lead to changes in the business environment, while entrepreneurial activity changes its shape and affects the economy of a country or a region, which is of particular importance for its competitiveness in the era of globalization.
M20|Approach Regarding a Framework for Risk Reporting in Order to Enhance the Related Good Practices|The nowadays accounting information user profile became more sophisticated and the financial reports face new challenges in accomplishing process to meet users’ needs. The purpose of financial reports is to provide useful information to users. According to International Accounting Standards Board, the utility of information is defined through the qualitative characteristics (fundamental and enhancing). The financial crisis emphasized the limits of financial reporting who has been unable to prevent investors about the risks they were facing. Some managers expressed reservations about the quality and relevance of corporate reporting, stating that the annual report is no longer a useful tool. Due to the current changes in business environment, managers have been highly motivated to rethink and improve the risk governance philosophy, processes and methodologies. The lack of quality, timely data and adequate systems to capture, report and measure the right information across the organization is a fundamental challenge to implementing and sustaining all aspects of effective risk management. Starting from 80s, the investors became more interested in narratives (Notes to financial statements), than in primary reports (financial position and performance). Our research suggests a framework for risk reporting with the main goal of improving the good practice in risk management field. Also, we will debate the relation between the qualitative characteristics of accounting information, transparency and risk, and explore the possibility of developing some good practices in risk reporting.
M20|Composite Evaluation of Customer Satisfaction|The aim of our paper is to identify attributes and elements of customer satisfaction that individually and collectively influence seniors´ evaluation of and satisfaction with retail stores and the consequent contribution towards repeat purchase behavior. Customer satisfaction per se refers to a whole set of particular attributes. We argue that any single attribute of customer satisfaction (for example low prices), does not necessarily ensure satisfaction with the store. From marketing point of view, customer satisfaction indicates consistently doing something valueable for customers in the way meeting their expectations. This could influence consumer´s attitudes during their subsequent decisions and enhance repeat purchase behaviour and positive word-of-mouth communication. In our research contribution of 21 individual attributes towards overall shopping satisfaction in seniors´ segment was analysed based on the empirical research in seniors´ population. All 21 attributes have been assigned to 6 broader marketing mix elements. To explain the complexity in satisfaction judgments and to arrive at limited number of explanatory variables, factor analysis was applied to the empirical data. Factor analysis identified three complex factors of customer satisfaction that are significant in seniors´ satisfaction with the chosen store. They are: convenience of shopping, value for money and store image and they collectivelly indicate the inter-relatedness of individual satisfaction attributes and explain the composite character and complexity of the term „satisfaction“. The findings confirm that participants tend to compromise among individual attributes in favour of an „overall shopping experience“, which reinforces the belief that seniors´ rating of individual satisfaction attributes should be considered less important than that of a collective rating of satisfaction factors in judgment of shopping satisfaction. The research in this paper was conducted within the Research project VEGA 1/0224/15.
M20|Studies Profitability Of Restaurants|Fast foods are internationally expanding at an amazing pace. Because fast-food products are delicious, abundant, relatively cheap and available in any moment of the day, this type of restaurants are found almost everywhere, and in addition, these have home delivery options, are appreciated and consumed by all age categories, so that fast-food has become a worldwide appreciated phenomenon. In support of the previous mentions, we shall emphasize an economic analysis performed for the Burger King Plaza Restaurant during 2010-2011. The results of the analysis may be appreciated as for being satisfying, although there is a need for improvement if this unit is to cope to the current and future conditions.
M20|The Impact Of Change In The Romanian Organizations|Organizational change requires a continuous effort from both managers and employees as the outside environment is more and more unstable requiring a prompt response and flexibility. Change identification should be on manager's every day agenda because without an organizational culture that supports and embraces change, organizations will not be able to face the fierce competition.This paper aims to analyze the impact of change programs in the Romanian organizations and the forces that drive change in order to highlight the general attitude that managers have on this complex process. The study was made on several Romanian SMEs, mainly from the western side of the country, operating in different industries such as trade, services, manufacture and public services.
M20|Profitability Analysis Tourist Hostels|"This study aims for a comparative analysis on the economic efficiency of the Confort Penssion located in a rural area and the Danacris Penssion from the urban area. The reason for choosing these two units is that the types of tourism they represent are significant areas of operation, namely leisure tourism (""Confort "" Penssion) from Suceava area and business tourism (""Danacris"" Penssion) from Bucharest. Based on the existing methodology in the specialized literature we computed specific indicators in order to highlight economic efficiency.Based on the analysis of the main financial standing indicators and the evolution of income and expenditure one may conclude that both companies are profitable."
M20|Czech Accounting Academia and Practice: Historical Roots and Current Issues|The purpose of this article is to investigate the development of Czech accounting research and education and their links to current practice. The paper uses the autoethnography method and deals with some of the main issues arising in current university research management practices. To this aim we apply our own experience and combine personal perspectives and existing literature (research papers on historical and contemporary academic environment and the current debates regarding management of academic research). The underlying premise of the analysis is that the actual status of accounting academics and accounting education in the Czech Republic is rooted in its past and is closely linked to practice. Characteristics of educational institutions involved in the process of accounting research and education are provided in the main body of the article. The paper also delves into current relations amongst academia, practice and training institutions. The article addresses the quality of Czech accounting research and financial support of universities and it ends with an analysis of current academic and research topics. We finally characterize major shortcomings of the Czech academic accounting research community which seems to be one of the results of changes in the management system of higher education and research. However, it must be stressed in this respect that most current published Czech accounting research reflects the needs of accounting practice rather than academic research as traditionally understood in western countries.
M20|Timely Loss Recognition and the Value Relevance of the Romanian Listed Companies Considering the IFRS Approach|The Romanian listed entities had to report their individual financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) from 2012. As at international level the adoption of the new regulation created mixed effects, we investigate how the timely loss recognition and the value relevance changed in Romania after their implementation. The present research looks both at timely loss recognition and at value relevance for Romanian entities that are listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange. The research is conducted on a four year period of time. The research is based on logit and panel data analysis. The results provide evidence that there seems to be more timely loss recognition and more value relevance for Romanian listed entities after the adoption of the IFRS in the individual financial statements. As a consequence, there is more accurate accounting information on the Romanian market which might trigger higher confidence both for the stakeholders of the company and for the foreign investors.
M20|Economic And Social Importance Of Tourism|Tourism is a sector with a significant share in the economies of many countries. There are nations whose GDP consists of 40% of the total contribution of tourism to this indicator. One such segment requires permanent research of its economic, social and sustainability dimensions and their importance. This study outlines an overview of the main aspects related to economic and social importance of tourism and how tourism relates to the concept of sustainable development. The total contribution and the direct contribution of tourism to GDP are elements studied within this research. It is also studied the direct contribution of tourism to employment, and the main positive and negative effects of tourism on social life.

M20|Small Businesses in the Context of Innovation Competition|The article presents the results of the analysis and systematization of publications on the competitive behavior of small businesses in the innovation economy. It is shown that the adoption of innovation activity in small firms is an effective way of mass replication of innovations and is connected with the non-linearity of the innovation process, the need for the accumulation and constant search for new knowledge and the successful adaptation to a changing business environment. In accordance with the presented in the article approach to the analysis of the competitive behavior of a small firm there were highlighted the motives (reasons) incorporating different forms of imitations in its innovation activity, individual objects of imitation, the range of factors affecting the success of the business. Suggestions put forward in this article are the basis of the author’s model of the impact made by innovative solutions on the performance of small businesses using imitations of varying degrees of creativity.
M20|Knowledge Management: The Way to Organizational Competitive Advantage|The paper explains the crucial knowledge management (KM) processes which are rapidly growing in importance in the present day globalized knowledge based economy. A firm’s intellectual capital is thus increasingly seen today as possessing the potential to become the primary wealth creator in many business organizations. The researchers, therefore, stick to the description of the primary activities of learning, creativity and performance, which are inherent in the holistic frame of modern KM systems, and which sequentially follow each other as typical knowledge processes evolve in a knowledge centric organization.
M20|The Necessity Of Eliminating Classical Concepts And Introduction Of New Concepts Into Strategic Management And Business|The fact is that even today in the management of developed countries they apply the concept of strategy defined in the eighties by Michelle Porter. This concept is based on both classic and mechanistic basis, i.e. determinism and the organization chart that was effective in terms of small changes and a high degree of certainty in management decisions. Therefore, the fact that Porter's concept of strategy had not changed for more than three decades and is as such still applied and analyzed at high business schools in the West is reason enough for this concept to deteriorate leading to the final outcome - death . With evident turbulent and radical changes, Porter's concept of strategy is inefficient and it must be replaced with new approaches and concepts based on biologistical-medical grounds, which are natural, and hence more objective to formulate quality strategy and strategic decisions. It turns out that it is necessary to redefine the postulates of classic strategies and set a new basis, i.e. new strategy for the development and implementation of strategies, and the introduction of new, primarily adaptive, flexible, and strategies shaping the environment, which are relatively unknown today, or neglected. This paper aims to highlight the necessity of abandoning the classic strategy in strategic management and the necessity of introducing those concepts that take into account volatility and the high level of uncertainty that exists today and will in the future be even greater.
M20|Business Process Improvement Application Of Modern Management Techniques|Today, globally operating business world is exposed to constant change processes. Reengineering is the driving force that helps companies, business and manufacturing organizations to achieve success in the new millennium that is full of challenges, risks, information explosion, Internet communications, teleconferencing and global competition. Therefore, effective business strategy, well-trained management personnel, financial - tech resources (IT), management skills and the skills and flexibility (responsiveness) are essential for success in business. Market conditions will be created by people who will decide on the changes, plans and projects, organizational culture, new challenges to create value that can be sold (goods and services) and how to define where consumers expect to buy. In this paper, attention is concentrated on the three most important methods and techniques for strategic business changes, observed through the application re-engineering, including self-assessment, teamwork and benchmarking.
M20|Are Housing Markets Decoupled? A Case Study of Residential Real Estate Affordability in Austria|Real estate arguably forms the most important asset to most households and the basis for their wealth. Around this context a model has been set up testing the relative affordability of real estate for the median household in Austria and the consequences of lower borrowing costs between 2004 and 2013 by vintage year. In this paper the hypothesis that the significant decline in base interest rates is not sufficient to offset the relative affordability loss caused by declining net household incomes and the simultaneous increase of real estate prices. To test this hypothesis a model has been set up comparing two different Housing Affordability Indices – one including and one excluding financing effects, having been compared via a multi factor model. Based on this calculation the author finds decreased base interest rates to offset relative affordability losses by only approximately 50%, verifying the hypothesis. The paper therefore argues for a potential decoupling of the residential housing market in Austria.
M20|"Credit reporting e intermediazione creditizia: scelte di ""make or buy"" tra relationship e transaction banking"|Il presente lavoro prende in esame, con una prospettiva di analisi economico-aziendale, il ruolo del mercato del credit reporting nell’esercizio della funzione creditizia delle banche, nonché il vario articolarsi delle scelte di make-or-buy informativo nella catena del valore dell’intermediazione creditizia, tra approcci di relazione di clientela di tipo relationship banking e transaction banking.

M20|The Potential Of The Leader To Perform|Based on the finding that most research focused on the evaluation of the leader’s performance through results and by identifying the fundamental traits that a leader has, we aim through this paper to make an assessment of the leader from the perspective of the his capabilities. By using this approach we consider that we can appreciate the capacity to perform the potential data. We are studying the following potential components of the leader: the emotional potential - self-knowledge, self-control, relationship management, social awareness; thesocial potential - sense of situation, attitude, clarity, empathy, authenticity; the cognitive potential - logical reasoning, symbolic reasoning, concentration, memory; the practical potential - four mega-skiluri, four habits (skills, abilities) key; the spiritual potential - the ability to understand the truth of the situation, assess the truth of the situation, the ability to act according to the truth of the situation. The method of assessment used is based on a questionnaire research. We created a questionnaire with 25 questions, which was addressed to the top management of 20 companies. The questionnaire was given to a number of 200 subjects. The purpose of the research was to assess the capacity of the leaders to perform, the potential data and how it correlates with the performance of companies in which leaders operate. The study concludes that performances of companies are positively correlated with the capabilities of leaders but not exclusively. Potential generally understood as a synthesis of personality traits and capabilities developed, in our opinion, is the fundamental criterion in the selection and assessment of performance leader.
M20|Key Factors of Online Customer Satisfaction|The development of e-business and intensified competition in online environment made e-marketing activities and especially customer satisfaction an important part of these businesses. Previous research took the online customer satisfaction from marketing or from technical perspective. Although these approaches helped improve our understanding, a framework to integrate them is missing from the current literature. In this study, the customer satisfaction is taken into account using an integrative view of these multiple perspectives. A survey is conducted with 1312 customers of 5 online stores. Marketing and technical constructs were incorporated into a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to understand the effect of each variable on customer satisfaction. The analysis results show that although these constructs do have a significant influence on customer satisfaction, not all the variables of each construct have the same effect. Thus it is important to take an integrative approach and improve key marketing and technical factors.

M20|Reactions to corporate insider’s transactions: Do legal stock market disclosure rules have an impact?|We test the impact on security prices of top manager’s requirement’s to disclose their own share transactions in the firm. Specifically we study whether buy or sales transactions convey relevant information for market participants thereby studying the effects of legal stock market disclosure rules. Based on a comprehensive collection of stock market announcements from Danish CEOs and chairmen we find that insiders’ transactions influence share prices. However, it appears that there is a surprisingly difference, as buy transactions by chairmen have a much higher impact compared to CEO transactions, which to our knowledge have not been noticed already by others. Thus, our event study shows that the Danish stock market seems to be efficient in the semi-strong from. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
M20|Productivity growth persistence: firm strategies, size and system properties|This chapter analyses the dynamics of path dependence, exploring the determinants of the persistence of firm productivity, here measured by total factor productivity (TFP). It highlights the crucial role of the interplay between the internal characteristics of companies, including their size and management strategies, and system properties such as access conditions to local pools of knowledge and the dynamics of economic activity in assessing the dynamics. Analysis of transition probability matrices (TPMs) and econometric analysis provide substantial evidence of the relevance of the mix of individual and systemic factors in shaping persistence as a path-dependent process in which events that take place along the process affect its direction and the pace of productivity dynamics.
M20|Productivity growth persistence: firm strategies, size and system properties|This paper investigates the dynamics of productivity in a large sample of Italian manufacturing firms, focusing on the determinants of firm-level persistence in time of high total factor productivity (TFP) growth rates relative to the corresponding sectoral distributions. In particular, we assess the impact of both the internal characteristics of companies, including size and management strategies, and external systemic conditions, including business cycles and regional innovation performance. In order to disentangle the effects of the mix of internal and systemic factors in shaping firm-level persistence, we implement both transition probability matrices and dynamic probit models. Results reveal the presence of significant persistence in TFP growth rates. Such persistence turns out to be path-dependent since it is shaped by a number of complementary and contingent factors that locally affect the dynamics of the process.

Since the state is still passing through the period of transition, many changes have occurred on the principles of the accounting system.The methodology used while making this research is the semi-structured interviewing. By this method the literature of Kosovo was reviewed and the results and findings are based on consultations with business firms, professionals at the field of accounting and also books related to accounting development.The final results obtained through this research clarify the situation of development of the accounting system in Kosovo and it explains that there is a huge difference between the previous and current accounting performance which is highly noticeable and that the present status is satisfactory.
M20|Geographical Factors in Determining IFDI Policy|With the initiative of the West China Development policy, the flow of Inward Foreign Direct Investment (IFDI) gradually increased in western China. This paper investigates and tests the determinants of IFDI for western China’s11 provincesduring2002 – 2008. By compiling a pool data set and employing General Least Squares (GLS) with fixed effects model in natural logarithmic form, we explorethe IFDI in western China thoroughly. The proposed model illustrates reliable estimates of determinants of IFDI for the region. The market size, laborcosts, education level, imports and highway length are found to have a significant relationship with IFDI in western China, hence, they may be considered as determinants. On the other hand, research and development (R&D), length of railways, and postal and telecommunication services have a statistically insignificant effect on IFDI.
M20|The Effect of Enterprise Strategies Employed During the Crisis on the Growth Options of Companies|The recent worldwide economic crisis had drastic consequences for the economies of nations around the globe. As we are at the end of the crisis period, the really interesting strategic question is: what will happen after the crisis. We have some, but only limited, research evidence to answer this question properly. Scholars try to obtain answers by studying the consequences of the previous crisis periods. However, the recent crisis was unique in its expansion and rather accelerated spread all over the world.The present paper attempts to analyze this issue from a company-level point of view. We are interested in learning what has happened during the crisis, and what the reactions of companies were to the emerging new economic, technological and social conditions. The author has conducted empirical studies in Hungary and in the Slovak Republic. The empirical background of the paper includes studies of publications of research groups engaged in doing surveys in the field, as well as primary data collections through questionnaire surveys and interviews conducted in Hungary and in Slovakia.

M20|Business practices in small firms in developing countries|Management has a large effect on the productivity of large firms. But does management matter in micro and small firms, where the majority of the labor force in developing countries works? This study developed 26 questions that measure business practices in marketing, stock-keeping, record-keeping, and financial planning. These questions have been administered in surveys in Bangladesh, Chile, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. This paper shows that variation in business practices explains as much of the variation in outcomes ? sales, profits, and labor productivity and total factor productivity ? in microenterprises as in larger enterprises. Panel data from three countries indicate that better business practices predict higher survival rates and faster sales growth. The effect of business practices is robust to including many measures of the owner?s human capital. The analysis finds that owners with higher human capital, children of entrepreneurs, and firms with employees employ better business practices. Competition has less robust effects.
M20|The Role of Project Office for Project Portfolio Management|The paper focuses on the management of project portfolios as a novel and complex area in the practice of project-oriented organizations. The paper’s main goal is to review the role of project management office /PMO/ for enhancing the performance of organizational project portfolio. It considers several core issues and functions related to the process of implementation of PMO in a particular organization. A case study has been conducted in order to provide evidence about the benefits from the introduction of PMO in a company operating in the media sector. Results from the case study analysis shows that this approach to project management in a multi-project environment is to a large extent universal and can be successfully applied in similar organizational context.
M20|Globalization And The Competitiveness Of The European Textile And Clothing Industry|The aim of the paper is to analyze the competitiveness of the European textile and clothing industry under the influence of globalization and recent economic crisis. The textile and clothing industry is an important part of the European manufacturing industry, playing a vital role in the economy and social welfare in many regions of Europe. The European textile and clothing industry has undergone significant changes in recent decades due to the technological advances, developments in production costs, the emergence major international competitors and the elimination import quotas after 2005. In response to the competitive challenges, this sector of activity has undertaken a lengthy process of restructuring and modernization. Globalization and technological progress have led to rethinking the strategy of the companies in the industry. In a competitive global market, European organizations producing textiles and garments have as main competitive advantage research and continuous innovation. Using methods of qualitative research, this paper analyses the evolution of the main financial indicators concerning this sector of activity in the period 2007 – 2013, including domestic consumption, turnover, number of employees, number of companies, imports and exports. The globalization of markets, international outsourcing and development of the Internet had a major impact on the structure and dynamics of the textile and clothing industry in Europe, and in particular on small and medium enterprises. Also, relocation, subcontracting and outsourcing of large brands in this domain have contributed significantly to the increase of imports from low-cost countries. A growing number of apparel retailers have emerged on the market, organizing supply chains globally. At the same time, producers have transferred part of their activities to low-cost countries in order to maintain market competitiveness. This was determined by the major differences in salaries across the global labour markets and high profits obtained from trade. Based on the results of the analysis undertaken, the paper suggests that in recent years, the competitiveness of the textile and clothing sector fell significantly, causing restructuring and downsizing.
M20|Socially Optimal Service hours with Special Offers|It is very important for service industries to decentralize consumers at peak time, and thereby to increase sales not at peak time. This study discusses an optimal number of business hours for a service industry when the service provider offers a price discount immediately after the opening time and just before the closing time. For a specific ideal service time distri- bution of consumers, the optimal opening and closing time are explored. Clarified are the conditions under which an optimal number of business hours exists to maximize the social welfare. Numerical examples are also presented to illustrate the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed model.
M20|Strategy: Between Misuse and Abuse of the Label and the Concept|The study points out aspects of the use of the term strategy in the present theory of management, with demonstration of undesirable implications arising from inappropriate use. This takes the form of a deterioration of the meaning of the term or its usage is the distorting effect of abusive. Definition of the concept for managerial use emphasizes the inappropriate use of the word. The meaning offered by some authors creates confusion in the definition of other important concepts, due to the illogical and inconsistent links with the original Greek word and concept. Proposed discussion highlights dilemmatic landmarks that could have negative effects on the firm's strategy.
M20|Changes in Conservatism after the Adoption of the IFRS: Evidence from Romania|Starting with 2012, the Romanian entities had to comply with international regulation in reporting their individual financial statements. As a fact, several elements could have been changed, including their level of conservatism. The purpose of this research is to provide evidence about the level of conservatism that the Romanian entities have considering their size, their market to book ratio (MBR) and their level of indebtedness after the adoption of the new regulation. The research is conducted on panel data models, using a four year period of time for estimation. The results show that for MBR and for indebtedness indicator, the entities have higher good news timeliness, while for size and for indebtedness variables they have higher asymmetric timeliness after the adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)

M20|The hidden role of women in family firms|Women have historically played an important hidden role in family firms, and a great deal of research is now shedding light on this role. In spite of the more formal nature of their work in the present day, still a considerable volume of women’s contributions remains invisible to official statistics. This study, based on interviews with over 500 women in small and medium family firms, brings this informal work into view, quantifying it in terms of hours worked and monetary value, exploring the reasons for its informality and examining the risks and precariousness it entails.
M20|Entrepreneurship Failure: Case of Low Productivity in Nigeria|We study the role of entrepreneurs in low productivity in manufacturing firms of Nigeria. Federal Executive Council while adopting the National Policy of Productivity in 2012 emphasized that transformation of Nigeria to become strong economy will never be realized until the nation adopts the culture of productivity, innovation, improvements and proper management of resources. The policy is to guide the public and private sectors in enhancing productivity to stimulate national development. Thus policy framework appreciated role of private sector management in enhancing productivity, the dire need for national development. Enhanced national productivity is at the heart of any economic development and progress.
M20|Policy Design & Delivery: Undermanaged Human Resources as Determinants of India’s High Growth & Low Productivity|India’s series of economic reforms since 1991 have accelerated economic growth but not productivity at same pace. Productivity in manufacturing sector in the last two decades remains stagnant, but nobody sincerely has bothered to measure and improve. There are several ways & means to measure productivity, defined differently by different scholars. It is a fact that even using same data, different methodology will give different numbers of productivity. But whatsoever methodology we use to measure productivity, India’s productivity is quite low compared to USA & other BRIC nations. As per world management survey, 1% increases of management score increases 6% productivity. Comparatively there is not much empirical study in India to understand employee efficiency. And hence there are no concentrated efforts to take remedial measures to make them more effective and efficient using study of health economics, human psychology, education, cognitive & non-cognitive capabilities and its effect on skill formation. India faces challenges of poor governance, corruption, slow decision making process, lack of accountability, low & obsolete management skill. This research aims at investigating reasons of low productivity specifically in the manufacture sector due to human resource management of industry & the government. The industry to some extent look at their own human resources as part of employee performance management, but this research aims to investigate; does the government policy affect productivity? Indian business environment is said to be heavily influenced by various government interfere and red-tapism. A business has to pass through dozens of windows varies in one state to another. The government policies cobweb is cumbersome and puzzle. The government policy is what is inferred by the person who implements it. The policy is implemented through various stages and each stage has its own nuances. It is the people on ground that understands the policy and implement which determine the fate of the policy. The policy is framed at high level after detailed study of the relevant factors and with full knowledge. But on the ground those who are responsible to implement such policy at micro level hardly understand the rationale and have same self-drive to implement the policy. Corruption, lack of accountability, political influence and lack of managerial & leadership skill of the government employees adds hurdle in safe delivery of the policy.

The aim of this paper is to evaluate effects of subsidies from programme ""Development"", which was focused on rising small and medium company competitiveness. Method Benchmark and method Per se were created for this purpose. Analyses confirm that subsidies are drawn by companies with above average rate of competitiveness. On the other hand, competitiveness of these subsidised companies (measured by eight financial indicators) was ostensibly decreasing after drawing the subsidy. The cause for this fact can be found in Czech accounting legislation which creates a dilemma for company managers. Research results show that managers of subsidized companies have probably chosen conservative strategy - the above average EBIT (created thanks to the subsidy) hold in liquid assets and use it for necessary future reinvestment but formally worsen profi tability ratios."
M20|Creating Shared Value: Eine Grundsatzkritik (Creating Shared Value: A Fundamental Critique)|Der Beitrag formuliert eine Grundsatzkritik an Michael Porters und Marc Kramers Konzept des „Creating Shared Value“ (CSV). Fuer diesen Zweck wird in einem ersten Schritt die positive und negative Kritik, die seit 2011 am CSV geaeussert worden ist, zusammengefasst. Im Weiteren zeigen die Autoren, dass CSV hinter das Verstaendnis einer modernen Unternehmensverantwortung zurueckfaellt, die insbesondere in einer angemesseneren Verhaeltnisbestimmung von Unternehmen und Gesellschaft liegen muss. Der Beitrag schliesst mit kritischen Anmerkungen zur Rolle der Wissenschaft in der Interaktion mit der Praxis. (This article offers a fundamental critique of Michael Porter’s and Marc Kramer’s “Creating Shared Value” (CSV) concept. First, the authors summarise the positive and negative criticism which CSV has received since 2011. They then show that CSV falls short of a modern understanding of corporate responsibility which is centred on more adequate ideas about the relationship between business and society. The article concludes with critical comments on the role of scholars in their interaction with practitioners.)

Zur Geschichte der scheinbaren Emanzipation vom neoliberalen Paradigma Milton Friedmans (Understanding CSV: A New Narrative to Reshape Capitalism?)|Der CSV von Porter und Kramer wird in Theorie und Praxis intensiv diskutiert. Am Beispiel der in der Financial Times gefuehrten Diskussion zeigt der Beitrag die sehr unterschiedlichen Auffassungen zum CSV auf. Im zweiten Teil des Beitrags wird der theoretische Kern des CSV auf ein Missverstaendnis der Position von Milton Friedman zurueckgefuehrt. Abschliessend wird der CSV als Narrativ gedeutet, das nicht in der Lage ist, den Kapitalismus zu relegitimieren. (In theory and practice we observe an intensive discussion of the CSV. Based on the contributions regarding the CSV in the Financial Times we summarize different views on the CSV. In the second part of the paper we argue that the theoretical core argument of the CSV is based on a misunderstanding of Milton Friedman. Finally, we describe CSV as a narrative which is not able to relegitimize capitalism.)

Preston entitled “The Corporation and Society: Search for a Paradigm”. The article became an important landmark in the evolution of the young, but rapidly growing, field of business and society. This paper reviews Preston’s effort to articulate the corporation-society paradigm. The author, who served as Preston’s research assistant when the original paper was written and, later, as his coauthor, discusses Preston’s “search for a paradigm”, offers an assessment of where the field stands today, and discusses whether, or where, a new paradigm is likely to emerge.

Soziale Bewegungen und Walmarts Unternehmenspolitik (The (Re-)Construction of Corporate Legitimacy Through Public Legitimacy Conflicts. The Case of Social Movements and Walmart)|Dieser Artikel untersucht an dem Beispiel von Walmart in den USA, wie die oeffentliche Mobilisierung von Legitimitaetswahrnehmungen zu einer Re-Konstruktion von corporate legitimacy und damit zu einem Wandel von Unternehmenspolitik fuehrt. Dazu wird empirisch aufgearbeitet, wie eine Kampagnenkoalition aus sozialen Bewegungen und Gewerkschaften die zentralen Saeulen unternehmerischer Legitimitaet re-definiert und wie das angegriffene Unternehmen darauf reagiert. Im Gegensatz zu der prominenten These, dass in der oeffentlichkeit vor allem moralische Legitimitaet von Bedeutung ist, zeigt die Fallstudie, dass die spezifische Kombination von Legitimitaetsarten fuer die De- bzw. Re-Stabilisierung des Ansehens des Unternehmens ausschlaggebend ist. Legitimitaetstransfer ueber verschiedene Themenbereiche hinweg wird dabei als entscheidender Abwehrmechanismus identifiziert, welcher es dem Unternehmen erlaubt, sehr selektiv auf die externen Forderungen einzugehen. (The social and political acceptance of transnational companies has increasingly become a topic of public debate. This article takes the case of Walmart in the US to show how the mobilization of public legitimacy perceptions leads to a re-construction of corporate legitimacy and consequently to a change in corporate politics. In contrast to the prominent thesis that moral legitimacy has become the major source of legitimacy, this article shows that all types of legitimacy and their specific relationship in particular are relevant in public legitimacy conflicts. Legitimacy transfer across thematic fields is identified as a major defense strategy which enables the company to respond selectively to external demands.)
M20|Impacts of entrepreneurs’ stress and family members on SMEs’ business success in Serbian family-owned firms|This paper focuses on micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in Serbia, with a special emphasis on family-owned businesses. The main goal of this research is to analyze family business owners’ perception of stress caused by high levels of responsibility and flexible working hours, as well as to analyze the influence of family member employees on the success of a company. This research has confirmed that high levels of responsibility and flexible working hours do not represent important factors for giving up on starting a business. Furthermore, owners perceive these two stressors as “positive” stress. The second important result of this study is that a large number of family member employees, and unclear hierarchy between them, can endanger a company’s success in terms of annual income and annual turnover.

It is a fact that an ERP software cannot meet all needed company functionalities of a governmental organization. Thus, organization must choose a flexible ERP system for its requirements.
M20|Role Models' Effect On Students Entrepreneurial Intention|Entrepreneurship is affecting economic growth worldwide. In a time of economical crises the creation of new ventures would be an ideal solution. Understanding entrepreneurship's importance and positive contribution to the economy of a country, it is significant studies to be undertaken in order to boost the development of entrepreneurship. Thus, in focus must be factors that alter students' behavior and their career decision to become entrepreneurs. Many highlight that role model consist to be among the most important factors that alter entrepreneurial intention.This study aims to analyze the family role in the decision of students to follow entrepreneurial career path and the influence it has on the intent of the Albanian youth entrepreneurs. The purpose is to assess the role of the family in determining the preference of students to become entrepreneurs. To observe this relation we have studied the case of 434 Albanian students majored in business across the country. The findings suggest that students who have been exposed to entrepreneurial role of families show high intention to become entrepreneurs compared with those who lack this role model. A positive correlation between students exposed to entrepreneurial model within the family and their entrepreneurial intent exists. As a result many suggestions for the education system and policy makers in Albania are proposed.Suggestions drive the attention to education. They reinforce that education can expose students to entrepreneurial role models. It has a very important impact not only to provide students with the skills and knowledge needed for entrepreneurship but also to create confidence and implement new business models. The challenge of education system is that it can influence entrepreneurial intent to young students. As for in terms of role models where such a model is missing in the family, education can provide it successfully.
M20|Rebuilding Trust In The Aftermath Of A Financial Crisis|The aftermath of the 2007-2009 global financial crises can still be felt, with numerous experiencing significant deteriorations in profitability levels. However, despite the propensity of financial recovery, a deeper rooted problem has emerged: the fact that trust between business and exchange partners has mostly disappeared. Trust has always been instrumental in the development of any relationship, whether it is on country, business or individual level. It is therefore not unexpected to learn that role players are unceasingly in search of new and innovative ways through which trust can be recovered and managed.In order to manage relationships, whether it is business-to-business or business-to consumer relationships, it is important that the antecedents of trust are comprehensively identified and managed. The question arises, however, whether the concept of trust can be universally applied, and whether it varies between industries? For instance, should financial services relationships be managed differently from those in the personal care industry, or even the non-profit industry?The objective of this study is therefore to compare the establishment and management of trust amongst a diverse selection of industries. Ultimately, the study aims to provide practical suggestions on how trust should be managed within each of the industries investigated. Through a comprehensive literature review, five key antecedents of trust were identified: shared values, communication, satisfaction, reputation and competence. The literature review was followed by an empirical study in which 330 respondents were targeted by means of a quantitative research approach. Data were collected regarding respondents? perceptions of the management of trust within three distinct industries, namely the financial services industry, the non-profit industry and the personal care industry. The data were analysed by means of SPSS, where both confirmatory factor analyses and regression analyses were applied. The results of the study were somewhat unexpected. Not only could the generally-assumed and well-established antecedents of trust not be confirmed in the present study, it was also necessary to regroup some of the existing antecedents. This situation resulted in an almost urgency amongst practitioners and academics to rethink their current trust-building strategies. The major contribution of the study lies in the growing realisation that the management of trust should be approached on an industry specific level.
M20|The antecedents of corporate sustainability performance|Climate change and global warming are major challenges for Malaysia as well as for companies. Companies are fronting growing pressure to become greener or more environmentally friendly. Due to pressure from consumers and government, companies need to review their production processes. Consequently, they have to apply the concept of sustainable development in their policies and plans. The objective of this study is to examine three dimensions, mainly, knowledge management, eco-innovation and corporate sustainability performance to support sustainability environment. Creating sustainability environment is one of the main agendas in Malaysia Plan. The study focuses on examining the effect of knowledge management strategy on eco-innovation; the effect of knowledge management strategy on corporate sustainability performance; the effect of eco-innovation on corporate sustainability performance; and the mediating effect of eco-innovation on knowledge management strategy and corporate sustainability performance. Halal pharmaceutical companies were chosen as a sample in the study. Data were collected using survey questions and were analysed using Smart PLS. Results show that strategic KM contributes significantly to eco-innovation but does not contribute significantly to corporate sustainability performance. Eco-innovation significantly affects corporate sustainability performance and it mediates the relationship between strategic knowledge management and corporate sustainability performance. It is suggested that pharmaceutical companies in the study need to enhance the creating, sharing and utilizing of implicit and explicit knowledge in order to enhance companies? corporate sustainability performance.
M20|From demand-pull and technology-push innovations, towards knowledge-based innovation systems. Evidence from Albanian small and medium enterprises|This paper focuses at small and medium enterprises (SMEs) which are facing growing competition. Technological innovation and the increasing role of knowledge exploitation in the enterprise, provide an important source of innovation and competitive advantage. Technological innovation is being perceived to a greater extent as a continuous, collaborative, multi-actor process requiring new collaboration-supporting technologies and focusing on knowledge and social dynamics perspectives. This paper tries to determine if any relationships do exist between measures for adapting technological innovation in SMEs and whether these are caused by a technology-push or demand-pull. It also aims at verifying if activities related to knowledge management in the enterprise lead to planned or incidental innovations. In doing so we get insights on how different activities could affect technological innovation and it contributes to the small business management literature by adding to the body of knowledge on technological innovation adaption and utilization in SMEs. The empirical investigation is carried out in an emerging market nation such as Albania
M20|The Decomposition of the Result of the Business Transformation Process in the Value Terms|The economic result is primary and main financial source for the further development of the enterprise. It is an expression of value of business transformation process. It represents the criterion for deciding on the volume of production, new products, investments, etc. In the interests of stability and the further development of each enterprise we need to pay attention to it not only in terms of level, but also the factors that affect it. On the basis of the above, there was created a process model of decomposition of the economic result. It consists of the knowledge and the analysis of its reference point, defining target value, making variations in order to achieve the target value, the determination of the means to achieve it, establishing the criteria for the selection of variant, selection of the most appropriate variant, implementation of concrete measures, finding the actual condition of the creation of economic result, findings and analyses of the deviations, adoption of measures. The aim of the paper is the generalisation of the results arising from the creation and application of process model of economic result decomposition and drawing conclusions and recommendations. The result is the acquisition of new knowledge making up the essence of the observed value expression of the business transformation process.
M20|Financial Balance ? An Important Objective for the Stakeholders in Romanian?s Energy Sector|The annual financial statements represent the main point of view through which the stakeholders assess an entity?s financial position. An important aspect followed by the stakeholders is the existence of a solid financial position, which is manifested through a financial balance. The present study seeks to analyze the financial position of the Romanian entities that are representative to the energy sector, based on specific indicators of appreciating the financial balance. Within the analysis, indicators such as net situation, working capital, the need of working capital, net treasury and many others were taken into account.Also, within the study we tried to highlight the main differences between the analysis of the financial balance based on the regular balance sheet and its analysis based on the financial balance sheet. Thereby, one of the main objectives of this study is to present the main advantages that the financial balance sheet brings to the analysis of the financial balance and raising the awareness of the stakeholders towards this approach.The results of the study have shown significant differences between the analyzes made on different types of balance sheets. These results could open new research directions, such as more detailed analyzes based on the financial balance sheet, but could also raise the awareness of the stakeholders (except the governments) about the fact that the balance sheet, in its present form (form which is imposed by the law), has some boundaries, and for a meaningful analysis of the financial position (financial balance) it is often necessary to resort to derivative forms of the balance sheet.
M20|Redesign And Improvement Of Support Processes To Improve Business Processes In Crises ? Case Study: Water And Sewerage Split Company|Business process management (BPM) in partially process oriented companies, such as public utility companies and Vodovod i kanalizacija Split are, in crisis, requires from top management the redesign of business processes and primarily of business activities which flow through support processes. Since all the activities and changes in BPM are human based, it is essential to strenghten the support sector. IT management, changes in human resources, increasing the level of power and authority, disciplining activities in financial flow and improvement of controlling. In this key study, activities that have been undertaken for the past three years by top management, have brought up to the improvement of all business performances of the company, especially financial ones. Activities, undertaken by top managemant, have streghten the authority of IT sector, so the processing time of consumers' requests and reports has been reduced by 40%, internal fluctuations of the employees and working efficiency have been increased by 32%, and delegating the authority and power to middle management has been increased, which again brought up to reducing the decision making operational time. More evident public procurement, strenghtening the controlling, better payment conditions and adequate desposition of available fiancial resaurces have improved the efficiency of the company on the whole and financial performances have been improved by 105 %.
M20|Is Advertising for Losers? An Empirical Study from a Value Creation– Value Capturing Perspective|Does advertising lead to higher profits? This question has occupied both academic researchers and company executives for many decades. Arguments have gone in both directions, and evidence is mixed at best. Re-examining the question from a value creation and value capturing perspective as introduced in the strategic management and marketing literature, this article attempts to re-interpret and reconcile the different views and empirically validate the resulting hypotheses. Using a database of the top 500 brands of established companies during the period 2008–2012, we find that advertising spending has no significant impact on profitability, in contrast with brand value and innovation(the latter also positively affects brand value creation). In addition, advertising spending actually weakens the positive effect of innovation on profitability. These findings provide support for the view that advertising in and of itself does not improve profitability. Rather, its effect is positive only when it acts to support customer value creation, based on brand value and/or innovation activities.
M20|Betriebswirtschaftliche Folgen und Bewertung des Mindestlohns in Hotellerie und Gastronomie|On 1 January 2015 a minimum wage of 8.50 euros per working hour was implemented in Germany. The hotel and restaurant industry, as a service-intensive sector, is especially affected. To study the economic impact of the minimum wage, an online survey with 1,512 hoteliers and gastronomers was conducted. The results show that no negative effects on the total number of employees are anticipated, but the participants do expect a changing staff structure. The expected economic impact depends on branch, region and company size. Most entrepreneurs plan to compensate for the extra costs by increasing prices. The participants considered the greatest challenges to be the documentation obligation of the daily working time and the implementation effort–more so than the extra wage costs. In total, the sector holds unfavourable attitudes towards the minimum wage, with hoteliers less negative than gastronomers, and entrepreneurs in the north and west less negative than those in the south and east of Germany.

M20|Editorial: The Cooperative Advantage for Community Development|Empirical evidence has shown that cooperatives are diverse organizations that efficaciously address a plurality of socio-economic needs. Cooperative organizations are effective in provisioning for myriad life needs, and do so in more democratic and sustainable ways than investor-owned firms. Rooted in the unique principles and values that distinguish them from other business types, cooperatives, in a nutshell, embody what has been called “the cooperative advantage”. This special issue of the Journal of Entrepreneurial and Organizational Diversity, “The Cooperative Advantage for Community Development”, was organized to highlight the myriad roles that cooperatives can and do have in protecting and developing communities, as well as the possible tensions and challenges that emerge in the process. Including seven articles from established and upcoming cooperative studies scholars, the special issue critically assesses diverse experiences of co-ops deployed for community development. Via papers engaged in case study approaches, political economy perspectives, critical historical research, and qualitative and quantitative methods, this special issue of JEOD critically reflects on and contributes to understanding the role of cooperatives in grounding bottom-up and locally based community development.
M20|Impact of Information Technology investments on firm productivity in peripherals countries: The case of Portugal|IS/IT investments are seen has having an enormous potential impact on the competitive position of the firm, on its performance, and demand an active and motivated participation of several stakeholder groups. The shortfall of evidence concerning the productivity of IT became known as the ?productivity paradox?. As Robert Solow, the Nobel laureate economist stated ?we see computers everywhere except in the productivity statistics?. An important stream of research conducted all over the world has tried to understand these phenomena, called in the literature as Â«IS business valueÂ» field. However there is a gap in the literature, addressing the Portuguese situation. No empirical work has been done to date in order to understand the impact of Information Technology adoption on the productivity of those firms. Using data from two surveys conducted by the Portuguese National Institute of Statistics (INE), Inquiry to the use of IT by Portuguese companies (IUTIC) and the Inquiry Harmonized to (Portuguese) companies (accounting data), this study relates (using regression analysis) the amounts spent on IT with the financial performance indicator Returns on Equity, as a proxy of firm productivity, of Portuguese companies with more than 250 employees. The aim of this paper is to shed light on the Portuguese situation concerning the impact of IS/IT on the productivity of Portuguese top companies. Empirically, we test the impact of IIT expenditure on firm productivity of a sample of Portuguese large companies. Our results, based on firm-level data on Information Technology expenditure and firm productivity as measured by return on equity (1186 observations) for the years of 2003 and 2004, exhibit a negative impact of IT expenditure on firm productivity, in line with ?productivity paradox? claimants.
M20|Costs of trade and self-selection into exporting and importing: The case of Turkish manufacturing firms|This paper focuses on self-selection into trade by exporting and importing firms, and on the presence of differential variable and sunk costs between exporters and importers across different categories of imports. The authors use a rich and recent dataset for Turkish manufacturing firms for the period 2003 - 2010. This allows them to provide a comprehensive analysis of firm heterogeneity and the connection between firm-level performance and international trade. They provide evidence on the remarkable heterogeneity across firms where only-importers (importers) perform better than only-exporters (exporters). The authors detect a self-selection effect for both importing and exporting firms with a stronger effect for importers. The results suggest that the nature of sunk costs varies between importing and exporting activities with importers facing higher sunk costs. Tariffs represent a potentially important source of variation in the variable costs of trading. When taking the tariffs faced by firms into account, the authors find that the self-selection effect associated with sunk costs is still present but greatly reduced with a smaller reduction for importers compared to exporters.
M20|A Model for Eliciting Expert Knowledge into Sports-Specific Knowledge Management Systems|Grounded on literature reviews from knowledge management, information system, marketing, organization science and sports management strategy, the paper proposes a way to build sports-specific knowledge management systems based on expert knowledge to improve strategic decision-making. Previous research showed sports teams had complex management systems, decisions needing to be made not only on sports-related knowledge. The hallmark of the study is that it emphasizes laying out the premises of knowledge acquisition, knowledge transfer, and knowledge sharing in sports, in order to discuss a model for helping teams to use wider expert knowledge in their management. Results show that team competitivity is strongly related to employing specialized knowledge.
M20|Influence of Natural Factors upon the Organization Activities|The main objective of this article is to demonstrate the importance of the natural factors on bussiness environment, even for companies that do not have economic activities depending on them. The natural factors are ignored by most business analysis especially in companies whose main activity does not regard exploiting natural resources. But when natural factors are analysed, the so called ecological influences are mistankenly regarded by many specialists as regulations, policies and methods, imposed by government to protect the environment. Instead, we consider that the primary natural factors are: the geographic position, landscape, climate, ecosystem, natural resources and the natural hazard. This paper is addressed to specialists, researchers, managers and all interest readers.
M20|Technology, regulations, business strategy and business performance on indonesian telecommunication industry|Telecommunication industries in indonesia have currently entered a phase which people's awareness of knowledge on the information technology-based products and services increases. some of the phenomena that occur in the industries are : (i) the technology develops rapidly, (ii) the telecommunication regulations are frequently overdue in anticipating the user needs and business requirements, (iii) the income of the executants,signed by the average revenue per user (arpu), tends to decline hence the profit per customer decreases; (iv) the strategy implementation by the company or business unit in these industries are relatively the same. these conditions require the industry players to determine the proper steps in anticipating the current competition. therefore, this research will explore the correlation among the variables of technology , regulation , business strategy , and the business unit performancein order to formulate the correlation among the four variablesthe research is aimed to produce a study concerning the correlation among technology,regulation,business strategyy,and unit business performancein the telecommunication industries in indonesia. the research used descriptive and verification by conducting a survey to 34 samples with the units of analysis covering the business units in the four largest telecommunication operators in Indonesia. data were obtained from the results of observation, questionnaires and interviews, and partial least square (pls) was used for analysis and hypothesis testingthe results of this study show that there is an impactof technology on business unit performance through the regulation and business strategy. the impact of technology may happen through the regulatory and business strategies. at the same time, the impact of technology on both business strategy and business unit performance directly is extremely low, and so is the impact of the regulation on the performance of the business. the impactof regulation on the performance of the business unit will be significant if it is through the business strategy
M20|The use of Social Network Sites for the Employment Seeking Process|Social networks are becoming more and more important in employment seeking process. The importance of social networks in this respect has been researched also in academic research worldwide and discussed on scientific conferences. The aim of the paper is to analyse the experience of the use of social network sites (SNS) with empirical results of 28 interviews with employment seeking individuals to identify the behaviour of employment seeking individuals and to identify further information regarding the employment seeking process in SNSs. In addition is an objective of the paper to falsify the dimensions of Sander / Teh. That the framework of the dimensions can be used to investigate SNSs and to describe the social capital theory of SNSs (Sander & Teh 2014a). The importance of real social networks are presented in many papers but the perspective of the employment seeking individual in SNSs needs further and deeper research.
M20|Intellectual Capital in Enterprises and a Model Study in an Industrial Zone|The study mainly consists of two parts. The first part includes theoretical knowledge; the second part includes application-oriented information. In the theoretical part of the study, intellectual capital and SMEs are emphasized in general. In the application-oriented part of the study, a field research will be done for Corum SME. In this study, the demographic structure of Corum SMEs, intellectual capital structure and financial performance of this structure will be evaluated. The resulting data will be analyzed in this context. The businesses operating in the Organized Industrial Zone of Corum and those matching the definition of SME will be considered within the research scope. Surveys will be applied by interviewers face to face and each survey will be evaluated individually. After the evaluation, a model will be proposed. The aim of our study is to investigate the relationship between components of intellectual capital in SMEs and business performance. For this reason, a survey will be conducted for SMEs. Since the results of the study will be shared with scientific circles and the public, they will prove to be guiding for Corum SMEs.
M20|Importing, exporting and performance in sub-Saharan African manufacturing firms|This paper examines productivity differences between internationally trading and non-trading firms using data on a sample of firms from 19 sub-Saharan African countries. The paper provides the first evidence of whether exporters, importers and two-way traders perform better than non-traders, and whether there are differences in performance between different types of trading firms in sub-Saharan Africa. Our results indicate that exporters, importers and two-way traders perform better than non-exporters, non-importers and non-two-way traders. We further find that two-way traders perform better than importers only or exporters only, results largely consistent with recent results for other countries and regions. Considering information on export starters, continuers and exiters we also present some evidence suggesting that there is no significant difference in performance between export continuers and starters.

M20|What natural capital disclosure for integrated reporting? Designing & modelling an Integrated Financial - Natural Capital Accounting and Reporting Framework|"Business and government leaders from around the world are increasingly sounding the alarm about the need for effective management of business dependencies and impacts on ecosystems. As a consequence, financial institutions have recently made a formal commitment to work towards integrating natural capital considerations into their decision-making processes, including helping improve the accounting and disclosure practices of reporting organisations. Though various frameworks and standards have been developed and implemented to improve extra-financial accountability to stakeholders, current ""sustainability reporting"" falls short in providing the information needed for accurate investment decision-making. The recent releases of Integrated Reporting (IR) guidelines, notably by International Integrated Reporting Committee, have been presented as a significant step in the right direction by professionals and academics. This paper argues that a solid accounting foundation is required for these to be able to effectively incorporate the broader and longer-term social and environmental consequences of corporate decision-making. To support this argument, this paper first provides a brief review of Natural Capital accounting methods and main reporting practices. Based on this analysis, the paper proposes the key principles and methodological foundations for an Integrated Financial - Natural Capital Accounting and Reporting Framework which can be used to fulfil the aspirations of IR guidelines. A theoretical case study involving selected natural capital accounts (GHG emissions, wood consumption, water footprint, habitat loss) illustrates the practical implications of such a framework over three years, by notably explaining: i) the integrated financial - natural capital accounting journal entries, ii) the ensuing Integrated Financial - Natural Capital Statements of Position and Performance; and iii) how to calculate and disclose the natural capital biophysical and externality intensity of financial accounts. In doing so, this Framework provides the concrete foundation for building up a time and space distributed ""catalogue"" of natural capital dependency and impact information aligned with financial information recorded by companies, hence providing the integrated accounting application for other environmental accounting standards and guidelines, such as the forthcoming Natural Capital Protocol. It can hence be used to improve business decision-making, drive sustainable organisational changes and improve natural capital accountability."
M20|Trade Implications of the Trans-Pacific Partnership for ASEAN and Other Asian Countries|The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) aspires to become a state-of-the-art trade agreement linking 12 countries on both sides of the Pacific. In addition to establishing a free trade agreement (FTA) among these countries, negotiators are pursuing a long list of other issues, both trade-related and non-trade related. This paper examines the likely effects of the TPP on trade alone, taking into account the fact that all of the potential members of the TPP are already participants in other FTAs. Using information from the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the existence of these FTAs plus data on the identities of countries’ major trading partners for both exports and imports, I discuss the likely effects on a list of countries in terms of trade creation, trade diversion, preference erosion, and “trade reversion”--the reversal of trade diversion that has already occurred due to existing FTAs. The list of countries includes all of the members of the TPP as well as of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). In addition it includes 10 additional Asian economies that are not part of either. © 2013 Asian Development Bank and Asian Development Bank Institute.
M20|Un análisis del comportamiento cíclico de las cooperativas y sociedades laborales españolas y de su relación con la actividad económica<BR>[Spanish cooperative cyclic behavior and labor companies. What is its relation to economic activity?]|Existe un amplio debate acerca del papel que ha jugado y juega la Economía Social en el proceso de desarrollo y de creación de empleo estable. En dicho debate resulta de interés conocer cuáles son las características que definen las fases cíclicas de las empresas de participación y de su relación con el ciclo económico. El comportamiento cíclico de las empresas de participación respecto al conjunto de la actividad económica marcará sin duda sus efectos sobre el desarrollo y el empleo. El trabajo que presentamos se mueve en esta línea de investigación, el análisis se centra en la economía española y en las dos principales figuras de la Economía Social, las cooperativas y las sociedades laborales. Los principales objetivos que se persiguen son los dos siguientes. En primer lugar, caracterizar las fases cíclicas del número de empresas y del empleo de las cooperativas y de las sociedades laborales y compararlas con las fases cíclicas de la actividad económica española. En segundo lugar, analizar cómo las diferencias/similitudes detectadas en las características de las fases afectan al nivel de sincronización con el ciclo económico. El periodo que entra en el estudio es desde el primer trimestre de 1995 (1995:1) hasta el segundo de 2013 (2013:2). Cabe señalar que un elemento novedoso dentro del análisis propuesto es el hecho de trabajar por separado las cooperativas y las sociedades laborales. La literatura predominante o bien se centra en el análisis global de la Economía Social o bien da mayor protagonismo al ámbito de las cooperativas. Según los resultados obtenidos, las sociedades laborales muestran un comportamiento pro-cíclico importante tanto en cuanto a su creación como a su desaparición, comportamiento que acaba trasladándose, aunque con menor intensidad, a la creación o destrucción de empleo. Por su parte las cooperativas evolucionan de forma bastante desvinculada de la actividad económica. La creación y destrucción de cooperativas y su empleo alcanzan valores relativamente bajos de sincronización con el ciclo económico.
M20|The Direct or Indirect Exporting Decision in Agri‐food Firms| ABSTRACT Selecting an export channel is one of the most important strategic decisions for any exporting agri‐food firm. This paper presents a unified theoretical framework, integrating the two decisions (i.e., the export decision itself and the export channel decision) by jointly examining the effects of 1) intangible resources, 2) product quality, 3) firm size, and 4) international experience on the probabilities of these decisions. Our findings, obtained by analyzing the export behavior of 177 firms in the DOC Rioja (Spain) wine industry, can help policy‐makers understand how they should promote exports and the export channels for agri‐food firms.

M20|Erwerbsbiografische Einflüsse auf das Gründungsverhalten von Frauen|Trotz eines stetigen Anstiegs der Anzahl von selbstständigen Frauen in Deutschland hat sich der sogenannte Gender-Gap kaum verringert. Die vorlie-gende Studie untersucht auf Basis des Nationalen Bildungspanels (NEPS), ob bzw. inwieweit familienbedingte Erwerbsunterbrechungen, die aus theoretischer Sicht mit Humankapitalverlusten einhergehen, die geringere Gründungsneigung von Frauen erklären. Die Ergebnisse der Studie zeigen keinen eindeutigen (negativen) Zusammenhang zwischen familienbedingten Erwerbsunterbrechungen und dem Übergang in die Selbstständigkeit. Besteht bei solchen Erwerbsunterbrechungen keine Beschäftigungsgarantie, erhöhen sie sogar signifikant die Gründungswahrscheinlichkeit.
M20|Why do small Chinese firms list on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange?|Recently, Chinese firms have become more active in attempting to go public on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FWB). This paper uses multivaria te probit analysis to test the motivations of Chinese firms to list on the FWB. In general, Chinese firms are driven by the following motivations. Firstly, they pursue relatively more stringent listing standards and closer monitoring than the Hong Kong Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) and the London Alternative Investment Market (AIM) provide. Secondly, they are motivated by emerging needs for external financing. Moreover, this paper also examines the post-issue performance of Chinese listings on the FWB. It turns out that Chinese firms listed on the FWB show bad operating performance as well as bad stock performance. However, these are no exceptions since many Chinese firms listed on other foreign stock exchanges also underperform the market average.
M20|Spas Performances Benchmarking and Operation Efficiency|This paper aims to benchmark the performance and operational efficiency of spas by using key performance indicators. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method with SBM super-efficiency model has applied to evaluate the operational efficiency of 21 spas which consist of 7 day spas and 14 hotel and resort spas. The result of the study found that spa with the best performance can use existing resources efficiently and encourage therapists to have the best productivity in service. However, the efficient operations of day spas and hotel and resort spas are not statistically significant difference. Cost reduction of spa products is one of the key factors that induce the increase of operational efficiency of spas. Moreover, the results of hypothesis testing found that spa with good performance will also have good operational efficiency. This study suggests that the operators/entrepreneurs should promote the development of service skills of therapists and encourage economy of scale approach in reducing cost of spa products, as well as promote knowledge management in Thailand spa industry to stimulate learning from those who have excellent practices the in industry. These will enhance the competitiveness of Thailand spa industry in the future.

M20|Cyclicity & Chaotics In Post-Crisis Context|The current global crisis has generated in economic and management theory numerousquestions/ dilemmas, because the magnitude of the crisis surprising the entire capitalist world. Juglarcycles, Kuznets cycles and Kondratieff cycles are well known in economic theory but their findingshave been deliberately ignored by policy makers. The current theory discusses about the chaotics ofthe business environment, the instability and highly sinuous evolution of economic life. Regardingthe study of cyclicity in business at the firm level, this subject has been and remains more complex byits very nature. From the perspective of our research, we aim to highlight the relation ofinterdependence between the macroeconomic cycles and business development at the company/firmlevel.

M20|The development of accounting and application of IFRS in the Czech Republic|This paper focuses on development of rules and practices of accounting and on the application of IFRS in the Czech Republic. The article deals with historical background of the Czech accounting and subsequently with particular features of implementation of IFRS after 1989, when the economic transformation to market economy required adjustments in accounting regulation. This part of our research investigates the relationships between local and global standards of accounting, as well as the impact and consequences and perceived benefits of adopting IFRS in accounting practices. In the recent years one can observe some activity to transformation to IFRS in the field of accounting; this however is not systematic or homogenous, as application of local rules is still required in the domain of taxation. Our analysis of development of accounting regulations in the Czech Republic implies that the majority of Czech, companies nowadays have little motivation to switch to international reporting standards especially if there is no further reason for doing so like government requirement, presence of the subject on capital markets or strong business partner - e.g. mother company from abroad the Czech entity to report with the use international format. As to our knowledge, neither the Czech Ministry of Finance nor any other state authority prepares any regulation that would put this international regulation in force unanimously for all public companies.
M20|Levelized Product Cost: Concept and Decision Relevance|This paper examines a life-cycle cost concept that applies to both manufacturing and service industries in which upfront capacity investments are essential. Borrowing from the energy literature, we refer to this cost measure as the levelized product cost (LC). Per unit of output, the levelized cost aggregates a share of the initial capacity expenditure with periodic fixed and variable operating costs. The resulting cost figure exceeds the full cost of a product, as commonly calculated in managerial accounting. Our analysis shows that the LC can be interpreted as the long-run marginal product cost. In particular, this cost measure is shown to be the relevant unit cost that firms should impute for investments in productive capacity.
M20|Nachhaltigkeit in Unternehmen und Organisationen - Umweltmanagementsysteme als Instrument zur ökologischen Prägung der Organisationskultur|Die Neuorientierung in Richtung auf ökologische Nachhaltigkeit stellt die Unternehmen vor große Herausforderungen. Verlangt wird von den Unternehmen, ihr ökonomisches Streben nach Gewinnmaximierung mit ökologischen Zielen zu vereinbaren, was dauerhaft nur gelingt, wenn sie ihre Organisationskultur tiefgreifend verändern. Lisa Knoche, Universität St. Gallen, zeigt am Beispiel des Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), wie Umweltmanagementsysteme bei richtiger Handhabung ein wirkungsvolles Instrument sein können, eine nachhaltig ausgerichtete Organisationskultur in Unternehmen zu etablieren.
