H42|The Post-9/11 GI Bill: Beneficiaries, Choices, and Cost|Beginning August 1, 2009, the Post-9/11 GI Bill extended educational benefits to service members who were on active duty in the military on or after September 11, 2001. Measured in 2018 dollars, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) spent $65 billion on about 1.6 million beneficiaries in the seven years from the lawâ€™s inception through 2016. In 2016 alone, VBA spent $11 billion, an average of $17,400 per beneficiary.
H42|The Urban-Rural Gap in Health Care Infrastructure – Does Government Ideology Matter?|Spatial inequalities in publicly provided goods such as health care facilities have substantial socioeconomic effects. Little is known, however, as to why publicly provided goods diverge among urban and rural regions. We exploit narrow parliamentary majorities in German states between 1950 and 2014 in an RD framework to show that government ideology influences the urban-rural gap in public infrastructure. Leftwing governments relocate hospital beds from rural regions. We propose that leftwing governments do so to gratify their more urban constituencies. In turn, spatial inequalities in hospital infrastructure increase, which seems to influence general and infant mortality.
H42|Dynamic Hospital Competition Under Rationing by Waiting Times|We develop a dynamic model of hospital competition where (i) waiting times increase if demand exceeds supply; (ii) patients differ in their evaluation of health benefits and choose a hospital based on waiting times; and (iii) there are penalties for providers with long waits. We show that, if penalties are linear in waiting times, a more competitive dynamic environment does not affect waiting times. If penalties are instead non-linear, we find that waiting times are longer under the more competitive environment. The latter result is derived by calibrating the model with waiting times and elasticities observed in the English NHS for a common treatment (cataract surgery), which also shows that the difference between waiting times under the two solution concepts is quantitatively small. Policies that facilitate patient choice, an alternative measure of competition, also lead to higher steady-state waiting times, and tougher penalties exacerbate the negative effect of choice policies.
H42|The Congestion Relief Benefit of Public Transit: Evidence from Rome|We estimate the effect of public transport supply on travel times of motor-vehicle and bus users in Rome, Italy. We apply a quasi-experimental methodology exploiting hourly information on public transport service reductions during strikes. We find that a 10 percent reduction in public transit supply increases the travel time of motor-vehicles by about 1.6 percent in the morning peak. The effect on bus travel time is similar. The congestion-relief benefit of public transport is thus sizeable and bus travel time gains account for an important share of it. We also examine the welfare effects of providing bus lanes. All else given, a bus lane reduces bus travel time by at least 29 percent. We find that bus lanes are undersupplied in Rome, despite the potential costs due to reducing capacity available to cars.
H42|Promoting Child Development in a Universal Preschool System: A Field Experiment|This study tests an intervention that introduces a structured curriculum for five-year olds into the universal preschool context of Norway. We conduct a field experiment with 691 five-year-olds in 71 preschools and measure treatment impacts on children’s development in mathematics, language and executive functioning. Compared to business as usual, the nine-month curriculum intervention has effects on child development at post-intervention and the effects persist one year following the end of the treatment. The effects are entirely driven by the preschool centers identified as low-quality at baseline, suggesting that a structured curriculum can reduce inequality in early childhood learning environments.

H42|Private Protection and Public Policing|This paper looks carefully at situations in which public and private protection are complementary, that is, when private protection must be coordinated with public protection to be effective. For example, home alarms deter theft by being connected to a local police station: if the police do not respond to a home alarm, the home alarm on its own is virtually useless in halting a crime in action. We make a distinction between gross and net complementarity and substitution, where the latter takes into account the effect on the crime rate. We show that when public and private protection are complements the optimal provision of public protection trades offs the manipulation effect of encouraging private protection with the compensatory effect of providing protection to households that do not privately invest. We discuss the implications of our results for policy and empirical research in this area.
H42|Hold-up Problems in Contracting Out Waste Collection Services|It is reported previously that, in contracting out waste collection services to pri- vate enterprises, there is generally an inverse relationship between the contracting- out rate and the contract price, but this inverse relationship levels out as the degree of contracting-out increases and the contract price even goes up eventually as the contracting rate approaches 100%. In this paper, we construct a simple bargain- ing model between municipal governments and private rms and identify how the bargaining equilibrium differs from an outcome where municipal governments can make take-it-or-leave-it offers to private enterprises. Through a simple simulation analysis, in addition, we demonstrate that hold-up concerns of local governments can indeed lead to a U-shaped relationship between the contracting-out rate and the contract price across different municipalities.
H42|An Empirical History of the United States Postal Savings System|Seeking to reach the unbanked, the United States Postal Savings System provided a federally insured savings alternative to traditional banks. Using novel datasets on postal deposits, demographic characteristics, and banks, we study how and by whom the System was used. We find the program was initially used by non-farming immigrant populations for short-term saving, then as a safe haven during the Great Depression, and finally as long-term investment for the wealthy during the 1940s. However, even during the earliest period, Postal Savings was only a partial substitute for traditional banks, as locations with banks often still heavily used postal savings.
H42|Time-inconsistent Output Subsidy/Tax Policies in Free-entry Mixed Markets|This study considers time-inconsistent output subsidy/tax policies in free-entry mixed markets under different competition modes. In a committed regime where the subsidy is determined before entry, the optimal rate is zero in either Cournot or Stackelberg game with private leadership, while it is negative in Stackelberg game with public leadership. In a non-committed regime where the subsidy is determined after entry, the optimal rate is always positive. We also show that private leadership is the best for social welfare regardless of the timing of subsidy policies, but public leadership might be equilibrium if the timing of entry decisions is endogenous.
H42|Endogenous Public and Private Leadership with Diverging Social and Private Marginal Costs|We investigate endogenous timing in a mixed duopoly with price competition and with social marginal cost differing from private marginal costs. We find that any equilibrium timing patterns--Bertrand, Stackelberg with private leadership, Stackelberg with public leadership, and multiple Stackelberg equilibria-- emerge. When the foreign ownership share in a private firm is less than 50%, public leadership more likely emerges than private leadership. Conversely, private leadership can emerge in a unique equilibrium when the foreign ownership share in a private firm is large. These results may explain recent policy changes in public financial institutions in Japan. We also find a nonmonotone relationship between the welfare advantage of public and private leadership and the difference between social and private marginal costs for a private firm. A nonmonotone relationship does not emerge in profit ranking.
H42|Why should the government provide the infrastructure through the Public-Private Partnership mode?|This paper develops an endogenous growth model with the non-rival but excludable public good. We seek to answer the question that whether this kind of infrastructure should be provided by pure private firm or by state or by Public-Private Partnership (PPP). And, if the government invests in this type of infrastructure, how should it finance the manufacturing cost-through accumulating debt or imposing a tax or by charging user-fees? In this paper, PPP in infrastructure is defined as a profit-making private firm-producing infrastructure with the partial cost borne by the government. The authors make a comparison of the macro-economic performances under the purely private provision, purely public provision and PPP provision of infrastructure in an economy. In the purely public provision of infrastructure, if the government runs a balanced budget or has constant debt, our model suggests that government should finance the infrastructure solely by charging user fees instead of imposing the tax. The model finds the condition under which the PPP provision of infrastructure is justified. The present paper finds the user fees and growth rate under the private provision and also user fees and growth maximising tax rate in 3 budgetary regimes: (a) when the government has constant debt, (b) when public debt is zero and (c) when there is accumulating debt, under the pure public provision of infrastructure and PPP provision of infrastructure. We find that there exists a unique, equilibrium steady state balanced growth rate in all the regimes. We compare the user fees and growth rates across different regimes.
H42|Modern Democracy-Welfare State and Public Goods. A current consequence for Greece|People expect the state to create jobs and provide them with a social security net. Whatever its defects, whatever the virtues of the private sector, no structure other than the state can today provide citizens with the basic public goods. Under the present right-wing government of Nea Dimokratia in Greece, which is not particularly at odds with neoliberalism, a very active role of the state is not expected. Also is nor expected the introduction of a serious program of public investment and demand boosting to stimulate the national economy and enter into a virtuous circle of recovery. Greece, which has undergone the economic crisis with drastic cuts in its traditionally deficient social state, has to respond directly to the marked underinvestment in public goods (in key areas such as education, health, natural disasters, dealing with decent living conditions).The most important tool for inputting resources is the tax system.
H42|Cesarean sections: Use or abuse?|The cesarean rate in Italy is about 34%, higher than in other European countries and in the United States. It has been rising dramatically over the past decades and it varies considerably across geographical areas. I show that such geographical variation is not driven by medical need and that higher cesarean rates are achieved by performing the procedure on less and less appropriate patients. I find no evidence that high-use areas develop higher ability in performing cesareans. Finally, by using both panel data analysis and instrumental variables, I show that there is no significant relation between risk-adjusted cesarean rates and maternal and neonatal mortality. The combined evidence in this paper suggests that lowering cesarean rates would likely affect less appropriate patients, would not have negative spillovers in terms of quality of the procedure and would not affect neonatal nor maternal mortality. JEL Classification: I1, H42.
H42|Correcting for Transitory Effects in RCTs: Application to the RAND Health Insurance Experiment|The long run price elasticity of healthcare spending is critically important to estimating the cost of provision. However, temporary randomized controlled trials may be confounded by transitory effects. This paper shows evidence of a 'deadline effect' – a spike in spending in the final year of the program – among participants of the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, long considered the definitive RCT in the field. The deadline effect is economically and statistically significant, with power to identify coming from random allocation to three- or five-year enrolment terms. The deadline effect interacts with the price elasticity: participants who face lower coinsurance rates show larger spending spikes. Crucially, controlling for the price-deadline interaction yields significantly smaller estimates of the price elasticity in non-deadline years, which we argue is a better approximation for the long run elasticity. This has important implications for public finance and the design of private/temporary subsidy programs.
H42|Childcare and Maternal Employment: Evidence from Vietnam|Little literature currently exists on the effects of childcare use on maternal labor market outcomes in a developing country context, and recent studies offer mixed results. We attempt to fill these gaps by analyzing several of the latest rounds of the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey spanning the early to mid-2010s. Addressing endogeneity issues with a regression discontinuity estimator based on children’s birth months, we find a sizable effect of childcare attendance on women’s labor market outcomes, including their total annual wages, household income, and poverty status. The effects of childcare attendance differ by women’s characteristics and are particularly strong for younger, more educated women. Furthermore, childcare has a medium-term effect and positively impacts men’s labor market outcomes as well.
H42|Generational Bias and Tax Policy|We examine the nonlinear taxation of labour income and savings when the government places more weight on the welfare of the elderly than of young people. Our analysis is motivated by the observation that the elderly are more likely to vote. Compared to optimal taxation under a utilitarian social welfare function, we show that savings are subsidised, and young low-skill workers face a higher marginal labour tax rate. We also show that the lifetime utility of low-skill individuals is reduced, and that of high-skill individuals is increased, relative to optimal taxation under utilitarianism. An extension of the model to include generation-specific public spending is also considered.

H42|Shocking news and cognitive performance|We study how shocking news affects cognitive performance. Identifying these effects makes societies more resilient by helping to adjust policy responses to reduce indirect costs of future atrocities. Our analysis is based on a school shooting that coincided with national matriculation exams, allowing a difference-in-differences analysis. We find a substantial negative effect on males: their average performance dropped by seven percent. The average performance of females was unaffected. Our findings suggest that a shocking event may call for psychological support for young people even in communities that are not directly affected.
H42|Health and Pollution in a Vertically Differentiated Duopoly|In this paper, we analyze a vertically differentiated mixed duopoly in medical care services. Pollution is the source of illness. The government has a dual role. It decides how much to invest to reduce the pollution level and it may participate in the health market running a public hospital. We find that the presence of the public provider increases the average quality of the service in the market and it reduces the rate of mortality. Furthermore, when the public hospital offers services with the highest quality, then this has positive spillovers on thequality offered by the private provider. Despite these positive welfare improving features, the mixed duopoly in medical care goes along with a highest level of pollution. In the presence of an increasing concern about the relationship between pollution and health, understanding the role of public intervention appears crucial.
H42|A Test of Supply-side Explanations of Geographic Variation in Health Care Use|Evidence of regional variation in health care utilization has been well-documented over the past 40 years. Yet uncertainty persists about whether this variation is primarily the result of supply-side or demand-side forces, and the difference matters for both theory and policy. In this article, we provide new evidence as to the cause of geographic variation in health care utilization. We do so by examining changes in health care use by the near-elderly as they transition from being uninsured into Medicare. Results provide support for a causal supply-side explanation of regional variation. Estimates indicate that gaining Medicare coverage in above-median spending regions increases the probability of at least one hospital visit by 36% and the probability of having more than five doctor visits by 25% relative to similar individuals in below-median spending regions.
H42|From Paper to Plastic: Understanding the Impact of eWIC on WIC Recipient Behavior|Evidence shows that the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is underutilized. WIC enrolls only sixty percent of eligible persons. Participants claim only a fraction of available benefits. Researchers suggest that people underutilize WIC because of the time needed to enroll in and use WIC and because participants may believe that, if others notice them participating in WIC, community members will stigmatize them. Recently enacted policies may reduce both time costs and potential for stigma associated with WIC. Congress mandated that, by 2020, all states disburse WIC benefits through an Electronic Benefits Transfer (eWIC) system. The eWIC potentially reduces the time required for each transaction and makes it more difficult to identify beneficiaries. We analyze data on grocery expenditures of 11,887 WIC-participating households in one state over the period it implemented eWIC. We find that, after beneficiaries began redeeming WIC benefits through eWIC, spending on non-WIC eligible foods did not change but redemptions of WIC benefits increased.
H42|On supply function competition in a mixed oligopoly|In this paper we present a mixed duopoly model of supply function competition under uncertainty with product differentiation. We find that, regardless the nature of product heterogeneity, the best response of the private firm always arises as strategic complement. Contrary to this, state-owned firm's best response arises either as strategic complement or substitute depending on the product heterogeneity. As a result of the ex post realization of the demand uncertainty, different equilibria are reached.
H42|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.
H42|Flexible Privatization Policy in Free-Entry Markets|We investigate a mixed oligopoly in a free-entry market in the presence of shadow cost of public funding. The government chooses the degree of privatization before the entry of private firms and then adjusts the degree of privatization after the entry. We show that a pre-entry privatization policy may serve as a commitment device if the foreign ownership share of private firms is moderate, and substitutes the ideal privatization policy with complete commitment if the equilibrium pre-entry privatization policy is partial privatization.
H42|Preferences over public good, political delegation and leadership in tax competition|Leadership (sequential choice) and political delegation are two mechanisms suggested to restrict ‘race-to-the-bottom’ in tax competition. In this paper, we analyze whether these two mechanisms when combined together would lead to unilaterally higher taxation or not. We show that political delegation with leadership in tax competition not only restricts ‘race-to-the-bottom’ but also mitigates the possibility of over provision of public good. In sequential choice game, only the follower region delegates taxation power to the policy maker but not the leader region. This puts a check on intensity of tax competition and leads to optimal provision of public good.
H42|Price–quality competition in a mixed duopoly|We examine competition between a private and a public provider in markets for merit goods, such as education, healthcare, housing, recreation, or culture. The private firm provides a high‐price/high‐quality variety of the good and serves richer individuals, whereas the public firm provides a low‐price/low‐quality variety and serves poorer individuals. We first characterize the private competitor’s best response to changes in the public firm’s price and quality. This enables us to examine the distributional effects of policies that affect the price or quality of the public firm’s product. We then numerically characterize the public firm’s optimal provision policy, taking the private response into consideration. Our results have implications for the financing of publicly provided goods, and for whether additional resources, if available, should be spent on reducing the price or enhancing the quality of these goods.
H42|On Supply Function Equilibria in a Mixed Duopoly|In this paper we present a mixed duopoly model of supply function competition under uncertainty with product differentiation. We find that, regardless the nature of product heterogeneity, the best response of the private firm always arises as strategic complement. Contrary to this, state-owned firm's best response arises either as strategic complement or substitute depending on the product heterogeneity. As a result of the ex post realization of the demand uncertainty, different equilibria are reached.
H42|Employment in China’s hi-tech zones|Abstract The purpose of this paper is to explore employment differences over time across China’s hi-tech zones. Using data from China’s Ministry of Science and Technology, we find that if a university science park is within a hi-tech zone, employment in that zone is higher, but that finding only holds for zones established in the pre-information communication technology period. After 2000, proximity to a university science park does not appear to be necessary for the exchange of tacit knowledge which we contend leverages the technology base of firms and organizations in the zone and thus their level of employment. We also find greater employment in hi-tech zones in which information technology is a dominant industry.
H42|What ails fishery insurance in China? - Evaluating fishermen's willingness to pay in central coastal areas|Despite the remarkable development in its fishery sector, the penetration rate of fishery insurance in China is considerably low. This paper examines the key factors that contribute to the poor performance of fishery insurance in the country and investigates fishermen?s willingness to pay (WTP) for the insurance program, based on a survey of 1,280 fishermen in three coastal cities in China. The results indicate fishermen?s decision on adoption of an insurance scheme depends on various factors, among which the magnitude of loss, insurance awareness and education level all have positive impact, but annual income and years of fishing experience are more likely to have negative effects. In addition, the mean WTP for fishery insurance is estimated to be CNY 579 per family, which is equivalent to 1.5% of fishermen's mean annual income. These results provide several policy implications for not only the government but also researchers and insurance companies.
H42|Aid diversion and the impact of Development Assistance for Health in a decentralized health system|The effects of foreign aid on a decentralised health system are analysed in a theoretical framework where the donor has imperfect information about the local health needs while the central and local governments do not engage in self-interested efforts upon receiving aid. I discuss the implications of conditionality of aid on local health expenditures, intergovernmental transfers and social welfare. I then examine these consequences in a health system with two levels of care when the donor restricts aid on Primary Health Care.
H42|Why Leave Benefits on the Table? Evidence from SNAP|Studies of take up in social insurance programs rarely distinguish between initial enrollment and retention of beneficiaries. This paper shows that retention plays a meaningful role in incomplete take up: despite knowledge of and eligibility for a near-cash public benefit, many participants exit the program rather than complete administrative requirements. Using administrative data on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for multiple states, I show that over half of entering households exit SNAP within one year of entry. Exits are concentrated in key reporting and recertification months, when participants must submit substantial paperwork in order to remain on the program. Combining administrative SNAP and Unemployment Insurance (UI) records from the state of Michigan, I provide evidence that mechanical eligibility changes cannot explain the extent of program exit. Finally, I demonstrate a substantial effect of administrative requirements on retention by studying the staggered rollout of Michigan’s online case management tool, which reduced exits for likely eligible applicants by approximately 10 percent around these key dates.
H42|Cash transfers increase trust in local government|How does a locally-managed conditional cash transfer program impact trust in government? On the one hand, delivering monetary benefits and increasing interactions with government officials (elected and appointed) may increase trust. On the other hand, it can be difficult for citizens to know to whom to attribute a program and reward with greater trust. Further, imposing paternalistic conditions and possibly prompting citizens to experience feelings of social stigma or guilt, could reduce trust. We answer this question by exploiting the randomized introduction of a locally-managed transfer program in Tanzania in 2010. Our analysis reveals that cash transfers can significantly increase trust in leaders. This effect is driven by large increases in trust in elected leaders as opposed to appointed bureaucrats. Perceptions of government responsiveness to citizens’ concerns and honesty of leaders also rise, and these improvements are largest where there are more village meetings at baseline. One of the central roles of village meetings is to receive and share information with village residents, providing some evidence on the value of a high-information environment for generating trust in government. We also find that records from school and health committees are more readily available in treatment villages. Notably, while stated willingness of citizens to participate in community development projects rises, actual participation in projects and the likelihood of voting do not. Overall, the results suggest little reason to worry that local management of a conditional cash transfer program reduces trust in government or the quality of governance—especially in high-information settings.
H42|Optimal Healthcare Contracts: Theory and Empirical Evidence from Italy|In this paper we investigate the nature of the contracts between a large health-care purchaser and health service providers in a prospective payment system. We model theoretically the interaction between patients choice and cream-skimming by hospitals. We test the model using a very large and detailed administrative dataset for the largest region in Italy. In line with our theoretical results, we show that the state funded purchaser offers providers a system of incentives such that the most efficient providers both treat more patients and also treat more difficult patients, thus receiving a higher average payment per treatment.
H42|On Public Education Spending under Nonlinear Income Taxation|This paper examines a model in which public education spending is skill specific. It may be directed towards low-skill or high-skill individuals, increasing their respective skills and wages. Education spending is financed by nonlinear income taxation. We show that the tax and education-spending policy most preferred by low-skill individuals may include more education spending for high-skill individuals than for themselves. The tax and education-spending policy most preferred by high-skill individuals has no spending on education for low-skill individuals. Our results provide support for previous findings that education policy should favour the high-skilled, despite the government's redistributive goals.
H42|The deadweight loss of christmas - Reply|"In this paper, we study the welfare effects of Christmas presents with a focus on the effect of presents for gift-givers. Based on a survey among students at the University of Göttingen, Germany, we find that the vast majority of gift-givers prefers in-kind gifts compared to gifts of money. The average present in our survey has a price of 36 Euro and results in a ""giver's surplus"" of 10 Euro. This indicates a welfare gain of approximately 143% from the average giver's perspective. The welfare gain for presents to friends and partners is lower than for presents to close family members. Our empirical analysis shows a negative effect of a present's price on the welfare gain for gift-givers."
H42|Funding for International Affairs Activities, Within and Outside Agenciesâ€™ Base Budgets|The Congress provides the State Department, the Agency for International Development (USAID), and other agencies a â€œbase budgetâ€ each year to fund ongoing activities related to international affairs. The agencies have received other â€œnonbaseâ€ funding in recent years, in the form of supplemental appropriations, emergency appropriations, and funding for overseas contingency operations. In this report, CBO analyzes the recent use of such nonbase appropriations for international affairs activities.
H42|La Empresa Estatal Como un Sustituto a los Impuestos|En este trabajo planteamos un modelo de estatización de empresas privadas basado en el supuesto de que el gobierno es un agente maximizador de recursos fiscales. El gobierno puede permitir el funcionamiento de una empresa privada y obtener recursos fiscales a través de impuestos o puede estatizar la empresa y obtener recursos fiscales de los beneficios de la empresa estatal. Un gobierno maximizador de recursos decidirá estatizar una empresa privada cuando los beneficios que le genera la empresa bajo control del Estado menos los costos de estatizarla superen a la recaudación impositiva que le brinda la empresa privada.
H42|Early Detection of Students at Risk - Predicting Student Dropouts Using Administrative Student Data and Machine Learning Methods|High rates of student attrition in tertiary education are a major concern for universities and public policy, as dropout is not only costly for the students but also wastes public funds. To successfully reduce student attrition, it is imperative to understand which students are at risk of dropping out and what are the underlying determinants of dropout. We develop an early detection system (EDS) that uses machine learning and classic regression techniques to predict student success in tertiary education as a basis for a targeted intervention. The method developed in this paper is highly standardized and can be easily implemented in every German institution of higher education, as it uses student performance and demographic data collected, stored, and maintained by legal mandate at all German universities and therefore self-adjusts to the university where it is employed. The EDS uses regression analysis and machine learning methods, such as neural networks, decision trees and the AdaBoost algorithm to identify student characteristics which distinguish potential dropouts from graduates. The EDS we present is tested and applied on a medium-sized state university with 23,000 students and a medium-sized private university of applied sciences with 6,700 students. Our results indicate a prediction accuracy at the end of the 1st semester of 79% for the state university and 85% for the private university of applied sciences. Furthermore, accuracy of the EDS increases with each completed semester as new performance data becomes available. After the fourth semester, the accuracy improves to 90% for the state university and 95% for the private university of applied sciences.
H42|Endogenous Timing and Income Inequality in the Voluntary Provision of Public Goods: Theory and Experiment|This paper investigates how the heterogenous incomes and preferences of potential donors affect the timing of contribution decisions when it is endogenously determined by contributors themselves. More specifically, we use a simple setting with two donors, Cobb-Douglas preferences, and complete information to investigate how income inequality affects the endogenous choices of contribution timing and the level of the voluntary supplied public goods. This paper obtains the following results. First, when income is extremely unequal, potential contributors are indifferent between the timing choices of simultaneous and sequential moves, even if they have different preferences towards a public good. Second, as income inequality decreases, the simultaneous move-game is increasingly likely to emerge, because all potential contributors prefer to act as a leader. Third, in the presence of multiple public goods, contributors with higher valuations for one public good tend to be first contributors to that one. Fourth, these theoretical predictions regarding the timing decisions of individuals are not supported by the laboratory experiment, although those regarding individuals’ contribution decisions are consistent with the experimental results.

H42|Do You Have to Win It to Fix It? A Longitudinal Study of Lottery Winners and Their Health-Care Demand|We exploit lottery wins to investigate the effects of exogenous changes to individuals' income on the utilization of health-care services, and the choice between private and public health care in the United Kingdom. Our empirical strategy focuses on lottery winners in an individual fixed-effects framework and hence the variation of winnings arises from within-individual differences in small versus large winnings. The results indicate that lottery winners with larger wins are more likely to choose private health services than public health services from the National Health Service. The positive effect of wins on the choice of private care is driven largely by winners with medium to large winnings (win category > £ [or US$750]; mean = £1,922.5 [US$2,893.5], median = £1,058.2 [US$1,592.7]). There is some evidence that the effect of winnings vary by whether individuals have private health insurance. We also find weak evidence that large winners are more likely to take up private medical insurance. Large winners are also more likely to drop private insurance coverage between approximately 9 and 10 months earlier than smaller winners, possibly after their winnings have been exhausted. Our estimates for the lottery income elasticities for public health care (relative to no care) are very small and are not statistically distinguishable from zero; those of private health care range from 0 to 0.26 for most of the health services considered, and 0.82 for cervical smear.
H42|The stimulative effect of an unconditional block grant on the decentralized provision of care|Understanding the impact of central government grants on decentralized healthcare provision is of crucial importance for the design of grant systems, yet empirical evidence on the prevalence of flypaper effects in this domain is rare. We study the decentralization of home care in the Netherlands and exploit the gradual introduction of formula-based equalization to identify the effect of exogenous changes in an unconditional block grant on local expenditure and utilization. A one euro increase in central government grants raises local expenditure by twenty to fifty cents. Adjustments occur through the number of hours as well as through substitution between basic and more advanced types of assistance. These findings suggest that conditioning of grants is not required for the central government to retain a moderate degree of control over the decentralized provision of care.
H42|On the political economy of compulsory education|We consider an economy with two categories of agents: entrepreneurs and workers. In laissez-faire, the former gain from having their children educated, while the latter, although they may profit from their own education, have no interest in sending their children to school. We first characterise the preferred education policy-cum-redistributive taxation for the two groups, and find that entrepreneurs favour a compulsory education policy while workers prefer a purely redistributive taxation. Each group would like the policy to be entirely financed by the other group. Then, we introduce a political process with probabilistic voting and verify that an equilibrium with both a compulsory education policy and some redistribution may exist in which the workers are constrained but the entrepeneurs, who benefit from hiring educated workers, are not.
H42|De samlade effektbedömningarnas roll i framtagandet av Trafikverkets förslag till nationell plan|Vad som påverkar vilka infrastrukturinvesteringar som ingår i planer har studerats flera gånger, såväl i Sverige som utomlands. I denna studie studerar vi vilka egenskaper hos namngivna investeringar, så som de beskrivs i Trafikverkets samlade effektbedömningar (SEBarna), som påverkar vilka namngivna investeringar Trafikverket tar med i sitt förslag till nationell plan. Vi studerar även hur de samlade effektbedömningarna har använts av planerarna i arbetet med att ta fram planförslaget. Vi finner att den samhällsekonomiska analysen verkar ha påverkat objekts sannolikhet att tas med i planförslaget, både den samhällsekonomiska kalkylen och de icke-värderade miljöeffekterna. Trafikverket uppger också att de använder den samhällsekonomiska analysen som ett redskap för att sålla bort olönsamma åtgärder. Bedömningarna i de andra delarna av SEB:en, fördelnings- och måluppfyllelseanalysen, verkar däremot inte påverka vilka objekt som föreslås. I intervjuer framkom att dessa delar, som beslutsunderlag betraktat, har flera brister. Att vi inte finner att fördelnings- och måluppfyllelseanalysen påverkat vilka objekt Trafikverket föreslagit till planen behöver emellertid inte innebära att dessa aspekter inte har påverkat vilka åtgärder som föreslagits för planen. Tvärtom verkar de aspekter som utvärderats i måluppfyllelseanalysen haft betydelse i alternativgenereringen, och alltså påverkat vilka åtgärder som utvärderats.
H42|Exploring Digital Time Measurement in the Public Sector: Labor Productivity and Service Quality in Home Care|We measure labor productivity in home care using new data from the recent introduction of digital time measurement in Swedish municipalities. By measuring worker utilization (delivered hours as a share of worked hours) we avoid several problems that have plagued previous studies of public sector productivity. The time use measure exposes substantial variation in productivity between home care units, suggesting room for improvement. More productive units deliver a larger share of the hours approved by care managers and have equally satisfied users.
H42|Choice and Competition in the Welfare State: Home Care as the Ideal Quasi-market|We study a reform by which a standardized model of choice and competition was introduced in tax-financed home care in a majority of Swedish municipalities. The market for home care is of particular interest since it is close to the ideal quasi-market. For identification, we exploit the different timing of reform implementation across municipalities. We find that the introduction of free choice and free entry in home care increased perceived quality by about one quarter of a standard deviation without affecting costs. Since satisfaction is unrelated to the private market share, the underlying mechanism seems to be new choice opportunities rather than competition or an advantage of private providers.
H42|“Post-Truth” Schooling and Marketized Education: Explaining the Decline in Sweden’s School Quality|The Swedish school system suffers from profound problems with teacher recruitment and retention, knowledge decline, and grade inflation. Absenteeism is high, and psychiatric disorders have risen sharply among Swedish pupils in the last ten years. In this pioneering analysis of the consequences of combining institutionalized social constructivism with extensive marketization of education, we suggest that these problems regarding school quality are to no small extent a result of the Swedish school system’s unlikely combination of a postmodern view of truth and knowledge, the ensuing pedagogy of child-centered discovery, and market principles. Our study adds to the findings from previous attempts to study the effects of social-constructivist pedagogy in nonmarket contexts and yields the implication that caution is necessary for countries, notably the U.S., that have a tradition of social-constructivist practices in their education systems and are considering implementing or expanding market-based school reforms.

H42|What Accounts for the US Ascendancy to Economic Superpower by the Early 20th Century: The Morrill Act – Human Capital Hypothesis|Maddison's international panel data show that technically it was the faster growth rate of the US economy that led to its overtaking the UK as economic superpower. We explore the contributing factors. Identifying the land-grant colleges system triggered by the 1862/1890 Morrill Acts (MAs) as a major contributor, we develop this hypothesis theoretically and test it via difference-in-differences regression analyses viewing the MAs as the experiment, the US or US states as treatment groups, and the UK as chief control group in the country-level comparisons. Using national and state-level data, we estimate that the MAs produced sizeable educational and economic returns which catapulted the US into its leading status.
H42|Effect of measles outbreak on vaccination uptake|This paper explores the effects of a measles outbreak on vaccination uptake in Austria, using administrative data with individual-level information on childhood vaccinations. I define a treatment group of children affected by the outbreak, and compare them with a control group of earlier-born children who are unaffected. Twelve months after the outbreak, the vaccination rate of the treatment group is 2.5 (first dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine) and 4 (second dose) percentage points higher than the corresponding rates of the control group. The results do not indicate that families at increased risk respond more strongly, suggesting that the outbreak changed the perceived value of vaccinations across the whole population. Findings also reveal heterogeneity in the response of families based on the parents’ level of education, indicating that parents with higher education levels absorb new information more rapidly.
H42|Ethnic Horizontal Inequity in Indonesia|For the first time in Indonesia, we jointly analyse several economic statistics and ethnic diversity indicators at national and local levels. Nationally, we find very high levels of economic inequality, measured from household asset values or consumption expenditure. In contrast, the levels of ethnic diversity, while non-negligible, are much lower, whether they reflect fractionalization, polarization, or horizontal inequity based on individual living standards. All horizontal inequity indicators surged after the Asian economic crisis. Horizontal inequity based on education is much lower and decreasing. Finally, we provide tentative explanations of local horizontal inequity in regressions that show a mixed pattern of socioeconomic influences.
H42|Municipal socialism or municipal capitalism? The performance of local public enterprises in Italy|This paper evaluates the performance of Italian local public enterprises (LPEs) with respect to their private sector counterparts. We address the following questions: i) do LPEs perform worse than (comparable) private firms?; ii) does the performance gap depend on the ownership structure (the share held by the public) or on the market structure (the degree of competition in the sector)?; iii) which are the main determinants of LPEs' performance in terms of productivity? The main findings – which are robust to the possible endogeneity of the ownership structure – are as follows: i) LPEs perform less well than private companies by about 8 percent in terms of TFP; ii) although both ownership structure and market structure matter, our results suggest that the ownership structure is more important; and iii) the performance gap of LPEs with respect to private firms seems to be driven by over-capitalization rather than by over-employment.
H42|The National Flood Insurance Program: Financial Soundness and Affordability|The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) offers flood insurance and promotes floodplain management. CBOâ€™s analysis of 5 million policies in effect in August 2016 showed that the NFIPâ€™s expected one-year costs exceeded annual premiums (including fees and assessments paid by policyholders) by $1.4 billion. That shortfall stemmed primarily from premiumsâ€™ falling short of expected costs in coastal counties, which account for three-quarters of all NFIP policies nationwide.
H42|A normative justification of compulsory education|Abstract Using a household production model of educational choices, we characterise a free-market situation in which some agents (high wagers) fully educate their children and spend a sizable amount of resources on them, while others (low wagers) educate them only partially. The free-market equilibrium is iniquitous, both because the households have different resources and because the children have different access to education. Public policy is thus called for, for vertical as well as horizontal equity purposes. Conventional wisdom has it that both objectives could be achieved using price control instruments, i.e. income taxes and price subsidies. We find instead that income taxes reduce equality of opportunity and that price subsidies cannot remedy this. Quantity controls become necessary: a compulsory education package, financed by a redistributive tax system, achieves both types of equity. Redistributive taxation and compulsory education are therefore best seen as complementary policies.
H42|The Hospital as a Multi-Product Firm: The Effect of Hospital Competition on Value-Added Indicators of Clinical Quality|There is increasing international interest in using Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) to assess health care provider performance. PROMs are a fundamental advance on existing indicators of health care quality in two respects: they equate outcomes with value added (i.e. health gain) from treatment rather than post-treatment health status, and they allow clinical quality to be measured at the level of the individual medical intervention to a far greater extent than existing failure-based indicators of quality such as mortality or readmissions. Most existing econometric studies of hospital competition and quality equate outcomes with post-treatment health status, and use mortality rates of various kinds as indicators of overall hospital performance, in spite of the fact that mortality is a relatively uncommon outcome in the spheres of hospital activity - such as elective surgery - in which competition for patients does occur. This paper contributes to the development of a value-added, multi-product conception of hospital quality by studying the impact of a major competition-promoting reform to the English NHS in 2006, in which patients were allowed to choose which hospital they attended for elective surgery, on PROMs of health gain from hip and knee replacement, groin hernia repair, and varicose vein surgery. In contrast to the existing literature, I find that the competition brought about by the introduction of patient choice of hospital may have had a negative effect on clinical quality. I put forward a theoretical framework that explains these findings, and conclude by arguing that future research should model the hospital as a multi-product firm, and capture clinical quality using value-added outcome measures.
H42|Image concerns and the political economy of publicly provided private goods|Governments often provide their citizens with goods and services that are also supplied in markets: education, housing, nutritional assistance, etc. We analyze the political economy of the public provision of private goods when individuals care about their social image. We show that image concerns motivate richer individuals to vote for the public provision of goods they themselves buy in markets, the reason being that a higher provision level attracts more individuals to the public system, enhancing the social exclusivity of market purchases. In effect, majority voting may lead to a public provision that only a minority of citizens use. Users in the public system may enjoy better provision than users in the private system. We characterize the coalition structures across voters that can prevail in a political equilibrium.
H42|Income Taxes, Political Accountability and Public Goods Provision|This paper proposes and analyzes an unexplored mechanism through which in- creases in income taxes -understood as increases in either marginal tax rates or tax progressivity- might positively affect the degree of political accountability (PA), and consequently, the provision of public goods (PG) in a democratic environment. To do this, we build a voting-agency model with income-heterogeneous voters and different tax schedules. Our main result is that, in fact, the provided mechanism uncovers a direct link between income taxes and the degree of PA. A crucial condition for observing a positive effect of an increase in income taxes on both voters' political demands for PG and the provision of PG is that said increase must negatively affect the median voter's disposable income. If this does not occur, which may well be the case in low-income countries, the effect of an increase in income taxes on the degree of PA is ambiguous. We also explore how agency problems a affect the majority-voting equilibrium income tax rate.
H42|Who wants violence? The political economy of conflict and state building in Colombia|"Enduring violent conflict is the flip side of the coin of a weak state. In this article, I propose some political economy underpinnings for the persistence of conflict (and the weak state). Focusing on the case of Colombia, I discuss three broad sets of mechanisms that are also relevant elsewhere. First, a public goods trap"" implies that a low supply of public goods (including security and order) produces a low demand for public goods, and vice versa. This trap is grounded on, and reproduces, political and economic inequality. Second, conflict and a weak state create economic and political rents, producing vested interests in the status quo. I argue that political rents are a particularly strong obstacle, partly because reformers face a sort of curse of dimensionality: many things have to work well for state capacity and stable peace to consolidate. Politically powerful groups take advantage of any weak spot to defend their rents, producing countervailing negative effects following state building efforts. Finally, the very clientelistic pattern of political exchange in many societies consolidates a weak state, and weak states are fertile ground for clientelism to flourish. This vicious circle of clientelism and state weakness is another reason for persistence. I conclude discussing some lessons for reformers, though the very nature of the argument implies that there are no easy recipes for success."
H42|Optimal rationing of productive public services under tax competition|Oates and Schwab (1991) advocate capital-tax financing of public services that support the production process under the assumption that these services are rationed to private firms according to their capital employment. This paper makes the rationing scheme for public services endogenous and demonstrates that the Oates–Schwab scheme is actually the optimal policy choice. We also consider the rationing scheme when labor taxation, instead of or in addition to capital taxation, is imposed.
H42|A cautionary tale on using panel data estimators to measure program impacts|We compare experimental and nonexperimental estimates from a social and informational messaging experiment. Our results show that applying a fixed effects estimator in conjunction with matching to pre-process nonexperimental comparison groups cannot replicate an experimental benchmark, despite parallel pre-intervention trends and good covariate balance. The results are a stark reminder about the role of untestable assumptions–in our case, conditional bias stability–in drawing causal inferences from observational data, and the dangers of relying on single studies to justify program scaling-up or canceling.
H42|Two experiments in one: How accounting for context matters for welfare estimates|By combining two different types of experiments in one experimental session, this paper aims at understanding how different contexts may influence participants’ choices. This paper focuses on one hybrid experimental session that mixed one voluntary contributions mechanism (VCM), influencing the indemnity received by participants, and one mechanism eliciting willingness to pay (WTP) for milk bottles with public and private attributes. The VCM shows relatively high levels of contributions that are mainly influenced by the positive expectations of participants about the average group contribution, rather than by the variations in the design of this mechanism and the period of experiments. The WTP for milk bottles are particularly sensitive to the order of mechanisms and to the period of experiments. Conversely, the WTP differences between milk bottles for a given round of information are invariant across the order of mechanisms and the period of experiments. For each bottle, the variations of WTP coming from the messages about private and public attributes are also stable over the order of mechanisms and the period of experiments. This confers validity to experiments for measuring WTP for public and private attributes related to food. In other words, these variations of WTP contribute to welfare estimates and are useful to evaluate market regulations focusing on public and/or private attributes.
H42|The tradeoff of the commons under stochastic use|We develop a model of scarce renewable resources to study the problem of the commons. Our model formulation differs from the existing literature in that it assumes the use of the commons to be stochastic in nature. One example is microwave spectrum for mobile and wireless communications. We investigate three mechanisms of resource allocation: free usage, the exclusive franchise, and a regulated monopoly. We show that the welfare tradeoff among these three mechanisms depends on the characteristics of the commons and their usage patterns. In particular, we find that property rights are not always the best solution. We then make four extensions that apply to spectrum allocations.
H42|Are users better-off with new transit lines?|This paper studies the entry of a new competitor in a public transport network. Competitors for existing rail can be long distance buses but also the vanpool services. These new lines decrease the ridership of the existing lines and increase waiting time for its passengers. A stylized network model is used to study this potential vicious cycle. We derive sufficient conditions for this negative effect to increase overall public transport costs. The new line is only beneficial when there are relatively many users that want to use the new direct line or when the unit cost reduction is sufficiently large. Our result raises concerns with respect to the decentralized management of transit systems.
H42|Ethnic Horizontal Inequity in Indonesia|For the first time in Indonesia, we jointly analyse several economic statistics and ethnic diversity indicators at national and local levels. Nationally, we find very high levels of economic inequality, measured from household asset values or consumption expenditure. In contrast, the levels of ethnic diversity, while non-negligible, are much lower, whether they reflect fractionalization, polarization, or horizontal inequity based on individual living standards. All horizontal inequity indicators surged after the Asian economic crisis. Horizontal inequity based on education is much lower and decreasing. Finally, we provide tentative explanations of local horizontal inequity in regressions that show a mixed pattern of socioeconomic influences.
H42|The Effects of Fluoride in the Drinking Water|Fluoridation of the drinking water is a public policy whose aim is to improve dental health. Although the evidence is clear that fluoride is good for dental health, concerns have been raised regarding potential negative effects on cognitive development. We study the effects of fluoride exposure through the drinking water throughout life on cognitive and non-cognitive ability, math test scores and labor market outcomes in a large-scale setting. We use a rich Swedish register dataset for the cohorts born 1985–1992 in the main analysis, together with drinking water fluoride data. To estimate the effects, we exploit intra-municipality variation of fluoride, stemming from an exogenous variation in the bedrock. Taking all together, we investigate and confirm the long-established positive relationship between fluoride and dental health. Second, we find precisely estimated zero-effects on cognitive ability, non-cognitive ability and math test scores for fluoride levels in Swedish drinking water. Third, we find that fluoride improves later labor market outcomes, which indicates that good dental health is a positive factor on the labor market.
H42|Management Practices and the Quality of Primary Care|Using the World Management Survey method, we map and analyse management quality in Swedish primary care centres. On average, private providers have higher management quality than public ones. We also find that centres with a high overall social deprivation among enrolled patients tend to have higher management quality. Regarding quality of care, we find that management quality is positively associated with accessibility, but not with patient reported experience.
H42|Optimal Redistributive Income Taxation and Efficiency Wages|This paper integrates efficiency wage setting in the theory of optimal redistributive income taxation. In doing so, we use a model with two skill-types, where efficiency wage setting characterizes the labor market faced by the low-skilled, whereas the high-skilled face a conventional, competitive labor market. There are two types of jobs in this economy; a low-demanding job which can be carried out by everybody, and a high-demanding job which can only be carried out by the high-skilled, meaning that a potential mimicker may either adopt a conventional income-replication strategy or a job-replication strategy. In this framework, we show that the marginal income tax implemented for the high-skilled is negative under plausible assumptions. The marginal income tax facing the low-skilled can be either positive or negative in general, even if employment-related motives for policy intervention typically contribute to an increase in this marginal tax. An increase in the unemployment benefit contributes to relax the binding self-selection constraint (irrespective of the strategy adopted by a potential mimicker), which makes this instrument particularly useful from the perspective of redistribution.
H42|Do Rewards Work?: Evidence from the Randomization of Public Works|This paper evaluates the effect of positive inducements on tax behavior by exploiting a natural experiment in which a municipality of Argentina randomly selected 400 individuals among more than 72,000 taxpayers who had complied with payment of their property tax. These individuals were publicly recognized and awarded the construction of a sidewalk. Results indicate that: i) being selected in the lottery and publicly recognized by the government has a positive but not persistent effect on future compliance; ii) receiving the sidewalk has a large positive and persistent effect; iii) high and persistent spillover effects exist: some neighbors of those who receive the reward comply more too, and these effects can be even larger than the direct effects; and iv) there is no financial motive effect; i.e., people do not pay their taxes just to participate in the lottery. Recognition serves only as a short-term incentive, but the provision of a durable and visible good has more persistent and broader effects. These findings provide evidence on features that make a positive inducement more successful, whether for tax compliance or other policy purposes.
H42|Healer or Gatekeeper? Physicians' Role Conflict When Symptoms Are Non-Verifiable|Although physicians are often expected to be gatekeepers to health insurance benefits such as paid sick leave, research indicates a substantial reluctance to reject patient requests for sickness certificates. We show that private information on the patient's part creates a conflict between the healer and gatekeeper roles: if a patient reports subjective symptoms indicating a need for sick leave, the physician is unable to tell if the patient is truly sick or a shirker. We show that even if most physicians prefer to be good gatekeepers, all of them may trust their patients in Nash equilibrium. These ideas are illustrated using results from focus group interviews with Norwegian primary care physicians.
H42|Public Enterprises – Objectives and Performance|Public ownership is a way to provide goods and services where market performance is not satisfactory, or when the economy would otherwise be stagnant, provided that its costs do not overshadow its benefits. We provide a brief review of the existing theoretical and empirical literature. While far from exhaustive, the review suggests that there is no unanimous body of research showing that public ownership is inefficient to such an extent that private ownership is always socially superior. More research is needed on the costs and benefits of different forms of ownership, and we emphasise the need of analysing potential intrinsic motivation, service quality and the impact of international competition. Moreover, the fact that privatisation has often been implemented through outsourcing suggests a need of analysing renationalisation through buyer power.
H42|Healthcare Spending and Utilization in Public and Private Medicare|"We compare healthcare spending in public and private Medicare using newly available claims data from Medicare Advantage (MA) insurers. MA insurer revenues are 30 percent higher than their healthcare spending. Healthcare spending is 25 percent lower for MA enrollees than for enrollees in traditional Medicare (TM) in the same county with the same risk score. Spending differences between MA and TM are similar across sub-populations of enrollees and sub-categories of care, with similar reductions for ""high value"" and ""low value"" care. Spending differences primarily reflect differences in healthcare utilization; spending per encounter and hospital payments per admission are very similar in MA and TM. Geographic variation in MA spending is about 20 percent higher than in TM, but geographic variation in hospital prices is about 20 percent lower. We present evidence consistent with MA plans encouraging substitution to less expensive care, such as primary rather than specialist care, and outpatient rather than inpatient surgery, and with employing various types of utilization management. Some of the overall spending differences between MA and TM may be driven by selection on unobservables, and we report a range of estimates of this selection effect using mortality outcomes to proxy for selection."
H42|Risk Preferences in Small and Large Stakes: Evidence from Insurance Contract Decisions|We examine risk preferences using the flood insurance decisions of over 100,000 households. In each contract, households make a small stakes decision, the deductible, and a large stakes one, the coverage limit. Over 94 percent of household choose one of the two lowest deductibles out of six options, and 77 percent fully insure, select a coverage limit of at least their home’s replacement cost. Households must be extremely risk averse to explain each of these choices with standard expected utility models. Households’ deductible choices imply a median relative risk aversion of 108. Households’ coverage limit choices require a median relative risk aversion of at least 112. Their substantial risk aversion over large stakes is due to households’ tendency to fully insure despite paying premiums well above their contracts’ expected value. Allowing for probability distortions improves our models and explains the small and large decisions of most households in our data. Assessing rank dependent utility models, we find that households follow two tenets of prospect theory: overestimation of small probabilities and diminishing sensitivity to losses.
H42|What Does (Formal) Health Insurance Do, and for Whom?|Health insurance confers benefits to the previously uninsured, including improvements in health, reductions in out-of-pocket spending, and reduced medical debt. However, because the nominally uninsured pay only a small share of their medical expenses, health insurance also provides substantial transfers to nonrecipient parties who would otherwise bear the costs of providing uncompensated care to the uninsured. The prevalence of uncompensated care helps explain the limited take-up of heavily subsidized public health insurance and the evidence that many recipients value formal health insurance at substantially less than the cost to insurers of providing that coverage. The distributional implications of public subsidies for health insurance depend critically on the ultimate economic incidence of the transfers that they deliver to providers of uncompensated care.
H42|Storm Crowds: Evidence from Zooniverse on Crowd Contribution Design|Crowdsourcing - a collaborative form of content production based on the contributions of large groups of individuals - has proliferated in the past decade. Due to this growth, recent research has focused on understanding the factors that affect its sustainability. Prior studies have highlighted the importance of volunteers’ prosocial motivations, the sense of belonging to a community, and symbolic rewards within crowdsourcing websites. One factor that has received limited attention in the existing literature is how the design of crowdsourcing platforms affects their sustainability. We study whether the design element - particularly, the divisibility of contributions (i.e. whether contributing tasks are bundled together or can be carried out separately) - is a factor that affects the level and quality of crowdsourcing contributions. We investigate this in the context of Zooniverse, the world’s largest crowd-sourced science site, in which volunteers contribute to scientific research by performing data processing tasks. Our choice of empirical setting is motivated by the fact that one of the Zooniverse projects, Cyclone Center, underwent a format change that decreased the divisibility of contributions, by bundling together two tasks that were previously separate. We refer to contributions for which both tasks were done as complete, and contributions for which only one task was done as incomplete. In this context, we develop a theoretical model that predicts (i) a positive relationship between contribution divisibility and the total number of contributions (i.e. complete and incomplete) per volunteer, (ii) an ambiguous relationship between contribution divisibility and the number of complete contributions per volunteer, and (iii) an ambiguous relationship between contribution divisibility and the value of complete contributions. We test these predictions empirically by exploiting the format change in Cyclone Center. We find that after the format change, which decreased contribution divisibility, (i) the total number of contributions per volunteer decreased, (ii) the number of complete contributions made by anonymous volunteers increased, while that made by registered volunteers remained unchanged, and (iii) the value of complete contributions increased because anonymous volunteers, who increased their number of complete contributions, contributed high quality contributions. Our results have strategic implications for crowdsourcing platforms because they suggest that the design of crowdsourcing platforms, specifically the divisibility of contributions, is a factor that matters for their sustainability.
H42|Mechanism Design with Financially Constrained Agents and Costly Verification|A principal wishes to distribute an indivisible good to a population of budget-constrained agents. Both valuation and budget are an agentâ€™s private information. The principal can inspect an agentâ€™s budget through a costly verification process and punish an agent who makes a false statement. I characterize the direct surplus-maximizing mechanism. This direct mechanism can be implemented by a two-stage mechanism in which agents only report their budgets. Specifically, all agents report their budgets in the first stage. The principal then provides budget dependent cash subsidies to agents and assigns the goods randomly (with uniform probability) at budget-dependent prices. In the second stage, a resale market opens, but is regulated with budget-dependent sales taxes. Agents who report low budgets receive more subsidies in their initial purchases (the first stage), face higher taxes in the resale market (the second stage) and are inspected randomly. This implementation exhibits some of the features of some welfare programs, such as Singaporeâ€™s housing and development board.
H42|A New Approach to Free Entry Markets in Mixed Oligopolies: Welfare Implications|This study formulates a new model of mixed oligopolies in free entry markets. A state-owned public enterprise is established before the game, private enterprises enter the market, and then the government chooses the degree of privatization of the public enterprise (Entry-then-Privatization Model). We find that under general demand and cost functions, the timing of privatization does not affect consumer surplus or the output of each private firm, while it does affect the equilibrium degree of privatization, number of entering firms, and output of the public firm. The equilibrium degree of privatization is too high (low) for both domestic and world welfare if private firms are domestic (foreign).
H42|Optimal Privatization and Uniform Subsidy Policies: A Synthesis|The privatization neutrality theorem states that the share of public ownership in an enterprise does not affect welfare (i.e., any degree of privatization is optimal) under optimal uniform tax-subsidy policy. We revisit this neutrality result. First, we investigate the case in which the private enterprise is domestic. We show that this neutrality result does not hold unless public and private enterprises have the same cost function. In addition, we show that the optimal degree of privatization is zero regardless whether the public or private firm has a cost advantage under the optimal subsidy policy. Next, we investigate a case in which the private enterprise is owned by both domestic and foreign investors. We show that the optimal degree of privatization is never zero, and thus, the neutrality result does not hold even when there is no cost difference between public and private enterprises.
H42|Comparing welfare and profit in quantity and price competition within Stackelberg mixed duopolies|Abstract We compare welfare and profits under price and quantity competition in Stackelberg mixed duopolies. Under public leadership, price competition always yields greater profits and welfare than quantity competition. By contrast, under private leadership, the result depends on the nationality of the private firm. When the private firm is domestic (foreign), welfare is greater under quantity (price) competition. However, private firms always earn more under price competition. Introducing the nonnegative profit constraint affects welfare ranking but not profit ranking. These results indicate that profit ranking is fairly robust to the time structure in Stackelberg mixed duopolies, but welfare ranking is not.
H42|Dynamic Privatization Policy|This study formulates a two‐period model of mixed oligopoly in which the government privatizes a state‐owned public firm over multiple periods. We introduce the shadow cost of public funding (i.e., the excess burden of taxation). The government is concerned about both the total surplus and the revenue obtained from the privatization of the public firm. We find that the government may or may not increase the degree of privatization over time depending on the competitiveness of the product market and nationality of private competitors. The government increases the degree of privatization over time if the product market is competitive and the foreign ownership share in private firms is low. Although it adjusts its privatization policy over time, this harms welfare. In addition, this distortion in the ex post incentive leads to too low a degree of privatization in the first period.
H42|Optimal Privatization Policy under Private Leadership in Mixed Oligopolies|We discuss optimal privatization policies in mixed oligopolies in which a public firm is the Stackelberg follower (private leadership). We find that under constant marginal cost, the optimal degree of privatization is zero. When the marginal cost is increasing, however, the optimal degree is never zero, and full privatization can be optimal. These results suggest that the optimal privatization policy depends on the cost conditions. We also find that the optimal degree of privatization is substantially lower under private leadership than in the simultaneous-move model when there is no cost difference between public and private firms.
H42|Regional regulators in health care service under quality competition: A game theoretical model|In several countries, health care services are provided by public and/or private subjects, and they are reimbursed by the government, on the basis of regulated prices (in most countries, diagnosis‐related group). Providers take prices as given and compete on quality to attract patients. In some countries, regulated prices differ across regions. This paper focuses on the interdependence between regional regulators within a country: It studies how price setters of different regions interact, in a simple but realistic framework. Specifically, we model a circular city as divided in two administrative regions. Each region has two providers and one regulator, who sets the local price. Patients are mobile and make their choice on the basis of provider location and service quality. Interregional mobility occurs in the presence of asymmetries in providers' cost efficiency, regulated prices, and service quality. We show that the optimal regulated price is higher in the region with the more efficient providers; we also show that decentralisation of price regulation implies higher expenditure but higher patients' welfare.
H42|The Contingent Valuation Method in assessing the value of sport’s stadium in developing nations. The case of Poland|The European Football Championship (Euro 2012) organized in Poland became the pretext for a number of infrastructural changes at a total cost of 100 billion PLN2012. Such high expenditure makes the Polish event the most expensive among events of this magnitude. The fact that these changes were 100% financed by public means raises the question whether these funds were used in a substantiated way. Therefore, the aim of this study is to estimate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) among the community of the Pomeranian region, in connection with intangible benefits and costs stemming from hosting the Euro 2012 in Gdansk. A survey conducted among 407 respondents was the source of information. The results of the study show that the average value of WTPbenefit for the whole sample was 45,72 PLN2012 and WTPcost was 3,86 PLN2012. The aggregate values for the whole region was in terms of benefits and costs 396,6 million PLN2012 and 33,49 million PLN2012 respectively. The results thus confirm the existence of both intangible benefits and costs associated with the event. However, it should be noted that the importance of the net benefits is insignificant and does not compensate for the massive expenditure from public sources.
H42|Shadow Cost of Public Funds and Privatization Policies|We investigate the optimal privatization policy in mixed oligopolies with shadow cost of public funds (excess burden of taxation). The government is concerned with both the total social surplus and the revenue obtained by the privatization of a public firm. We find that the relationship between the shadow cost of public funds and the optimal privatization policy is non-monotone. When the cost is moderate, then higher the cost is, the lower is the optimal degree of privatization. However, this does not hold when the cost is high. A further increase of the cost might drastically increase the optimal degree of privatization.
H42|Partial Privatization under Multimarket Price Competition|We investigate the effect of multimarket contacts on the privatization policy in mixed duopoly with price competition. There are two markets, one of which is served solely by the state-owned public firm, and the other is served by both public and private firms. Two markets are linked by the production technology of the public firm. In the general model, we first show that privatization is never optimal in the absence of multimarket contacts, i.e., if there is only one monopoly market or one duopoly market. Then, using a linear-quadratic specification, we show that a positive degree of privatization can be optimal in the presence of multimarket contacts. This result has an implication for the privatization policy in universal service sectors.
H42|Supply function equilibria and nonprofit-maximizing objectives|We examine the supply function equilibrium (SFE) that is often used in the analysis of multi-unit auctions, such as wholesale electricity markets, among (partially privatized) public firms. We show that in a duopoly model with linear demand and quadratic cost functions, both a partially privatized public firm and a profit-maximizing firm offers flatter supply functions as equilibrium strategies, resulting in a larger social surplus, when the public firm focuses more on social welfare. This implies that the full nationalization is optimal if firms compete in SFE, in contrast to a Cournot case, which has been used as an approximation of the wholesale electricity markets. We also confirm that the SFE converges to the (inverse) marginal cost function when the firms’ social concern is improved symmetrically in the industry.
H42|Optimal Production Tax and Privatization Policies under an Endogenous Market Structure|We investigate the optimal tax and privatization policies in a mixed oligopoly in which a state-owned public firm competes against private firms in a free-entry market. First, we investigate the domestic private firm case. The optimal tax rate is strictly positive except for the full privatization and full nationalization cases, and the relationship between the optimal tax rate and degree of privatization is inverted U-shaped. Further, the optimal degree of privatization is decreasing in the tax rate. Next, we investigate the foreign private firm case and find that the two policies are mutually independent.
H42|Optimal degree of privatization in a mixed oligopoly with multiple public enterprises|I discuss the optimal degree of privatization in a mixed oligopoly in which multiple public enterprises exist. I find that the optimal degree of privatization is increasing in the number of private firms n and independent of the number of public firms m. These results suggest that no matter how many public firms exist, an increase in the number of private firms would increase the optimal degree of privatization as long as all public firms are partially privatized at the same degree.
H42|Perfect Public Offering: A Process to Provide Complete Ownership & Direction of Businesses to the Entire Public|A process for a business to exclusively and completely sell its shares to a 501(c)3 charity to transfer full ownership & direction of the business to the entire public. Nonprofit universities are charities well positioned to completely own & operate businesses: to produce and allocate their goods and services to society efficiently, effectively and in harmony with the best interests of the entire public, especially when employees of acquired businesses become faculty of the university; When work becomes education in motion; When operating costs of the university and the acquired businesses are subsidized by the goods, services, amenities, and processes of the university and the businesses it acquires; And when socioeconomic order is naturally regulated via the infrastructures of universities. The social and economic efficiency and effectiveness of businesses completely owned and operated by nonprofit universities induce logic and peer-pressures which encourage global assimilation. The mechanism relies on an iterated prisoner’s dilemma scenario established amongst all businesses, created by global externalities produced from the localized interactions of an initial group of businesses being completely acquired by a nonprofit university, which uses an internet platform to localize their social and economic information and activities to help concentrate public understanding, trust and support to itself and the businesses, which initially join to benefit being first within their industry to be acquired. [1] The result, efficiently and effectively produces and allocates goods, services, knowledge, resources, jobs, and opportunities amongst society; Establishes Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs; And naturally resolves many socioeconomic issues.
H42|Cost-Benefit Analysis of Liberia’s Rice and Goat Value Chains|This paper presents the findings of the CBA of Liberia’s work with rice and goat value chains (VCs), specifically evaluating the recent Feed the Future (FtF) activities implemented under the Food and Enterprise Development program (FED). The Integrated Investment Appraisal (IIA) methodology is used to evaluate both the financial and the socio-economic effectiveness of FED interventions and assess their impacts from various perspectives. In conclusion, the ENPV of FED project once the USAID cost is included is a negative US$10.19 million, indicating that the benefits of the interventions do not outweigh the costs. The ERR is only 7.6 percent, which is 4.4 percent lower than the threshold of 12 percent set by USAID. The recent Ebola outbreak and other factors including the high logistical costs in Liberia contributed to the negative returns of FED interventions.
H42|Cost-Benefit Analysis of Rwanda’s Dairy Value Chains|This paper presents the findings of the CBA of Rwanda’s work with the dairy value chain (VC). The analysis looks at evaluating the recent Feed the Future (FtF) activities implemented under the Rwanda Dairy Competitiveness Program II (RDCP II). It was discovered that the USAID investments have resulted in an increase in the annual incomes of dairy farmers by more than 40%. The analysis has also revealed that because of project interventions, the VC has reached a stage when investments in dairy farming are financially feasible without government or other donors support. The consumer gains are estimated at US$ 18.83 million. Following the successful piloting of activities aimed at boosting domestic production of butter, cheese, and yogurt under the RDCP II project, it is recommended that future USAID interventions focus on increasing the market for raw milk.
H42|Cost Benefit Analysis of Mali’s Sorghum and Millet Value Chains|This paper presents the findings of the CBA of Mali’s work with the sorghum and millet value chains (VCs). The analysis looks at evaluating the recent Feed the Future (FtF) activities implemented under the Africa RISING’ large-scale diffusion of technologies for sorghum and millet systems (ARDT_SMS). It is seen that ARDT_SMS project has produced positive economic returns, with an ERR of 24 percent and an ENPV of USD 14.33 million. The annual income of the millet farmers has increased from 27 to 126 USD/ha. In the sorghum VC the annual income of farmers has increased from 50.0 USD/ha to 115.0 USD/ha. Another important finding of the analysis is that significant fiscal savings due to reduced subsidy on fertilizers can be attributed to the project. The annual fiscal savings for the GoM from reduced subsidy requirement are estimated at 816,011 USD. The PV over project life amounts to 6.8 mill USD. Moreover, positive environmental impacts can be attributed to the project due to the reduced fertilizer consumption
H42|Cost Benefit Analysis of Senegal’s Rice Value Chains|This paper presents the findings of the CBA of Senegal’s rice value chains (looking at rain-fed and irrigated rice specifically). The analysis looks at evaluating the recent Feed the Future (FtF) activities implemented under the PCE (Projet de Croissance Economique) in Senegal. Overall, the analysis points to two important conclusions: 1. The GoS, other donor partners, and the PCE project significantly improved the productivity of the irrigated rice VC over the last five years. From an economic point of view, the benefits of domestic rice production currently outweigh the costs, even with GoS subsidies and donor support. 2. The ERR is only one percent above the discount rate of 12%, emphasizing the importance of a well-defined exit strategy for both the GoS and international donors. The removal of subsidies or the inability of the budget to sustain such significant fiscal outflows may result in adverse effects throughout the VC.
H42|Cost-Benefit Analysis of Rwanda’s Poultry Value Chains|Over the last five years, the government of Rwanda (GoR) has developed a number of successful policies and regulations to address key challenges facing the poultry subsector. As outlined in its poultry subsector strategy for 2012-17, the government aims to establish poultry as the flagship of Rwanda’s livestock industry, with a particular focus on improving production and marketing. The financial and economic analysis of poultry farming activities as well as feed production has revealed that investments into poultry value chain are financially and economically feasible. Financial rate of return ranges from 19 to 53 percent, while economic rate of returns ranges from 30 to 73 percent.
H42|Relative Consumption Preferences and Public Provision of Private Goods|This paper shows that the public provision of private goods may be justified on pure efficiency grounds in an environment where individuals have relative consumption concerns. By providing private goods, governments directly intervene in the consumption structure, and thereby have an instrument to correct for the excessive consumption of positional goods. We identify sufficient conditions when the public provision of private goods is always Pareto-improving, even when (linear) consumption taxes are available. In fact, with the public provision of private goods, there are cases where first-best allocations can be achieved, and a luxury tax on the positional good is redundant.
H42|With Strings Attached: Grandparent-Provided Child Care and Female Labor Market Outcomes|Grandparents are regular providers of free child care. Similar to other forms of child care, availability of grandparent-provided child care has positive effects on fertility and mothers' employment. However, grandparent-provided child care requires residing close to parents or in-laws which may imply spatial restrictions for labor markets. We find that West German mothers who reside close to parents or in-laws have lower wages. We build a model of residence choice, fertility decisions, and female labor force participation that can account for the observed relationships. We simulate our model to analyze how women's decisions would change if the availability of grandparent-provided child care or family policies were altered. If out-of-pocket child care costs were lowered to the Swedish level, fertility, mothers' labor force participation, and geographical mobility would increase. If more households had access to free grandparent-provided child care, fertility and mothers' labor force participation would also increase, but geographical mobility would be reduced.

H42|Public Private Competition|"We examine competition between a private and a public provider in markets for ""merit goods"" such as education, healthcare, housing, recreation, or culture. The private firm provides a high-price/high-quality variety of the good and serves richer individuals, while the public firm provides a low-price/low-quality variety and serves poorer individuals. We derive the private competitor's best response to changes in the public firm's price and quality level. This enables us to examine the distributional effects of government policies aimed at making publicly provided goods more affordable or increase their quality, and of changes to the government budget constraint that make publicly provided goods more expensive or decrease their quality. Our results have implications for the financing of the public supply of such goods, and for whether additional resources, if available, should be spent on reducing the price or enhancing the quality of publicly provided goods."
H42|Determinants and Consequences of Corporate Social Responsibility: Evidence from the Revision of the Company Act in India|India is the first country to introduce mandatory CSR spending for eligible firms, based on the revision of the Companies Act in 2013. In this paper, I explore the effects of the revision of the Companies Act in India on the likelihood of a firm's CSR participation and its profit. It is the first work to investigate the effects of the provision of mandatory CSR. The results show that the revision increased the eligible firms' CSR incurrence by 2.3 percent-age points, compared to ineligible firms. The findings also indicate that the revision is effective to increase the eligible firms' profits by 3.5 percent, compared to the ineligible firms. Therefore, I suggest that profit-maximizing CSR and private provision of public goods through mandatory CSR are valid in India.
H42|Is Uber a substitute or complement for public transit?|How Uber affects public transit ridership is a relevant policy question facing cities worldwide. Theoretically, Uber’s effect on transit is ambiguous: while Uber is an alternative mode of travel, it can also increase the reach and flexibility of public transit’s fixed-route, fixed-schedule service. We estimate the effect of Uber on public transit ridership using a difference-in-differences design that exploits variation across U.S. metropolitan areas in both the intensity of Uber penetration and the timing of Uber entry. We find that Uber is a complement for the average transit agency, increasing ridership by five percent after two years. This average effect masks considerable heterogeneity, with Uber increasing ridership more in larger cities and for smaller transit agencies.
H42|Inequality and Fiscal Redistribution in Mexico|This paper uses income and expenditure surveys from 1992 to 2014 and public tax and spending accounts to estimate the redistributive impact of Mexico’s fiscal system over this period. It presents standard and marginal benefit incidence analysis for the principal public transfers (education, health, social security, direct cash transfers) in 1992-2014, and for the full fiscal system for 2008–14. The paper also estimates the effects of a major recent fiscal reform for the years 2015–18: the transition from large subsidies to taxes on petrol. The analysis shows a continuous improvement in the redistributive effects of the fiscal system through the 1990s and 2000s associated with an increase in social spending and in the progressivity of this spending over this period. This trend stagnated and reversed after 2008/2010, reflecting in part an interruption of the expansive and progressive trend of social transfers, but especially a sharp decline of net indirect subsidies.
H42|Publicly Provided Private Goods and Informal Labor Supply|In this paper we investigate how households time allocations decisions between formal and informal sectors are related to publicly provided goods with and without market substitutes. A simple static public provision model motivates our analysis. Households consume a normal private good and a quasi-private (education) good. Household needs some public utility services to consume the private good and supply labor to formal and informal sectors. Using data from the PNAD (National Household Sample Survey) for the period 2007-2015 we construct indexes of access to three groups of publicly provided goods: (I) basic infrastructure or public utility services, (II) basic education and (III) higher education. Our logit results show a positive effect of access to public education (basic and higher) on the probability of evasion. Differently from public utility services, that affect negatively the probability of evasion, the consumption of these goods present substitute in the private sector. We observe a stronger effect of access to publicly provided basic education comparing with higher education. This result may be related to the different quality of publicly provision of higher and basic education. Tobit results suggest a positive and significant effect only in the case of publicly provided education, i.e., an increase in the access or use of publicly provided education increases the supply of informal labor hours.
H42|Services for Child Care Support as Social Infrastructure: Impact on Birthrate and Migration of Children and Review of Best Practices|A family fs function of taking care of its members by itself has weakened due to the family size becoming smaller and women becoming more active in working outside the home. Moreover, various issues such as the increase in the number of children waiting to be admitted to nursery schools and the decline in the birthrate are being pointed out, especially in urban areas. In view of such situation, this paper focuses on the childcare support programs offered by local governments (municipalities) as social infrastructure for childcare support, and evaluates the effects of these programs quantitatively. The paper also aims to identify and study problems with these programs, which have been clarified through an interview survey. The first part of the paper describes the quantitative evaluation regarding whether or not the local government fs socioeconomic characteristics and their childcare support programs successfully create an environment that encourages people to have children, from two perspectives, i.e. birthrate and migration of children. The evaluation results show that the increased availability of nursery schools induces the migration of people who have children, and that it is important to increase the number of nursery schools in the Tokyo metropolitan area in particular. The second part of the paper discusses the developments and problems within the municipal childcare support programs, which have been made clear through interviews with government-designated cities in the Tokyo metropolitan area. To address the serious shortage of nursery schools, these cities have increased the quantity of childcare services. However, as Japan as a whole has entered the phase of population decrease, the decline in the number of children is unavoidable even in the urban areas, and thus building more nursery schools could result in increasing a negative legacy in the future. Municipalities that implement best practices increase not only tangible facilities such as nursery school buildings but also intangible services in order to make effective use of their resources. Such expansion of intangible infrastructure improves the efficiency in supplying childcare services and supplements the shortage of nursing schools through adjustment or by reducing the mismatch between the supply and demand of nursing schools, thereby making a great contribution to solving the issue of children on waiting lists. These best practices suggest that when municipalities decide on and implement policies for strategic infrastructure development, they should consider how to combine and coordinate tangible and intangible infrastructure resources so that these resources complement each other, and how to ultimately improve the gquantity h and gquality h of childcare services.
H42|La demande d'aide à domicile est-elle sensible au reste-à-charge : une analyse multi-niveaux sur données françaises|This article focuses on the price-elasticity of demand for formal home-care received by disabled elderly. In France a public financing system of long-term care for disabled elderly – aged 60 and over – called APA (Allocation Personnalisée d'Autonomie) has been set up in 2001. This policy is based on a partial subsidization of demand for formal home-care so that an out-of-pocket cost remains. It rests on three variables: the department policy, the provider chosen by the recipient and the income level of the recipient. The induced heterogeneity of the out-of-pocket cost allows price-elasticity estimations but compels me to employ two databases. I use the HSM survey – an individual database on disability and health that is representative of the French population – and the Territoire survey which provides information in each region on the APA policy parameters. The combination of these two databases enables me to approximate the out-of-pocket cost for each individual that is the one-hour formal home-care price. I estimate a multi-level model with random effects and find that the price-elasticity of demand for formal home-care has a value of -0.15 at my average point
H42|Guns, Latrines, and Land Reform: Private Expectations and Public Policy|Dynamically and statically optimal Pigouvian subsidies on durables will differ in a growing economy. For durables with positive externalities, such as sanitation, statically optimal subsidies will typically grow. However, in a dynamic game, governments can most cheaply induce optimal purchasing time by committing to eventually reduce subsidies. If governments cannot commit, there may be multiple, Pareto-ranked equilibria. The presence of multiple subsidizing bodies, including foreign donors, makes commitment more difficult. As a result, consumers may actually delay purchase, rationally anticipating growing subsidies. In the extreme, the benefits of foreign subsidies for durables that create positive externalities may be more than fully offset by such delays in private investment. For durables with negative externalities, such as guns, delays between the announcement and implementation of taxes or regulation may bring forward purchase, potentially causing policymakers who would otherwise prefer such policies to abandon them. Political actors may also be able to shape others’ policy preferences by changing private expectations. For example, a political party that announces an intent to redistribute land may reduce current owners' investment incentives, thus reducing the benefits of maintaining existing property rights and making land reform more attractive to the median voter.
H42|Unsticking the flypaper effect using distortionary taxation|The flypaper effect is a widely-documented puzzle whereby the propensity of subnational governmental units to spend out of unconditional transfers is higher than the propensity to spend out of private income. Building on previous insights in the literature that rationalize this puzzle using costly taxation, we develop a simple optimal fiscal policymodel with distortionary taxation that generates two novel and testable implications: (i) there should be a positive association between the degree of the flypaper effect and the level of the tax rate, and (ii) the flypaper effect should be larger the lower the elasticity of substitution between private and public spending and, in fact, should vanish for very high degrees of substitution. We show that these hypotheses hold for argentinean provinces and brazilian states.
H42|How Much Is That Star in the Window? Professorial Salaries and Research Performance in UK Universities|We study the relationship between academic salaries and research performance. To this end, we use individual level data on the salary of all UK university professors, matched to results on the performance of academic departments from the 2014 government evaluation of research. The UK higher education sector is particularly interesting because professorial salaries are unregulated and the outcome of the official research evaluation of universities is one of their key financial and academic concerns. We first present a simple model of university pay determination, which shows that pay level and pay inequality in a department are positively related to performance. Our empirical results confirm these theoretical predictions; we also find that the pay-performance relationship is weaker for the more established and better paying universities. Our findings are also consistent with the idea that higher salaries have been used by departments to recruit academics more likely to improve their performance.
H42|Making growth more inclusive in Costa Rica|In the past 30 years Costa Rica has grown steadily and social indicators have improved markedly. Well-being indicators are comparable or even above the OECD average in several dimensions, such as health, environment or life-satisfaction. This paper reviews the social progress that Costa Rica has achieved and identifies reducing inequality and poverty as the main challenges. To tackle those challenges, the paper argues that there is a need to upgrade existing social assistance programmes to maximise their impact. Social policies should put more emphasis on getting more people into formal work, including by raising their skill levels. This is the most effective way to get people out of poverty. Education is the area where the largest gap with respect to OECD countries is observed. Policy efforts are also warranted to tackle informality, which is increasing rapidly, and to close the gender gap in the labour market. The health and pension systems play a fundamental role in maintaining social cohesion in Costa Rica and it is crucial to modernise them and to make them sustainable in the face of demographic challenges. Costa Rica exemplifies the benefits of preserving natural resources in generating growth and employment opportunities, thereby providing a way out of poverty. Building on its achievements in this area, Costa Rica should reinforce environmental protection efforts, such as reducing emissions from the transport sector and improving wastewater treatment. Une croissance plus inclusive au Costa Rica Au cours des 30 dernières années, le Costa Rica a connu une croissance soutenue et les indicateurs sociaux se sont améliorés de façon marquée. Les indicateurs de bien-être sont comparables ou même au-dessus de la moyenne de l'OCDE en plusieurs dimensions, comme la santé, l'environnement ou la satisfaction de vivre. Cet article examine le progrès social que le Costa Rica a réussi et identifie la réduction des inégalités et de la pauvreté comme les principaux défis. Pour faire face à ces défis, le document fait valoir qu'il est nécessaire d'améliorer les programmes d'aide sociale existants afin de maximiser leur impact. Les politiques sociales devraient mettre davantage l'accent sur l'obtention de plus de gens dans le travail formel, y compris en augmentant leur niveau de compétence. Ceci est le moyen le plus efficace pour sortir les gens de la pauvreté. L'éducation est la dimension où le plus grand écart par rapport aux pays de l'OCDE est observé. Les efforts politiques sont également nécessaire pour lutter contre l'informalité, qui est de plus en plus haut, et de combler l'écart entre les sexes sur le marché du travail. Les systèmes de santé et de retraite jouent un rôle fondamental pour maintenir la cohésion sociale en Costa Rica et il est crucial de les moderniser et de les rendre durables face aux défis démographiques. Costa Rica illustre les avantages de la préservation des ressources naturelles en générant des opportunités de croissance et d'emploi, fournissant ainsi un moyen de sortir de la pauvreté. Fort de ses réalisations dans ce domaine, le Costa Rica devrait renforcer les efforts de protection de l'environnement, tels que la réduction des émissions du secteur des transports et l'amélioration du traitement des eaux usées.
H42|Efficiency, Welfare, and Political Competition|We study political competition in an environment in which voters have private information about their preferences. Our framework covers models of income taxation, public-goods provision, or publicly provided private goods. Politicians are vote-share maximizers. They can propose any policy that is resource-feasible and incentive-compatible. They can also offer special favors to subsets of the electorate. We prove two main results. First, the unique symmetric equilibrium is such that policies are surplus-maximizing and hence first-best Pareto-efficient. Second, there is a surplus-maximizing policy that wins a majority against any welfare-maximizing policy. Thus, in our model, policies that trade off equity and efficiency considerations are politically infeasible. JEL Codes: C72, D72, D82, H21, H41, H42.
H42|Of Bricks and Bats: New Stadiums, Talent Supply, and Team Performance in Major League Baseball|This article considers whether publicly financed new facility investments encourage professional sports team owners to increase their investments in costly talent. We develop a model of a sports league that incorporates publicly financed facility investments, the unique characteristics of the talent market, and revenue sharing to explore the complementarity between new facility amenities, the team budget decision, and team performance. Our empirical results suggest that publicly financed new stadiums do little to improve team performance, not due to restrictions in the talent market, but rather due to a lack of fan response.
H42|Information provision and consumer behavior: A natural experiment in billing frequency|In this study, I estimate a causal effect of increased billing frequency on consumer behavior. I exploit a natural experiment in which residential water customers switched exogenously from bimonthly to monthly billing. Customers increase consumption by 3.5–5% in response to more frequent information. This result is reconciled in models of price and quantity uncertainty, where increases in billing frequency reduce the distortion in consumer perceptions. Using treatment effects as sufficient statistics, I calculate consumer welfare gains equivalent to 0.5–1% of annual water expenditures. Heterogeneous treatment effects suggest increases in outdoor water use.
H42|Conservation policies: Who responds to price and who responds to prescription?|The efficiency properties of price and nonprice instruments for conservation in environmental policy are well understood. However, there is little evidence comparing the effectiveness of these instruments, especially when considering water resource management. We exploit a rich panel of residential water consumption data to examine heterogeneous responses to both price and nonprice conservation policies during times of drought while controlling for unobservable household characteristics. Our empirical models suggest that among owners of detached, single-family homes in six North Carolina municipalities, relatively low-income households are more sensitive to price and relatively high-consumption households are less sensitive to price. However, prescriptive policies such as restrictions on outdoor water use result in uniform responses across income levels, while simultaneously targeting reductions from households with irrigation systems and historically high consumption.
H42|A Short Note on the Efficacy of Contemporary Public Health Policies in BRICS Nations|This note deals with the efficacy of different public health policies sustained in BRICS nations on public health system of the corresponding economies. In this respect we have framed a comparative analysis among BRICS nations regarding their public health policies in their health care system. Overall, we have found that such policies have been helpful in uplifting the health standard in every nation to some extent but not up to the expectations as per as the health parameters of India and South Africa is concern. A lot remains to be done, discussed here, for which we feel the need of greater co operation among the BRICS countries.
H42|A political-economy perspective on social expenditures: corruption and in-kind versus cash transfers|Abstract This paper presents a novel political-economy perspective on the composition of social expenditures. We take into account the possibility that institutions are weak, i.e. there is corruption, and analyze how this affects the government’s choice between cash and in-kind transfers. Our results show that the share of in-kind transfers (e.g. basic health care, public housing or food stamps), whose appropriation by corrupt politicians is more easily observed than in the case of cash transfers, increases with corruption. This positive relationship exists, however, only in highly democratic countries. We argue that voters use their political influence in democratic countries to ensure that a higher share of transfers is provided in kind thereby shielding transfers from appropriation by corrupt politicians.
H42|Redistribution at the local level: the case of public childcare in Italy|Abstract We study attitude toward redistribution by local policy-makers in the context of public childcare in Italy. Within a substantially homogeneous legislative framework, different municipalities autonomously define how participation fees vary with a compound indicator of income and wealth (ISEE), thus redistributing resources across households using the service. The nearly one hundred municipalities we take into account exhibit wide heterogeneity in redistributive attitudes. We find statistically significant correlations with a number of individual characteristics of policy-makers and municipalities, but not with those of the ex ante distribution of income, which should be central according to both normative and positive theory. Since the price of public childcare is subsidized, resources are also redistributed from taxpayers to users. The evidence we find is consistent with the hypothesis that this type of redistribution is a public good.
H42|“How powerful is demography? The serendipity theorem revisited” comment on De la Croix et al. (2012)|Abstract Samuelson’s (Int Econ Rev 16(3):531-538, 1975) serendipity theorem states that the “goldenest golden rule” steady-state equilibrium can be obtained by a competitive two-period overlapping generation economy with capital accumulation, provided that the optimal growth rate prevails. De la Croix et al. (J Popul Econ 25:899-922, 2012) extended the scope of the theorem by showing that it also holds for risky lifetime. With this note, we introduce medical expenditure as a determinant of the probability of surviving to old age to prove the theorem. The original as well as all extended versions of the serendipity theorem, however, fail to prove that second-order conditions are satisfied in general. Still, unlike De la Croix et al. (J Popul Econ 25:899-922, 2012), we can exclude the existence of corner solutions where the probability of reaching old age is zero or one. The zero survival probability case becomes irrelevant if the option to randomize between death and life utility is taken into account. Survival with certainty is ruled out if the marginal cost of survival is increasing. Hence, the optimal survival probability represents an interior solution. Furthermore, we show for the optimal survival probability that the value of a statistical life is positive and equal to its marginal cost.
H42|Inequality, opting-out and public education funding|Abstract We investigate the effect of inequality on the political support for public education funding in a model of endogenous fertility and school choice. In contrast to recent literature we show that when household income heterogeneity is consistent with the skewness of empirical income distributions, inequality can drive education spending in opposite directions in poor and rich economies. A mean preserving spread increases tax rates and public school enrollment, but decreases public spending per student in low income economies, while it has opposite effects at high income levels. An increase in the average income level can also have non-monotonic effects.
H42|Öffentliche Wohnraumförderung — auf dem richtigen Weg?<BR>[Social Housing Promotion — On the Right Track?]|Zusammenfassung Die hohen Flüchtlingszahlen und die wachsende Nachfrage nach Wohnungen in den Ballungsräumen haben die Politik veranlaßst, die lange vernachläßsigte öffentliche Wohnraumförderung wieder in den Blick zu nehmen. Um rasch neuen Wohnraum anzubieten, schlagen die Autoren unterschiedliche Maßnahmen vor. Dabei kommt es darauf an, sie effizient auf die Zielgruppe zuzuschneiden. Welche Gewichtung die Objekt- und die Subjektförderung dabei haben sollte, wird unterschiedlich bewertet. Genossenschaften sollten in dem Maßnahmenbündel nicht vergessen werden.
H42|Progressive universalism? The impact of targeted coverage on health care access and expenditures in Peru|Like other countries seeking a progressive path to universalism, Peru has attempted to reduce inequalities in access to health care by granting the poor entitlement to taxâ€ financed basic care without charge. We identify the impact of this policy by comparing the target population's change in health care utilization with that of poor adults already covered through employmentâ€ based insurance. There are positive effects on receipt of ambulatory care and medication that are largest among the elderly and the poorest. The probability of getting formal health care when sick is increased by almost two fifths, but the likelihood of being unable to afford treatment is reduced by more than a quarter. Consistent with the shallow coverage offered, there is no impact on use of inpatient care. Neither is there any effect on average outâ€ ofâ€ pocket health care expenditure, but medical spending is reduced by up to 25% in the top quarter of the distribution.

H42|What Is the Case for Paid Maternity Leave?|We assess the case for generous government-funded maternity leave, focusing on a series of policy reforms in Norway that expanded paid leave from 18 to 35 weeks. We find the reforms do not crowd out unpaid leave and that mothers spend more time at home without a reduction in family income. The increased maternity leave has little effect on children's schooling, parental earnings and labor force participation, completed fertility, marriage, or divorce. The expansions, whose net costs amounted to 0.25% of GDP, have negative redistribution properties and imply a considerable increases in taxes at a cost to economic efficiency.
H42|Effect of Lengthening the School Day on Mother's Labor Supply|This article examines how a policy oriented toward a specific group within the population can have collateral effects on the economic decisions of other groups. In 1996, the Chilean government approved the extension of the school day from half- to full-day school. This article exploits the quasi-experimental nature of the reform's implementation by time, municipality, and age targeting of the program in order to examine how the maternal labor supply is affected by the childcare subsidy implicit in the lengthening of the school day. Using data from the Chilean socioeconomic household survey and administrative data from the Ministry of Education for 1990–2011, we estimate that, on average, there is a 5 percent increase in labor participation and employment rates of single mothers with eligible children (between 8 and 13 years old) with no younger children, who are the group that would be mainly affected by the policy.

H42|How do Hospitals Respond to Price Changes? Evidence from Norway| Many publicly funded health systems use activity‐based financing to increase hospital production and efficiency. The aim of this study is to investigate whether price changes for different treatments affect the number of patients treated and the mix of activity provided by hospitals. We exploit the variations in prices created by the changes in the national average treatment cost per diagnosis‐related group (DRG) offered to Norwegian hospitals over a period of 5 years (2003–2007). We use the data from Norwegian Patient Register, containing individual‐level information on age, gender, type of treatment, diagnosis, number of co‐morbidities and the national average treatment costs per DRG. We employ fixed‐effect models to examine the changes in the number of patients treated within the DRGs over time. The results suggest that a 10% increase in price leads to about 0.8–1.3% increase in the number of patients treated for DRGs, which are medical (for both emergency and elective patients). In contrast, we find no price effect for DRGs that are surgical (for both emergency and elective patients). Moreover, we find evidence of upcoding. A 10% increase in the ratio of prices between patients with and without complications increases the proportion of patients coded with complications by 0.3–0.4 percentage points.

H42|Relative consumption preferences and public provision of private goods|This paper shows that the public provision of private goods may be justified on pure efficiency grounds in an environment where individuals have relative consumption concerns. By providing private goods, governments directly intervene in the consumption structure, and thereby have an instrument to correct for the excessive consumption of positional goods. We identify sufficient conditions when the public provision of private goods is always Pareto-improving, even when (linear) consumption taxes are available. In fact, with the public provision of private goods, there are cases where first-best allocations can be achieved, and a luxury tax on the positional good is redundant.
H42|Quality and Accountability in Health Care Delivery: Audit-Study Evidence from Primary Care in India|We present unique audit-study evidence on health care quality in rural India, and find that most private providers lacked medical qualifications, but completed more checklist items than public providers and recommended correct treatments equally often. Among doctors with public and private practices, all quality metrics were higher in their private clinics. Market prices are positively correlated with checklist completion and correct treatment, but also with unnecessary treatments. However, public sector salaries are uncorrelated with quality. A simple model helps interpret our findings: Where public-sector effort is low, the benefits of higher diagnostic effort among private providers may outweigh costs of potential overtreatment.
H42|Ride Your Luck!A Field Experiment on Lotterybased Incentives for Compliance|We designed a natural-field experiment in the context of local public transportation to test whether rewards in the form of lottery prizes coupled with traditional sanctions effciently reduce free-riding. We organized a lottery in a medium-size Italian city the participation in which is linked to purchasing an on-board bus ticket. The lottery was then implemented in half of otherwise identical buses operating in the municipality. Our theoretical model shows that the introduction of the lottery generated an increase in the number of tickets sold and that it is possible to design a self-financing lottery. To estimate the effect of the lottery's introduction on the amount of tickets sold, we matched and compared treated and control buses operating on the same day on the exact same route. The results show that buses participating in the lottery sold significantly more tickets than the control buses. The increase in revenue from the tickets sold was more than the lottery prize amount.
H42|Particularities Companies With Locally Activity|In our view, companies operating locally engine should be both balanced territorial development, and sustainable development. In this regard, our research focused on finding mechanisms, means, techniques, methods by which financial side asymmetry territorial development plan can be reduced, consistent with the objectives of sustainable development at national and regional level. In our country, just administrative doctrine is the biggest obstacle to territorial development plan of these types of companies. Although there is a favourable legal framework that allows private provision in the form of public services, there are many cases when they are made by local government, but at a level determined predominantly by sources and appropriate level of financial resources. An alternative to the current state is the economic development zone, a concept proposed by us and trying to solve problems of interconnecting various locations (sized entities with different socio-economic structures) but which have in common a particular purpose. Public - private partnership thus becomes another dimension, the territorial level, the ultimate goal of meeting the needs of the population in the area.
H42|The stimulative effect of an unconditional block grant on the decentralized provision of care|Understanding the impact of central government grants on decentralized health care provision is of crucial importance for the design of grant systems, yet empirical evidence on the prevalence of flypaper effects in this domain is rare. We study the decentralization of home care in the Netherlands and exploit the gradual introduction of formula-based equalization to identify the effect of exogenous changes in an unconditional block grant on local expenditure and utilization. A one euro increase in central government grants raises local expenditure by fifty cents, while adjustments occur through the number of hours as well as through substitution between basic and more advanced types of assistance. These findings suggest that conditioning of grants is not required for the central government to retain some control over the decentralized provision of care.
H42|Urban Sprawl and the Public Provision of Fire Suppression|Population growth in the wildland urban interface (WUI) has put a greater number of houses at risk due to wildfire while often straining the resources of fire suppression agencies and contributing to a dramatic increase in wildfire suppression expenditures. In light of these facts, this paper analyzes the consequences of the public provision of fire suppression in a monocentric city where wildfire risk is endogenously determined through the choice of where to live. Public provision leads to increased development in the WUI, higher suppression costs, and an overall decrease in welfare. Differentiated taxes based on fire risk could reduce sprawl, improve welfare and lower suppression costs.
H42|How Much Is That Star in the Window? Professorial Salaries and Research Performance in UK Universities|Using individual level data on the salary of all UK university professors, matched to results on the performance of academic departments from the 2014 Research Excellence Framework, we study the relationship between academic salaries and research performance. The UK higher education sector is particularly interesting because professorial salaries are unregulated and the outcome of the official research evaluation is a key financial concern of universities. To frame our analysis, we present a simple model of university pay determination, which shows that pay level and pay inequality in a department are positively related to performance. Our empirical results confirm these theoretical predictions; we also find that the pay-performance relationship is weaker for the more established and better paying universities. Our findings are also consistent with the idea that higher salaries have been used by departments to recruit academics more likely to improve their performance.
H42|Boyas, faros y la provisión voluntaria de bienes públicos|The debate over lighthouses has become a central feature of economic theory, since it addresses what kind of institutional setting may be able to supply services characterized by limitations to exclude non-payers and the potential of free riding conducts. In a seminal work Ronald Coase reported on the history of lighthouse provision in England and stressed the role of private investors and private funding for their building and operation. A debate ensued on whether this could be qualified as “private” considering they were financed through “light dues” of a coercive nature. Van Zandt afterwards classifies the different institutional settings in five categories ranging from total private provision and financing to complete government supply. He and other authors claimed there are no historical cases of private provision or financing with only government enforcement of property and contract rights. This article shows one such case presently working in the northern coast of the River Plate, in northern Buenos Aires. Its existence raises new issues to be considered.
H42|Small price incentives increase women's access to land titles in Tanzania|We present results from a field experiment using price incentives to address two obstacles to women's access to formal land ownership. First, the price of formal land titles is often prohibitive, restricting access for both men and women. Second, when formal titles are issued, men are recorded as the sole owners of household land in the vast majority of cases. In theory, these problems may be in tension: requirements to grant women equal ownership may reduce the overall household demand for titling. In practice, we find no such trade-off: when residents of low-income, unplanned settlements in Dar es Salaam were offered price discounts for formal land titles, demand rose significantly. Price elasticity of demand was unchanged when price discounts were conditional on registering a woman as (co-)owner of household land. Furthermore, conditional price discounts achieved near gender parity in land ownership.
H42|Religious identity and the provision of public goods: Evidence from the Indian Princely States|This paper describes a simple model of how a ruler’s religious identity affects public goods provision. Our primary insight is that rulers reduce public goods expenditures to a greater degree when there are privately-provided substitutes excludable by religion.The basic idea is that if the good is provided privately to the ruler’s co-religionists, the ruler faces weaker incentives to provide this public good because his co-religionists receive lower marginal utility from its provision. Testing such a conjecture is an empirical challenge, however, since the religious identity of rulers rarely varies over time and place. We address this problem by exploiting variation in the religion of rulers in the Indian Princely States. Using data from the 1911 and 1931 Indian censuses, we find that Muslim-ruled states had lower Hindu literacy but had no significant impact on Muslim literacy. This result is consistent with our model, as Muslim religious schools provided a substitute for public schools that served both Hindus and Muslims. The model is further substantiated by the fact that the religion of the ruler had no statistically significant impact on railroad ownership or post office provision, neither of which had privately-provided substitutes.
H42|Optimal dynamic tax evasion: A portfolio approach|Most tax evasion models are set in a timeless environment, though this is not suitable for a study of revenues from financial activities where tax evasion occurs in a dynamic environment. This study examines a representative agent aiming to maximize the expected utility from inter-temporal consumption and could invest in both riskless and risky assets, through tax evasion is possible only in the latter case. The investor must pay a fine when his/her evasion is detected (with a given probability). We show that: (i) optimal consumption is higher with tax evasion, (ii) optimal evasion is affected by neither the return nor the volatility of the risky asset, (iii) evasion reduces investment in the risky asset and increases investment in the riskless asset, (iv) evasion can be reduced more efficiently by increasing the fine rather than by increasing the frequency of controls, (v) for a sufficiently high tax rate on the riskless asset, the optimal evasion is zero, and (vi) if the fine is proportional to the amount of taxes, for only sufficiently low fines the Yitzhaki (1974) paradox is confirmed.
H42|Gender bias in public long-term care? A survey experiment among care managers|Daughters of elderly women are more likely to provide informal care than sons. If care managers take this into account and view informal care as a substitute for formal care, they will statistically discriminate against the mothers of daughters. Using a survey experiment among professional needs assessors for long-term care services in Norway, we find that if a woman with a daughter had a son instead, she would receive 34 percent more formal care. On the other hand, daughters do not provide more care for fathers. Correspondingly, we find no effect of child gender for fathers in the experiment.
H42|Should I stay or should I go? Exit options within mixed systems of public and private health care finance|Mixed public–private finance is widespread in health care systems internationally. In one variant of mixed finance, some countries (e.g., Germany) allow eligible beneficiaries to fully exit from the public (social insurance) system and purchase private insurance. Using a controlled laboratory experiment, we empirically investigate the predictions of a political economy model of mixed systems of public and private finance with two types of exit: universal-exit, when all individuals can choose to exit the public system, and conditional-exit, when only individuals with an income at or above a threshold income level can choose to exit. We find that high-income individuals are less likely to exit under universal-exit than under conditional-exit, despite having the same incentive to exit in both treatments. Sensitivity treatments suggests that a number of factors may be at play in explaining this result, including learning effects, a priming effect and a framing effect, but that other-regarding preferences do not appear to be an important factor.
H42|Tradeoffs in the design of health plan payment systems: Fit, power and balance|In many markets, including the new U.S. Marketplaces, health insurance plans are paid by risk-adjusted capitation, sometimes combined with reinsurance and other payment mechanisms. This paper proposes a framework for evaluating the de facto insurer incentives embedded in these complex payment systems. We discuss fit, power and balance, each of which addresses a distinct market failure in health insurance. We implement empirical metrics of fit, power, and balance in a study of Marketplace payment systems. Using data similar to that used to develop the Marketplace risk adjustment scheme, we quantify tradeoffs among the three classes of incentives. We show that an essential tradeoff arises between the goals of limiting costs and limiting cream skimming because risk adjustment, which is aimed at discouraging cream-skimming, weakens cost control incentives in practice. A simple reinsurance system scores better on our measures of fit, power and balance than the risk adjustment scheme in use in the Marketplaces.
H42|A quantitative analysis of Turkish Private Education Reform|A recent education policy Turkish government is wishing to undertake is to shut down all private supplementary education centers (SECs) unless SECs manage to convert into a private school. With this policy, the government is willing to increase equality of opportunity among students. We show quantitatively that the policy, in fact, leads to a decrease in equality of opportunity since SECs are given the option to convert into private schools. We use a political economy model of education at which households, heterogeneous with respect to exogenously set income, choose among a continuum of private schools differentiated by tuition and a public school. Households choosing the public school can privately supplement their child's education spending in any amount. Public school is free of charge, and its spending is financed by income tax revenue collected from all households. Income tax rate is determined by majority voting. Achievement of a child depends only on educational spending. We calibrate the model's parameters by matching certain targets from 2013 Turkish data. We then exogenously restrict the supplemental education spending to zero in a counterfactual experiment. We find that variance of achievement (or inequality of opportunity) increases by 23.51% and mean achievement decreases by 1.74%.
H42|Optimal commodity taxation with varying quality of goods|A standard result in the optimal taxation literature is that when agents differ in market ability and the government aims at redistributing from high- to low-skilled agents by means of an optimal nonlinear labor income tax and a set of commodity taxes, an optimally designed commodity tax structure should encourage (discourage) the consumption of goods/services that are complement with labor (leisure). In this paper we highlight that when agents can choose both the quality and the quantity of a given good/service, this standard commodity tax result needs to be qualified. First, we show that it becomes relevant to distinguish between specific and ad valorem taxes/subsidies. Second, whether the standard result holds or not depends on how the concept of labor (leisure) complement is defined, namely, whether it is defined in terms of number of units or in terms of expenditure. We also show that levying specific and ad valorem taxes at opposite signs on a given good can be a feature of the second-best optimum.
H42|Social network structure and government provision crowding-out on voluntary contributions|We propose a general equilibrium model of voluntary contributions in which people have an individual-specific level for social approval. This heterogeneous setting has evolved from the different degree of social interaction of individuals in the exogenously given network. By extending the techniques developed by Ghiglino and Goyal (2010), we show that, given a network, individuals who face higher standards of social norms contribute more to the public good and are simultaneously less sensitive to government provision crowding-out in relative value. When comparing different networks, we show that government provision is more effective in networks with higher average connectivity because of a lesser crowding-out effect.
H42|The time dimension of parking economics|A model of demand for parking, evolving over time, is proposed. The model features both extensive (whether to park) and intensive (for how long to park) margins of parking demand, allows multidimensional heterogeneity of parkers, and evolution of demand throughout the day. I show that the optimal price for parking is proportional to the rate of arrival of new parkers and is inversely related to the square of the occupancy rate, which is different from previously discussed pricing methods. I show that the primary purpose of pricing is to regulate departures, rather than arrivals, of parkers. I also find that asymmetric information about parkers’ characteristics does not prevent the parking authority from achieving the social optimum. A numerical example compares the optimal policy against the alternatives.
H42|The organisation of services of general interest in Finland|Like in most European countries, SGIs in Finland have in recent years been subject to competition and increased private provision or privatisation. This development is motivated by expected cost reductions, by EU-regulations, by ideology and fashion, and in some cases by expected sales revenues. The empirical evaluations of SGI-reforms are few and somewhat contradictory, but the relative success of Finland’s manufacturing SOEs suggests that the public sector is hardly unable to organise efficient SGIs. A number of potential market failures suggest that public ownership should be taken seriously as an alternative to regulation. An increased emphasis on public ownership would be fairly easy to implement in Finland, because the state is still a significant owner, but EU’s policy on liberalisation and unbundling needs an overhaul.
H42|Financial performance of major public enterprises in Croatia from 2006 to 2014|The aim of this paper is to present basic characteristics of state-owned enterprises in Croatia, assess their financial operations and identify major trends in their operations and long-term development prospects. The analysis is carried out for the period from 2009 to 2014. The paper gradually examines financial operations, management system and the systems of accountability and transparency in state owned enterprises. The particular emphasis is on the comparative overview of major state-owned enterprises’ missions and the extent to which they serve public purposes. Moreover, the paper evaluates capital investment plans and provides proposals for the reform of state-owned enterprises in Croatia. In all state-owned enterprises, a serious organizational restructuring - adjustment of the organizational structure and number of employees is still expected.
H42|The Effect of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansions on Financial Wellbeing|We examine the effect of the Medicaid expansions under the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) on consumer financial outcomes using data from a major credit reporting agency for a large, national sample of adults. We employ the synthetic control method to compare individuals living in states that expanded Medicaid to those that did not. We find that the Medicaid expansions significantly reduced the number of unpaid bills and the amount of debt sent to third-party collection agencies among those residing in zip codes with the highest share of low-income, uninsured individuals. Our estimates imply a reduction in collection balances of approximately $1,140 among those who gain Medicaid coverage due to the ACA. Our findings suggest that the ACA Medicaid expansions had important financial impacts beyond health care use.

H42|Acute admissions to a community hospital: a descriptive cost study|Introduction: In several countries, health-care providers are searching for alternatives to hospitalization. In recent years, a practice has been established in Hallingdal, a rural region in Norway, in which patients with certain acute somatic illnesses are admitted to Hallingdal Sjukestugu (HSS), a community hospital 150 km from the nearest general hospital, Ringerike Sykehus (RS). A randomized, controlled study was carried out to compare health consequences, patient-perceived quality and health-care costs between patients acutely admitted to HSS and to RS. This paper discusses the topic of health-care costs. Methods: Patients intended for acute admission to HSS, as an alternative to hospitalization, were included in the study. Eligible patients were randomized to two groups; admitted to HSS (n = 33), and admitted to RS (n = 27). Costs were compared between the two groups at discharge and for the 12-month follow-up. Results: The cost of the inpatient stay at HSS was significantly lower than the cost at RS, which is explained by lower transport costs (p
H42|Do Non-Monetary Prices Target the Poor?: Evidence from a Field Experiment in India|This paper uses willingness to pay (WTP) data from a field experiment in Hyderabad, India in 2013 to determine whether non-monetary prices better target health products to the poor than monetary prices. Monetary WTP is increasing in income and non-monetary WTP is weakly decreasing in income. Household fixed effects in a pooled sample of monetary WTP and non-monetary WTP are used to compare the correlation of income and WTP across price types. It is found that non-monetary WTP falls relative to monetary WTP as income rises. Finally, a greater fraction of demand is comprised of the poor at non-monetary prices.
H42|Governmental Provision of Public Goods Need Not Crowd Out Private Provision|Consider the private provision of a public good, where consumption of the public good requires an individual to spend time. We show that gov- ernmental provision of the public good financed by a labor tax reduces the incentive to work, increases the time available to an individual to consume the public good, and so increases the marginal utility to the individual of the public good. That in turn means that, in contrast to standard mod- els, governmental provision need not fully crowd out private provision. Instead, increased governmental provision can lead to an increase in the sum of private and governmental provision.
H42|Income contingent loans in higher education financing|Around nine countries currently use a national income contingent loan (ICL) scheme for higher education tuition using the income tax system. Increased international interest in ICL validates an examination of its costs and benefits relative to the traditional financing system, government-guaranteed bank loans (GGBLs). Bank-type loans exhibit poor economic characteristics: namely, repayment hardships for the disadvantaged, and default. This damages credit reputations and can be associated with high taxpayer subsidies. ICLs avoid these problems, but effective collection of debt requires a sophisticated mechanism.
H42|Does The Aca’S Medicaid Expansion Improve Health?|We estimate the effects of the ACA’s Medicaid expansion on health outcomes with a difference-in-differences approach, using restricted geotagged NHANES data from 2007 to 2014. Our results show that the partial Medicaid expansion in 2014 is significantly associated with a decrease of 8.465 mg / dL (4.3%) in total cholesterol and decrease of 5.569 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (4.7%). These are both likely the result of an increase in the use of cholesterol lowering medications, which can affect both of these measures, as there is no corresponding increase in the use of blood pressure medication. Contrastingly, we find no statistically significant effects for diabetes prescriptions or measures.
H42|Common labor market, attachment and spillovers in a large metropolis|Abstract In this paper, we extend the home-attachment model to a setting with multiple (more than two) jurisdictions and consider non-cooperative policy making for provision of different types of metropolitan public goods in the presence of a common labor market. Migration and working place choices are independent. We show that the optimal redistributive policy implemented by a central authority always yields equalization of private consumption levels across jurisdictions. This result holds whether or not policy makers are able to anticipate migration responses to their policy choices. In the decentralized leadership games, jurisdictions make choices that fully internalize externalities.
H42|Cournot–Bertrand comparison in a mixed oligopoly|We revisit the classic discussion comparing price and quantity competition, but in a mixed oligopoly in which one state-owned public firm competes against private firms. It has been shown that in a mixed duopoly, price competition yields a larger profit for the private firm. This implies that firms face weaker competition under price competition, which contrasts sharply with the case of a private oligopoly. Here, we adopt a standard differentiated oligopoly with a linear demand. We find that regardless of the number of firms, price competition yields higher welfare. However, the profit ranking depends on the number of private firms. We find that if the number of private firms is greater than or equal to five, it is possible that quantity competition yields a larger profit for each private firm. We also endogenize the price-quantity choice. Here, we find that Bertrand competition can fail to be an equilibrium, unless there is only one private firm. Copyright Springer-Verlag Wien 2016
H42|Dynamic tax evasion with audits based on visible consumption|Abstract We solve the problem of a representative agent who maximises the expected present utility of his intertemporal consumption under the assumption that an optimal fraction of his wealth is hidden to the tax authorities (we show conditions under which evasion is expedient). Evasion affects the capital dynamics in two ways: the growth rate of capital increases because some taxes are not paid, but when caught evading the consumer has to pay a fine (proportional to evasion). Consumption can be allocated between ordinary goods and so-called visible goods. The latter are used by the Government for targeting the audit, since they are considered like an indicator of consumer’s income. In fact, the probability of being caught is a function of the distance between the actual and the presumed consumption in visible goods. We find a closed form solution to the dynamic optimization problem and show how fiscal and audit parameters affect the optimal evasion and the optimal allocation between the two types of consumptions.
H42|Has Farming Connect made an economic impact on the Welsh agricultural sector?| Demonstrating the impact of Knowledge Transfer activities and advisory services aimed at farmers is important to justify their use in the achievement of policy goals and in the spending of public funds. Experience gained in evaluating Farming Connect in Wales, the programme delivering these services using a wide range of activities, is drawn on to illustrate issues faced in detecting economic impacts at farm and sector levels, in particular in establishing the counterfactual. The various methodological tools employed are compared, including the common but 'naïve' approach of asking farmers about impacts on their business, and the 'quasi-experimental' one of comparing samples of beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. Rather different results are obtained (farmer responses suggesting a far greater level of impact) and reasons for these are sought. Lessons have been learned that need to be taken into account in the future design of monitoring and evaluation and for the selection of the types of activities that receive public support.
H42|Las transferencias agrarias en México y su efecto en el sector agropecuario| Este trabajo examina el impacto de las transferencias agrarias (TA) sobre el desempeño del sector agropecuario medido a través del valor agregado agrario por trabajador (VA). Las TA se diferenciaron por tipo de bienes y de acuerdo a su finalidad. Se utilizaron series de datos del periodo de 1986 a 2010 en dos modelos semi-logarítmicos. Los resultados indican que las TA en Bienes Públicos son las más eficaces, por cada peso invertido en este rubro, el VA creció 1.6 %; por su finalidad, la inversión en bienes de Fomento Productivo Indirecto registró el mayor impacto, por cada peso gastado el VA crece 7.6 %.
H42|Modeling Indian Wheat and Rice Sector Policies| This paper serves to disentangle the complex system of Indian food policies, related to wheat and rice procurement, storage, distribution and trade. Using time series for national aggregate data, these policies are econometrically analyzed, next their implications for the markets are assessed and finally their fiscal costs are estimated. The study revealed strong impact of the policy measures on the production, procurement, stocks and trade. We detected several market distortions and mounting fiscal costs. Wheat and rice supply strongly and significantly responds to the minimum support price (MSP). Wholesale prices at planting or lagged harvest time prices are largely irrelevant for the production. The Food Cooperation of India’s (FCI) procurement volume is driven by the production level and the difference between the MSP and the market price. The signs of the estimated price elasticities of demand are consistent with the theory, however for rice they turned out to be insignificant. The negative income elasticity of rice consumption as well as the downward trend in rice consumption suggest changing habits and the inferior character of rice as a consumption good. The public stock analysis suggests higher storage losses for rice (10%) than for wheat (2%). Strong crowding out effects of the public stocks on private stocks and negative impact of export restrictions on private ending stocks was found. Total exports are highly distorted by the trade regulations, which whipped out the trade response to the price incentives. Starting from 2006/07, there is a clear upward trend in inflation adjusted costs of operating the public food procurement and distribution system, coming mostly from the rising procurement volume and the MSP. On the other hand, the revenues have declined in real terms, due to lower real central issue prices and only marginal revenues from the domestic sales and exports. As a result, the food subsidy has shown a permanent growth in real terms. The seasonal analysis of the intra-year data revealed strong seasonality of prices and procurement and stock levels, in particular for wheat (less for rice).
H42|A Normative Analysis of Local Public Utilities: Investments in Water Networks|We analyze rehabilitation investments in a regulated water industry with perfectly inelastic demand. We compare alternative organizational solutions for local provision (municipalization, corporatization and privatization), though subject to a common regulatory mechanism. We can then assess the effects of incentive regulation in public firms and find that even benvolent politicians always stick to the price-cap, in order to save on distortionary taxation. However, incentives to invest result to be excessive only in private firms, as the cost of capital is accounted differently by public and private undertakings. We also provide a theory of mixed firms, based on strategic interaction between politicians and managers, which contributes to endogenously explain partial privatization and minority participation by private stockholders. In this last case incentives to invest appear to be driven just by governance and ownership reasons.
H42|Mind the Gap: Crowdfunding and the Role of Seed Money| We analyze voluntary private contributions to public goods and the role seed money plays in signaling the public good's quality to potential subsequent contributors. We present a theoretical model and analyze two sets of naturally occurring data from crowdfunding platforms. After developing the theoretical background, we find statistically significant switch points that distinguish between seed contributions and subsequent contributions. A positive change in contribution behavior after the switch suggests an increase in the perceived value of the public good. We find that the signal comprises the number of contributors and the average contribution (as a proportion of the targeted goal). Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
H42|Within-Mother Estimates Of The Effects Of Wic On Birth Outcomes In New York City|" type=""main"" xml:id=""ecin12219-abs-0001""> There is a large literature suggesting that “WIC works” to improve birth outcomes. However, methodological limitations related to selection into the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program have left room for doubt about this conclusion. This article uses birth records from New York City to address some limitations of the previous literature. We estimate models with mother fixed effects to control for fixed characteristics of mothers and we directly investigate the way that time-varying characteristics of mothers affect selection into the WIC program. We find that WIC is associated with reductions in low birth weight, even among full-term infants, and with reductions in the probability that a child is “small for dates.” These improvements are associated with a reduction in the probability that the mother gained too little weight during pregnancy. Improvements tend to be largest for first born children. We also find that women on WIC are more likely to be diagnosed with chronic conditions, and receive more intensive medical services, a finding that may reflect improved access to medical care.

H42|A Model of Tradeable Capital Tax Permits| Standard models of horizontal capital tax competition predict that, in a Nash equilibrium, states set tax rates inefficiently due to externalities—capital inflow to one state corresponds to capital outflow for another state. Researchers often suggest that the federal government impose Pigouvian taxes to correct for these effects and achieve efficiency. We propose an alternative incentive-based regulation: tradeable capital tax permits. Under this system, the federal government would require a state to hold a permit if it wanted to reduce its capital income tax rate from some predefined benchmark. These permits would be tradeable across states. We show that, if the federal government sets the correct number of total permits, then social efficiency is achieved. We discuss the advantages of this system relative to the canonical suggestion of Pigouvian taxes.
H42|Tax competition and the efficiency of “benefit-related” business taxes|Abstract We construct a tax competition model in which local governments finance business public services with either a source-based tax on mobile capital, such as a property tax, or a tax on production, such as an origin-based value-added tax, and then assess which of the two tax instruments is more efficient. Many taxes on business apply to mobile inputs or outputs, such as property taxes, retail sales taxes, and destination-based VATs, and their inefficiency has been examined in the literature; however, proposals from several prominent tax experts to utilize a local origin-based VAT have not been analyzed theoretically. Our primary finding is that the production tax is less inefficient than the capital tax under many—but not all—conditions. The intuition underlying this result is that the efficiency of a user fee on the public business input is roughly approximated by a production tax, which applies to both the public input and immobile labor (in addition to mobile capital). In marked contrast, the capital tax applies only to mobile capital and is thus likely to be relatively inefficient.
H42|The Privateness of Public Expenditure with Application to Indian States|Governments provide private goods as well as public services. We present a model of the private good - public good mix in public expenditure, and then apply it to explain the composition of spending by Indian state governments. The model explains why the publically provided private good to public good ratio is a decreasing function of the real income of voters, and is also decreasing in the degree of political competition. These hypotheses are tested on a panel of 14 Indian states for fiscal years 1987/88 to 2011/12. The long run results of three alternative ARDL models are broadly consistent with the proposed hypotheses, particularly the relationship between the private good share of state expenditures and real per capita incomes. They suggest that rising incomes and more effective political competition work together to improve a state’s policy mix and, in this sense, economic development becomes at least partially endogenous.
H42|Federal Reinsurance for Terrorism Risk in 2015 and Beyond: Working Paper 2015-04|CBO analyzed a variety of options for federal insurance against the risk of terrorism before the program was reauthorized in January 2015. This paper examines in more detail some options that might be considered in the future.

Además, se hacen sugerencias de política para una organización adecuada del sistema de aseo.
H42|Moving to Opportunity or Isolation? Network Effects of a Randomized Housing Lottery in Urban India|A housing lottery in an Indian city provided winning slum dwellers the opportunity to move into improved housing on the city's periphery. Fourteen years later, winners report improved housing but no change in tenure security, family income, or human capital. Winners also report increased isolation from family and caste networks and reduced informal insurance. We observe significant program exit: 34 percent of winners never took up subsidized housing and 32 percent eventually exited. Our results suggest negligible long-run economic value of this expensive public program and point to the importance of considering social networks in housing programs for the poor.
H42|The Organisation of Services of General Interest in Finland|Like in most other European countries, services of general interest in Finland have in recent years been subject to competition, increased private provision, and in some cases privatisation. This development is motivated by expected cost reductions, by EUregulations, by ideology and fashion, and in some cases also by a desire to generate sales revenues. Empirical evaluations have provided mixed results, but the relatively successful history of Finland’s state enterprises makes it hard to believe that the public sector would be unable to organise SGI-services efficiently. A number of potential market failures suggest that renationalisation should be taken seriously as an alternative to regulation. This would not necessarily be a very radical policy, because public ownership is still fairly prominent among SGIs in Finland
H42|The publication of school rankings: A step toward increased accountability?|This paper contributes to the discussion of the effects of the publication of school rankings based on students’ scores on national exams. We study the effectiveness of this (low-stakes) accountability mechanism. Our results suggest that the publication of rankings has clear effects upon families and schools in Portugal. After the rankings publication, fewer students enroll in schools that are rated poorly and the probability of closure of these schools increases. These effects are stronger for private schools.
H42|Heterogeneous preferences and in-kind redistribution: Theory and evidence|This paper examines the impact of social heterogeneity on in-kind redistribution. We contribute to the previous literature in two ways: we consider (i) the provision of several public goods and (ii) agents different not only in income, but also in their preferences over the various goods provided by the public sector. In this setting, both the distribution and size of goods provision depend on the heterogeneity of preferences. Our main result is that preference heterogeneity tends to decrease in-kind redistribution, while income inequality tends to increase it. An empirical investigation based on United States Census Bureau data confirms these theoretical findings.
H42|Competition, gatekeeping, and health care access|We study gatekeeping physicians’ referrals of patients to specialty care. We derive theoretical results when competition in the physician market intensifies. First, due to competitive pressure, physicians refer patients to specialty care more often. Second, physicians earn more by treating patients themselves, so refer patients to specialty care less often. We assess empirically the overall effect of competition with data from a 2008–2009 Norwegian survey, National Health Insurance Administration, and Statistics Norway. From the data we construct three measures of competition: the number of open primary physician practices with and without population adjustment, and the Herfindahl–Hirschman index. The empirical results suggest that competition has negligible or small positive effects on referrals overall. Our results do not support the policy claim that increasing the number of primary care physicians reduces secondary care.
H42|Full-time universal childcare in a context of low maternal employment: Quasi-experimental evidence from Spain|Using a natural experiment framework, we study the effects of offering full-time public childcare for 3-year-olds in a context of low female labor force participation and insufficient infrastructure of childcare slots. We find that two mothers entered employment for every ten additional children enrolled in public childcare. The effect is driven by mothers 30years old and older and those with two children or more. While our estimates compare to those found earlier, they cannot be explained by a crowding out of alternative childcare modes. Nonetheless, as the reform was implemented in a period of low labor demand in Spain, our estimates may not be as modest at they appear at first sight.
H42|Canadian evidence on ten years of universal preschool policies: The good and the bad|More than ten years ago, to increase mothers’ participation in the labour market and to enhance child development, the province of Québec implemented a $5 per day universal childcare policy. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the impact of the program over more than 10years after its implementation. A nonexperimental evaluation framework based on multiple pre- and posttreatment periods is used to estimate the policy effects. We find that the reform had important and lasting effects on the number of children aged 1–4years old attending childcare and the numbers of hours they spend in daycare. For children aged 5years old, we uncovered strong evidence that implementing full-day kindergarten alone was not enough to increase maternal labour force participation and weeks worked, but when combined with the low-fee daycare program it was, and these effects were also long lasting. Finally, our results on cognitive development suggest the reform did not improve school readiness and may even have had negative impacts on children from low-income families.
H42|“Phantom of the Opera” or “Sex and the City”? Historical amenities as sources of exogenous variation|Using the location of baroque opera houses as a natural experiment, Falck et al. (2011) claim to document a positive causal effect of the supply of cultural goods on the regional distribution of talents. This paper raises considerable doubts on the validity of the identification strategy underlying these estimates. While we are able to replicate the original results, we show that the same empirical strategy also assigns positive causal effects to the location of historical brothels and breweries. The estimated effects are similar in size and significance to those of historical opera houses. We document that these estimates reflect the importance of institutions for long-run economic growth, and that the effect of historical amenities on the contemporary local share of high skilled workers disappears upon controlling for regions' historical importance.
H42|Universal coverage with supply-side reform: The impact on medical expenditure risk and utilization in Thailand|We estimate the impact on out-of-pocket (OOP) medical expenditure of a major reform in Thailand that greatly extended health insurance coverage to achieve universality while implementing supply-side measures intended to deliver cost-effective care from an increased, but modest, public health budget. Difference-in-differences comparison of groups to whom coverage was extended or deepened with those whose coverage did not change indicates that the reform reduced OOP expenditure by 28% on average and by 42% at the 95th percentile of the conditional distribution. Simulations suggest that exposure to medical expenditure risk was reduced by three-fifths, on average, generating a social welfare gain equivalent to 80–200% of the approximate deadweight loss from financing the reform. Estimated effects on health care access suggest that the policy managed to reduce households' medical expenses while also raising their utilization of both inpatient and ambulatory care.
H42|Public Good Provision in Indian Rural Areas: The Returns to Collective Action by Microfinance Groups|Self-help groups (SHGs) are the most common form of microfinance in India. We provide evidence that SHGs, composed of women only, undertake collective actions for the provision of public goods within village communities. Using a theoretical model, we show that an elected official, whose aim is to maximize re-election chances, exerts higher effort in providing public goods when private citizens undertake collective action and coordinate their voluntary contributions towards the same goods. This effect occurs although government and private contributions are assumed to be substitutes in the technology of providing public goods. Using firsthand data on SHGs in India, we test the prediction of the model and show that, in response to collective action by SHGs, local authorities tackle a larger variety of public issues, and are more likely to tackle issues of interest to SHGs. Our findings highlight how the social behavior of SHGs can influence the governance of rural Indian communities.
H42|Financialisation of the water sector in Poland|Over the last decade there has been dynamic development of technical infrastructure connected with the water economy in Poland. In the years 2000-2013, the water system network expended three times. Such development was possible thanks to the subsidies granted for the realisation of infrastructural investments under the European Union pre-accession (ISPA) as well as post-accession programmes (Structural Funds, Cohesion Funds) supported by state institutions responsible for environmental protection (the Ministry of Environment, the National Fund of Environmental Protection and Water Management). The financial means obtained from bank loans constituted an insignificant part of infrastructural investments. Responsibility for the water system, including the collective supply of water and collective discharge of sewage, is held by gminas1 and it is their own task under the municipal economy. Gminas, the number of which is 2479 in Poland, commission water and sewage service enterprises to perform these tasks. Such enterprises, characterised by a very fragmented structure, play a monopolistic role in a given gmina or a collection of gminas. That is why, the process of financialisation of this sector seems to be rather slow. Political conditions in local communities constitute additional limitations to abrupt ownership transformations in the water sector. Of key importance in water sector is the process of establishing tariffs for collective water supply and collective sewage discharge. The manner of validating the tariffs by gminas is, however, rather questionable. The total price of water supply in Poland varies to a large degree, compared to the prices of electricity or gas supply. It comes as a result of geographical and geological conditions in particular gminas as well as a large scale of proecological investments. Furthermore, the prices of water constitute a crucial political factor used in the fight for votes in the local government elections. The agreement from the gmina’s authorities to increase water prices may contribute to their political defeat and a loss of influence. The sector of water and sewage services is not supervised by a central regulatory authority. The functioning of water and sewage service enterprises is supervised by individual gminas. Thus, a conflict of interests occurs, i.e. gminas establish water and sewage service enterprises which they subsequently supervise. That is why, there has been a discussion in Poland over the creation of a central regulatory authority and the consolidation of the sector. These activities could lead to an intensive privatisation of this area of the economy and a significant growth in the level of financialisation of this sector.
H42|Public Food Procurement: A Systematic Literature Review|The use by governments of their purchasing power to achieve social objectives is a practice that dates back to the 19th centuries when regulations were issued in both the USA and England establishing fair wages or maximum working hours per day for firms working under public contracts (McCrudden,2004). Public food procurement (PFP) is another example of how a policy instrument has been used to “link” different objectives at once. We attempted to undertake a first systematic review of the scientific literature that deals with PFP. The first striking evidence is that the number of papers per year shows an almost exponential growth during the last decade providing support to the relevance of this review. Differently from the literature on Public procurement where the themes of contracting and cost minimisation are prevalent, the literature on PFP is centred on the concepts of localisation and structured demand and its impacts on food chain actors as well as citizen-consumers and on sustainability at large. We provide a conceptual scheme of the PFP literature largely based on the concept of linkage that has been first proposed in law and regulation studies and is declined in a rather specific fashion in this field of public procurement.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H42|Do treatment decisions depend on physicians' financial incentives?|We study how General Practitioners (GPs) respond to fee changes with respect to the number of visits and treatment intensity. Our empirical strategy is to exploit within GP variation in the fee schedule due to specialisation in general medicine that implies a higher consultation fee, and to use only a narrow time window around the date of the fee change to identify the GPs' supply responses. Making use of detailed administrative claims data covering all GPs in Norway over a six-year period (2006-2011), we find that a higher consultation fee increases the number of visits (with an elasticity of 0.2), but reduces the treatment intensity per visit (and per patient). This is a pure substitution effect where GPs respond to the fee increase by seeing more patients but spending less time with each, without changing the total amount of time spent per month treating patients. Thus, our analysis suggests that fee-for-service is a powerful policy instrument that needs to be carefully designed in order to ensure optimal provision of care.
H42|Dynamic Tax Evasion with Audits based on Conspicuous Consumption|We solve the problem of a representative agent who maximises the expected present utility of his intertemporal consumption under the as- sumption that an optimal fraction of his wealth is hidden to the tax au- thorities (we show conditions under which evasion is expedient). Evasion affects the capital dynamics in two ways: the growth rate of capital in- creases because some taxes are not paid, but when caught evading the consumer has to pay a fee (proportional to evasion). Consumption can be allocated between ordinary goods and so-called conspicuous goods. The latter are used by the Government for targeting the audit, since they are considered like an indicator of consumer's wealth. In fact, the probabil- ity to be caught is a function of the distance between the actual and the presumed consumption in conspicuous goods. We find a closed form solu- tion to the dynamic optimization problem and show how fiscal and audit parameters affect the optimal evasion and the optimal allocation between the two consumptions.
H42|A Note on Possible Estimation Bias When Studying Persons with Work Disability in Active Labour Market Programs|This study looks at the effects of participating in active labour market policy programs for persons with work disabilities. More in detail, it draws attention to the importance of taking into account the timing of when a work disability has been registered for persons attending ALMP programs. We argue that not controlling for time of events, i.e. the exact time a participant starts a program, as well as the time that person is being registered with a work disability, implies a risk of ending up with biased estimations with respect to the effectiveness of certain ALMP programs.
H42|Evaluating the efficiency of public services|Efficiency is an important consideration for those who manage public services. Costs vary with output and with a variety of other factors. In the case of higher education, for example, factors include quality, student demographics, the scale and scope of the higher education provider, and the size and character of the real estate. But even when taking all these factors into account, costs vary across providers because of differences in efficiency. Such differences offer clues about good practice that can lead to improvements in the system as a whole. The role of efficiency is illustrated by reference to higher education institutions in England.
H42|Gunning for efficiency with third party enforcement in threshold public goods|When public goods can only be provided when donations cross a minimum threshold, this creates an advantage in that Pareto Efficient outcomes can be Nash Equilibria. Despite this, experiments have shown that groups struggle to coordinate on one of the many efficient equilibria. We apply a mechanism used successfully in continuous public goods games, the Hired Gun Mechanism (Andreoni and Gee in J. Public Econ. 96(11–12):1036–1046, 2012 ), to see if it can successfully get subjects across the threshold. When we use the mechanism to eliminate only inefficient equilibria, without addressing coordination, there is a modest but statistically insignificant improvement with the mechanism. However, when we hone the mechanism to eliminate all but one of the provision-point equilibria, thereby addressing the coordination issue, the mechanism moves all subjects to the desired efficient outcome almost immediately. In fact, after only one round using the hired gun mechanism, all subject are coordinating on the chosen equilibrium. The mechanism can be applied in settings where a group (1) has a plan for public good provision, (2) can measure contributions, (3) can fine members and (4) has an agreed upon standard for expected contributions. In these settings simple punishments, when focused on solving coordination as well as free riding, can greatly improve efficiency. Copyright Economic Science Association 2015
H42|Competition and privatization policies revisited: the payoff interdependence approach|We investigate the relationship between competition and privatization policies. Existing studies measure the strength of competition based on the number of firms, and show that the optimal degree of privatization is higher in more competitive markets. We introduce an interdependent payoff structure into a mixed oligopoly and revisit this problem. Here, we assume that firms consider their own and other firms’ profits. In the model, competition increases when firms are negatively affected by rivals’ profits. We find that under the assumption of quadratic production costs, which is popular in mixed oligopolies, the optimal degree of privatization is higher when there is less market competition. This finding contrasts with those of prior studies. However, this result may be reversed when we adopt alternative model formulation. Furthermore, in the constant marginal cost case, the optimal degree of privatization is always lower when there is less market competition, which is opposite to the result in the quadratic cost case. Our results suggest that the relationship between an optimal privatization policy and the strength of competition crucially depends on the market structure, including the cost conditions.

H42|Voluntary public health insurance|We look at the consequences of allowing public health insurance (PuHI) to be voluntary when its coverage can be supplemented in the market. PuHI redistributes with respect to risk and income, and the market is affected by adverse selection. We argue that making PuHI voluntary does not lead to its collapse since individuals always participate in it. Additionally, in some cases, a voluntary PuHI scheme increases market efficiency because participation in it sends a signal to private insurers of an individual’s health-risk type. The welfare consequences depend on the status quo. If in the status quo no political support exists for a compulsory PuHI, making it voluntary constitutes a Pareto improvement, and in some cases all individuals are strictly better off. If, instead, the status quo implements compulsory PuHI, making it voluntary then results in less redistribution. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
H42|Senior Housing in Sweden – Organisation of the System and Conclusions for Poland|The aim of this paper is to present the organisation of Swedish senior housing and the mechanisms of its functioning. After an analysis of this issue, conclusions for Poland have been provided. Sweden experienced the consequences of the aging population process earlier than Poland. In order to minimise its negative effects, the Swedes managed to create a few solutions for supporting seniors, especially in the field of housing and long-term care. One of the most significant measures which was taken to achieve this goal was to oblige municipalities to take full responsibility for elderly care. Thanks to that, Swedish local authorities decided to privatise parts of their tasks and take part in creating supply for senior housing on the real estate market.
H42|The Political Economics of Higher-Education Finance for Mobile Individuals|We study voting over higher-education finance in an economy with two regions and two separated labor markets. Households differ in their financial endowment and their children's ability. Nonstudents are immobile. Students decide where to study; they return home after graduation with exogenous probability. The voters of the two regions decide on whether to subsidize higher-education costs or to rely on tuition fees only. We find that in equilibrium, in both regions a majority votes for subsidies when the return probability is sufficiently small. When that probability is large, both regions opt for full tuition finance.
H42|Costly Exclusion, Property-Rights Enforcement, and the Optimal Supply of Rival and Nonrival Goods|We analyze the optimal relationship between the public and private enforcement of property rights for the case of rival and nonrival goods. Exclusion is interpreted as a costly activity, which allows it to endogenize the distinctions between public and club goods on the one hand and between private and common-pool goods on the other. We characterize optimality conditions for the private provision of rival and nonrival goods, characterize optimal enforcement policies, and compare the solutions with other institutional alternatives.
H42|Flexibility of Deficit Ceiling and Income Fluctuation|To avoid fiscal crisis, a government can impose a long-term deficit ceiling. A key issue that has arisen with respect to this is how long-term objectives should be modified to accommodate economic fluctuations and to maintain some flexibility with respect to fiscal stabilization policy in a political economy. By incorporating the political efforts of private agents into a simple model, we explore how income fluctuations affect the deficit ceiling in a political economy. If the government can optimally impose a deficit ceiling, normally, the deficit ceiling should rise in a recession as a first-best case; however, interestingly, a recession does not necessarily prompt an increase in the deficit ceiling in the second-best case. The response of the optimal deficit ceiling to income fluctuations mainly depends on the effect of fiscal privileges on the marginal benefit of useful public spending and on the extent of political effort.
H42|Upcoding: Evidence from Medicare on Squishy Risk Adjustment|In most US health insurance markets, plans face strong incentives to “upcode” the patient diagnoses they report to the regulator, as these affect the risk-adjusted payments plans receive. We show that enrollees in private Medicare plans generate 6% to 16% higher diagnosis-based risk scores than they would under fee-for-service Medicare, where diagnoses do not affect most provider payments. Our estimates imply upcoding generates billions in excess public spending and significant distortions to firm and consumer behavior. We show that coding intensity increases with vertical integration, suggesting a principal-agent problem faced by insurers, who desire more intense coding from the providers with whom they contract.
H42|The Birth of Edge Cities in China: Measuring the Spillover Effects of Industrial Parks|Several Chinese cities have invested billions of dollars to construct new industrial parks. These place based investments solve the land assembly problem which allows many productive firms to co-locate close to each other. The resulting local economic growth creates new opportunities for real estate developers and retailers that develop properties and stores close to the new park. The city mayor has the political clout and the personal promotion incentives to anticipate these effects as he chooses whether and where within the city to build the park. Using several geo-coded data sets, we measure the localized spillover effects of the new parks on local incumbent firm productivity, the growth of retail activity close to the park and local real estate pricing and construction. We document the heterogeneous effects of investment in parks. Those parks featuring a higher level of human capital, a greater level of co-agglomeration among firms within the park, and a smaller share of State Owned Enterprises offer greater spillover effects.
H42|Insiders and Outsiders: Local Ethnic Politics and Public Goods Provision|We examine the role of ethnic politics at the local level in supplying public goods within a framework that incorporates two sides to ethnic groups: an inclusionary side associated with internal cooperation and an exclusionary side associated with the disregard for others. The inclusionary aspect of ethnic politics results in the selection of more able political representatives who exert more effort, resulting in an increased supply of non-excludable public goods. The exclusionary aspect of ethnic politics results in the capture of targetable public resources by insiders; i.e. the representative's own group, at the expense of outsiders. Using newly available Indian data, covering all the major states over three election terms at the most local (ward) level, we provide empirical evidence that is consistent with both sides of ethnic politics. Counterfactual simulations using structural estimates of the model are used to quantify the impact of alternative policies that, based on our theory and the empirical results, are expected to increase the supply of public goods.
H42|Effects of ACA Medicaid Expansions on Health Insurance Coverage and Labor Supply| We examined the effect of the expansion of Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act on health insurance coverage and labor supply of low‐educated and low‐income adults. We found that the Medicaid expansions were associated with large increases in Medicaid coverage, for example, 50 percent among childless adults, and corresponding decreases in the proportion uninsured. There was relatively little change in private insurance coverage, although the expansions tended to decrease such coverage slightly. In terms of labor supply, estimates indicated that the Medicaid expansions had little effect on work effort despite the substantial changes in health insurance coverage. Most estimates suggested that the expansions increased work effort, although not significantly.
H42|How should commodities be taxed? A counter-argument to the recommendation in the Mirrlees Review|The Mirrlees Review recommends that commodity taxation should in general be uniform, but with some goods consumed in conjunction with labour supply (such as child care) left untaxed. This article examines the validity of this claim in an optimal income tax framework. Contrary to the recommendation of the review, our theoretical results imply that even if all goods other than the good needed for working are separable from leisure, the optimal tax on these goods should not be uniform. Instead, commodity taxes should discourage consumption of goods with large expenditure elasticities. Our results imply that the optimal commodity tax system is dependent on the expenditure side of the government. For instance, if the government fully subsidizes the cost of the good needed for working, then commodity taxation is uniform under the standard separability assumption. Calibration exercises suggest that these results can be quantitatively important.
H42|Optimal Taxation and Productive Social Expenditure|This paper characterizes the optimal tax and expenditure policies in economies where households’ unobservable gross earnings depend on exogenous (or inherited) capabilities and input investments. In a two-class economy, optimal redistribution relies on non-linear income taxation and input public provision only if the poor households demand less input than the rich. In a multi-class economy, optimal redistribution is implemented by usual-shape, non-linear income taxation and uniform public provision of input, if inherited capability and input are economic substitutes. But, when capability and input are complements, optimal redistribution relies only on non-linear income taxation. Numerical analyses show that, when individual productivity is separable in input and capability, these factors are economic substitutes (or complements) if preferences take into account (or not) the income effects.
H42|Investments in Water Networks: A Normative Analysis of Local Public Utilities|We analyze rehabilitation investments in a regulated water industry with perfectly inelastic demand. We compare alternative organizational solutions for local provision (municipalization, corporatization and privatization), though subject to a common regulatory mechanism. We can then assess the effects of incentive regulation in public firms and find that even benvolent politicians always stick to the price-cap, in order to save on distortionary taxation. How- ever, incentives to invest result to be excessive only in private firms, as the cost of capital is accounted differently by public and private undertakings. We also provide a theory of mixed firms, based on strategic interaction be- tween politicians and managers, which contributes to endogenously explain partial privatization and minority participation by private stockholders. In this last case incentives to invest appear to be driven just by governance and ownership reasons.
H42|Completing Ostrom’s Table : A Note on the Taxonomy of Goods|A framework is proposed to subsume public goods and common-pool resources, respectively, as specific cases of positive and negative externalities. A pure public good is a positive externality whose appropriable benefits are too small or too uncertain relative to the high private cost for anyone to produce it in any amount. The common-pool problem is a case where each agent’s action imposes a negative externality on everyone else.
H42|Partnering and the Viability of Affordable Housing Projects in London: Determining a causation|It has been reported that strategic partnering can deliver savings of 30% while one-off, project partnering can deliver up an immediate 10%. Many researchers have however began to criticize the concept of partnering. Some are of the view that the concept has not been clearly defined and definitions are often too vague and overly optimistic (Eriksson, 2010). Others argue that the concept is one that sounds good as a theory but lacks the necessary contents needed for its implementation (Eriksson, 2010). This research focuses on the impacts of partnering on the supply of housing. This will be achieved by investigating the impact of partnering on the viability of affordable housing schemes in London. Upon analysis and interpretation of the data, the paper finds that partnering may affect viability through 6 key factors including: Long-Term Relationship, Economy, Transparency, Capability, Labour and Ideals. These findings suggests the need for local authorities to abandon the Best Price method of affordable housing procurement and the need for the stability of the UK economic environment in order to reduce risks and encourage partnering in the affordable housing sector.
H42|Roadblocks on the Road to Grandma's House: Fertility Consequences of Delayed Retirement|We investigate the role of grandparental childcare for fertility decisions of their offspring. Exploiting pension reforms in Italy, we argue that delayed retirement means a negative shock to the supply of informal childcare for the next generation. We show that one additional grandparent available in the early child-bearing years increases by 5% the number of children. Effects are limited to the most familistic close-knits, and are not the mechanical consequence of changes in living arrangements, investment in education or labor supply. Given the Italian lowest low fertility, we conclude that pension reforms may have had unintended inter-generational effects.
