D45|Capitalization as a Two-Part Tariff: The Role of Zoning|This paper shows that the capitalization of local amenities is effectively priced into land via a two-part pricing formula: a “ticket” price paid regardless of the amount of housing service consumed and a “slope” price paid per unit of services. We first show theoretically how tickets arise as an extensive margin price when there are binding constraints on the number of households admitted to a neighborhood. We use a large national dataset of housing transactions, property characteristics, and neighborhood attributes to measure the extent to which local amenities are capitalized in ticket prices vis-a-vis slopes. We find that in most U.S. cities, the majority of neighborhood variation in pricing occurs via tickets, although the importance of tickets rises sharply in the stringency of land development regulations, as predicted by theory. We discuss implications of two-part pricing for efficiency and equity in neighborhood sorting equilibria and for empirical estimates of willingness to pay for non marketed amenities, which generally assume proportional pricing only.

D45|Waiting for Affordable Housing in New York City|We develop a new dynamic equilibrium model with heterogeneous households that captures the most important frictions that arise in housing rental markets and explains the political popularity of affordable housing policies. We estimate the model using data collected by the New York Housing Vacancy Survey in 2011. We find that there are significant adjustment costs in all markets as well as serious search frictions in the market for affordable housing. Moreover, there are large queuing frictions in the market for public housing. Having access to rent-stabilized housing increases household welfare by up to $65,000. Increasing the supply of affordable housing by ten percent significantly improves the welfare of all renters in the city. Progressive taxation of higher-income households that live in public housing can also be welfare improving.
D45|Competitive Equilibria in Matching Models with Financial Constraints|We consider the one-to-one two-sided matching with contracts model in which buyers face financial constraints. In this model there is a stable outcome, but not necessarily a competitive equilibrium as defined in the standard way. We propose a new equilibrium notion, quantity-constrained competitive equilibrium (QCCE) that allows buyers to form rational expectations on the lack of supply when their financial constraints are binding. We show the existence of QCCEs and establish the equivalence among QCCE outcomes, stable outcomes, and core outcomes. We also analyze the existence of QCCEs with uniform prices, the lattice property of QCCEs, and the rural hospital theorem of QCCEs. We finally examine the relation between models with financial constraints and models with price controls.
D45|Licensing with Free Entry|The literature on the licensing of an innovation has mainly focused on some speci c contract types. We show within the framework of a fairly general model that removing these contractual limitations will lead to extreme market outcomes. Speci cally, we nd that when the patentee can employ observable contracts that can condition on market entry, it can achieve the monopoly outcome. Furthermore, when the patentee can only use unconditional quantity forcing contracts, it captures the entire market, albeit not at monopoly price, via a single licensee. Our results point out to the signi cance, and perhaps the particularity, of observable, nonrenegotiable contracts.
D45|Patent licensing in a Cournot oligopoly: General results|This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of patent licensing in a Cournot oligopoly with general demand and looks at both cases: outside and incumbent innovators. The licensing policies considered are upfront fees, unit royalties and combinations of fees and royalties (FR policies). It is shown that (i) royalties unambiguously ensure full diffusion of the innovation while diffusion is limited under upfront fees, (ii) the Cournot price is higher under royalties compared to upfront fees and the price could even exceed the post-innovation monopoly price, (iii) for generic values of magnitudes of the innovation, when the industry size is relatively large, royalties are superior to upfront fees for the innovator and (iv) for any m, there is always a non empty subset of m-drastic innovations such that for relatively large industry sizes, upfront fee policy results in higher consumer surplus as well as welfare compared to both royalty and FR policies.
D45|Endogenous heterogeneity in duopoly with deterministic one-way spillovers|Abstract This paper examines the standard symmetric two-period R&D duopoly model, but with a deterministic one-way spillover structure. Though the two firms are ex-ante identical, one obtains a unique pair of asymmetric equilibria of R&D investments, leading to inter-firm heterogeneity in the industry, in R&D roles as well as in unit costs. We analyze the impact of a change in the spillover parameter and R&D costs on firms’ levels of R&D and profits. We find that higher spillovers need not lead to lower R&D investments for both firms. In addition, equilibrium profits may improve due to the presence of spillovers, and it may be advantageous to be the R&D imitator rather than the R&D innovator.
D45|Price opinion data in subsidized economies: Empirical evidence from Iraq|Distortions resulting from consumption subsidies or rationing systems often lead welfare analysts to use market price opinions, where household budget survey respondents are asked to provide their opinions of equivalent market prices of subsidized or rationed goods, to value consumption of the rationed goods. This is because prices paid by households for rationed goods do not represent the true marginal utility from consumption of these goods. This is the case in household budget surveys undertaken in Iraq, for example, where rationed food items received through the Public Distribution System are valued at market prices using price opinion data rather than at official prices facing households. Despite the fact that most Living Standards Measurement Surveys conducted in countries that maintain consumption subsidies collect market price opinions, little evidence exists to support the notion that respondent opinions on market prices adequately approximate shadow prices of subsidized or rationed commodities. This paper explores the adequacy of market price opinions of subsidized food commodities using data from Iraq. The evidence presented here suggests that price opinions of subsidized food commodities are influenced by the importance of the subsidy in the household economy - a reflection of household welfare levels and preferences. This leads to the conclusion that price opinion data for subsidized goods distorts the estimated transfer value of the PDS food subsidy and biases welfare analysis, particularly affecting the ability to monitor trends over time.
D45|Does occupational deregulation affect in-company vocational training? – Evidence from the 2004 Reform of the German Trade and Crafts Code|The European Commission actively evaluates occupational entry restrictions in all member states. This has attracted a growing interest among scholars of the German crafts sector as it is governed by an idiosyncratic national set of rules. We estimate the effects of the deregulation of the German Trade and Crafts Code in 2004 on the overall vocational training levels in affected crafts trades. We employ Difference-in-Differences regressions as well as Synthetic Control Methods on data for the entire population of the German crafts sector. We show that the overall effect of the reform on vocational training levels was negative, and is largely driven by the additional costs of obtaining a training license in the deregulated sector.
D45|Bargaining over Entry with a Compulsory License Deadline: Price Spillovers and Surplus Expansion|We analyze bargaining between a developing country (South) and a multinational firm over the local price of its patented product. We use an alternating offers bargaining game in which the South can resort to compulsory licensing (CL) if the two parties fail to reach agreement by a certain deadline. The presence of international price spillovers introduces two novel features into the standard bargaining problem: the surplus from entry prior to the CL deadline may be negative, and CL can yield higher surplus than entry. We establish conditions under which equilibrium may exhibit immediate entry, preemptive entry just prior to the CL deadline, or the occurrence of CL. The South necessarily gains from the threat of CL if the joint payoff under entry is higher relative to CL but can lose if it is lower.
D45|Competition, Product Innovation and Licensing|This paper compares market profit and social welfare levels between differentiated Bertrand and Cournot duopoly. We start with a basic model in which a firm with a production technology can license its new technology to a potential rival who can use the technology to produce a differentiated product and compete with the incumbent firm. It is found that for any given technology level, Bertrand competition is necessarily more profitable but less socially desirable, due to its higher royalty rate. By contrast, if the licensee firm is an incumbent firm, the results hold if the technology level is high. Furthermore, if we assume the licensor firm can engage in product innovation and choose its optimal technology endogenously and the R&D efficiency is high (low), the welfare ranking is reversed (still holds).
D45|Takings of Land by Self-interested Governments Economic Analysis of Eminent Domain|In this paper, we model and examine the effects of two salient features of the eminent domain law and its use. First, the compensation is less than ‘full’. Second, the government is not a perfect agent of the society. Once these features are factored in, several claims in the existing literature do not hold. Our results question the ‘fiscal-illusion’ theory. We show that the full compensation ensures efficiency neither of the takings nor of the investment decisions. Moreover, things can get worse with tightening of the budget constraints. However, under-compensation combined with the provision of restitution delivers a better outcome - in terms of investment choices by the owners as well as the taking decisions and project choices by the government. Further, we show that fixed-compensation schemes generally are not efficient even if the government is benevolent, but under-compensation can still deliver outcome more efficient than the full compensation.
D45|Patent licensing in the presence of a differentiated good|The existing literature has considered licensing of a patented innovation either in a homogenous good industry or in a differentiated goods industry. We consider the licensing problem between two firms i.e., licensor and licensee producing the homogenous goods when there is a third firm producing a differentiated good in the market. We find that when the costs of non-innovators are not high, the optimal licensing contract depends on the degree of product differentiation and the innovator has more incentive for innovation when it is an insider than when it is an outsider of this market.
D45|Vertical licensing, input pricing, and entry|We explore the incentives of a vertically integrated incumbent to license the production technology of its core input to an external firm, transforming the licensee into its input supplier. We find that the incumbent opts for licensing even when licensing also transforms the licensee into one of its direct competitors in the final products market. In fact, the licensee’s entry into the final products market, although it increases the competition and the cost that the licensor faces, reinforces the licensing incentives. Furthermore, the licensee’s entry augments the positive welfare implications of vertical licensing.
D45|Sequential innovation, naked exclusion, and upfront lump-sum payments|Abstract We present a potentially benign naked exclusion mechanism that can be applied to sequential innovation; a non-patentable original innovation by the incumbent supplier fosters derivative innovation by rivals. In the absence of an appropriate legal framework, the original innovator’s equilibrium exclusivity contracts block subsequent efficient entry even if there is (leader–follower) competition in the contracting phase. However, the legal framework may maximize social welfare by imposing a ban on upfront lump-sum payments in exclusivity contracts (by all suppliers) combined with an outright ban on exclusivity contracts by the derivative innovator. The former ban precludes the exclusion of socially beneficial derivative innovation by causing the incumbent supplier to resort to accommodation, rather than to pure exclusion, strategies. The latter ban complements the former by preventing inefficient or excessive derivative innovation.
D45|College Admission and High School Integration|This paper examines possible effects of college admission policy on general equilibrium outcomes at the high school stage. Specifically, we investigate whether a policy that bases college admission on relative performance at high school could modify in the aggregate the degree of segregation in schools, by inducing some students to relocate to schools that offer weaker competition. In a matching model, such high school arbitrage will occur in equilibrium and typically result in desegregating high schools, if schools are segregated with regards to socio-economic characteristics that are correlated with academic performance and race. This is supported by empirical evidence on the effects of the Texas Top Ten Percent Law, indicating that a policy designed to support diversity at the college level in fact achieved high school desegregation, unintentionally generating incentives for some students to choose schools strategically.
D45|Optimal licensing of technology in the face of (asymmetric) competition|We reconsider the optimal technology licensing by an incumbent firm facing multiple competitors. First, we cover the case of one license and show that competition has a drastic effect on optimal two-part tariffs. We also consider license auctions and design a more profitable dynamic mechanism. Next, we allow the licensor to award multiple licenses and design a dynamic mechanism that extracts the maximum industry profit. It awards licenses to all firms, prescribes maximum permitted royalty rates and positive fixed fees, and is more profitable than other dynamic mechanisms. Finally we show that a slight modification of that mechanism is also optimal for outside patent holders.
D45|Per unit vs. ad valorem royalty licensing|We consider licensing of non-drastic innovations by a patent holder who interacts with a potential licensee in a downstream market. We compare two kinds of license contracts: per unit and ad valorem royalties, combined with fixed fees. Assuming that antitrust authorities apply the same principle to review ad valorem licensing which they apply to per unit licensing, we show that per unit licensing is more profitable if the licensor is more efficient in using the innovation, whereas ad valorem licensing is more profitable if the licensee is more efficient. This explains why and when these licensing schemes should be observed.
D45|Who Moves Out of Social Housing? The Effect of Rent Control on Housing Tenure Choice|Abstract Rent control provides substantial in-kind benefits to tenants of social housing. In the Netherlands these benefits equal almost 40% of the market rent on average. We show that rent control benefits for the 10% tenants with highest income are 5% points higher than the benefits for the 10% with lowest incomes. Next we provide evidence that rent control influences the housing tenure choice decision. We find that on average rent control reduces transitions within the social housing sector, but not transitions from the social housing sector. Only the 20% tenants with highest incomes postpone moves out of social housing in response to rent control. This suggests that the inequitable distribution of rent control benefits is prolonged by the reduction in transition rates out of social housing. It also suggests that recent policy in the Netherlands that reduces rent control benefits for high income households can increase the mobility of those affected.
D45|The Economic Implications of Housing Supply|In this essay, we review the basic economics of housing supply and the functioning of US housing markets to better understand the distribution of home prices, household wealth, and the spatial distribution of people across markets. We employ a cost-based approach to gauge whether a housing market is delivering appropriately priced units. Specifically, we investigate whether market prices (roughly) equal the costs of producing the housing unit. If so, the market is well-functioning in the sense that it efficiently delivers housing units at their production cost. The gap between price and production cost can be understood as a regulatory tax. The available evidence suggests, but does not definitively prove, that the implicit tax on development created by housing regulations is higher in many areas than any reasonable negative externalities associated with new construction. We discuss two main effects of developments in housing prices: on patterns of household wealth and on the incentives for relocation to high-wage, high-productivity areas. Finally, we turn to policy implications.
D45|Mechanism Design with Financially Constrained Agents and Costly Verification|A principal wishes to distribute an indivisible good to a population of budget-constrained agents. Both valuation and budget are an agentâ€™s private information. The principal can inspect an agentâ€™s budget through a costly verification process and punish an agent who makes a false statement. I characterize the direct surplus-maximizing mechanism. This direct mechanism can be implemented by a two-stage mechanism in which agents only report their budgets. Specifically, all agents report their budgets in the first stage. The principal then provides budget dependent cash subsidies to agents and assigns the goods randomly (with uniform probability) at budget-dependent prices. In the second stage, a resale market opens, but is regulated with budget-dependent sales taxes. Agents who report low budgets receive more subsidies in their initial purchases (the first stage), face higher taxes in the resale market (the second stage) and are inspected randomly. This implementation exhibits some of the features of some welfare programs, such as Singaporeâ€™s housing and development board.
D45|‘To sell or not to sell’: Licensing versus selling by an outside innovator|We study various modes of technology transfer of an outside innovator in a spatial framework when the potential licensees are asymmetric. In addition to different licensing options, we also look into the option of selling the property rights of innovation and find the optimal mode of technology transfer. For licensing we find the optimal policy is to offer pure royalty contracts to both licensee firms when cost differentials between the firms are relatively small compared to the transportation cost, otherwise offer a fixed fee licensing contract to the efficient firm only. Interestingly, we show the innovator is always better-off selling the innovation to any one of the firms who further licenses it to the rival firm. The result holds irrespective of the size of the innovation (drastic or non-drastic) and the degree of cost asymmetry between the licensees. Social welfare is greater under selling than licensing.
D45|Subsidization Policy on the Social Enterprise for the Underprivileged|We formulate an oligopoly model in which social enterprise for the underprivileged competes with private enterprises under government subsidization, and examine the market ole of private leadership. We show that Stackelberg private leadership is better from the viewpoint of total social welfare, while Cournot followership is better when the social provisions for the underprivileged are emphasized. We also find that both cost inefficiency and the number of private enterprises affect the profitability and welfare consequences. We then investigate the rationing policy on the production of social enterprise and show that output rationing is superior to market share rationing not only for the social concerns of the underprivileged but also for total social welfare, even though it is less attractive than subsidy policy. Finally, we find that there is a strategic over-incentive to pursue social activities under government subsidization.
D45|Ex-post optimal knapsack procurement|We consider a budget-constrained mechanism designer who selects an optimal set of projects to maximize her utility. Projects may differ in their value for the designer, and their cost is private information. In this allocation problem, the quantity of procured projects is endogenously determined by the mechanism. The designer faces ex-post constraints: the participation and budget constraints must hold for each possible outcome, while the mechanism must be strategyproof. We identify settings in which the class of optimal mechanisms has a deferred acceptance auction representation which allows an implementation with a descending-clock auction. Only in the case of symmetric projects do price clocks descend synchronously such that the cheapest projects are implemented. The case in which values or costs are asymmetrically distributed features a novel tradeoff between quantity and quality. The reason is that guaranteeing allocation to the most favorable projects under strategyproofness comes at a price of a diminished expected number of implemented projects.
D45|Gli incentivi allâ€™efficienza energetica nelle Gare per il Servizio di Distribuzione Gas: riflessi di Finanza Pubblica Locale|This paper provides timely and updated analysis of the role of incentives to energy efficiency, namely to investments efficiency improving, conveyed through the â€œwhite certificate systemâ€ or â€œenergy efficiency certificatesâ€ against annual obligations that fall at the expense of natural gas distributor. Are analyzed the ways of performance of the obligation to purchase and the role played in this matter by the institutional players (GME, GSE, AEEGSI, Ministry of Economic Development). The analysis is therefore developed on the subject of â€œadditional energy efficiency certificatesâ€ that competitors (bidders) in the race for the award of natural gas distribution service can offer to Municipalities hanging in â€œMinimum Territorial Areaâ€ (ATEM) and on the fallout that such minimum offer has in the â€œFinancial Planâ€ prepared by competitor in support of his offer. Finally the authors analyze some problems and critical aspects of the system and made synthetically any proposal to eliminate them.
D45|Screening for Good Patent Pools through Price Caps on Individual Licenses|Patent pools reduce prices when selling complementary inputs to technologies, but can also effectively cartelize markets when involving substitutes. Independent licensing, by reintroducing competition, ensures that only good pools form when there are two patent holders involved. For larger pools, independent licensing needs to be complemented by other policy tools. We propose to constrain the royalties for the patents individually licensed outside the pool with price caps replicating the pool's sharing rule. This information-free screening device works with asymmetries, even when licensors try to stabilize pools by readjusting the sharing rule in a way that may not reflect contributions.
D45|Innovation Led Alliances: Theory and application to the GM Plant Industry| The objective of the present paper is to identify the determinants of the form of collaboration initiated between an upstream innovator and a downstream producer in order to incorporate a new input and commercialize an innovation consisting of a quality enhanced final product, with an empirical application to the GM plant industry. The choice of upstream firm between license, joint venture, merger or a subsidiary is modeled as a function of three parameters: degree of quality improvement engendered by the new input, the market share of the downstream producer and the capability of the downstream producer to incorporate the new input and commercialize it successfully. We also discuss the case where the downstream firm is a cooperative.

D45|Strategic Capacity Investment under Hold-up Threats: The Role of Contract Length and Width|This article analyzes the impact of incomplete contracts’ length on investment in a bilateral relationship. The seller has the power to set the contract terms whereas the buyer decides on the investment level, which acts as a cap on future demand. Two-part tariffs succeed at implementing the optimal investment and consumption even if commitment is limited, and the contract’s duration is irrelevant. Interestingly, this efficient solution is rendered possible by subsidies on consumption during the contract. In other terms, duration matters hugely for the contract details (the timing of transfers), not for its performance. Under certain circumstances that we discuss, linear pricing may have to be used, which leads to suboptimal investment. We show that longer contracts are less efficient, meaning that a degree of completeness (pricing width) may be strictly complementary to another one (contract length). The buyer’s surplus increases with respect to the contract duration, whereas the seller loses more in profit than the social surplus decreases. A longer contract actually protects expropriable investors rather than investment itself.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D45|Optimal value of a patent in an asymmetric Cournot duopoly market|We study how to transfer a patented innovation to competing firms. We consider a Cournot duopoly market with asymmetric pre-innovation costs and an independent patent holder who is not a producer in the market. There are two kinds of cost reducing innovations: “common innovation” and “new technology innovation”. We show that the best way to transfer an innovation for the patent holder is to sell the patent to the efficient firm at a fixed payment who would further license the innovation to its rival. This patent sale dominates all other methods of licensing for both kinds of innovations.
D45|Patent strength and optimal two-part tariff licensing with a potential rival incorporating ad valorem royalties|We show that an internal patentee may prefer to use ad valorem royalties instead of per-unit royalties in the licensing contract of a new product to a potential rival who may develop a substitute good.
D45|Antiretroviral therapy and demand for HIV testing: Evidence from Zambia|This paper examines the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on demand for HIV testing and of ART-induced testing on demand for risky sexual behavior. I provide a model of sexual behavior decision-making under uncertainty and estimate the structural parameters of the model using nationally representative survey data from Zambia on HIV testing decisions before and after the introduction of ART. The empirical results indicate that although the introduction of ART appears to have increased HIV testing rates by upwards of 50 percent, the ART allocation process may have limited the prevention benefit of ART-induced testing. Simulation results show that eliminating this prevention inefficiency while holding the supply of ART constant would increase the prevention impact of ART-induced testing more than four-fold. More generally, the analysis indicates that existing studies which examine “universal” testing or quasi-experimental testing programs understate the efficacy of standard voluntary counseling and testing programs.
D45|Licensing under general demand and cost functions|We consider a Cournot duopoly under general demand and cost functions, where an incumbent patentee has a cost reducing technology that it can license to its rival by using combinations of royalties and upfront fees (two-part tariffs). We show that for drastic technologies: (a) licensing occurs and both firms stay active if the cost function is superadditive and (b) licensing does not occur and the patentee monopolizes the market if the cost function is additive or subadditive. For non drastic technologies, licensing takes place provided the average efficiency gain from the cost reducing technology is higher than the marginal gain computed at the licensee’s reservation output. Optimal licensing policies have both royalties and fees for significantly superior technologies if the cost function is superadditive. By contrast, for additive and certain subadditive cost functions, optimal licensing policies have only royalties and no fees.
D45|On the licensing of a technology with unknown use|We consider the problem facing the patentee of a technology that may be used to reduce the costs of firms in an industry. The technology's ability to cut costs depends on a use for it being discovered and the patentee has the option of trying to discover the use before licensing the technology to the firms. Should the patentee try? To answer this question, we model the interaction between the patentee and the firms as a game in extensive form. The first move in the game belongs to the patentee, deciding whether to carry a trial. Next, there is a licensing stage, followed by Cournot competition involving licensees and nonlicensees. We show that if a failure leads to the belief that the technology is most likely useless to the firms, then not trying to discover the use is optimal, even if a trial is free of pecuniary costs.
D45|Optimal allocation of an indivisible good|In this paper, we consider the problem of allocating an indivisible good efficiently between two agents with monetary transfers. We focus on allocation mechanisms that are dominant-strategy incentive compatible when agents' types are private information. Inefficiency of an allocation mechanism may come from two sources: misallocation of the indivisible good and an imbalanced budget. Unfortunately, as Green and Laffont (1979) demonstrate, no allocation mechanism can always overcome both kinds of inefficiency. We identify allocation mechanisms that maximize the expected total utilities of agents, and characterize optimal mechanisms for a large class of agents' type distributions. For strongly regular type distributions, we show that the optimal mechanisms must be budget-balanced: they are either fixed-price mechanisms or option mechanisms. The result may not hold for other type distributions. For certain type distributions, we show that optimal mechanisms are hybrids of Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanisms and budget-balanced mechanisms.
D45|Optimal bid disclosure in patent license auctions under alternative modes of competition|The literature on patent license auctions in oligopoly assumed that the auctioneer reveals the winning bid and stressed that this gives firms an incentive to bid high in order to signal an aggressive output strategy in a downstream Cournot market game, and conversely bid low to signal acquiescent pricing in a Bertrand market game. The present paper examines the information revealed by publishing the winning or the losing or no bid, assuming an oligopoly with differentiated goods. We rank disclosure rules and find that it is not optimal for the innovator to disclose the winning bid, regardless of the mode of competition.
D45|The licensing of eco-technology under emission taxation: Fixed fee vs. auction|This paper investigates the effect of emission taxation on outside innovator's licensing strategies for eco-technology and its welfare consequences when duopolistic polluting firms have different production costs and purchase licenses for pollution abatement goods. In the presence of an emission tax, we compare the two types of licensing contract, fixed fee and auction, and show that the preference on licensing strategy depends not only upon the level of the emission tax but also on the production cost gap. Specifically, non-exclusive licensing is preferred to exclusive licensing when the emission tax or cost gap is small, while exclusive auction (fixed fee) licensing is preferred when the cost gap is intermediate (large). We also analyze some important welfare issues and discuss public policies on emission taxation and licensing regulation.
D45|Public Distribution System vs. Market: Analysis of Wheat and Rice Consumption in India|Despite the large-scale antipoverty programs, especially food and nutrition programs, 15 per cent of Indian population is undernourished. The National Food Security Act (NFSA) aims at reducing food insecurity by granting a right to food to a large share of the population. The implementation of the world largest food aid program, however, is controversially debated: While historically, rationed highly subsidizes staple food have been used to improve the access to food for poor people, cash transfers are considered as an alternative with lower market distortions, leakages and fiscal costs. This study analyzes consumption patterns of wheat and rice delivered through the Public Distribution System in India and investigates targeting errors as well as reasons for leakage, self-selection and under-supply of staples using cross-sectional household data on all-India level. Our findings indicate some serious targeting errors of the current distribution system as migrant workers and female-led households are not well covered. We find that leakage rates are in general very low for poor households and regions with high poverty rates, implying that higher market prices have negative consequences for the poor excluded from the system. Further, wealthier households restrain from consuming subsidized grains. This negative self-selection of wealthier households implies a high potential for cost savings that would be lost under a cash-transfer scheme. Thus, or study provides a subtle and differentiated analysis that is highly useful for improving the current distribution system as well as design and targeting issues relevant for an alternative cash-transfer system.
D45|Determinants Of Financial Rewards From Industry–University Collaboration In South Korea|The external circumstances for universities have been changing rapidly. In order to be competitive, survive and flourish, universities have turned to external sources to generate revenues. The literature refers to this phenomenon as academic capitalism, defined as the involvement of colleges and their faculty in market-like behaviours, which has become a key feature of higher education finances in most countries. As a result, technology transfer, technological commercialisation, and patents via industry–university collaboration represent a source of financial rewards. This paper explores the determinants of financial rewards of universities sourced from academic engagement through industry–university collaboration in South Korea. We have found that technology transfer per employees working at technology licensing offices, participation of engineering faculty, patent approvals, and the number of firms with incubators within universities significantly contributes to university revenues. The following determinants of financial performance are unexpectedly not contributors to revenue: technological commercialisation using technology transfer, distinguished faculty and incentive rules for inventors. In the light of these findings, it appears that an entrepreneurial university program is likely to play a strong role in university finances in Korea.

D45|Optimal Licensing of Non-Drastic and (Super-)Drastic Innovations: The Case of the Inside Patent Holder|We reconsider the inside innovators¡¯ optimal licensing problem, assuming incomplete information and unit cost profiles that may or may not have the potential to propel a monopoly, taking into account restrictions concerning royalty rates and the use of exclusive licenses implied by antitrust rules. We analyze optimal licensing mechanisms using methods developed in the analysis of license auctions with downstream interaction. The optimal mechanism differs significantly from the mechanisms reported in the literature, which assumed complete information or particular cost profiles or probability distributions.
D45|Revenue royalties|Abstract Under the assumption of decreasing returns to scale, we compare several licensing mechanisms—per-unit royalty, an ad valorem royalty, and a revenue-royalty, and combinations with fixed fees—for an insider patentee. In the case of a non-drastic innovation, the patentee maximizes its profits by offering, respectively, an ad valorem royalty, a revenue-royalty and a two-part per-unit royalty, if the cost function is scarcely or highly convex, moderately-low convex, and moderately-high convex. In the case of a drastic innovation, the patentee always offers an ad valorem royalty contract.
D45|Uncertainty and speculators in an auction for emissions permits|Abstract Auctions have become popular as means of allocating emissions permits in the emissions trading schemes developed around the world. Mostly, only a subset of the regulated polluters participate in these auctions along with speculators, creating a market with relatively few participants and, thus, incentive for strategic bidding. I characterize the bidding behavior of the polluters and the speculators, examining the effect of the latter on the profits of the former and on the auction outcome. It turns out that in addition to bidding for compliance, polluters also bid for speculation in the aftermarket. While the presence of the speculators forces the polluters to bid closer to their true valuations, it also creates a trade-off between increasing the revenue accrued to the regulator and reducing the profits of the auction-participating polluters. Nevertheless, the profits of the latter increase in the speculators’ risk aversion.
D45|Firming renewable power with demand response: an end-to-end aggregator business model|Abstract Environmental concerns have spurred greater reliance on variable renewable energy resources (VERs) in electric generation. Under current incentive schemes, the uncertainty and intermittency of these resources impose costs on the grid, which are typically socialized across the whole system, rather than born by their creators. We consider an institutional framework in which VERs face market imbalance prices, giving them an incentive to produce higher-value energy subject to less adverse uncertainty. In this setting, we consider an “aggregator” that owns the production rights to a VER’s output, and also signs contracts with a population of demand response (DR) participants for the right to curtail them in real time, according to a contractually specified probability distribution. The aggregator bids a day ahead offer into the wholesale market, and is able to offset imbalances between the cleared day-ahead bid and the realized VER production by curtailing DR participants’ consumption according to the signed contracts. We consider the optimization of the aggregator’s end-to-end problem: designing the menu of DR service contracts using contract theory, bidding into the wholesale market, and dispatching DR consistently with the contractual agreements. We do this in a setting in which wholesale market prices, VER output, and participant demand are all stochastic, and possibly correlated.
D45|Émergence du modèle de la compétence : de la rationalisation économique à la rationalisation du facteur humain<BR>[Emergence of the Competency Model: From the Economic Rationalization to the Rationalization of the Human Factor]|Today, the strict purely economic vision of the company gave way to more global approach involving human factor. From now on, the difference between successful companies and those which fail is in their human capital. This article explores the way which led the economic rationalization to that of the human factor. It interrogates the role of skills approach in this process and examines, through the model at three levels (Dietrich, 2008), the integrated implementation of skills approach.
D45|Environmental policy on the fixed-fee licensing of eco-technology under foreign penetration|This study investigates environmental policy on the fixed-fee licensing strategy of clean eco-technology by an innovator having foreign ownership. We show that near-zero emission taxes accompanied by non-exclusive licensing regulation can improve social welfare when the cost gap is small or foreign penetration is high. However, when foreign ownership is not high, exclusive licensing regulations with an appropriate emission tax policy may improve social welfare.
D45|The Effect of Occupational Licensing Deregulation on Migrants in the German Skilled Crafts Sector|Occupational Licensing may reduce the entry of minorities, such as migrants, into a profession if the likelihood of fulfilling the licensing requirements is lower in this group. While policy makers typically justify occupational licensing on the grounds of quality control it, thus, also has the potential to adversely affect the labor market integration of foreign‐born citizens. Before the backdrop of increased levels of migration into Germany, and the general discussion about the free movement of labor in Europe, this paper empirically examines the effects of the deregulation of occupational licensing in the German crafts sector on the proportion of migrants working in this sector. The results suggest that the reform has increased the proportion of migrants by about 5 percentage points among self‐employed professionals and 6 percentage points among employed craftsmen.
D45|Rationing and screening in crowdinvesting-markets|"The allocation of shares on crowd-investing-platforms is best described by the phrase ""first come, first served"". An entrepreneur who sells corporate equity to a ""crowd"" of investors on such a platform chooses a fixed investment target before the investment period begins. Once the aggregate investments equal the investment target the financing period ends immediately. We demonstrate that this preferential treatment of early investors is not optimal because it potentially excludes informational disadvantaged investors and entrepreneurs from the market. We recommend a market design that allows for some excessive demand. Such a design would increase the willingness of informational disadvantaged investors and entrepreneurs to participate in the market. At the same time, it would minimize a platforms screening costs and maximize its profits."
D45|Public Distribution System in India - Leakage, Self-Selection and Targeting Errors|Despite the large-scale antipoverty programs, especially food and nutrition programs, 15 per cent of Indian population is undernourished. India’s current implementation of the world largest food aid program, the National Food Security Act (NFSA), experiences many challenges and needs rigorous analysis. Current study analyzes consumption patterns of wheat and rice delivered through the Public Distribution System in India. Further, impact of the subsidy on market grain consumption is quantified. The household consumption analysis using cross-sectional econometric techniques reveals targeting errors of the Public Distribution System. There is a negative self-selection of the richer households; however the migrant workers and female-led households are not well covered. The Above Poverty Line quota seems to have higher leakage rate, which strongly affects consumption of the subsidized grains. For the Below Poverty Line cardholders, subsidized grains are imperfect substitutes for the market grains. Further, subsidized grains are found to increase total consumption of wheat and rice. Because of high targeting errors, higher total demand for wheat and rice might result in higher market prices and have negative consequences for the poor excluded from the system. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical analysis of the various targeting errors and reasons for under-purchase on all India level. The results further contribute to the growing evidence that the PDS crowds in consumption of wheat and rice.
D45|Equilibrium and matching under price controls|The paper considers a matching with contracts model in the presence of price controls. The model contains two important streams in the matching literature, those with and those without monetary transfers, as special cases. An adjustment process that ends with a stable outcome is presented. The paper presents a notion of competitive equilibrium, called Drèze equilibrium, and shows Drèze equilibrium allocations to be equivalent to allocations induced by stable outcomes. We therefore have an equivalence that is valid with and without monetary transfers as well as when monetary transfers are limited.
D45|Patent Licensing with Bertrand Competitors|" type=""main""> This paper analyses an optimal two-part licensing scheme based on ad valorem royalties within a differentiated Bertrand duopoly where the innovator is also the downstream producer, and compares it with the optimal two-part per-unit royalty mechanism. After showing that the optimal two-part ad valorem licensing scheme reduces to a pure ad valorem royalty scheme, we show that per-unit contracts are typically preferred to ad valorem contracts by the patentee, as, under price competition, the per-unit royalty has a stronger strategic effect than the ad valorem royalty. In contrast, welfare is higher under the ad valorem contract than under the per-unit mechanism."
D45|A Macroeconomic Model of Imperfect Competition with Patent Licensing|This paper sets up an imperfectly competitive macroeconomic model that features the strategic interaction between the patent-holding firm and licensees, and uses it to analyze the relevant macro-variables under various licensing arrangements. Some main findings emerge from the analysis. First, the equilibrium aggregate output and aggregate consumption under fixed-fee and royalty licensing regimes are always greater than those under the no licensing regime. Moreover, the equilibrium aggregate output and consumption under the fixed-fee licensing regime are always greater than those under the royalty licensing regime. Second, with the higher (lower) technology level the patent holder prefers the fixed-fee (royalty) contract. Third, welfare could be improved through technology transfer, and the level of welfare under the fixed-fee licensing regime is higher than that under the royalty licensing regime. Lastly, this paper discusses some extensions of the baseline model.
D45|Quantifying The Impacts Of Limited Supply: The Case Of Nursing Homes| This article develops a new estimation method that accounts for excess demand and the unobserved component of product quality. We apply our method to study the Wisconsin nursing home market in 1999 and find that nearly 20% of elderly qualified for Medicaid were rationed out. However, our counterfactual experiment shows that the net welfare gain of fulfilling all nursing home demands may be small, because the welfare gain could be largely offset by the increase in Medicaid expenditures. We also find that a 1% increase in quality would crowd out 3.2% Medicaid patients in binding nursing homes.
D45|Optimal private good allocation: The case for a balanced budget|In an independent private value auction environment, we are interested in strategy-proof mechanisms that maximize the agents' residual surplus, that is, the utility derived from the physical allocation minus transfers accruing to an external entity. We find that, under the assumption of an increasing hazard rate of type distributions, an optimal deterministic mechanism never extracts any net payments from the agents, that is, it will be budget-balanced. Specifically, optimal mechanisms have a simple “posted price” or “option” form. In the bilateral trade environment, we obtain optimality of posted price mechanisms without any assumption on type distributions.
D45|Auctions with imperfect commitment when the reserve may signal the cost to re-auction|If bidders are uncertain whether the auctioneer sticks to the announced reserve, they respond with strategic non-participation, speculating that the auctioneer may revoke the reserve. However, the reserve inadvertently signals the auctioneer's type, which drives multiplicity of equilibria. Eliminating belief systems that violate the “intuitive criterion” yields a unique equilibrium reserve price equal to the seller's consumption value. Paradoxically, even if bidders initially believe that the auctioneer is bound by his reserve almost with certainty, commitment has no value. Commitment is a shorthand for a high cost to re-auction, which may reflect a concern for reputation. Several variations of the model assess the robustness of our results.
D45|The impact of licensing requirements on industrial organization and labor: Evidence from the U.S. private security market|The consequences of occupational licensing regulations on the private security market are examined. Analysis suggests that these regulations impact the number of private security firms in a state, the distribution of firm size, and the average wage of private security employees. Regulations imposed in some states reduce the number of private security firms, increase the size of firms, and raise average wages in the industry. The hypothesis that some licensing requirements act as barriers to entry is examined, as are arguments that these requirements alleviate asymmetric information problems in the industry.
D45|Sequential rules for house allocation with price restrictions|This paper considers a housing market with price restrictions. On such market, price equilibrium may be excluded for certain preference profiles. However, the existence of a unique minimal rationing price equilibrium has previously been established on a general preference domain that contains “almost all” preference profiles. This type of equilibrium has been demonstrated to be an important ingredient in a direct and strategy-proof allocation mechanism for housing markets with price restrictions. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a finite ascending price sequence that terminates to a minimal rationing price equilibrium. This sequence is demonstrated to play a key-role in an Iterative English Auction Rule for housing markets with price restrictions.
D45|Implementing Efficient Market Structures: The Role of Information Transmission|We extend the literature on the implementation of efficient market structures to private information on marginal costs. We consider a setting with an incumbent and two potential entrants whose costs can be either high or low. By setting the license fee appropriately, the regulator can induce truth-telling by the potential entrants, and can then implement the welfare-maximizing market structure. We distinguish between a disclosure policy , where the regulator reveals the types of entrants before the market game is played, and a concealment policy , where he keeps silent about types. While the concealment policy is predominant in practice, we show that the disclosure policy leads to higher social welfare.
D45|The Assessment Of The Development Phases Of Transnational Corporations|The present study is focused on the analysis of the particularities of the development of the transnational corporations starting with their appearance, which from the historical point of view has passed through several phases. Generalizing the scientific literature study that has been done, was identified the consecutiveness development of the transnational corporations in five major phases. Thus, all large companies are treated as international companies, because by increasing the liberalization of international economic relations is triggered the process of opening the global market and international division of labour. Along with financial capital and technology, TNC transfer through the entrepreneurial capital of the receiver economy and managerial-organizational skills, influencing the competitiveness of firms and the economic performance of host countries.
D45|An Empirical Analysis of Factors Affecting Prices of Intangible Assets: A Preliminary Testing in Consumer Durables Sector|In the last few decades, a valuation of intangible assets is an activity of particular importance, not only because of growing number of transactions with intangibles but for accurate financial reporting as well. In this discipline, a special area is dedicated to the research of different factors that affect the value of intangibles. Royalty rate, a price of the licensed intangible, is a typical measure of an intangible asset´s value. This research paper aims at testing empirically selected factors that have been identifi ed by theoretical literature as well as by licensing practice as relevant in determining the level of royalty rates. For this purpose, a multi-factor linear regression model is built using the latest possible sample of licensing transactions from consumer durables industry from 2002 to 2006. The authors make tests of dependent variable (royalty rate) on financial factors as well as on factors coming from diff erent provisions of licensing agreements. Based on a sample of 67 transactions, the fi nancial factors revealed themselves to be statistically negligible, while some license provisions, in particular the extent of rights granted and the license term appeared to be highly significant in determining the royalty rate level.
D45|Should UI Eligibility Be Expanded to Low-Earning Workers? Evidence on Employment, Transfer Receipt, and Income from Administrative Data|Recent efforts to expand unemployment insurance (UI) eligibility are expected to increase low-earning workers' access to UI. Although the expansion's aim is to smooth the income and consumption of previously ineligible workers, it is possible that UI benefits simply displace other sources of income. Standard economic models predict that UI delays reemployment, thereby reducing wage income. Additionally, low-earning workers are often eligible for benefits from means-tested programs, which may decrease with UI benefits. In this paper, we estimate the impact of UI eligibility on employment, means-tested program participation, and income after job loss using a unique individual-level administrative data set from the state of Michigan. To identify a causal effect, we implement a fuzzy regression discontinuity design around the minimum earnings threshold for UI eligibility. Our main finding is that while UI eligibility increases jobless durations by up to 25 percent and temporarily lowers receipt of cash assistance (TANF) by 63 percent, the net impact on total income is still positive and large. In the quarter immediately following job loss, UI-eligible workers have 46-61 percent higher incomes than ineligibles.
D45|Licensing Innovations: The Case of the Inside Patent Holder|The present paper reconsiders the inside innovatorsâ€™ licensing problem under incomplete information. Employing an optimal mechanism design approach, we show that, contrary to what is claimed in the literature, the optimal mechanism may prescribe fixed fees, royalty rates lower than the cost reduction, and even negative royalty rates.
D45|Contests with small noise and the robustness of the all-pay auction|This paper considers all-pay contests in which the relationship between bids and allocations reflects a small amount of noise. Prior work had focused on one particular equilibrium. However, there may be other equilibria. To address this issue, we introduce a new and intuitive measure for the proximity to the all-pay auction. This allows, in particular, to provide simple conditions under which actually any equilibrium of the contest is both payoff equivalent and revenue equivalent to the unique equilibrium of the corresponding all-pay auction. The results are shown to have powerful implications for monopoly licensing, political lobbying, electoral competition, optimally biased contests, the empirical analysis of rent-seeking, and dynamic contests.
D45|Pooling with Essential and Nonessential Patents|Several recent technological standards were accompanied by patent pools?arrangements to license relevant intellectual property as a package. A key distinction made by regulators?between patents essential to a standard and patents with substitutes?has not been addressed in the theoretical literature. I show that pools of essential patents are always welfare increasing, while pools which include nonessential patents can be welfare reducing?even pools limited to complementary patents and stable under compulsory individual licensing. If pools gain commitment power and price as Stackelberg leaders, this reduces, and can reverse, the gains from welfare increasing pools.
D45|Pro‐competitive Rationing in Multi‐unit Auctions|In multi‐unit auctions, it is necessary to specify rationing rules to break ties between multiple marginal bids. The standard approach is to ration marginal bids proportionally. This article shows how bidding can be made more competitive – and the auctioneer can increase his surplus – if the rationing rule instead gives increasing priority to bidders with a small volume of marginal bids at clearing prices closer to the reservation price. As compared to standard rationing, such a rule can, in beneficial circumstances, have almost the same effect on the competitiveness of bids as a doubling of the number of bidders.
D45|Auctions with imperfect commitment when the reserve may serve as a signal|If bidders are uncertain whether the auctioneer sticks to the announced reserve, some bidders respond by strategic non-participation, speculating that the auctioneer may revoke the reserve. However, the reserve inadvertently signals the auctioneerâ€™s type, which drives a unique separating and a multitude of pooling equilibria. If one eliminates belief systems that violate theâ€œintuitive criterionâ€ , one obtains a unique equilibrium reserve price equal to the sellerâ€™s own valuation. Paradoxically, even if bidders initially believe that the auctioneer is bound by his reserve almost with certainty, commitment has no value.
D45|Optimal contract under brand name collaboration|In an international Cournot duopoly, we determine the optimal contract for a brand name collaboration where the contract consists of fixed-fee and output royalty. We show that the firms always have the incentive for brand name collaboration. However, whether the optimal contract will have positive fixed-fee and positive royalty is not immediate and it depends on the factors such as the transportation cost of exporting and the consumers' initial perception about the products of the firms reflected in the consumers' maximum willingness to pay for the products. Thus, our paper shows that the possibility of brand name collaboration is significantly more than predicted in the existing literature.
D45|Patent licensing in spatial models|We show that a two-part tariff licensing contract is always optimal to the insider patentee in spatial models irrespective of the size of the innovation or any pre-innovation cost asymmetries. The result provides a simple justification of the prevalence of two-part tariff licensing contracts in industries.
D45|Patent strength and optimal two-part tariff licensing with a potential rival|We investigate a two-part tariff licensing contract that enables an incumbent innovator to license the technology for a new product to a potential rival, who may alternatively develop a compatible technology for an imperfectly substitutable product. We identify the optimal two-part tariff licensing contract based on the development cost incurred by the rival, the market parameter, and the substitution coefficient.
D45|Licensing and innovation: A comment|According to Chang et al. (2013), social welfare under licensing is lower than under no-licensing if the R&D efficiency is high. We show that this result is not correct, as when R&D efficiency is high social welfare is higher under licensing than under no-licensing.
D45|Optimal licensing of uncertain patents in the shadow of litigation|This paper investigates the choice of a licensing mechanism by the holder of a patent whose validity is uncertain. We provide sufficient conditions of a general nature under which the licensor prefers to use a per-unit royalty contract. In particular we show that this is the case for the holders of weak patents if the strategic effect of an increase in a potential licensee's unit cost on the equilibrium industry profit is positive. The latter condition is shown to hold in a Cournot (resp. Bertrand) oligopoly with homogeneous (resp. differentiated) products under general assumptions on the demands faced by firms. As a byproduct of our analysis, we contribute to the literature on the cost paradox in oligopoly by offering some new insights of independent interest regarding the effects of cost variations on Cournot and Bertrand equilibria.
D45|Per unit vs. ad valorem royalties under asymmetric information|We study an inside patent holder's optimal licensing policy when it has imperfect information about the value of the patent to its rival. The patent holder can choose any two-part licensing fee with either per unit or ad valorem royalties. We demonstrate that the equilibrium will be either a fully separating contract with different per unit royalty rates, or a contract with a single ad valorem royalty that excludes a high cost rival. Fixed fees will not be used. The presence of asymmetric information uniquely drives the per unit royalties that otherwise would not be adopted. Per unit royalties always generate higher social welfare than ad valorem royalties.
D45|A dynamic auction for multi-object procurement under a hard budget constraint|This contribution revisits the problem of allocating R&D subsidies by government agencies. Typically, the applicants’ financial constraints are private information. The literature has recommended the use of auctions in order to reduce information rents and thus improve the efficiency of how scarce public funds are allocated. We propose a new open clock auction for this procurement problem. This auction is strategically simple, as it exhibits truthtelling in dominant strategies and satisfies ex-post rationality, while observing the budget constraint. We test the auction in Monte-Carlo simulation and discuss its applicability and limitations. Moreover, we highlight connections to recent advances in computer science.
D45|Measuring inflation under rationing: A virtual price approach|The presence of rationing or more generally of the situations of constrained demand can make the traditional methods of measuring inflation questionable and give an erroneous image of the reality. In this paper, we use the virtual price approach (Neary, Roberts, 1980) to estimate the real inflation level in a centrally planned economy (CPE) with administrated prices. In the first part of the paper, we discuss various methods used in CPE's to evaluate the real level of inflation by the market disequilibrium indicators or proxies which take into account rationing and incomplete information. In the second part of the paper, we apply the virtual price approach to compute the real inflationist gap between demand and supply under rationing in Poland's centrally planned economy with administrated prices in 1965-1980 period. We estimate for this period the model of consumer behaviour under rationing and recover the virtual prices reflecting the real cost of purchasing rationed goods following Neary, Roberts' (1980) and Barten's (1994) methodology. The results show a very large difference between official and virtual price of food considered as the most rationed good (up to 500%). The natural experiment of shift from the centrally planned economy to the market economy (or from rationing to market equilibrium) observed in Poland during the “shock therapy” (1990) confirms the scale of estimated by the model gap between the official (administrated) and market prices
D45|State intervention and the microcredit market: the role of business development services|We analyze in this paper how various forms of state intervention can impact microfinance institutions’ lending behavior. Using a simple model where entrepreneurs receive individual uncollateralized loans, we show that, not surprisingly, state intervention through the loan guarantee increases the number of entrepreneurs receiving a loan. However, after modeling business development services (BDS) provided by the microfinance institution, we show that the loan guarantee can have a counterproductive effect by reducing the number of entrepreneurs benefiting from such services. We therefore analyze an alternative policy: BDS subsidization. We show that if BDS are efficient enough and are targeted toward less performing borrowers, then—for fixed government expenditures—such subsidies do better in terms of financial inclusion than the loan guarantee. Moreover, we argue that—under similar conditions—BDS subsidization alone does better in terms of financial inclusion than a mix of policies. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
D45|Licensing under convex costs|We show that both the outside and inside innovators license a new product (or drastic process innovation) to all potential licensees in the presence of convex costs, which occur under decreasing returns to scale technologies. An implication of our analysis is that a monopolist producer may prefer technology licensing in a homogeneous goods industry. We also show that an inside innovator’s incentive for innovation may be higher than that of an outside innovator. Copyright Springer-Verlag Wien 2014
D45|Interest group incentives for post-lottery trade restrictions|The rights to use publicly-managed natural resources are sometimes distributed by lottery, and typically these rights are nontransferable. Prohibition of post-lottery permit transfers discourages applicants from entering the lottery solely for profitable permit sale, so only those who personally value the use of the resource apply. However, because permits are distributed randomly and trade is restricted, permits may not be used by those who value them most. We argue that restrictions on permit transfers is a policy response designed to limit entry when interest group membership is not distinguishable ex ante, and characterize the economic/informational conditions under which post-lottery prohibitions on trade are likely to arise. We develop our model using the specific case of the Four Rivers Lottery used to allocate rafting permits on four river sections in Idaho. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
D45|Eco-Technology Licensing under Emission Tax: Royalty vs. Fixed-Fee|This article considers the licensing strategies of eco-technology when an innovator provides pollution abatement goods to oligopolistic polluting firms that produce consumption goods and emit environmental pollutants. In the presence of emission tax, two types of licensing contracts, royalty and fixed-fee, are examined to analyze market equilibrium and to compare their welfare consequences. We show that an eco-innovator provides a non-exclusive license under a royalty contract while it might exclude polluting firms under the fixed-fee licensing contract. However, when mixed licensing contract where royalty and fixed-fee contracts are combined together is available, we show that ecoinnovator provides non-exclusive license. We also show that, compared to royalty licensing, exclusive fixed-fee contract will increase the welfare but its welfare effect depends on the level of emission tax. Finally, we derive the optimal emission tax and show that an appropriate emission tax combined with non-exclusion policy or profit-cap regulation can increase the welfare.

D45|Technology transfer and its effect on innovation|This paper analyses the relationship of technology transfer and innovation in a Cournot duopoly framework, where technology transfer between the firms may occur after the innovation decision is taken by the high cost firm. The possibility of licensing via fixed-fee or royalty, encourages (discourages) innovation if the cost difference between the firms is high (low). Hence, it is shown that technology transfer and innovation are substitutes (complements) if the cost difference between the firms is low (high).
D45|On the number of licenses under symmetric versus asymmetric information with signaling|We analyze a two-period licensing game in which a non-producer upstream patent holder licenses an innovation to either one or two downstream licensees for a payment based on the licensee’s expected per-period profit. Licensees have private information about the innovation’s value, and their period-1 output may signal that value. We find that two licensees are more likely to be preferred under asymmetric information with signalling than under symmetric information.
D45|Fee versus royalty licensing in spatial Cournot competition|This article investigates the optimal licensing mechanism in a spatial model where competitors set quantities and one firm owns a cost-reducing innovation. We show that when the firms spatially discriminate, the innovator gets higher profits by licensing through royalties instead than through a fixed fee, whereas in the case of uniform delivered quantities, the innovator prefers licensing by royalties (fixed fee) if and only if it has not (has) a sufficiently strong locational disadvantage with respect to the potential licensee.

D45|Licensing a common value innovation when signaling strength may backfire|This paper reconsiders the licensing of a common value innovation to a downstream duopoly, assuming firms observe imperfect signals of the cost reduction induced by the innovation. The innovator adopts a direct revelation mechanism and awards an unrestricted license to the firm that reports the highest signal and a royalty contract to the other. Firms may signal strength to their rivals through exaggerated messages, which may however backfire, and give rise to higher royalty payments. We provide sufficient conditions for truthful implementation, and for the profitability of adding royalty contracts to what is otherwise a first-price license auction.

D45|Security bid auctions for agency contracts|A principal uses security bid auctions to award an incentive contract to one among several agents in the presence of hidden action and hidden information. Securities range from cash to equity and call options. “Steeper” securities are better surplus extractors, yet reduce effort incentives. In view of this trade-off, a hybrid share auction that includes a cash reward to the winner, a minimum share, and an option to call a fixed wage contract, tends to outperform all other auctions, although it is not an optimal mechanism. However, by adding output targets a hybrid share auction can (arbitrary closely) implement the optimal mechanism. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014
D45|Optimal bid disclosure in license auctions with downstream interaction|The literature on license auctions for process innovations in oligopoly assumed that the auctioneer reveals the winning bid and stressed that this gives firms an incentive to signal strength through their bids, to the benefit of the innovator. In the present paper we examine whether revealing the winning bid is optimal. We consider three disclosure rules: full, partial, and no disclosure of bids, which correspond to standard auctions. We show that more information disclosure increases the total surplus divided between firms and the innovator as well as social surplus. More disclosure also increases biddersâ€™ payoff. However, no disclosure maximizes the innovatorâ€™s expected revenue.
D45|Elastic contests and the robustness of the all-pay auctions|This paper studies a large class of imperfectly discriminating contests, referred to as elastic contests, that induce players to either overbid a standing bid or to abstain from bidding altogether. Many common forms of contest are elastic. In any equilibrium of an elastic contest, there is complete rent dissipation for all but at most one player. This result is used to show that in any suffciently decisive anonymous standard contest, any equilibrium is an all-pay auction equilibrium. Thus, the analysis offers strong support for the robustness of the all-pay auction. The approach also delivers definite answers regarding the extent of rent dissipation in Tullock contests with intermediate values of the decisiveness parameter.
D45|Measuring the Efficiency of an FCC Spectrum Auction|We propose a method to structurally estimate the deterministic component of bidder valuations in FCC spectrum auctions, and apply it to the 1995-1996 C block auction. We base estimation on a pairwise stability condition: two bidders cannot exchange two licenses in a way that increases the sum of their valuations. Pairwise stability holds in some theoretical models of simultaneous ascending auctions under intimidatory collusion and demand reduction. Pairwise stability results in a matching game approach to estimation. We find that a system of four large regional licenses would raise the allocative efficiency of the C block outcome by 48 percent.

D45|Assignment of Arrival Slots|Industry participants agree that, when inclement weather forces the FAA to reassign airport landing slots, incentives and property rights should be respected. We show that the FAA's Compression algorithm is incentive compatible, but fails to guarantee a form of property rights. This is significant since these conditions were the motivation for introducing Compression a decade ago. We give an alternative mechanism that does satisfy these conditions. It has the flavor of Top Trading Cycle variants of Abdulkadiroğlu and Sönmez (1999) and Pápai (2000) for related but distinct models. Finally, both mechanisms may fail another condition: the incentive to vacate unusable landing slots. (JEL D45, D82, L93, L98, P14, R41)
D45|Patents as Options: Path-Dependency and Patent Value| Enabled by the Bayh-Dole Act (1980), universities license access to innovations protected by US patents. Despite the growing importance of license revenue to cash- strapped land-grant universities that generate a large share of agricultural innovations, there has been no formal attempt to determine an optimal pricing strategy for patent licenses. We recognize that patents are options on the stream of future revenues, and apply option-valuation techniques to determine optimal pricing strategies for university technology o¢ cers. We nd that path-dependency in license revenue streams creates signi cant di¤erences in the optimal pricing strategy relative to more standard risk- neutral pricing models, but that path-dependent pricing more nearly approximates ob- served patent prices. While non-path dependent prices yield conventional sensitivities to volatility, mean-reversion and returns-growth, path-dependent prices show highly non-linear comparative statics. These results are important both for patent licensees, and for licensors seeking to maximize license revenue.
D45|License prices for financially constrained firms|It is often alleged that high auction prices inhibit service deployment. We investigate this claim under the extreme case of financially constrained bidders. If demand is just slightly elastic, auctions maximize consumer surplus if consumer surplus is a convex function of quantity (a common assumption), or if consumer surplus is concave and the proportion of expenditure spent on deployment is greater than one over the elasticity of demand. The latter condition appears to be true for most of the large telecom auctions in the US and Europe. Thus, even if high auction prices inhibit service deployment, auctions appear to be optimal from the consumers' point of view.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D45|Bargaining and delay in patent licensing|We consider a model of licensing of a non-drastic innovation in which the patent holder (an outside innovator) negotiates either up-front fixed fees or per-unit royal- ties with two firms producing horizontally differentiated brands and competing à la Cournot. We investigate how licensing schemes (fixed fee or per-unit royalty) and the number of licenses sold (exclusive licensing or complete technology diffusion) affect price agreements and delays in reaching an agreement. We show that the patent holder prefers to license by means of up-front fixed fees except if market competition is mild and the innovation size is small. Once there is private information about the relative bargaining power of the parties, the patent holder may prefer licensing by means of per-unit royalties even if market competition is strong. Moreover, the delay in reaching an agreement is greater whenever the patent holder chooses to negotiate up-front fixed fees instead of per-unit royalties.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D45|Structural reform of the road haulage sector|This study presents the implementation progress of the post-2010 reform in the road haulage sector of Greece that removed earlier regulatory barriers to competition. The legislative interventions since 2010 are reviewed in light of the international best practices and are assessed in terms of how they addressed the poor outcomes of the road haulage sector. The study concludes that further policy actions are required in view of best practices and present conjucture in order to fully capitalize the on the structural reform of road haulage.
D45|The impact of the current crisis on private returns to education in Greece|This paper explores the relationship between the position of individuals in the labour market (employment characteristics and wages) and their education level in order to determine the private returns to education in Greece. Specifically, the focus is on the impact of the crisis on the returns to education. The main conclusions of the study are: (i) the crisis has increased the probability of unemployment for all, though generally those with more education have suffered less; (ii) higher unemployment has reduced wages, especially for men and for those with a postgraduate degree; and (iii) education, even after adjusting for unemployment risk, continues to yield high returns in the crisis period. Thus, even in the crisis, tertiary education graduates enjoy better prospects in the labour market than lower education level graduates.
D45|Royalty Rate Determination|Courts require royalty rate calculations based on rigorous economic foundations. The licensing literature provides limited guidance for royalty rate determination, leaving appraisal report readers wanting a more tangible and objective lens through which to judge the credibility of royalty rate analyses. This article develops the standard, core model for calculating market royalty rates for intangible asset licenses where royalty rates are determined ex ante in the actual market, or ex post in a hypothetical market under a Market Value Standard. The model forms a consistent basis for performing and evaluating licensing royalty appraisals. Not being distracted with the question of how to combine the input values when calculating a royalty rate, the court can focus on understanding and verifying an appraiser’s calculations of the input variable values.
D45|Disequilibrium in the Indian Registered Manufacturing Sector-A Simulated Maximum Likelihood Analysis|How a macroeconomic policy package is designed depends critically on whether the economy in question is supply constrained or demand constrained. In simple terms, this may often be seen in terms of whether the policies should try to augment demand or to raise productive capacity. The question is relevant to objectives of growth as well as stability. In the present study, we examine this problem with regard to the registered manufacturing sector in India, within a framework of market disequilibrium for the period 1980 through 2007. The maximum simulated likelihood approach used by us indicates that the registered manufacturing sector in India has largely been demand-constrained over the entire period of analysis.

D45|Chile: congestión portuaria y racionamiento eficiente en la transferencia de carga|El sistema de precios difícilmente puede eliminar la congestión en la transferencia de carga portuaria en períodos de máxima afluencia (peak), pues el uso del puerto no depende tanto de factores estacionales como sobre todo de la llegada simultánea de barcos, situación que conduce al racionamiento de su uso. En este artículo se muestra que el racionamiento eficiente debe hacerse de acuerdo con el valor de la carga transferida más que según el orden de arribo de las naves (first-come-first-served ). Se evidencia que en un racionamiento eficiente se da prioridad a la carga en contenedores, luego a la fraccionada y por último a la carga en graneles. Se aplican estos resultados a la transferencia de carga en el puerto concesionado de San Antonio Terminal Internacional de Chile.
D45|Chile: Port congestion and efficient rationing in cargo transfer operations|No pricing system is likely to be able to do away with congestion in port cargo transfer operations at peak times, since port use is determined not so much by seasonal factors as, first and foremost, by the simultaneous arrival of vessels, which results in rationing. This article shows that rationing, to be efficient, needs to go by the value of the cargo transferred rather than following a first-come-first-served rule. It demonstrates that efficient rationing gives priority to containerized cargo, followed by break bulk cargo, with bulk cargo in last place. These findings are applied to cargo transfer at the San Antonio Terminal Internacional franchised port in Chile.
D45|Patent licensing under cost asymmetry among firms|This paper extends Poddar and Sinha's (2010) duopolistic model to an oligopolistic model consisting of three cost differential firms engaging in Cournot competition. The focus of the paper is on the impact of the differences in efficiency among the three firms on the choices of the patentee's optimal licensing contract. By confining the number of licenses to one license only, the paper derives a more comprehensive result than that in Poddar and Sinha (2010). In addition, it shows that the insider patentee may choose pure fixed-fee, mixed or pure royalty licensing regardless of licensing to one or two licensees. This paper also proves that the optimal licensing contract can be either exclusive or non-exclusive, depending upon the relative cost advantage between the two licensees.
D45|Efficient mechanisms for access to storage when competition in gas markets is imperfect|Scarce storage capacity and distortions in access to storage can lead to market foreclosure in liberalized gas markets. We consider rules currently adopted in Europe for storage allocation, and discuss efficient rationing mechanisms as based on the value of storage, when other flexibility inputs are partially available. We initially analyze productive efficiency issues, without explicitly considering vertical restraints. We then assume imperfect competition in the downstream market for gas supplies, given the availability of storage capacity upstream, and analyze strategic behavior in a two-stage model. In this framework we compare regulated storage tariffs — coupled with a centralized rationing mechanism — with storage auctions. Finally, we consider the allocation of storage that arises from welfare maximization by a benevolent social planner. We find that it is usually optimal to maximize the amount of storage capacity allocated to new entrants in liberalized gas markets. Storage auctions deviate from the optimal mechanism, but still afford greater efficiency than do rules that allocate storage capacity independently of its value. Furthermore, storage allocation appears to be a powerful mechanism with which to improve competition and efficiency in gas markets.
D45|Licensing process innovations when losersʼ messages determine royalty rates|We consider a licensing mechanism for process innovations that awards a limited number of unrestricted licenses to those firms that report the highest cost reductions, combined with royalty licenses to others. Firmsʼ messages are dual signals of their cost reductions: the message of those who win an unrestricted license signals their cost reduction to rival firms, while losersʼ messages influence the royalty rate set by the innovator. We explain why a sufficiently high threshold level for awarding the unrestricted license is essential to induce truth-telling, show that the innovator generally benefits from the proposed mechanism, and derive conditions for implementability by a modified second-price auction.
D45|Market and non-market mechanisms for the optimal allocation of scarce resources|A number of identical objects is allocated to a set of privately informed agents. Agents have linear utility in money. The designer wants to assign objects to agents that possess specific traits, but the allocation can only be conditioned on the willingness to pay and on observable characteristics. I solve for the optimal mechanism. The choice between market or non-market mechanisms depends on the statistical linkage between characteristics valued by the designer and willingness to pay.
D45|Efficient assignment mechanisms for liquidity-constrained agents|We study alternative methods of assigning scarce resources to individuals who may be liquidity-constrained. Selling the resources via auctions is increasingly popular, but that method may produce an inefficient allocation when agents are liquidity constrained. A simple non-market scheme such as random assignment does better, if resale is allowed, since individuals with a high valuation but low liquidity are more likely to be assigned initially, and recipients with low valuations will resell to those with high valuations. Similarly, a need-based assignment scheme favoring those with low liquidity enhances welfare. Lotteries with entry fees could also be desirable. The optimal mechanism displays features of the non-market schemes such as in-kind and cash subsidies.
D45|Tax havens or tax hells? A discussion of the historical roots and present consequences of tax havens|Tax havens are not recent phenomena. However, in contrast to historical precedents, tax havens in the age of mobile capital allow for non-consensual transfers and are not profitable for every citizen. We discuss the four main groups of tax havens (former Western possessions, sovereign nations, countries controlled by cartels, and emerging economies). This article also synthesizes the history of tax havens and describes their current heterogeneity, discussing the main methods available to regulate tax haven flows. Some of the most efficient methods involve unilateral measures (such as the Fiscal Transparency of Outland Societies) but also encompass multilateral measures (such as Tax Harmonization and the Request for Information).
D45|Demand reduction and preemptive bidding in multi-unit license auctions|Multi-unit ascending auctions allow for equilibria in which bidders strategically reduce their demand and split the market at low prices. At the same time, they allow for preemptive bidding by incumbent bidders in a coordinated attempt to exclude entrants from the market. We consider an environment where both demand reduction and preemptive bidding are supported as equilibrium phenomena of the ascending auction. In a series of experiments, we compare its performance to that of the discriminatory auction. Strategic demand reduction is quite prevalent in the ascending auction even when entry imposes a (large) negative externality on incumbents. As a result, the ascending auction performs worse than the discriminatory auction both in terms of revenue and efficiency, while entrants’ chances are similar across the two formats.

D45|Implementation of the Maximum Sustainable Yield under an Age-Structured Model|One of the main goals stated in the proposals for the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform is achieving maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for all European fisheries by 2015. In this paper, we consider the mechanism design problem for allocation of fishing rights to achieve MSY harvesting conditions. We study an age-structured fish population model and apply this model for a fishing environment including two fishermen having perfect or imperfect fishing selectivity. If we assume that fishermen are non-satiated and they fulfill their remaining quotas through capturing untargeted (less revenue-generating) fish after targeted fish population is fully caught, the fix ratio of the catch of targeted fish to untargeted fish, derived from catchability coefficients, is not valid anymore. As a result, we show that not only the age-structure or fishing technology but also the estimated level of MSY is steering the optimal allocation of quotas. Accordingly, we determine technology-based optimal quota shares for each fisherman at particular MSY levels. We also show that the optimal allocation of fishing quotas does not have a bang-bang nature under imperfect fishing selectivity.
D45|¿Puerto o playa? Un análisis económico del conflicto entre la ciudad de Trujillo y el puerto de Salaverry|Salaverry es un pequeño puerto localizado a pocos kilómetros de la ciudad de Trujillo, al norte del Perú. Moviliza alrededor de 2.5 millones de toneladas de carga al año, en su mayoría, granel seco. Desde 1982, ENAPU, la empresa estatal que opera el puerto, ha venido reduciendo sus costos de dragado mediante el alargamiento de un molón retenedor de arena, solución que ha alterado el equilibrio dinámico de la costa y causado la virtual desaparición de las playas de Trujillo. Desde el punto de vista de las políticas públicas, el problema se vuelve aún más complejo si se toma en cuenta el alto costo de las obras necesarias para detener la erosión de las playas (US$ 150 millones), el incremento de la demanda por más y mejores servicios ambientales, y lo poco probable que resulta concesionar al sector privado una operación que genera una externalidad negativa tan seria. El objetivo de este estudio es el de examinar el conflicto entre el puerto de Salaverry y la ciudad de Trujillo desde el punto de vista económico, y determinar cuál es su solución más eficiente mediante análisis determinísticos y probabilísticos desde los puntos de vista público y privado. Los resultados indican que: (i) el terminal portuario de Salaverry no genera recursos suficientes para operar sin un subsidio, menos aún para pagar el costo de la reparación ambiental; (ii) para concesionar el terminal al sector privado, el gobierno deberá otorgar un subsidio cercano a los US$ 25 millones; y, (iii) cerrar el puerto no es recomendable, pues si bien mantenerlo operativo le costaría a la sociedad US$ 175 millones, cerrarlo le generaría costos por US$ 322 millones.
D45|Decreasing Returns, Patent Licensing, and Price-Reducing Taxes|This paper proposes simple tax policies that can alleviate the distortive effectsof royalties. We consider a Cournot duopoly under decreasing returns where oneof the firms has a patented technology that it can license to its rival using combinations of royalties and fixed fees. Under optimal licensing policies for the patentee, stronger diseconomies of scale result in lower market prices. It is possible to construct tax-transfer schemes for the firms that are Pareto-improving as well as deficit-neutral, i.e., these taxes lower market prices and collect sufficient revenue to compensate firms for their losses from taxation without incurring any deficit.

D45|Rationing and deprivation: disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis in the United Kingdom|Unlike other industrialised countries, the UK deferred the routine introduction of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for multiple sclerosis (MS) in favour of an experiment. Between 2002 and 2005, MS sufferers were identified, were offered DMTs only if deemed suitable by their physicians, and were monitored thereafter to assess long-term outcomes. It has been demonstrated for other therapies that judgements about suitability to receive treatment are conditioned by the patient’s deprivation status. We hypothesised that this would have been the case for DMTs also. Using individual patient data for samples in Nottingham and in Glasgow, we matched patients’ postcodes of residence with deprivation scores and confirmed that patients from more deprived areas were less likely to have been prescribed DMTs. A more detailed analysis of the Nottingham data revealed two channels through which this outcome was effected. First, people from less-deprived areas were more likely to possess clinical characteristics, such as less severe disease severity and shorter duration of the disease, that enhanced their suitability for treatment. Second, the analysis of the clinical notes detailing patients’ correspondence with the medical teams suggested that less-deprived people were more able to exercise a voice capable of influencing physicians’ prescribing decisions.

D45|Auctions with imperfect commitment when the reserve may signal the auctioneer's type|"If bidders are uncertain whether the auctioneer sticks to the announced reserve, some bidders respond by not bidding, speculating that the auctioneer may revoke the reserve. However, the reserve inadvertently signals the auctioneer's type, which drives a unique separating and a multitude of pooling equilibria. If one eliminates belief systems that violate the ""intuitive criterion"", one obtains a unique equilibrium reserve price equal to the seller's own valuation. Paradoxically, even if bidders initially believe that the auctioneer is bound by his reserve almost with certainty, commitment has no value."
D45|Analyzing the Extent and Influence of Occupational Licensing on the Labor Market|This study examines occupational licensing in the United States using a specially designed national labor force survey. Estimates from the survey indicated that 35% of employees were either licensed or certified by the government and that 29% were licensed. Another 3% stated that all who worked in their job would eventually be required to be certified or licensed, bringing the total that are or eventually must be licensed or certified by government to 38%. We find that licensing is associated with about 18% higher wages but that the effect of governmental certification on pay is much smaller.
