F59|Globalisation and Female Economic Participation in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study assesses the relationship between globalisation and the economic participation of women (EPW) in 47 Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 1990-2013. EPW is measured with the female labour force participation and employment rates. The empirical evidence is based on Panel-corrected Standard Errors and Fixed Effects regressions. The findings show that the positive effect of the overall globalisation index on EPW is dampened by its political component and driven by its economic and social components, with a higher positive magnitude from the former or economic globalisation. For the most part, the findings are robust to the control for several structural and institutional characteristics. An extended analysis by unbundling globalisation shows that the positive incidence of social globalisation is driven by information flow (compared to personal contact and cultural proximity) while the positive effect of economic globalisation is driven by actual flows (relative to restrictions). Policy implications are discussed with some emphasis on how to elevate women’s social status and potentially reduce their victimisation to male dominance.

F59|Brexit: balance de situación y perspectivas|Tras casi tres años desde que se anunciara la celebración del referéndum sobre la permanencia del Reino Unido en la Unión Europea (UE) y dos de intensas negociaciones entre las partes, la no ratificación del Parlamento británico del acuerdo alcanzado por su Gobierno y por el resto de los socios europeos en noviembre del año pasado ha dado lugar a una situación extraordinariamente compleja, en la que, a escasos días de que se cumpla el plazo (el 29 de marzo de 2019) para la salida del Reino Unido establecido con la activación del artículo 50, no se vislumbra todavía un plan de consenso. A falta de una alternativa pactada, la salida sin acuerdo en la fecha prevista constituye —salvo prórroga— la actual opción por defecto. Este documento ocasional hace balance de la situación actual y de las perspectivas que se abren en relación con el proceso de salida del Reino Unido de la UE, y recopila y actualiza algunos trabajos que se han venido realizando, en relación con el seguimiento regular de dicho proceso y con la estimación de sus potenciales efectos en la economía española, en la Dirección General de Economía y Estadística del Banco de España. Tras tomar nota del momento actual del proceso negociador, el documento revisa la evolución de la economía británica desde que se anunciara el inesperado resultado del referéndum en junio de 2016, así como las perspectivas económicas a medio plazo del país, que dependerán ante todo del tipo de relación comercial que se establezca en un futuro entre ambas áreas, así como de la manera más o menos abrupta en que se produzca la salida. En relación con nuestro país, en este documento se analizan diversos aspectos relativos a la exposición comercial y financiera de la economía española al Reino Unido, y se estiman, mediante el modelo trimestral del Banco de España (MTBE), los posibles efectos que el brexit podría tener sobre nuestra economía en diversos escenarios hipotéticos. Finalmente, se recuerdan las medidas de contingencia que la Comisión Europa y el Gobierno de España han adoptado, en sus respectivos ámbitos, ante la eventualidad de que la salida del Reino Unido se produjera sin acuerdo y de forma brusca.
F59|Cooperation in the climate commons|This paper surveys the existing empirical evidence on the scope for cooperation in the climate commons and on the effectiveness of possible interventions to spur it. Given the global public good properties of climate change mitigation, mitigation efforts have to rely on the willingness of individuals to contribute voluntarily to this public good, by reducing the demand on the environmental commons either in the form of ‘green’ consumer behaviour or through the acceptance of costly climate policy. Both are likely to be necessary. The authors survey evidence that suggests a central role for local social norms in the provision of global public goods. They discuss the importance of the visibility of norms and the role of beliefs when such visibility is lacking, concluding that some actors may behave as conditional cooperators when confronted with global dilemmas, similarly to what takes place in the local commons.
F59|Agent Orange: Trump, Soft Power, and Exports|A country's exports rise when its leadership is approved by other countries. I show this using a standard gravity model of bilateral exports, a panel of data from 2006 through 2017, and an annual Gallup survey which asks people in up to 157 countries about whether they approve of the job performance of the leadership of China, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Holding other things constant, a country's exports are higher if its leadership is approved by the importer, since; 'soft power' promotes exports. The Gallup effect is statistically and economically significant; a one percent increase in leadership approval raises exports by around .66 percent. This effect is reasonably robust and different measures of soft power deliver similar results. I conservatively estimate that the >20 percentage point decline in foreign approval of American leadership between 2016 (Obama's last year) and 2017 (Trump's first year) lowered American exports by at least .2% or >$3 billion.
F59|Modeling the drugs and guns trade in a two-country model with endogenous growth|This paper develops a two-country, dynamic general equilibrium model of endogenous growth with illicit drugs and guns trade. With a trade framework that unies both drug-control policies in consuming- and producing-country, as well as explicit modeling of firearm trade, the model is solved and parameterized to study the dynamic trade-off and growth effects of various drug-control policies. A production-consumption growth trade-off not previously documented in the literature is found. Further, under different conditions, and depending on the resulting gain in formal trade expansion, there are economic rationale to either a prohibitive or liberalization drug-control policy.
F59|One-In, X-Out: Regulatory offsetting in selected OECD countries|Governments are increasingly trying to limit the costs of regulatory compliance. One of the approaches that has been gaining ground in the last five years is the “one-in, x-out rule”, or the offsetting of regulatory costs stemming from new regulations by reducing the existing regulatory stock. This paper presents examples of regulatory offsetting approaches in selected OECD countries. By comparing the different approaches and discussing their key features, the paper provides guidance to countries considering introducing regulatory offsetting. This paper finds that there are many methodological and implementation issues that need to be resolved before a government decides to use a one-in, x-out approach as part of its regulatory policy. Key suggestions for countries introducing regulatory offsetting include i) ensuring a solid methodology for calculating regulatory costs; ii) linking the responsibility for finding offsets to the “owners” of regulation; iii) setting up quality oversight mechanisms; iv) securing strong political commitment and support and v) implementing regulatory offsetting as a complement to other regulatory management tools.
F59|The Fracturing of Globalization: Implications of Economic Resentments and Geopolitical Contradictions| In this comprehensive piece about the future of globalization, geopolitical competition will be a deciding factor. Until recently, the United States imposed what the author calls a neoliberal template on global trade. Today, this template is challenged in several ways and may well come apart. There will be regional integrations and adjustments as a result.
F59|Distortions in aid allocation of United Nations flash appeals: Evidence from the 2015 Nepal earthquake|We examine the role of local need and various distortions in the design and implementation of United Nations flash appeal triggered in response to the destructive 2015 Nepal earthquake. Specifically, we investigate the extent to which the allocation of this humanitarian assistance follows municipalities' affectedness and their physical and socio-economic vulnerabilities, as rapidly reducing suffering is the intended goal of flash appeals. We then analyze potential ethnic, religious, and political distortions. We alternatively consider the proposed project number, the proposed financial amount, and the subsequent funding decision by aid donors. Our results show that aid allocation is associated with geophysical estimates of the disaster's destructiveness, but shows little regard for the specific socio-economic and physical vulnerabilities conditional on destruction. It is worrisome that the allocation of the flash appeal commitments favors municipalities dominated by higher castes and disadvantages those with a greater distance to the Nepali capital Kathmandu.
F59|Does private aid follow the flag? An empirical analysis of humanitarian assistance|"Little is known about foreign aid provided by private donors. This paper contributes to closing this research gap by comparing the allocation of private humanitarian aid to that of official humanitarian aid awarded to 140 recipient countries over the 2000-2016 period. We construct a new database that offers information on the country in which the headquarters of private donors are located to test whether private donors follow the aid allocation pattern of their home country. Our empirical results confirm that private aid ""follows the flag."" This finding is robust against the inclusion of various fixed effects, estimating instrumental variables models, and disaggregating private aid into corporate aid and NGO aid. Donor country-specific estimations reveal that private aid from China, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States ""follow the flag""."
F59|Understanding protectionism: Empirical analysis of protectionist attitudes in the EU|A changing landscape in trade policy in recent years is undoubtedly related to changing voter preferences. Based on Eurobarometer survey data, the present paper investigates both the factors determining the level of support for protectionism and the striking inconsistency of responses to questions related to free trade and protectionism. EU citizens are more likely to support protectionism when the economy runs smoothly and rejects protectionism if the national economy is not in the best shape. Unemployment, bad economic situations as well as negative feelings regarding immigration are identified as possible reasons to call for protectionism while respondents are favouring free trade at the same time. The inconsistent attitudes toward free trade and protectionism are a matter of lacking knowledge of political issues. Better educated EU citizens are all less likely to support free trade and protectionism at the same time. This applies to respondents who show a higher level of knowledge regarding basic EU-related facts as well as to those who discuss political matters with friends more often. A possible way to tackle this problem is a broad information strategy covering the topics of international econom-ics across several media channels. Especially radio, press and internet are identified as media which seem to contribute to a better understanding of these complex issues.
F59|Indonesian Business Environment - VOC Model and Local Culture|Our presentation focuses on the structure of Indonesian political economy and how local form of capitalism is underpinned by social relations and culture. Specifically, in our research, we: i) analyze Indonesian business environment through the Varieties of Capitalism (henceforth VOC) model as developed by Hall and Soskice, ii) look into the reform and dynamic changes of Indonesian business environment following 1997 crisis in East Asia through the lens of VOC model, and iii) examine how Indonesian form of capitalism is underpinned by local culture by the use of GLOBE Project and Hofstede dimensions of culture. Our findings suggest that the case of Indonesia can be presented as a special type of a coordinated market economy driven by local culture with some aspects of liberal market economy, which are, to a large extent, imported from the outside. Our research also shows that the influence of international business environment and globalization combined with post-1997-crisis reform push Indonesian economy further towards modes of coordination more typical for liberal market economies, causing tensions among various actors of local political economy. Considering limited body of literature on the topic, the main contributions of our research is twofold. First, to study Indonesian form of capitalism, we apply a VOC model and connect local form of capitalism with socio-cultural characteristics of the country. Second, we apply VOC model to look at the interplay between domestic forces shaping local political economy and the influence of international environment and globalization largely reflecting (neo)liberal view of economic and business relations.
F59|The Internet and the grassroots foundation of civil society in Indochina|It is widely believed that the social contract, credited to Magna Carta of Englandin the 13th century and subsequent thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes, JohnLocke, is the major factor that has empowered the concept of civil society in theworld, starting from the West. This perspective paper suggests that althoughthat still holds to a large extent, the case of Indochina shows a diametrical, andunnatural, difference as civic engagement in social matters of deep influence wasborn out of the state’s necessity to tolerate diverging voices, either bycontrolling, empowering or engaging, in order to cope with social conflicts. Thisobservation gives rise to the need for further studies on the nature of theinformation-power nexus in the age of big data and social networks.
F59|Fluctuations in renewable electricity supply: Gains from international trade through infrastructure?|113 countries report producing electricity from non-hydro renewable sources and thereby participate in the global energy transition. This paper shows through a dynamic panel data analysis that imports of electric currents have increased and exports have decreased through the higher share of renewables in electricity production, controlling for other factors. On the one hand more cables have been built recently; but on the other hand some countries are blocking electricity shocks technologically as they suffer from free trade temporarily when receiving supply shocks. This shows that trade currently helps dealing with fluctuations of supply, but temporary losses for recipients of shocks may require payments to leave the borders open.
F59|Passport, please! Travels, travails and trade| A country’s visa policies are widely assumed to have economic consequences. In this short paper, I examine the effect of the ease with which a country’s citizens can enter foreign countries on international trade. Using a specification of the gravity model that avoids the endogeneity problems that typically arise when analyzing the association between ease of travel and the extent of bilateral interactions, I find that countries which issue powerful passports experience more international trade.
F59|The effects of foreign aid on refugee flows|We investigate whether foreign aid affects refugee flows from recipient countries. Combining refugee data on 141 origin countries over the 1976–2013 period with bilateral Official Development Assistance data, we estimate the causal effects of a country’s aid receipts on both total refugee flows to the world and flows to donor countries. The interaction of donor-government fractionalization and a recipient country’s probability of receiving aid provides a powerful and excludable instrumental variable (IV) when we control for country- and time-fixed effects that capture the levels of the interacted variables. Though our IV results suggest that aid induces recipient governments to encourage the return of their citizens, we find no evidence that aid reduces worldwide refugee outflows or flows to donor countries in the short term. However, we observe long-run effects after four three-year periods, which appear to be driven by lagged positive effects of aid on growth.
F59|"The relationship between the Chinese ""going out"" strategy and international trade"|This study is the first to estimate a system of simultaneous gravity equations for Chinese exports, imports and foreign direct investment (FDI) using a sample of 167 countries over the period 2003-2012. The main results indicate that trade and outward FDI are complementary. In particular, the authors show that outward Chinese FDI is related to higher exports and imports and that China trades more with countries hosting Chinese FDI. Results are also robust to the use of instrumental variables. Therefore, Chinese investment seems to foster trade.
F59|Government Ideology and Arms Exports|The relationship between ideology and government decisions is a major field of research in economics and political sciences. Particularly the influence of government ideology on security issues of special interest. This paper analyses the relationship between government orientation and arms exports. Therefore, bilateral trade data for conventional weapons is regressed on data of government orientation. The results indicate that left-wing governments are more likely to grant arms export licences than governments of other partisan orientation. The finding is robust to the inclusion of control variables checking for further characteristics of the exporter government. Including interaction terms shows, that left-wing governments care about the human rights protection in importing countries and prefer to export to countries which are not involved in a conflict.
F59|Trick or Treat? The Effect of IMF Programmes on Mobilising FDI in CESEE Countries|This paper investigates the effect of IMF programmes on foreign direct investment in the countries of Central, Eastern and South-eastern Europe. We use original dataset for 17 countries in the region in the period from 1990 to 2013. In order to address selection bias stemming from the fact that countries are not randomly assigned to participation in IMF arrangements in a given year and controlling also for the unobservable factors influencing both IMF participation and foreign investment we employ treatment effect model. The robustness of our findings was additionally assessed by fixed effects instrumental variable panel and Arellano Bond dynamic panel estimation. Irrespective of the method used and model specification, we find that IMF arrangements negatively affect foreign direct investment in the CESEE region.
F59|Chinese and Japanese infrastructure investment in Southeast Asia: from rivalry to cooperation?|This article focuses on Sino-Japanese competition dynamics in Southeast Asian infrastructure investment. It attempts to use Sino-Japanese competition for infrastructure financing and high-speed railway contracts as a case in point to explore whether and in what way the Sino-Japanese rivalry extends to the infrastructure sectors in Southeast Asia, what impacts it will create on the region in terms of investment models and regional financial architecture. This article concludes by saying that Sino-Japanese competition in Southeast Asian infrastructure could be constructive, since this competition can contain the two countries’ respective behavior and prompt them to improve their investment approaches. Thus, a multilateral cooperation framework among ASEAN, Japan and China would be needed so as to contain and soften Sino-Japanese overdue rivalry in Southeast Asia.
F59|Supply-side links in oil and gas markets|Previous analyses of relationships between crude oil and natural gas markets focused primarily on demand-side connections. We provide a model and empirical evidence of important supply-side connections. First, crude oil and natural gas production require common inputs: drilling rigs, well completion services, and specialized labor. Competition for these inputs creates a \emph{cost-spillover} channel through which a price shock for one commodity reduces supply of the other commodity. Second, crude oil wells produce associated gas, while natural gas wells often produce associated liquid hydrocarbons. This creates an \emph{associated-commodity} channel through which a price shock for one commodity will increase supply of the other. Which effect dominates depends on the characteristics of the producing region. We test the model using well-level data from five large oil and gas producing basins in Texas and Oklahoma. We find substantial evidence across all five basins of a cost-spillover channel between natural gas prices and oil drilling, but mixed evidence of an associated-commodity channel between oil prices and natural gas drilling. Finally, we discuss the implications of these supply-side connections for energy policy.
F59|The contribution of trans-governmental networks of regulators to international regulatory co-operation|This study takes stock of the membership, governance structure, operational mode and regulatory power of trans-governmental networks of regulators (TGNs). It contributes to a greater OECD project aimed at building greater understanding of the benefits and pitfalls of various approaches to international regulatory co-operation (IRC) as identified in OECD (2013), International Regulatory Co-operation: Addressing Global Challenges.In order to fill the knowledge gap, this study provides a working definition of TGNs, maps existing cases, and analyses their key features. It relies on information gathered for this study on 144 TGNs. It analyses the substantive fields in which TGNs operate as well as differences in membership and other structural features. It discusses the range of regulatory activities in which TGNs engage and analyses the advantages and the disadvantages of TGNs as mechanisms for IRC, based on a review of the large and growing scholarly literature. It provides a new database on the topic, as well short case studies of three significant but structurally dissimilar TGNs: the Asian Harmonization Working Party (AHWP) on medical devices, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), and the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH).
F59|On the Relationship between Globalisation and the Economic Participation of Women in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study assesses the relationship between globalisation and the economic participation of women (EPW) in 47 Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 1990-2013. Two indicators are used to measure EPW, namely, the: female labour force participation and employment rates. The empirical evidence is based on Panel-corrected Standard Errors and Fixed Effects regressions. The findings show that the positive effect of the overall globalisation index on EPW is dampened by its political component and driven by its economic and social components, with a higher positive magnitude from the former or economic globalisation. For the most part, the findings are robust to the control for several structural and institutional characteristics: varying conditioning information sets, changes in the growth of urban population, government consumption, legal systems, resource wealth, health, technological advancement, political strife and conflicts, income levels and levels of industrialisation. An extended analysis by unbundling globalisation shows that the positive incidence of social globalisation is driven by information flow (compared to personal contact and cultural proximity) while the positive effect of economic globalisation is driven by actual flows (relative to restrictions). Policy implications are discussed.

F59|A Survey on Inequality-Adjusted Human Development in Africa|The survey puts some structure on recent empirical studies from the African Governance and Development institute (AGDI) on inclusive development published between 2016 and 2017 for the most part. The emphasis is exclusively on the inequality adjusted human development index (IHDI) because of the sparse scholarly literature on the indicator which was first published in 2010. The review provides relationships between the IHDI and inter alia: foreign aid, globalisation, information and communication technology, business dynamics and knowledge economy, software piracy, finance, health worker migration and the feasibility of common cross-country policies aimed at improving the IHDI. The survey is of policy relevance because inclusive human development is fundamental to Africa’s growth agenda in the post-2015 sustainable development era.

En outre, les inégalités sont très importants que les effets de la croissance sur le ratio de pauvreté.
F59|Integración latinoamericana y del Caribe: 200 años de la Carta de Jamaica a la CELAC|"El sueño de Integración Latinoamericano se inicia en 1815 con el manifiesto al continente conocido como “La Carta de Jamaica”, continuaría con el congreso anfictiónico de Panamá en 1826; pero solo en la cumbre de la CELAC en 2014 fue posible reunir a todos los países latinoamericanos y del caribe. Por diferentes razones Argentina, Brasil, Chile y Paraguay estuvieron ausentes de los intentos en el siglo XIX y parte del siglo XX. Desde la carta de Chapultepec en 1945 los procesos de integración toman forma a partir de la década de los 50, con experiencias que se inspiraron en la teoría pura del Comercio Internacional y específicamente en la experiencia de Europa Occidental. En el Siglo XXI con la caída del muro de Berlín y el afianzamiento del aperturismo económico se inicia un proceso nuevo de integración que modificó el mapa del poder político del continente, condicionado por la política exterior de Estados Unidos y con el surgimiento de los BRICS como una alternativa hacia el multilateralismo. ****** The dream of Latin American Integration began in 1815 with the manifesto to the continent known as ""The Letter of Jamaica"", it would continue with the Congreso Anfictiónico de Panamá in 1826; but only at the CELAC summit in 2014 was possible to join together all the Latin American and Caribbean countries. For different reasons Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Paraguay were absent from the attempts in the 19th century and part of the 20th century. From the Carta de Chapultepec in 1945 the integration processes take shape from the 50s, with experiences that were inspired by the pure theory of International Trade and specifically the Western European experience. In the 21st century, with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the consolidation of economic openness, a new process of integration began and modified the map of the political power of the continent, conditioned by the foreign policy of the United States and with the emergence of the BRICS as an alternative towards multilateralism."
F59|Terrorism risk and democratic preferences in Pakistan|Beyond direct damages, terrorism creates fear and insecurity, potentially reducing support for democratic institutions if these are deemed inadequate to tackle the threat. To investigate this possibility, we use data from Pakistan, a country that experienced an exponential rise in terrorism since 2001. Exploiting individual-level data on democratic attitudes and district-level information on terrorist attacks, we document that persistent exposure to terrorism (and more broadly to violence) is associated to a significantly lower support for democratic values. This correlation is robust to various alternative specifications (including an IV strategy), relevant in magnitude, and more pronounced for individuals who are male, poor, or less exposed to the media. Terrorism thus threatens not only individuals, but also democratic institutions.
F59|Transnational insurgents: Evidence from Colombia's FARC at the border with Chávez's Venezuela|Many insurgent groups operate across international borders, but transnational insurgent activities are seldom observable and little is known about their consequences. In this paper I show that activity by Colombian insurgent group FARC increased disproportionately in Colombian municipalities next to the border with Venezuela after Hugo Chávez became president of the latter. I argue that FARC's reliance on short-range weaponry and non-mechanized transportation limited the area in which the group could expand its operations as a result of access to a cross-border safe haven. In consequence, the finding above constitutes evidence of increased FARC presence in Venezuela during the Chávez administration. Exploiting the plausibly exogenous change of government in Venezuela, I find that Colombian municipalities more exposed to a cross-border guerrilla sanctuary experience large increases in the intensity of violence, as well as reductions in local tax revenue and educational enrolment.
F59|Capital market liberalization: Optimal tradeoff and bargaining delay|Host and investing countries are faced with a tradeoff between growth and volatility arising from capital flows. The host country seeks capital inflows for high growth, yet worries about accompanying volatility so much that it limits capital market opening due to its financial weakness. However, the investing country solicits quick and safe returns from capital outflows by requesting wide foreign openness. It is often observed that one side’s push for opening encounters the other side’s reluctance. We examine how this conflict of interest is resolved for international compromise equilibrium through sequential bargaining between the two sides with private valuations of capital flows. We find that openness bargaining can end up with strategic delay after information revelation. This finding sheds light on certain puzzles in international finance.
F59|Marketing Aspects of Russia-The European Union Cooperation in the Field of Education|In the paper the authors identified the need and identified the benefits of the development of Russia-EU cooperation in the field of education in the context of globalization, marked barriers to the development of such cooperation conditions for its development. The authors also performed a comparative analysis of the state and the market model for cooperation between Russia and the European Union in the field of education in the context of globalization and the expediency of the transition to it. As perspective directions of cooperation between Russia and the European Union in the field of education in the context of globalization the authors developed and validated a complex marketing mix.
F59|China's evolving role in global production networks: implications for Trump's trade war|This paper examines China's evolving role in global production networks and its implications for assessing the potential impact of the 'trade wars' declared by President Trump. The analysis, which is based on a systematic disaggregation of trade based on global production sharing into components and final assembly, suggests that the Sino-US trade gap is a structural phenomenon driven by the pivotal role played by China within East Asia centered production networks. The global competitiveness of US MNEs depends on their ability to use China as the production base for supplying the rest of the world, and China is now an important supplier of components used in US manufacturing. Given this intricate interdependence between the two countries, attempt to impose punitive tariffs on China is bound to face formidable opposition from business interests in the United States. Even if the protectionist threat becomes a reality, the impact may not be as damaging as commonly thought because global production sharing has considerably weakens the link between relative prices and trade flows.
F59|On the political economy of national tax revenue forecasts: evidence from OECD countries|Abstract Sustainable budgets are important quality signals for the electorate. Politicians might thus have an incentive to influence tax revenue forecasts, which are widely regarded as a key element of national budget plans. Looking at the time period from 1996 to 2012, we systematically analyze whether national tax revenue forecasts in 18 OECD countries are biased due to political manipulation. Drawing on theories from the field of political economy, we test three hypotheses using panel estimation techniques. We find support for partisan politics. Left-wing governments seem to produce more optimistic, or less pessimistic, tax revenue forecasts than do right-wing ones. Contrary to the theoretical prediction based on the “common pool” problem, we find that more fragmented governments and parliaments tend to produce more pessimistic, or less optimistic, tax revenue forecasts. We find no empirical evidence that political business cycles play a role in tax revenue forecasts.

F59|USA trade policy agenda perspectives in international trade|International trade means the exchange of goods or services along international borders. This type of trade allows for a greater competition and more competitive pricing in the market. Probably the most important single insight in all of international economics is that there are gains from trade - that is, when countries sell goods and services to each other, this exchange is almost always to their mutual benefit. Importing and exporting of goods is big business in today's global economy thus international trade is supposed to be beneficial for a particular economy even for the USA. The question is arising if Americans shouldn’t buy American goods whenever possible, to help create jobs in the United States. Paper deals with issues such as the U.S. international trade characteristics in terms of territorial and commodity structure, the U.S. export trade promotion strategy, the impact of trade on the US economy and international trade development as well as President’s Obama strategy regarding the U.S. international trade strategy. This study is analyzing the US trade policy agenda and discussing the impact of foreign trade on the U.S. economy and its current status in international economic relations. To accomplish this goal, methods such as analysis, comparison, synthesis and logical deduction are to be used; facts from scientific and professional publications, periodical and non-periodical press. International trade of the United States is one of the world's most significant economic markets. The country is among the top three global importers and exporters. USA has trade relations with many other countries. Through efficiency, competition, and relationships the international trade can increase economic growth and allow for all countries to benefit from it.
F59|Blockchains and Extra-Terrestrial Nations: Role of Blockchains in the Socio-Political Milieu of Future Extra-Terrestrial Settlements|Humanity is on the cusp of a great wave of space exploration and colonization of Extra-Terrestrial Bodies (ETB). This paper deals with the socio–political issues that may arise between Earth and E.T Settlements and the possible ways to resolve them. Firstly we discuss as to how early maritime explorations compare to present day space voyages. Based on the lessons learnt, we will analyse the socio–political relation between Earth and Extra-Terrestrial Settlements (ETS) and how some possibilities of conflicts can arise. We then evaluate as to how Blockchain systems can potentially keep earth and ETS tethered to each other and provide a way for harmonious co-existence. The paper concludes by summarizing the possible Socio–Political and Economic conflicts between Earth and future ETS and ways to resolve them.
F59|European Union and Big Four’s Position Towards the 16+1 Cooperation Platform|The aim of the present paper is to investigate the position towards the 16+1 framework from the standpoint of the EU as an entity and also the four largest EU countries in terms of GDP, namely Germany, Great Britain, France and Italy. The Big Four are the main recipients of Chinese FDI and are also the most active European exporters to China, while CEE concentrates only a small share of the EU-Chinese trade and investment flows. However, the Big Four are apprehensive with regard to China’s rising competitiveness through national reform policies (such as China 2025 Program) but also via acquisition of high-tech companies. In the competition with a stronger China, these countries and especially Germany consider that the Chinese presence in CEE, alongside the proposed investment projects in infrastructure, including harbours, represent a threat to their established positions in this region and their companies will lose market shares and big infrastructure contracts. Seen from another perspective, in the literature the new framework is considered as a lobby platform, intended to influence the EU decisions through CEE players, which is incompatible with the strategic Sino-EU partnership. As a matter of fact, the EU foreign policy is incoherent in major aspects, including EU-China relation as well. Therefore our investigation focuses on three main aspects. First, we explain how the lack of harmonization between the Big Four and the other EU member states is influencing EU policy towards China. Conferring the Big Four observer status at the 16+1 summits might mitigate tensions. Second we investigate whether the Big Four detain the supremacy in the EU to the detriment of the EU periphery. Third, we underline that the EU needs a common vision towards the Eurasian cooperation, as it includes a new element: the Belt and Road Initiative. One cannot support the BRI by criticizing the 16+1, as the latter is considered by the Chinese authorities a significant component of the BRI. In conclusion, if the CEE countries become a bridge or a wall in the Chinese-EU relations depends only on the ability of all actors to have a balanced relationship with each other.
F59|Romanian Attitudes and Perceptions towards the 16+1 Cooperation Platform|The aim of this paper is to analyze Romanian citizens’ attitudes and perceptions towards the 16+1 framework, their determinants and effects. The influencing factors are correlated with the general perception of China and its image, while the effects are seen from the perspectives of the engagement and level of participation in joint initiatives. Recent literature underscores that although this platform offers a range of opportunities in each of the nine pillars of sectoral cooperation, Romania has adopted a passive attitude as regards large-scale projects developed with Chinese partners. Beyond EU specific technical barriers to such projects, the Romanian attitudes towards the 16+1 strongly affected cooperation intensity with China. Positions towards this initiative (opinions from general public, elites, politicians and experts) are identified through three main channels: mass media research, individual interviews and focus groups. The quantitative analysis, combined with qualitative research, emphasizes that in spite of the recognition by some groups of the potential benefits offered by the cooperation in the 16+1 format, reluctance remains. This is not due to China’s assets-liabilities balance or the lack of capacity to understand China, but on both insufficient information on 16+1 and political inertia.
F59|Industrial Policy of BRICS Countries as an Instrument of State Capitalism|The article deals with industrial policy in the BRICS countries, which is an important instrument of their development. First, the importance of industrial policy is stated. There are numerous approaches to it: the extreme ones are the neoliberal approach, advocating no interventions of the state in the market; the other extreme is interventions either directly by subsidies to chosen branches or indirectly by building institutional surroundings which are comfortable for industrial development. The development of theoretical approaches to industrial policy is also discussed: from structuralists to new structuralists, who try to connect a market as the main mechanism with an industrial policy. Industrial policies practised in Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are then described. Some statistical data are given which illustrate the position of the BRICS countries in the present-day world as for their industrial performance. China seems to be the relatively most successful in this respect. Finally, some questions concerning state capitalism and industrial policy are discussed.
F59|Problema Trecerii României La Euro Si Convergenta Economica|By the Treaty of Acccesion to the EU, Romania opted for the euro adoption. According to the Maastricht Treaty, since 2014, Romania has fulfilled the nominal convergence criteria, thus becoming apt to adopt the euro. But a careful analysis of the reality and the lessons learnt from the euro crisis show that the real convergence criterion is able to ensure the sustainability of the nominal criteria and the adequate functioning of the economy. To adopt the euro we should look for the minimum threshold of the GDP per capita calculated by the Purchasing Power Parity. In our study, we consider different real convergence thresholds on corresponding time horizons for comparison: at a 70% convergence level of Romania in relation to the EU 28 average, we need 89 years, and a full convergence level (100%) requires 22-26 years.

F59|Domestication of Germany?s European Policy and German Leadership in the EU: The Cases of Eurozone Crisis and Refugee Crisis|Germany?s European policy and German influence in the EU have been subject to hot discussions in academic and political circles. The German influence in the EU took a new turn in recent years with federal government?s readiness to enhance its leadership status in the EU and to undertake unilateral actions, when the EU has entered an era of multiple crises in view of severe challenges including the Eurozone crisis and the more recent refugee crisis. This paper discusses Germany?s actorness in regards to the management of the Eurozone crisis and refugee crisis on the basis of the gradually increasing ?domestication? of its European policy. It reveals that Germany?s European policy throughout the two most prominent crises the EU has been lately challenged with, namely the Eurozone crisis and refugee crisis, has been largely shaped by the preferences of the influential domestic actors, who took into account the negative externalities that were likely to arise from the introduction of policies that would impose significant costs on them. Germany?s unilateral actions and leadership role in the management of these two crises (including the making of the EU-Turkey deal on the management of the refugee crisis) should be evaluated in light of the constraints imposed by domestic constituencies.
F59|The Unification Of The Philosophical And Behavioral Social Sciences|This research design overcomes the three problems of coordinating the micro and macro behavioral sciences of Gintis defined as: (1) the identification of an overarching casual theme, (2) the identification of an integrative methodology, and (3) the identification of a series of a series of compatible frameworks. This is achieved by the comparison of the competing Hume-Smith versus Marx-Engels foundational-political-economic philosophical theories in relation to the outcome of the 20th Century Ideological Experiments. This paper contends that the range of valid foundational-political-economic philosophical theories, and the corresponding series of psychological, political, economic theoretical frameworks in the social sciences, can be reduced considerably across the board considerably, and then integrated laterally.
F59|Refugee Crisis in Europe (2015-2016): The Clash of Intergovernmental and Supranational Perspectives|The refugee crisis of 2015-2016 exposed structural difficulties in decision making for the European Union on critical issues that was deemed ?existential? for its member states. The emerging balance between intergovernmentalism and supranationalism tilted toward the former at the expense of the latter contriving to the post-Maastricht trend. Member states and the supranational EU institutions have been divided in their approach to the refugee crisis viewing it as either a national security or a human security issue. This clash of perspectives, it is argued, may not only slow the pace of integration but it is also likely to reverse the spillover affects achieved so far. Thus, the most feasible and likely response for the EU is to seek a middle way between the views of the EU actors who prioritize the refugee crisis as primarily a human security issue and those who regard it firstly as a national security issue.
F59|Türkiye Vatandaşlarının Kırgız ve Kırgızistan İmajına Yönelik Algıları|Academic studies on country’s image have conducted since 1930. Creation of country image includes several key features as economic, politic, ecologic, technologic conditions, history and cultural background as well as human resources of that country. We can say that the country image as a subject attracts attention of academic studies. Although there are many studies on the image of Turkey in Kyrgyzstan, there is no published research on the image of Kyrgyzstan in Turkey. The main purpose of this study is to determine Turkish citizens’ perception toward Kyrgyz and Kyrgyzstan. For this purpose, it had carried out survey among 358 participants. The findings suggested that Turkish citizen’s perceptions toward Kyrgyz and Kyrgyzstan generally positive. However, there is a significant difference between participants who has already visited Kyrgyzstan and has not visited yet. In other words, after visiting Kyrgyzstan Turkish citizens’ view is being changing in a negative direction.
F59|Relationship between good governance and economic growth - A contribution to the institutional debate about state failure in developing countries|Numbers of economists of development consider that good governance, defined as the quality management and orientation of development policies has a positive influence on economic performance. The question is what content the literature gives to the concept of governance? According to the World Bank, good governance is evaluated by the implementation capacity of governance principles of a country, providing a framework for market development and economic growth. Several econometric studies (Kauffman et al. (1999, 2005), Knack et al. (1999) tested the relationship between good governance in the sense of ”market-enhancing governance” (stimulus institutions market) and showed a positive relationship between good governance and economic growth. However a good governance policy is allows developing countries to achieve minimum economic growth and political reforms in order to reach a level of development similar to that of industrialized countries? We focus on the definition and the work on the concept of good governance made by the World Bank and criticism formulated by Mushtaq Khan (2002.2004), who reconstructed the notion of governance in a broader sense, taking into account the capacity of states to drive structural change in institutional, political, economic and social fields, in order to ensure longterm economic growth. Is good governance can explain economic performance? Or according to the thesis of Mushtaq Khan (2002, 2004), reforms of economic structures and government capabilities are the first step to improve economic performance of developing countries, and in a second step to allow economic growth to enhance good governance? Following several works of neo-institutionalist economists on the relationship between economic growth and good governance (Kauffman D. and al.1999, 2005, Knack S. and Keefer P. 1997, Hall, R. Jones, C.1999, Clague, C. Keefer P., Knack S. and Olson M., 1997, Barro R., 1996, Rodrick D., 1995, 1997, and 2002) emerged two divergent theories of ”state failure” in developing countries: The first thesis (market Enhancing governance) defended by neo-institutionalist authors consider the state as a sovereign role and welfare state. Economically, the proper functioning of markets is correlated to the proper functioning of institutions through efficient practice of state governance, what is commonly called ”good governance”. Therefore, underdevelopment and low economic growth performance of countries could be explained by a ”state failure” and the components of good governance with the increase in corruption, instability of property rights, market distortions, and lack of democracy. The second thesis (growth Enhancing governance) developed in particular by Mushtaq Khan (1995, 2004, 2005, 2006) and partly by Dany Rodrik (1995,1997,2002), concerns the ability of the state to implement social change and a voluntary policy of economic development: The transition of developing countries towards a capitalist system comparable to that of developed countries, can not operate without the establishment of efficient institutions in relation with distribution of political power in these countries. Conversely, those countries would face a state failure, as a result of a mismatch between institutions and economic policy for development. Our research consists first to present the results of an empirical model that we have done based on a panel of developing countries chosen by region (MENA, Latin America, and Asia) and due to their natural resource endowment. The aim is to check if growth rate may or may not be correlated with good governance indicators as defined by the World Bank. The goal is to lead in a second time an analysis of criticism made by Mushtaq Khan on the definition of governance, the causes of state failure and barriers to economic development. Our contribution is to discuss the concept of good governance and the failure of states that take into account the level of development and governance capacity that is based on a structure and distribution of political power that evolves in time and may or may not be positive for growth. The assumption we make here is that the so-called good governance policies are relevant if countries reach a sound level of economic and social development that enable institutions of good governance to boost growth.
F59|Difficulties in international travelling for residents of areas with undefined political status. Case study: Crimea|In March 2014 a change took place on Europe's political map. The Crimean Peninsula became part of Russia, switching sovereignty after more than 20 years during which it was part of Ukraine. This took place following a Russian military intervention and a referendum. A majority of the world's countries however, do not recognize the Russian control of Crimea and still consider it a part of Ukraine, rendering the territory an area with undefined political status. Shortly after the sovereignty change, the region and its population started experiencing all kinds of hardships. An often neglected type of hardship Crimeans are experiencing is the difficulty of obtaining visas. Following the referendum, many diplomatic missions in Russia have instituted a policy of not issuing visas to residents of Crimea who apply with Russian-issued documents. This article shall make a summary of EU and Schengen countries' positions regarding this issue, as these are the biggest groups of countries that requires both Russians and Ukrainians to obtain visas before travelling there. This research was made mostly directly, by requesting each country's diplomatic mission in Moscow to give an official position. The research had the purpose of verifying the information that certain countries do issue visas to Crimeans with Russian documents and also to give a more general and complex picture on the matter of visas for residents of Crimea. This theme is important as a policy of not issuing visas has significant repercussions on the region's economy and on the freedom of movement of its citizens.
F59|Краснодарска Покрајина И Република Србија: Могућности И Перспективе Сарадње<BR>[Krasnodar Krai and Republic of Serbia: possibilities and perspectives of cooperation]|This article analyzes the presumptions for the development of cooperation between the Republic of Serbia and Krasnodar Krai, one of the subjects of Russian Federation. At the beginning it was provided a geographic and socio-economic description of Krasnodar Krai, one of the federal subjects of the complexly organized Russian Federation. Its size and population are comparable to the ones of smaller European countries, such as Austria, Czech Republic, Republic of Ireland or Denmark, Finland and Slovakia. In comparison to Serbia, this region is somewhat smaller and less densely populated. Its landscape and climate diversity, as well as an abundance of natural resources make a good starting point for a further economic and social development of the region. The agro-industrial complex and tourism are especially developed in this region and are considered its strong points both within Russia and outside its borders. In the production of many agrarian products Krasnodar Krai is leader, or at the top in the Russian Federation. The level of industrial cooperation between Serbia and Russia is considerably lower than in the times of SFRY and USSR. However, it will certainly increase in the future, leading to an intensification of cooperation with Krasnodar region which will not only be based on trade relations. У овом раду се анализирају претпоставке развијања сарадње између Републике Србије и Краснодарске покрајине, једног од субјеката Руске Федерације. Најпре је дат географски и друштвеноекономски приказ Краснодарске покрајине, једног од субјеката сложено уређене Руске Федерације. По величини територије и броју становника упоредив с мањим европским земљама, попут Аустрије, Чешке или Републике Ирске, односно Данске, Финске и Словачке, овај руски регион је нешто мањи и слабије насељен од Србије. Разноврсност рељефа, климатских услова и велика природна богатства чине повољне услове за економски и друштвени развој региона. Посебно су развијени агроиндустријски комплекс и туризам, што и представља знак распознавања региона не само у оквирима Русије, већ и ван њених граница. У производњи низа пољопривредних култура Краснодарска покрајина заузима водеће, или једно од водећих места у оквирима Руске Федерације. Привредна сарадња Србије с Русијом у целини знатно заостаје за оном из времена СФРЈ и СССР, али ће у будућности свакако бити повећана, а у оквиру тога и сарадња с Краснодарском Покрајином, која се неће заснивати само на трговинским односима.
F59|The Comparative Inclusive Human Development of Globalisation in Africa|Abstract This study examines the impact of globalisation on inclusive human development in 51 African countries for the period 1996–2011 with particular emphasis on income levels (low income vs. middle income), legal origins (English common law vs. French civil law), resource wealth (oil-rich vs. oil-poor), landlockedness (landlocked vs. unlandlocked), religious domination (Christianity vs. Islam) and political stability (stable vs. unstable). The empirical evidence is based on instrumental variable panel Fixed effects and Tobit regressions in order to control for the unobserved heterogeneity and limited range in the dependent variable. Political, economic, social and general globalisation variables are used. Six main hypotheses are investigated. The findings broadly show that middle income, English common law, oil-poor, unlandlocked, Christian-oriented and politically-stable countries are associated with comparatively higher levels of globalisation-driven inclusive human development. Puzzling findings are elucidated and policy implications discussed.
F59|Globalization and Inclusive Human Development in Africa|This study extents the literature on responses to a recent World Bank report on the African poverty tragedy by assessing the effect of globalisation on inclusive human development in 51 African countries for the period 1996–2011. Political, economic, social and general globalisation variables are used. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) and Instrumental Quantile Regressions (IQR). While estimated coefficients are not significant in GMM results, for IQR, globalisation positively affects inclusive human development and the favourable effect is higher in countries with high initial levels of inclusive development. The main economic implication is that in the post-2015 development agenda, countries would benefit more from globalisation by increasing their levels of inclusive development.
F59|Bank Failure Prediction Model for Zimbabwe|Probability of Default (PD) is a financial term describing the likelihood of default over a particular time horizon. This concept has attracted a lot of interest ever since the late 1960¡¯s and has been extended to the banking sector to predict probability of failure as well as bank performance ratings. We derive the probability of bankruptcy and bank ratings in a Zimbabwean context based on data between 2009 and 2013, inclusive. We build a model to predict the probability of bank failure twelve months in advance for Zimbabwean banks based on twelve micro factors. Further, we build the corresponding rating model. The empirical analysis revealed that the warning signal so developed produced a robust result with a high prediction accuracy of 92.31% compared to 60% of the Altman¡¯s Z Score model.
F59|The key goal of this research is to empirically determine the effects of terrorism on FDI of the selected EU and EEA member countries|The key goal of this research is to empirically determine the effects of terrorism on FDI of the selected EU and EEA member countries.The methodology is based on a system-GMM estimator for dynamic panel data models on a sample covering up to 29 countries, and 13-year periods from 2000 to 2013. The main results confirm that terrorism incidents, economic and institutional variables are found to depress FDI of analysed EU and EEA countries. It can be concluded that terrorism and institutional stability are most influential on FDI inflows of the observed EU and EEA countries. The results indicate that terrorist activities reduce security and confidence of investors in countries exposed to terrorist activities, reducing the inflow of foreign direct investment. The recommendations and proposals are given based on the results of empirical analysis.
F59|Development of Regionalism : New Criteria and Typology|This study examines the development of regionalism and the different typologies of Regional Trade Agreements. Beginning with Balassa’s typology, it conducts an overview of commonly used typologies of regionalism and emphasizes that the previous typologies do not reflect the different features of Regional Trade Agreements, for example, the external factors that make it possible to differentiate between seemingly similar types of Regional Trade Agreements. After noticing these limitations, we propose a new typology of Regional Trade Agreements and its criteria by combining the existing methods and the new one. Recent Regional Trade Agreements can be regarded as responses to a new trade environment: Multilateral negotiations agenda and globalization. This is probably why recent Regional Trade Agreements are often termed as World Trade Organizationplus.In the context of emerging mega-Regional Trade Agreements, such as the Trans Pacific Partnership and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, this study calls for more efforts toward harmonizing the different Regional Trade Agreements or creating a template of standard Regional Trade Agreements in order to prevent a spaghetti bowl effect. Meanwhile, Mega-Regional Trade Agreements also seem to be influenced by the consequences of the 2008~2009 global financial crisis.
F59|Koreaâ€™s Post-1997 Restructuring|This paper aims to transcend current debates on Koreaâ€™s post-1997 restructuring, which rely on a dichotomy between domestic industrial capital and foreign financial capital, by adopting Nitzan and Bichlerâ€™s capital-as-power perspective. Based on this approach, the paper analyzes Koreaâ€™s recent political economic restructuring as the latest phase in the evolution of capitalist power and its transformative regimes of capital accumulation.
F59|Chinese investments in Africa: what have we known and what should we know?|This study conducts a systematic review of the researches on Chinese investments in Africa, publishing in major journals of business administration and international business over these last 10 years. It studies the motivational factors for Chinese firm?s presence in Africa, the modes of entry of Chinese investment, the management issues, and their impacts on local economy and firms. It aims to provide an organizing framework for emerging theoretical and methodological issues, as well as future research direction in this field.Based on the international business theories, the findings of this study indicated that, to date, the majority of research has attempted to either qualitatively or conceptually criticize the cooperation between China and Africa, and there are very few studies that define model and develop measurement tools to empirically test the effects of the Chinese presence in the African continent and its impacts on local enterprises. Very few studies have provided robust evidence to establish the role that China is playing and the crowding-in or crowding-out effects of the Sino-Africa cooperation. This paper discusses about 5 major flaws in the existing literature and concludes with some emerging issues, the practical implications of this review, and future research directions.
F59|Nation Building in fragile states|Fragile states will remain the main challenge for the international community to eradicate poverty and to contribute to just and inclusive societies as aimed for in the SDG's (OECD State of Fragility 2015). In the fragile states agenda the focus is on the state building agenda: building institutions and systems to strengthen the state, to make sure that the delivery of security, justice and basic social services is guaranteed. Without questioning the relevance and urgency of this institutional strengthening, there is a need to complement this strategy with a nation-building strategy that focuses on building social cohesion and a sense of belonging in fragmented and conflict ridden countries: what makes people to identify with their nation-state as their community they belong to. People in fragile states identify with and relied on their ethnic, religious, linguistic community and it is important to understand how people can identify with their nation-state as basis for their acceptance of and loyalty to this nation state when it relates to taxation, justice and economic development. Including nation-building into the fragile states discourse and policies is based on the model of fragility that identifies three drivers of fragility: lack of authority, lack of capacity, lack of legitimacy. Whereas state-building focuses on solving the lack of authority and capacity, nation building addresses the lack of legitimacy and supports the process of legitimacy-building that is necessary for stability. Nation-building does not fit the traditional log-frame model for development interventions. Input- output-outcome sequence is difficult to define at the beginning of the process and the role of international actors is less prominent compared to the state building and institution building agenda. In order to break the often vicious cycle of conflict in fragile states, we need to invest in nation-building as complementary to state building. Nation-building is not a magic wand for the solution of conflicts, but it should be part of a comprehensive agenda for the international community. The research to be presented in the presentation is connecting policy, practice and science and it is interdisciplinary, drawing on cultural anthropology, political sciences, religious studies, sociology and social psychology.
F59|The challenges of India economy in current international economics environment|In the past few years India´s economy has got economic growth 5 percent a year. Despite the country´s economic view is unpredictable. On one hand India has strong economic growth and healthy market. On the other hand the country´s development is being complicated by insufficient infrastructure, higher budget deficit, low foreign direct investments flow and slow employment growth. The second most populated country of the world with huge natural resources amount has the potential to come back in world economic development where it used to be. Thus the main aim of this paper is by means of current status and development analysis of India´s economy at present times and in the past to determine its future position and leeway in the international economics system.
F59|In Pursuit of New Peace Building: Peace, Security and Development|Recent events in international relations push us to analyze comprehensively and simultaneously the issues regarding peace, security and development. Many states in the world still suffer from deep and stark economic problems. These economic problems also increase the risk of conflict especially in the developing world. If any conflict occurs, the political, social, economic and environmental disasters can be deepened as well. Therefore, any state facing chronic development problems, has greater risks in terms of the potential conflict or humanitarian crisis. The states in conflict are obliged to use their human capital as soldiers rather than their economic developments. Additionally, those countries mostly allocate their own resources for armament rather than infrastructure or investment. They are not also able to get enough foreign aid for development. These economic and security problems reproduce widespread humanitarian crises, violations of law and corruption that may undermine order and peace in those countries. In this respect, security, peace and development are inseparable issues and concepts that must be tackled together both in theory and practice. Being aware of this necessity, this paper argues that if we analyze those three concepts together, the agenda of the security studies can be broadened. This paper also deals with the case of United Nations in general, and recent resolutions of the United Nations Security Council in particular that evaluate peace, security and development in the same perspective.
F59|The New World (Dis)Order and the Conflicts Evolution ? The Iran Nuclear Proliferation and the Crisis in Ukraine as Cases of Study|The World Order is a concept in constant mutation that has lost a lot of what characterized it when it was established with the Peace of Westphalia. The conflicts also went through changes. They lost its State distinctiveness and became dispersed and chaotic due to multipolarization. These two concepts share some connections and both dissociated from their traditional definition. This paper aims to establish a connection between the contemporary World Order and the conflicts evolution. The threats to the stability of the World Order contribute to the current disorder and reflects how the conflicts distanced themselves from the clausewitzian battles. To understand how these threats impact the World Order stability and evince the conflicts evolution two cases of study were selected: the nuclear proliferation in Iran and the crisis in Ukraine. These two examples will help establishing the link between the contemporary World Disorder and the conflicts evolution.
F59|Policies against human trafficking: the role of religion and political institutions|Abstract I investigate empirically the role of religion and political institutions in policies against human trafficking, using the new 3P Anti-trafficking Policy Index. The dataset contains 175 countries. The results show that governments in countries with Christian majorities implement stricter anti-trafficking policies than governments in countries with Muslim majorities. The differences between countries with Christian and Muslim majorities are pronounced in dictatorships but less so in democracies. For example, the 3P Anti-Trafficking Policy Index in a dictatorship with no Muslims was by 1.9 points higher than in an otherwise identical but purely Muslim dictatorship (on a scale from 3 to 15). The association between religion and the overall 3P Anti-trafficking Policy Index is driven by protection and prevention policies. As compared to prosecution policies that mainly target the perpetrators of human trafficking, protection and prevention policies mainly protect the victims of human trafficking, i.e. predominantly women. The conclusions are consistent with other empirical findings regarding the association between religion, political institutions, and human development.
F59|Credibility, preferences, and bilateral investment treaties|When is a commitment mechanism employed as a solution to a time-inconsistency problem? This article provides a nuanced answer to this question by studying bilateral investment treaties (BITs). We develop a game theoretic model of BIT signing in which the government of a capital-importing country and an investor from a capital-exporting country strategically interact. The model predicts that, on the one hand, when host states highly value foreign direct investment (FDI), the likelihood of BITs increases as their judicial institutions lack credibility. On the other hand, when their preferences for FDI are only modest, the likelihood of BITs increases as their judicial institutions become more credible. We employ Cox proportional hazard models to test our hypotheses, and the results largely support our theory. Our findings have broad implications for the large literature on credible commitment, which has paid insufficient attention to the interplay between preferences and credibility.

F59|War and Relatedness|We find that more closely related populations are more prone to engage in international conflict with each other. We provide an economic interpretation based on two connected mechanisms. First, more closely related groups share more similar preferences over rival goods and are thus more likely to fight over them. Second, rulers have stronger incentives to conquer populations more similar to their own, to minimize postconflict heterogeneity in preferences over government types and policies. We find support for these mechanisms using evidence on international conflicts over natural endowments and on territorial changes, including decolonization.
F59|Ja zu Freihandel, nein zu TTIP? Die TTIP-Skepsis und ihre Ursachen|Drei Jahre nach Beginn des Verhandlungsprozesses über das geplante Freihandelsabkommen TTIP zwischen der EU und den USA breitet sich die Skepsis besonders im deutschsprachigen Raum weiter aus. Zwar unterstützt die Mehrheit der Bevölkerung den Freihandelsgedanken und protektionistische Maßnahmen haben ein schlechtes Image. Trotzdem findet sich etwa in Deutschland eine solide Mehrheit, die TTIP ablehnt. Die vorliegende empirische Analyse untersucht potenzielle Ursachen für Skepsis gegenüber TTIP. Diese geht mit einem schlechten Image des Globalisierungsprozesses und einem mangelnden Verständnis für seine ökonomischen Vorteile einher. Doch die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Ablehnung des Freihandelsabkommens auch durch ein geringes Vertrauen in die EU und durch die Unzufriedenheit mit der Art und Weise, wie Demokratie auf der EU-Ebene funktioniert, befeuert wird. Auch die Offenheit für Fremdgruppen ist positiv mit der Zustimmung zu TTIP korreliert. Zusammenfassend lässt sich aus der empirischen Analyse ableiten, dass hinter der TTIP-Skepsis eine Reihe von Ursachen steckt, die nur einen indirekten Bezug zu TTIP haben. Die Ablehnung des Freihandelsabkommens ist ein Teil des Protests gegen die Strukturen der EU, sodass mögliche Ansätze für mehr TTIP-Unterstützung darin bestehen, das Vertrauen in die EU auszubauen. Heutzutage werden die Errungenschaften der europäischen Integration als eine Gegebenheit empfunden und ihre Vorteile nicht richtig wahrgenommen. Zudem ist die gefühlte Distanz zu den Europäischen Institutionen mit einem verstärkten Gefühl verbunden, dass die EU-Bürger den politischen Prozess nicht beeinflussen können. Es ist somit nicht nur für die Zukunftsfähigkeit der EU von großer Bedeutung, die Funktionsweise der EUDemokratie zu verbessern und auch die positiven Seiten der europäischen Integration ins Gedächtnis zu rufen. Auch der Kampf um die Unterstützung für TTIP dürfte davon profitieren.
F59|Geographic Politics, Loss Aversion, and Trade Policy: The Case of Cotton and China|This paper seeks to explain how governments respond to world market price fluctuations. It develops a theoretical model of trade policy incorporating loss aversion and reference dependence. Like Freund and Ã–zden (2008), this paper assumes only trade policy instruments are available to the government, but it goes beyond their model by adding a spatial dimension to interest-group politics. The model suggests that: (1) politically sensitive products receive more trade protection; (2) the governmentÂ’s changing trade distortions insulate the domestic market from international price fluctuations by setting trade protection lower (higher) when the world price is higher (lower) than a targeted domestic reference price; and (3) variations in market intervention help producers at the expense of consumers in periods when the international price is well below trend, and help consumers at the expense of producers in high-price periods. These predictions from theory are shown to still hold when the model is extended to a large country case involving terms of trade effects. The model is tested empirically and found to offer a plausible explanation of the puzzling changes in cotton protection in China.
F59|Culture and International Business|National culture is still an important factor in managing a wide spectrum of areas and forms of international business. The understanding of the concept of culture, respectively the values and practices of foreign business partners, is instrumental in achieving effective intercultural communication and international business. The notion of culture as a set of schemes and codes (culture-as-a-code) gives ground to the context dependent concept of culture (culture-in-context). Although the context dependent paradigm of culture is not a new phenomenon, the international business practice has not capitalized on its contributions yet. The paper does not aim at comprehensively revealing the nature of culture and its components. The focus is on those issues which have proved its significance for international business practice. The thesis states that culture is dynamically enfolded in international business practice and its specific context. That’s why contemporary international business players should be knowledgeable about both the traditional postulates about the culture factor and the dynamic aspects of cultural, including intercultural, matters. On the basis of a literature review and analytical reasoning, the paper strives to shed light on the topical debate on culture and its implications for international business.
F59|Like Me, Buy Me: The Effect of Soft Power on Exports|In this paper I quantify a gain that a country receives when its global influence is considered to be admirable by others. I use a standard gravity model of bilateral exports, a panel of data from 2006 through 2013, and an annual survey conducted for the BBC by GlobeScan which asks people in up to 46 countries about whether each of up to 17 countries were perceived to have “a mainly positive or negative influence in the world.” Holding other things constant, a country’s exports are higher if it is perceived by the importer to be exerting more positive global influence. This effect is statistically and economically significant; a one percent net increase in perceived positive influence raises exports by around .8 percent. Succinctly, countries receive a commercial return on their soft power.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F59|Democratization and Real Exchange Rates|This paper empirically assesses how democratization affects real exchange rates. By doing this, we combine so far separated strands of the economic literature and argue that democratization reduces currency undervaluation leading to a real exchange rate appreciation. We test this hypothesis empirically for a sample of countries observed from 1980 to 2007 by combining a difference-in-difference (DID) approach with propensity score matching (PSM) estimators. Our results reveal a strong and significant finding: democratization causes real exchange rates to appreciate. Consequently, the ongoing process of democratization observed in a few Arabic and Moslem countries is likely to reduce exchange rate distortions.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F59|Is political risk still an issue for Turkish stock market?|In this study, we analyze the effects of internal political risk on the Turkish stock market in the period of 2001–2014. Empirical analyses are conducted through various methods to obtain breaks and regimes in the return volatilities of the BIST100 index. According to the results, while the number of breaks has increased in recent years, the risk level of recent periods is significantly lower than the early regimes, and the risk level trend for all regimes show a negative slope. In conclusion, the Turkish stock market responds to political events, but according to our results, not as significantly as in the past.
F59|UK Referendum and Potential Brexit?|Vortrag von Prof. John Ryan, London School of Economics and Political Science
F59|Austritt Großbritanniens aus der EU: Kann die Europäische Union einen Brexit überstehen?|Am 23. Juni stimmen die Briten darüber ab, ob ihr Land Mitglied der Europäischen Union bleiben soll oder nicht. Michael Wohlgemuth, Open Europe Berlin, befürchtet, dass ein Brexit gerade für deutsche Vertreter einer ordnungspolitischen Wirtschaftsverfassung statt einer interventionistischen Wirtschaftsregierung »ein schwerer Schlag« wäre. Friederike Welter, Institut für Mittelstandsforschung, Bonn, sieht in Großbritannien den Hauptverlierer eines möglichen EU-Austritts. Verließe das Vereinigte Königreich die EU, würde das Land nicht nur seine Investitionsattraktivität verlieren, sondern unter Umständen auch Konzernsitze. Nach Ansicht von Holger Schmieding, Berenberg, könnte die Europäische Union einen Brexit ohne schwerwiegende wirtschaftliche Folgen überstehen. Sollten aber auch andere Länder der EU den Rücken kehren wollen, könnte der Schaden erheblich sein. Auch Franz Peter Lang, Technische Universität Braunschweig, sieht Europa und seine Wirtschaft deutlich weniger erschüttert, denn Verlagerungen wirtschaftlicher Aktivitäten von der Insel nach Europa würden mildernd wirksam. Bert Van Roosebeke, Centrum für Europäische Politik, Freiburg, sieht sogar die Gefahr, dass sich die Schotten als Folge eines Brexit für die Abspaltung vom Mutterland entscheiden könnten.
F59|Is tied aid bad for the recipient countries?|This paper examines the welfare effects of the exclusivity of foreign aid taking consideration of donor countries' strategic and self-interested economic motivations. Based on an oligopolistic model with strategic interactions between firms and governments providing foreign aid, we demonstrate that a higher exclusivity of foreign aid, taking the form of tied aid, increases the equilibrium amount of aid and the social welfare of the recipient country when the foreign aid policies are decided in a non-cooperative fashion between donor countries. However, when donor countries coordinate aid policies to maximize joint-welfare including recipient country's welfare, the lower exclusivity of foreign aid, taking the form of untied aid, will increase the equilibrium amount of aid and the global social welfare. The results implicate that when a credible enforcement mechanism for the cooperative regime for foreign aid is not available, tied aid is welfare dominant policy for both donor and recipient countries than untied aid.
F59|Food prices and the multiplier effect of trade policy|This work studies the relationship between trade policy and food prices. We show that when individuals are loss averse, governments may use trade policy to shield the domestic economy from large food price shocks. This creates a complementarity between the price of food in international markets and trade policy. Specifically, unilateral actions give rise to a “multiplier effect”: when a shock drives up the price of food, exporters respond by imposing restrictions, while importers wind down protection, thus exacerbating the initial shock and soliciting further trade policy activism. We test the key prediction of the theory with a new dataset that comprises monthly information on trade measures across 77 countries and 32 food products for the period 2008–11, finding evidence of a multiplier effect in food trade policy. These findings contribute to inform the broader debate on the proper regulation of food trade policy within the multilateral trading system.
F59|Sovereign Wealth Funds' Internationalization Strategies: The Use of Investment Vehicles|In this paper, we examine the strategies used by sovereign wealth fund (SWF) investments in their cross-border investments. We investigate how SWFs internationalize their activities, specifically whether the use of investment vehicles as signal of passive investment approach to access foreign markets is influenced by SWF- and deal-specific characteristics and the presence of bilateral trade agreements between the SWFs and the target country. Our probit and multinomial logit estimates show that fund opacity, fund politicization, strategic industry targets, and majority ownership choices lead to a more likely use of vehicles, while bilateral trade agreements negatively affect such investment strategy. We also find that fund opacity increases the likelihood to use SWF-controlled vehicles, while fund politicization, strategic industry targets, and majority ownership choices increase the likelihood to use a corporate vehicle. Bilateral trade agreements reduce the use of corporate vehicles. Our results also indicate that politicized foreign SWFs are more likely to invest through vehicles located in third countries. On the other hand, when strategic industries are targeted, investment vehicles are likely to be located in the target country. Our results control for SWFs' strategic goals, SWF experience (reliance on external managers or advisors, fund size), type of funding sources, crisis period, deal-specific effects, and legal and institutional differences across countries and over time.
F59|Dual-use products export multipliers with the indirect effects|The micro–macro link is provided for the impact of the dual-use defence-civilian exports of products and services on the Slovenian economy. The unique firm-level data on the dual-use export is integrated in the symmetric 60 groups of activities input–output tables. The classification of the economic activities is used to integrate data on the firm-to-firm dual-use export transactions in the symmetric input–output coding system to avoid the double counting. The input–output modelling approach is used for the measuring of the direct input–output flows and the dual-use products export multipliers with the indirect effects. The direct and indirect effects are analysed by the economic activities, technological intensity of the products and services, and statistical regions in Slovenia. Comparisons with alternative non dual-use high tech are analysed by economic activities in terms of value-added and labour productivity. The dual-use export is associated with high technologically intensive suppliers and sub-suppliers of defence-civilian goods and services. The empirical estimations can serve as a guide in questions of comparing with alternative in economic policy design when investigating trade-offs between allocation of expenditures for defence equipment and their opportunity costs for non dual-use of high tech products and services.

F59|Economic diplomacy: The “one–China policy” effect on trade|Chinese foreign policy is mainly characterized by the Beijing consensus and the one-China principle in international relations. More precisely, the situation faced by Taiwan is a “core interest” in China's economic diplomacy strategy. We investigate whether the “one-China policy” (OCP) has had visible effects on bilateral trade flows. In other words, does the compliance of diplomatic commitments with China undermine Taiwanese trade and enhance China's trade position? Using a structural gravity model based on worldwide panel data for the period 1948–2012, we approximate the OCP through two dummy variables: the vote by countries of the UN resolution about China's recognition in 1971 and the existence of diplomatic ties with China. The first component of the OCP drastically increased on average in trade flows with China regardless of the vote of trading partners concerning this UN resolution as well as that for Taiwan. On average, results suggest that diplomatic relations with China improve bilateral trade flows for China, but a trade-deteriorating effect appears for Taiwan with certain ex-colonies. We also find that the effects of these economic diplomacy components confirm previous results reported for the period studied.
F59|Too Much Idealism? Ferguson, Kissinger, and the Vietnam War|Ferguson provides evidence from Kissinger’s early academic writings involving Kantian philosophy and nineteenth century diplomacy, but continuing much later, that his subject was not the one-dimensional realist many have taken him to be. Kissinger was in fact a Kantian idealist, thought Prince Metternich to be backward-looking, and had serious reservations about the thrust of Bismarck’s power politics… Ferguson’s account of his record regarding Vietnam during the Kennedy andJohnson administrations demonstrates that Kissinger never opposed overall war strategy, although he made tactical criticisms of it. Ferguson and Kissinger both neglect evidence that Kennedy was moving in an opposite direction regarding Vietnam, and that serious intra-Vietnam peace talks were underway in 1963. Such neglect leaves a misleading impression about alternatives… Ferguson’s account provides much evidence that Kissinger’s, and US, expectations for what might be obtained at the negotiating table in 1967-68 were unrealistic–this is a cardinal criticism of Kissinger and Nixon’s performance… Kissinger’s premises for continuing in Vietnam were usually geopolitical, rather than based on careful understanding of what was happening on the ground; and his view of power relations, at least during the 1950s and 1960s, gave insufficient attention to the role of nonaligned countries in contributing to international stability. Also, Kissingerthought maintaining US credibility an almost independent rationalefor continuing the war effort. Credibility arguments work best, however, where their advocates are otherwise on the right side of history. Just as the US security framework survived concessions to avoid nuclear war over Berlin or Cuba, it would survive the post-Vietnam consequence thattroop commitments would henceforth be severely limited. The Kissinger-Nixon approach to Vietnam suffered from too little foreign policy realism, not too much.
F59|Are Democratising Countries Rewarded with Higher Levels of Foreign Aid?|The paper examines how flows of foreign aid have reacted to events of democratisation in developing countries. Using a panel dataset of 136 aid-receiving countries between 1980 and 2009, aid allocation regressions reveal that Western donors in general have tended to react to visible, major democratic transitions by increasing aid to the partner country, but no significant increases can be identified in the case of countries introducing smaller democratic reforms. The increases in aid flows are not sustained over time, implying that donors do not provide long-term support to nascent democracies. Also, democratisations in Sub-Saharan Africa do not seem to have been rewarded with higher levels of aid.

F59|Impacts macroéconomiques internationaux des réformes structurelles|La mise en oeuvre de réformes structurelles sur les marchés des biens et du travail a des effets différenciés selon la structure économique sous-jacente des pays. Les effets de diffusion de ces réformes structurelles sont généralement positifs pour les économies partenaires, mais d’une ampleur qui varie avec les caractéristiques des canaux de diffusion, sensiblement différents d’une économie à l’autre.
F59|International macroeconomic impacts of structural reforms|The impact of the implementation of structural reforms on product and labour markets differs according to the underlying economic structure of countries. The spillover effects of these structural reforms are generally positive for partner economies, but the magnitude varies depending on the characteristics of the transmission channels, which are very different across economies.
F59|Inclusive Human Development in Pre-crisis Times of Globalization-driven Debts|" type=""main"" xml:lang=""en""> The paper verifies the Azzimonti et al. ( ) conclusions on a sample of 53 African countries for the period 1996–2008. Authors of the underlying study have established theoretical underpinnings for a negative nexus between rising public debt and inequality in OECD nations. We assess the effects of four debt dynamics on Inequality Adjusted Human Development. Instrumental variable and interactive regressions were employed as empirical strategies. Two main findings were established which depend on whether debt is endogenous to or interactive with globalization. First, when external debt is endogenous to globalization, the effect on inclusive human development is negative, whereas when it is interactive with globalization, the effect is positive. This may reflect the false economics of preconditions. The magnitudes of negative estimates from endogenous related effects were higher than the positive marginal interactive effects. Policy implications were discussed in light of the post-2015 development agenda."
F59|The Evidence on Globalisation|" type=""main"" xml:id=""twec12174-abs-0001""> Globalisation is blamed for many socioeconomic shortcomings. I discuss the consequences of globalisation by surveying the empirical globalisation literature. My focus is on the KOF indices of globalisation that have been used in more than 100 studies. Early studies using the KOF index reported correlations between globalisation and several outcome variables. Studies published more recently identify causal effects. The evidence shows that globalisation has spurred economic growth, promoted gender equality and improved human rights. Moreover, globalisation did not erode welfare state activities, did not have any significant effect on labour market interaction and hardly influenced market deregulation. It increased, however, within-country income inequality. The consequences of globalisation thus turn out to be overall much more favourable than often conjectured in the public discourse."
F59|Quelle stratégie financière pour un accord climatique à Paris 2015 ?|The Paris climate summer represents the last chance to lay the foundations for a universal agreement. An ambitious climate agreement is based on: (1) a commitment by governments, (2) an independent monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system and (3) the introduction of international carbon pricing. In this paper we propose a method combining taxation and allowances markets. First, the introduction of an international carbon bonus-malus system, with a tax of around $7 per tonne of CO 2 , calculated for each country on the basis of the difference between its average emissions per capita and the world average. This pricing system would have the dual objective of encouraging countries with low emissions per capita to join the common MRV system and of facilitating compliance with the pledge to make an annual transfer of $100 billion to the least developed countries. Second, the creation of a transcontinental carbon market, based on the emissions trading systems being developed in Europe, China and the United States. Interconnecting these markets requires setting up a common system of governance to ensure that major emitters fully commit themselves to trajectories consistent with the objective of limiting global warming to 2?C.

F59|Implementing partial tax harmonization in an asymmetric tax competition game with repeated interaction|This paper investigates the conditions under which partial harmonization for capital taxation is sustained in a repeated interactions model of tax competition when there are three countries with heterogenous capital endowments. We show that regardless of the structure of the coalition (i.e., full or partial tax coordination), whether partial tax harmonization is sustainable or not crucially depends on the extent to which the capital endowment of the medium-sized country is similar to that of the large or small country. The most noteworthy finding is that the closer the capital endowment of the median country is to the average one, the less likely the tax harmonization including the median country is to prevail and the more likely the partial tax harmonization excluding the median country is to prevail. We also show that partial tax harmonization makes the member countries of the tax union better off and non-member countries worse off, which stands in sharpe contrast with previous studies, such as Konrad and Schjelderup (1999) and Bucovetsky (2009).
F59|The Behavior of Conventional and Islamic Bank Deposit Returns in Malaysia and Turkey|This paper examines the empirical behavior of conventional bank deposit rates and the rate of return on retail Islamic profit-and-loss sharing (PLS) investment accounts in Malaysia and Turkey, using monthly data from January 1997 to August 2010. The analysis shows that conventional bank deposit rates and PLS returns exhibit long-run cointegration and the time-varying volatility of conventional bank deposit rates and PLS returns is correlated and is statistically significant. The pairwise and multivariate causality tests show that conventional bank deposit rates Granger cause returns on PLS accounts. These findings have policy implications in terms of price stability and financial stability.
F59|An Empirical Study of the Relationship between Money Market Interest Rates and Stock Market Performance: Evidence from Zimbabwe (2009-2013)|The research examines the long run relationship between money market interest rates and stock market returns in Zimbabwe from April 2009 to December 2013. The estimation model controls for money supply growth rate, inflation, volume of manufacturing index, crude oil price and political stability. All the variables were tested for unit root using augmented Dickey-Fuller test before Johansen cointegration tests. Based on vector error correlation Granger causality tests, findings show evidence of strong and statistically significant inverse causal relationship between money market interest and stock market returns. Findings also show existence of short run causality that runs from stock market returns to money market interest rates. This is believed to be caused by the passive nature of money market in Zimbabwe and non-functionality of Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe in controlling interest rates through monetary policy. There is therefore need to implement robust and pragmatic macroeconomic policies like the repo market to reactivate the money market.
F59|Price-Money Relationship after Infl ation Targeting: Co-integration Test with Structural Breaks for Turkey and Brazil|The infl ation targeting (IT) strategy may create structural changes in macroeconomic variables. This study analyzes the effect of the IT strategy on the price-money supply relationship in Turkey and Brazil by Kejriwal–Perron (K–P) cointegration analysis with structural breaks. The analysis aims to determine whether the IT strategy leads to regime shifts in the price index-money supply relationship in Turkey and Brazil. The K–P tests reveal a structural break in the price-money supply relationship as a result of the IT strategy. In both countries, the implementation of this strategy leads to a decrease in the regime coeffi cients for Turkey while it creates an increase for Brazil. When Turkey and Brazil are compared in terms of money-price relationship after the IT strategy, the study reveals that it has weakened more in Brazil.
F59|The costs of conflict: A choice-theoretic, equilibrium analysis|In models of (destructive) armed conflict, it is standard to account for the endogeneity of arming allocations made by incumbent government and rebel parties. Indeed, standard contest-theoretic (microeconomic) models of behavior recognize that allocations change with shifts in marginal benefit or marginal cost. Taking governments and rebels as responsive to such shifts, the present study applies standard, contest-theoretic, equilibrium analysis to the Smith et al. (2014) model of conflict and cooperation. This alternative solution methodology yields starkly different results. Within the present analysis, there does not exist greater scope for cooperation given endogenously-destructive arming rather than exogenously-destructive arming.
F59|Good-Bye financial crash, hello financial eclecticism: Latin American responses to the 2008–09 global financial crisis|1985 saw the publication of Carlos Díaz-Alejandro's classic article, “Good-Bye Financial Repression, Hello Financial Crash” (1985). Writing in the wake of drastic financial blowups in the Southern Cone, Díaz-Alejandro nonetheless argued that “a believable alternative system could be designed, avoiding many of the inefficiencies of financial repression … and blending both public and private financial agents” (18). Nearly three decades after the publication of this prescient work, there are credible signs that such an arrangement is now emerging within some Latin American emerging economies (EEs). Just as Díaz-Alejandro studied how the 1982 debt shocks both exacerbated and shed light on financial sector policies and institutions in the Southern Cone countries, we use the 2008–09 global financial crisis (GFC) as a lens through which to examine the policymaking capabilities of six Latin American countries. We find that several of the countries successfully weathered the 2008–09 financial shocks and argue that this is due to: institutional modernization that facilitated policy learning and a more business-friendly climate; and, to sustainable improvements in income distribution that may have facilitated consensus-building. These factors, we suggest, gave policymakers both the expertise and the political space to employ more nuanced fiscal and financial policies.
F59|Political economy of fiscal unions|Fiscal unions often use fiscal transfers to counter asymmetric shocks, but such transfers may be politically controversial. I present a model of a two-region fiscal union with region-specific shocks where the threat of secession imposes a limit on fiscal redistribution between regions. I show that both correlation of shocks across regions and their persistence over time are important for political support for integration. The gains from inter-regional risk sharing are potentially large when shocks are negatively correlated and temporary. In contrast, unions with negatively correlated permanent shocks are likely to be fragile.
F59|Global crisis: a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach to paradigm change|The global crisis is threefold. First, it is a financial and economic crisis, inducing hugely negative effects on growth, distribution, and welfare. Second, it severely damaged the mainstream in economics, particularly the theory of efficient financial markets and the theory of self-regulating markets. Third, it caused an ongoing fragility of conventional public policies to address socioeconomic issues. The scale of the global crisis demands nothing less than paradigm change. This change requires adopting an interdisciplinary triangle, in which economics dialogues productively with political science and international relations. The goal is a more pluralist and interdisciplinary theory of economic policies. In that spirit, the paper provides a critical analysis of the dominant narrative on globalization, and outlines an alternative, one that could favor more democratic and progressive policies, at both the national and international level.
F59|Anti-dumping petitions and exports: Evidence on the People’s Republic of China during the global financial crisis|Purpose - – The purpose of this paper is to quantify how the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) export volume affects the anti-dumping (AD) petitions filed by its major trading partners against the country. Design/methodology/approach - – Focusing on the AD petitions at the Harmonized System (HS) Code eight-digit level and the PRC’s exports at the HS two-digit level to its major trade partners during the financial crisis, we construct three instrument variables for export volume within HS two-digit level variation in the variables. These instruments – documents required, time taken and container charges incurred for goods traded across borders – represent trade costs obtained from World Bank’s Doing Business Project. We find rising exports from the PRC lead to rising AD petitions against the country. Findings - – Instrumental variable estimates indicate that a 1 percentage point rise in the PRC’s export volume raises the number of AD petitions against the country by about 0.25 percentage points, and the probability of receiving AD petitions by 3.5 per cent. These estimates are about 10 times larger than that found in ordinary least square regressions. Originality/value - – Their quantitative significance underlines why it is important to consider the issue of export endogeneity in the estimation, and that the failure of the current trade statistics to account for the true value-added of traded goods particularly disadvantaged the PRC given its position as the factory of the world.
F59|Values Vs. Interest: Strategic Use Of Japanese Foreign Aid In Southeast Asia|In light of an increased focus, in Japanese diplomacy since the turn of the millennium, on the need for strengthening democracy and human rights within ASEAN, this paper examines Japanese Official Development Assistance (ODA) to ASEAN during the 21st century in order to understand if Japan has lived up to its self-imposed principles of paying full attention to human rights and democracy in recipient countries when providing foreign aid. By comparing Japanese ODA flows to ASEAN members, committed through exchange notes between 2001 and 2013 with levels of democracy and human rights adherence in the same countries this paper argues that Japan is pragmatic in its approach to the ODA principles regarding democratization and human rights in recipient countries and balances considerations for normative values with national interests. Given ASEAN’s increasing importance for Japan, as a growing market and a strategic hedge against what is perceived as increased Chinese influence in the region, a major shift of said approach seems highly unlikely in the near future, particularly with the Abe administration set on using ODA more strategically as a means to secure regional stability and national security.
F59|Business as an Actor in Regional Governance: The Case of the APEC Business Advisory Council (Abac) in APEC|In the modern globalized world new actors, in particular business, exert increasing influence on the international decision-making processes. The business is generally important and influential actor in the regional governance promoting the group`s common interests. The article aims to test this hypothesis drawing on the findings from study of the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC). The author analyses the Asia-Pacific business priorities promoted by the ABAC, actions implemented to make other regional actors acting in line with these priorities and ABAC achievements in that process. The official ABAC and APEC documents constituted the evidence base for the analysis. The research methods used in the article include qualitative content analysis and comparative historical analysis. The author comes to conclusion that business is an influential actor in the Asia-Pacific regional governance due to its capability to promote business priorities implementation at the state level.
F59|Empirical Analysis of Multinational S&T Collaboration Priorities –The Case of Russia|The problem of rationalizing S&T cooperation, including identifying the most promising areas and forms for S&T cooperation (geographical and thematic) and state support instruments, is critically important to many countries. In view of the growing complexity of global trends and domestic restrictions on development and the emergence of new factors affecting contacts with foreign countries, there are increasing demands in the international arena to collect and analyse relevant information required to make substantiated administrative decisions on various levels, including with regard to international S&T collaboration. In these conditions, researchers and experts tend to resort to a broad range of empirical methods, while politicians make more active use of their results in administrative practice and international contacts. This working paper describes and systematizes analysis results in the field of international S&T collaboration based on a bibliometric study. The authors combine quantitative methods of bibliometrics and sociology to identify prospective partners and promising areas for collaboration. In addition, the possibility of using the proposed approach to provide information support for current state policy-making is assessed, and key results of the study are examined
F59|Comparative Advantages Revealed In The Foreign Trade From Mexico And Turkey, Las Ventajas Comparativas Reveladas En El Comercio Exterior De Mexico Y Turquia|Mexico and Turkey are two economies with strategically geographic positions and shared perspectives on trade liberalization and investment promotion. Turkey is a gateway to dynamic and complex markets in Asia and Europe. This situation is favorable to the economic goals of Mexico. In this research we provide an analysis with economic indicators showing the degree of openness of Mexico and Turkey as well as its ability to adapt to international trade, their convergence and their comparative advantages revealed for strengthen areas of opportunity from economic integration.
F59|Structural Changes in the Global Commodities Market|Commodities play an important part in the growth of the material production and in the world trade in goods and services. The access to raw materials is vital for sustaining the economic and social development of any country and for satisfying domestic demand for material goods. Increasing demand for commodities and the need for assuring a sustainable supply pose great challenges on the world economy. This paper is dealing with the main developments which occured during the last 15 years in the global commodity market, a major driver of the world economy, pointing out to the rapidly growing consumption, on the one hand, and the remarkable role played by China, an extremely dynamic economy, which has become by far the largest world consumer for such important commodities as aluminium, copper, nickel, meat, soybeans, on the other hand.
F59|BRICSâ€™ contribution to the new world order: a capacity appraisal|The present paper analyzes BRICSâ€™ capacity and contribution to building up the New World Economic Order. Our investigation is structured around three perspectives related to these countries: national, international and in relation to each other, enclosed in the theoretical framework of international relations. The argumentation is based on economic phenomena and processes, longitudinal and transversal comparative analyses and also the plentiful literature. In the introduction I clarify the concept of New World Order through the lenses of (neo)realism, (neo)liberalism and constructivism. In the following section, my objective is to bring to the forefront the five countriesâ€™ national performance estimated through four equally weighted components: critical mass, economic performance, military strength and quality of governance. In the succeeding section I assess the actual stage of BRICSâ€™ multilevel cooperation, answering the question whether the economic projects initiated by these countries involve rival or complementary goals. The final section summarizes the main conclusions and several directions for further research.
F59|A cluster analysis of FDI in Latin America|This study contributes to the literature on FDI in Latin America using cluster analysis, a technique rarely employed in studies on this topic, to examine the FDI performance of Latin American countries. The empirical findings reveal three clusters in 2011, compared to just two in 2005. The cluster with better FDI performance (Chile, Panama, Uruguay, and Costa Rica) also performs better in terms of variables such as market size, trade openness, and human capital. Between 2005 and 2011 Argentina left the best-performing cluster and the cluster with poorer performance split into two, indicating heterogeneous evolution of economies in the region.
F59|A Comparative Analysis Of The Eu Member States Regarding Their Interdependence With Russia|The interdependence is definitely the most common concept used to describe the relations between the EU and Russia. Nevertheless, despite their obvious interdependence, there are still a series of debates in literature which usually arise when it comes to describing its typology and its implications, especially in the analysis at the Member States level. Moreover, given the complexity and variety of relations between the EU-27 and the Russian Federation, the present study aims to outline a comprehensive picture of the interdependence between the two actors at a regional level by conducting a comparative analysis of the European Union Member States according to their interdependence with Russia, considering energy as the main aspect of their relations. In this sense, the scientific approach will focus on a comparative analysis of the mutual energy dependencies between the member states and Russia, in order to characterize the interdependence typologies, as well as to identify the distribution of cost and advantages.
F59|Economic Security – New Approaches In The Context Of Globalization|Nowadays, more than ever, economic relations between states are the ones that define the general character of the relations between them and establish economic security as a concept which cannot be neglected anymore. Globalization, the process that shapes the international environment, undermines the old definition of economic security and forces its redefinition. The article aims to identify and analyse the effects of globalization on economic security and the new approaches it takes in this context.
F59|The Reconfiguration Of The Contemporary World Economic Order. Determining The Position Of The European Union Within The Hierarchy Of Power Centres|The hereby study offers an ensemble image upon the effects of the contemporary economic order and reconfiguration of the European Union. In this light, we wish to stress the main tendencies of the current world conjunction, the economic, politic and geostrategic opportunities and challenges, as well as the factors that contributed to the affirmation of the European Union on the global economic scene. In order to determine the position that European Union occupies in the hierarchy of the power centres, we analysed the main indexes of economic growth, the impact of politics and reforms upon the integration process, the effect of the global crises upon the European structure and the existent discrepancies between different regions of the European Union. The main conclusion drawn from this study is that, by aspiring to the status of a superpower and trying to affirm itself as an economic and politic individuality, able to sustain its own visions and protects its own interests, the European Union should aim to become a political global force. However, it is hard to achieve that since the European Union lacks an internal cohesion and the required capabilities in order to develop a global policy.
F59|Theoretical Perspectives On Economic Cooperation|Economic cooperation, the engine of relations of international economic cooperation, is an insufficiently defined, dynamic concept. The transformations of the international environment, globalization and the intensification of economic interdependencies render economic cooperation a must, and not just an option within international relations. Similar to the international environment, economic cooperation undergoes a process of redefinition, of adjustment to the new realities. This article aims at identifying and analyzing the approaches of economic cooperation in this context.
F59|Political influence in commercial and financial oil trading : the evidence from US firms|"International politics affects oil trade. But do financial and commercial traders who participate in spot oil trading also respond to changes in international politics? We construct a firm-level dataset for all U.S. oil-importing companies over 1986-2008 to examine how these firms respond to increases in ""political distance"" between the U.S. and her trading partners, measured by divergence in their UN General Assembly voting patterns. Consistent with previous macro evidence, we first show that individual firms diversify their oil imports politically, even after controlling for unobserved firm heterogeneity. However, the political pattern of oil imports is not entirely driven by the concerns of hold-up risks, which exist when oil transactions via term contracts are associated with backward vertical FDI that is subject to expropriation. In particular, our results indicate that even financial and commercial traders significantly reduce their oil imports from U.S. political enemies. Interestingly, while these traders diversify their oil imports politically immediately after changes in international politics, other oil companies reduce their oil imports with a significant time lag. Our findings suggest that in designing regulations to avoid harmful repercussions on commodity and financial assets, policymakers need to understand the nature of political risk."
F59|Trade Policy in the European Union in the Light of Europe 2020 Strategy|In the European Union, trade between Member States and trade relations with third parties is an important element in terms of economic development especially in the long term. Increasing wealth and improving living conditions for people depend heavily on trade relations between the EU member states and extra EU, economic growth being closely linked to the manner in which it can be driven and supported by policies implemented in the field. Changes and especially their dynamics in terms of the pressures upon the global economy in the context of globalization of markets and not only cause permanent change of the parameters of business undertakings both at Community level and internationally, in trade relations. The EU responsibilities in local, regional and global areas are significant, the European Union being among the most powerful world economic actors.
F59|The education networks of Latin America. Effects on trade during and after the cold war|The friendship and social networks international students tend to build during their university studies can boost trade between the home country and that of the alma mater. This paper tests the effects of Latin American students on bilateral trade between eleven home economies and nine OECD countries during 1971-2012. We find education networks to positively and significantly affect both exports and imports. Also, the democratization and liberalization of Latin American political regimes following the end of the cold war slightly weaken the influence of networks, but directly and positively affect trade. Results are robust to different specifications and regressors.

F59|The Harnessing Of The Renewable Energy Sources Potential Of The Republic Of Moldova|Ensuring energy needs has turned into a major topic of all socio-economic systems worldwide. Against this background, renewable energy sources become a powerful part of the national, regional and global security. Given the current global trends and the major dependence on imports of energy resources in Moldova, a new strategy must be adopted by upgrading existing energy infrastructure, internal energy market analysis, diversification of the existing renewable energy sources and permanent coordination of the decisions taken within national energy policies. In this article, the author examined the potential of the renewable energy sources available in the Republic of Moldova, presenting calculations on the effectiveness of these resources use.
F59|Dynamics And New Challenges In The Global Commodity Market|Global economy and particularly the world production of goods depends to a large extent on the supply of raw materials, of resource inputs extracted from the environment as well as an easy access to them. Commodities play an important part in the growth of global production and in the world trade in goods and services. The access to raw materials is vital for sustaining the productive capacity of the economy and also for satisfying domestic demand for industrial goods. On the other side, increasing demand for commodities and the need for assuring a sustainable supply pose great challenges on the world economy. The issue of raw materials supply represents a high-priority theme in the political agenda of the European Union. The Raw Materials Initiative launched in 2008 by the European Commission is based on three main pillars: - to ensure the access to raw materials on world market at undistorted conditions; - to foster sustainable supply of raw materials from European sources; - to reduce the EU's consumption of primary raw materials. (EC, 2008). To this end, EC has started to take action in order to ensure access to resources and avoid supply shortages. A great deal of attention is being paid to the study of recent developments in the global and particular commodity markets, taking into consideration fundamental aspects as supply concentration, governance of producing countries, the pressure of demand and its impact on prices, material's substitutability, stressing the role of resource consumption efficiency, recycling and substitution of vital raw materials and thus providing policy makers and industry with reliable information on how to efficiently manage resource inputs. This paper is dealing with the main developments which occurred during the past decade or so in the global commodity market, a major driver of the world economy, with particular reference to selected key-markets - as: aluminium, copper, nickel; cotton; corn, meat-swine, rice, wheat, soybeans; oil - emphasizing the issue of price volatility and new challenges in the market.
F59|Intercultural Communication in International Business through Transactional Culture Building|Intercultural communication is the central, integrating component in the system of inter­national business; the “glue” which binds all of the elements together. Although the field of in­ternational business communications is practice oriented, awareness of the philosophical and methodological foundations and of the analytical tools develops analysis and assessment skills in intercultural situations and reveals new practical options to the participants in the system of inter­national business. The article proceeds from the situation and context-based views of culture and intercultural communication. The thesis states that the transactional culture approach reflects the contemporary behavioural perspective in in­ternational business. Namely, behavioural chang­es in the participants in international business occur under the influence of the international­ization and globalization of economic processes. On the basis of a literature review, analytical reasoning and empirical observations, the article sheds light on the concept of transactional cul­ture and discusses its implications for intercul­tural communication in international business
F59|Security Strains in the EU Eastern Neighbourhood in the Light of a Looming Common Foreign Policy [Presiuni de securitate în vecinătatea estică a UE în lumina emergentei politici externe comune]|The EU addresses security threats for the Eastern partners both through a dedicated policy created in 2004, the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), and through corresponding instruments included in the Common and Security Policy (CSDP). The latest ENP review in November 2015 and the forthcoming CSDP review from June 2016 are expected to bring more junctions between the two policies.
F59|The Eurasian Economic Union: Outlooks on the Development of Relations with the European Union [Uniunea Economică Eurasiatică: privire asupra dezvoltării relaţiilor cu Uniunea Europeană]|In spite of having received relatively little media attention since it came into effect on January 1st, 2015, the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) is not without its controversies. Analysts are split upon what exactly the nature and the purpose of this organization really are. One scenario: EEU is a geopolitical tool for Vladimir Putin to further his agenda on Russia’s sphere of influence in Eurasia.
F59|Ukraine… The Big Test for the European Neighbourhood Policy [L’Ukraine… Un grand test pour la Politique Européenne de Voisinage]|The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) was implemented in 2004 by the European Union (EU) in order to create an area of prosperity, stability, security and economic cooperation with the neighbouring countries with the aim of avoiding the emergence of new dividing lines between the enlarged EU and its neighbours. However, this policy has, paradoxically, caused the opposite.
F59|(Re)Mapping Geographies of Development- BRIC(S) Superpower Challengers?|The purpose of our present study is to investigate the concepts of power and superpower in their present day economic and political manifestation. Starting form Samuel Huntington’s assuption, according to which, the current global system is a hybrid (uni-multipolar) system, in which the U.S. are a major power, we then take a close look at the way in which the BRIC(S) countries are attempting at present to challenge this dominating position.
F59|Democratic transition and foreign direct investment: Transition process matters|"This paper provides evidence on the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and democratic transition. We propose first an econometric analysis of the determinants of the democratization process through a ""probit"" model. We consider a sample of 173 countries, with 44 that have experienced a democratic transition over the period 1980-2010. Our results reveal that variables related to human development and individual freedom facilitate the initiation of the democratic process in contrast to those related to social heterogeneity. In the second part, we study the impact of the democratic transition on FDI inflows. In order to avoid endogeneity, we limit the analysis to countries in transition and similar ones deduced from a matching process carried out after the first part. Our results confirm that democratic transitions lead to a significant increase in FDI inflows"
F59|The origins of Argentina’s litigation and arbitration saga, 2002-2014|The voluminous and protracted litigation and arbitration saga featuring the Republic of Argentina (mostly as defendant or respondent, respectively) has established important legal and arbitral precedents, as illustrated by three cases involving Argentina which were appealed all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court and were settled in 2014. At first glance, the scale of Argentina-related litigation activity might be explained by the sheer size of the government’s 2001 default, the largest-ever up to that point. However, its true origins are to be found in the unusually coercive and aggressive way that the authorities in that country went about defaulting on and restructuring their sovereign debt obligations. The mass filing of arbitration claims, in turn, was prompted by Argentina’s radical and seemingly irreversible changes to the “rules of the game” affecting foreign strategic investors, which clashed with commitments prior governments had made in multiple bilateral investment treaties. In sum, a major deviation from best practices as understood and settled in the early 2000s, which codified how economic policy adjustments are to be made in a way that minimizes damage to the investment climate, preserves access to the international capital markets, and promotes rapid and sustainable economic growth, lies at the root of Argentina’s litigation and arbitration saga during 2002-2014.
F59|Emergence of cross-border taxation and firm behaviour|The chapter discusses the evolution of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) from an emerging market (EM) perspective. It shows how treaties meant to prevent double taxation were used for double non-taxation and the problem was especially severe in EMs. It presents evidence of BEPS in India using firm level panel data. Since one country acting alone can frighten away foreign capital, global co-ordination is necessary. This makes BEPS one of the most productive initiatives G-20 has taken up. It aims to build global norms and agreements to ensure that taxes are paid where profit is earned. India should reform its corporate tax and regimes and bilateral investment treaties in line with international developments even while simplifying them and making them more business friendly.
F59|Francouzsko-Německé monetární vztahy - pnutí v základech eurozóny<BR>[Franco-German Monetary Relations - Tensions Built Into the Eurozone Core]|This paper discusses the thesis that the main danger for eurozone survival does not lie in the areas that most economists have focused on; that is, it lies neither in insufficient regulation of the financial sector (banking union) nor in fiscal irresponsibility of the European governments (fiscal compact). The eurozone technically has unlimited financial resources at its disposal to solve its recent financial problems, but the potential threats are rather of a political origin. The most important challenges are the distinct expectations that the strongest European economies harbored before the foundation of the eurozone. The French sought to gain more autonomy in the conduct of their domestic economic policy, which had been impeded by external constraints, particularly exacerbated by German monetary policy. The German goal was to prevent permanent upward pressure on their currency, which had been undermining their export-led economic model. These distinct expectations did partly influence the institutional arrangement of the Economic and Monetary Union. However, the essence of the Franco-German conflict has not been adequately addressed and we hold that the eurozone in its current setting is not able to fully resolve it. That being said, the ECB can employ means that could allow it to postpone the solution for a very long time.
F59|El MERCOSUR a 20 años del Protocolo de Ouro Preto: un balance de la dimensión comercial|Este artículo realiza un análisis de la dimensión comercial del MERCOSUR. Para ello se distinguen dos niveles: el de la política comercial implementada por los países miembros en sus relaciones hacia el bloque; y el de los flujos del comercio. A 20 años del Protocolo de Ouro Preto, se argumenta que si bien el MERCOSUR no ha alcanzado los objetivos de un mercado común, ha logrado cimentar las bases de una interdependencia económica. Se observa que en los últimos diez años, a pesar de que la coordinación de políticas hacia la zona de libre comercio y unión aduanera ha sido endeble, los flujos del comercio intrazona han mantenido una relativa estabilidad. El análisis combina elementos cuantitativos y cualitativos en su diseño de investigación y se apoya en fuentes documentales y estadísticas, que permiten presentar argumentos y evidencia empírica que contrastan contra las interpretaciones pesimistas del devenir del bloque regional.
F59|A MORE PROSPEROUS EUROPE : REVISITING THE CONCEPTS OF GROWTH , DEVELOPMENT AND PROSPERITY (International Conference “EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVE OF LABOR MARKET - INOVATION, EXPERTNESS, PERFORMANCE”)|Although discussions on the need to replace the view on economy based on Newtonian physics have been present for several decades, especially after the 1970s, the conditions in the European Union after 2008, as well as the long term global prospects have determined an increasing urgency for designing a new paradigm for a sustainable and humanely fulfilling economy.The interest for a new paradigm is not confined to European Union but the urgency may be higher in its case as a combination of structural and circumstantial factors require a sustainable solution sooner rather than later. The current official strategy, Europe 2020, has in view a new “growth model and creating the conditions for a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth”. But the five flagship initiatives of the strategy address important but partial dimensions of the socio-economic system. The strategy proposes some remedies but not a new paradigm. This paper aims to explore and capitalize on a number of new approaches that try to define growth, development and prosperity in a more realistic and operational manner. At the same time the author explores the consequences of rethinking growth and development and advocates a shift from quantitative to qualitative analysis. The conclusion is that reaching the goal of a more prosperous Europe requires some clarifications on what prosperity is and which is the relation of this new meaning of prosperity with the current global conditions that include the new technologies, the existing natural resources, the impact of waste on the environment and the human nature as manifested in the new geopolitical context.
F59|Does International Trade Reduce Political Disputes?|The effect of economic integration and other factors on interstate conflict has been examined with a delimited geographical scope. A logistic regression analysis is adopted with one-year lagged independent variables regressed on dependent variable of interstate conflict. It is revealed that the pacification effect of economic openness and economic dependence on trade of the East African countriesâ€”Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania and Ugandaâ€”is significant. In addition, it is found that an improvement in the democratic situation of the dyads reduces the likelihood of eruption of interstate conflict in the region. The article has uncovered that higher national capability asymmetry in East African region among the specified countries leads to an increase in the possibility of violence.
F59|The Energy Policy of the US towards Central Africa After 2001|The article «The Energy Policy of the US toward Central Africa After 2001» has many justifications. Academically, it should provide researchers of policy analysis a frame of reading Central Africa relations with the US in regards of the US energy security. It should also provide students of Central African affairs, especially in relation to the US the lenses through which to read ongoing events(human rights, civil unrest, terrorism) in the sub-region and how the US policy is influencing these events in the area. This work is also policy relevant because it should provide policy makers enough information and choices in formulating and conducting foreign policy decisions toward the US. The article aims to trace the US energy policy changes and subsequent US interest in the energy resources of Central Africa. Equally, to analyze the US foreign policy with regards to the US energy security toward Central Africa. In addition to the above, the article aims to concede the Central Africa?s energy resources for the development of the US global power. The foreign policy of the US towards Central Africa is influenced by its energy security in the sub-region. The US engage more with countries that produce oil than countries that are not oil producing nations. The US invest more in countries that can produce and sell oil and invest less in countries that have little to offer to the United States. With regards of the US energy policy toward Central Africa, it is clear that the US has been increasing to secure energy in the region confronting other powers like China, Russia and India as shown by the high increased in the US import of the energy resources in Central Africa. Also, the US is willing to co-operate with undemocratic and authoritarian governments in Central Africa like Cameroon, Congo, Angola, Equatorial Guinea and others just to protect its energy interest in the sub-region. However, the US energy policy toward Central Africa has also let to the increase in US investment in the energy sector of Central Africa. Equally, the Central African region has been provided financial, economic and social assistance from the US. Overall, the US energy policy has let to the development of the Sub-Saharan Africa region.
F59|Czas w badaniach nad internacjonalizacją przedsiębiorstw|Celem artykułu jest weryfikacja na podstawie literatury przedmiotu zależności pomiędzy czasem a doświadczeniem zagranicznym i poziomem umiędzynarodowienia przedsiębiorstwa oraz wskazanie znaczenia konceptualizacji pojęcia czasu i związanego z nim tempa w badaniach nad internacjonalizacją przedsiębiorstw. Rozważania przeprowadzono wykorzystując krytyczną analizę literatury z zakresu internacjonalizacji przedsiębiorstw koncentrując się na modelach procesowych, podejściu sieciowym do umiędzynarodowienia oraz literaturze z zakresu przyspieszonej internacjonalizacji. W szczególności uwzględniono badania dotyczące czasu i tempa internacjonalizacji przedsiębiorstw. W artykule przedstawiono wiele wniosków dotyczących czasu w badaniach nad internacjonalizacją przedsiębiorstw związanych kolejno z przyrostem doświadczenia w działalności na rynkach zagranicznych, tempem internacjonalizacji oraz związkiem między czasem a poziomem internacjonalizacji przedsiębiorstw. Wskazano, że, aby uzyskać większe zrozumienie procesu internacjonalizacji przedsiębiorstw, niezbędne jest włączenie czasu explicite do teorii umiędzynarodowienia. Wykazano, że zarówno zależność pomiędzy czasem a przyrostem doświadczenia zagranicznego przedsiębiorstw, jak i czasem a poziomem ich umiędzynarodowienia jest kompleksowa i nielinearna. Ponadto w zakresie samego pomiaru istotne jest, aby poziom internacjonalizacji wyznaczać na podstawie miar kompleksowych uwzględniających zasoby zaangażowane na różnych płaszczyznach funkcjonowania firmy. Z kolei badania nad tempem internacjonalizacji powinny uwzględniać zarówno pomiar tempa podjęcia działalności zagranicznej, jak i tempa całego późniejszego procesu umiędzynarodowienia, co ma szczególne znaczenie dla badań nad przedsiębiorstwami born global.
F59|Measuring attitudes toward regional organizations outside Europe|What shapes public attitudes toward regional organizations (ROs)? Although a number of articles have focused on the causes, design, and effectiveness of ROs in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, research so far has neglected to study the factors influencing public opinion regarding these bodies. This exploratory article argues that public attitudes toward organizations in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America are shaped by citizens’ fundamental economic and ideational perceptions and by their trust in domestic actors. These hypotheses are tested by employing data from the Afrobarometer and Latinobarometro surveys. The findings lend more credibility to the assumption that citizens outside Europe use heuristics instead of utilitarian cost-benefit analyses when asked for their attitudes toward regional integration and its organizations.

F59|International Tax Cooperation and Implications of Globalization|The success of the post-2015 development agenda depends on adopting global goals for sustainable development and on designing a robust accountability system. All stakeholders should be involved in the accountability framework. While sustainable development goals (SDGs) are universal in character, they need to be adapted to national contexts, according to specific sets of constraints and opportunities. Countries need also to specify their global commitments to create an enabling environment for sustainable development worldwide. The adaptation of global goals into national targets ensures ownership and facilitates answerability, thus promoting an accountability framework that is inclusive, transparent and participatory bottom-up process.
F59|2015 Global Conjuncture And Expectations|The year 2015 is bringing serious attention to the global economic model and some pertinent evolution which will lead to a repositioning of the economic powers, old and news. It is a sign that the old design of understanding the mighty locomotives of the further economic growth is changing and its perspectives should take care of the evolving in the new motivations which can add to the quality of future growth. We can thing about the change of the paradigm in the existing order and accept that economic thinking should adopt to the new realities.
F59|The Political Economy of FDI flows into Developing Countries: Does the depth of International Trade Agreements Matter?|There is considerable debate whether the domestic political institutions (specifically, the country’s level of democracy) of the host developing country toward foreign investors are effective in establishing the credibility of commitments are still underway, researchers have also analyzed the effect of international institutions such as (GATT-WTO) membership and Bilateral Investment treaties (BIT) in their role of establishing the credibility of commitment to attract foreign investments. In addition, most recent studies have examined the effect of International Trade Agreements (TAs) on FDI flows as they contain separate investment chapters and dispute settlement mechanism, thus providing confidence to investor regarding the security of their investments. We argue that there are qualitative differences among various types of trade agreements and full-fledged trade agreements (FTA-CU) provide credibility to foreign investors and democracy level in the host country conditions this effect whereas the partial scope agreements (PSA) are not sufficient in providing credibility of commitments and not moderated by democracy. This paper analyses the impact of heterogeneous TAs, and their interaction with domestic institutions, on FDI inflows. Statistical analyses for 122 developing countries from 1970 to 2005 support this argument. The method adopted relies on fixed effects estimator which is robust to control endogeneity on a large panel dataset. The strict erogeneity of results by using a method suggested by Baier and Bergstrand (2007) and no feedback effect found in sample. The results state that (1) More the FTA-CU concluded, larger the amount of FDI inflows are attracted into the developing countries and PSA are insignificant in determining the FDI inflow; (2) FTA CU are complementary to democratic regime whereas the conditional effect of PSA with democracy on levels of FDI inflows is insignificant
F59|More than Words and Good Intentions: The Political Agenda-Setting Power|Abstract In this paper, international aid is examined as a tool for political agenda-setting. A theoretical model is constructed for the analysis, incorporating the incentives created by foreign aid, on the political benefits of recipient governments. The model also incorporates the compensating benefits provided by these governments through the legitimization of the donor country's political agenda. The main results of this model indicate that governments which offer international assistance can in inffluence the political agenda of recipient countries through two channels: 1) By reducing the political costs of official intervention in issues that receive aid, and 2) By generating incentives for additional political rent-seeking. The results are studied in the case of aid provided by the USA to Colombia during the period 1998-2012, which shows the power of US presidents to establish part of the Colombian political agenda related to drugs and terrorism. The results are obtained through a novel content analysis of presidential speeches in both countries and from a set of estimates corrected by possible problems of endogeneity in foreign aid allocation.
F59|Theories of EU Actorness and the Treaty of Lisbon EU as a Global Foreign Policy Actor|This paper assesses the impact of the Lisbon Treaty reform of the EU foreign policy on the actorness of the EU. It is because Europe as a global actor is one of the principal issues of the Treaty of Lisbon. Owing to a growing role of the EU in the world politics, the actorness of the EU has been an issue for the European studies as well as for the international relations theories in past few years. Therefore, this paper analyses the prospective contribution of the newly created post of the High Representative of the Union for the foreign affairs and security policy, newly established European External Action Service, in brief also of the introduction of single legal personality of the EU and the possibility of reinforced cooperation amongst a smaller group of Member States within the Common security and Defence policy to enhancing the EU’s role as a global actor in the field of foreign policy. The analysis draws upon the criteria set by the theories of actorness, first introduced in the 1970’s.
F59|New Institutionalism in Europeanization Research: Positivist or Scientific Realist Metatheory Synthesis?|Combination of europeanization and arguments of rational, sociological (constructivist) and historical institutionalism has become an important and frequently used part of research. To include all three approaches in a coherent research framework is however not axiomatic, as namely rationalism and constructivism are theories arising from different premises. Aim of the introduced text is to open a debate about compatibility og these concepts and to offer alternatives on how new institutionalism theories can be reflected and synthesized on metatheoretical level within one research. Apart from positivist position prevailing in practical research, a possible dialogue of theories based on scientific realism viewpoint will be introduced. Conclusion hereof is not the argument that one way of integration is more suitable than others but a claim that appropriate attention should be drawn to this seemingly abstract part of research.
F59|The Advantages Of Wto Commercial System|The WTO was created in 1995 with the propose to encourage and regulate trade between its member states. The primary objective of the WTO was and still is to create economic growth and encourage free trade among nations. This aspect was disputed between specialists: some say that the WTO creates economic opportunities and that its positive impact extends beyond just economic benefits by creating an international framework of political stability, offering a solid foundation for promoting international peace by encouraging good political relations among member nations and providing a solid dispute resolution process, while others say it is disfavors lower class citizens, limiting their opportunities for social and economic mobility, is only widening the global income gap between the wealthy and poor: as the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and it favors prosperous countries and multinational corporations, while preventing smaller and poorer countries from having a fair shot of engaging in open market trades and exchanges. In this paper we will stop only to emphasize the advantages of the WTO commercial system, following that in a future work to approach also the disadvantages of this commercial system.
F59|A New Distribution Strategy : The Omnichannel Strategy|In an increasingly globalized world, dependent on information technology, distribution companies are searching for new marketing models meant to enrich the consumer’s experience. Therefore, the evolution of new technologies, the changes in the consumer’s behaviour are the main factors that determine changes in the business model in the distribution field. The following article presents different forms of distribution, focusing on the omnichannel strategy. In the last part of the paper, the authors analyse the Romanian retail market, namely, the evolution of the market, its key competitors and the new distribution models adopted by retaileres in our country.
F59|The Nexus between Antidumping Petitions and Exports during the Global Financial Crisis: Evidence on the People’s Republic of China|This paper quantifies how the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) export volume to its major trading partners during the global financial crisis affects the antidumping (AD) petitions filed by the trading partners against the PRC. Focusing on the AD petitions at the Harmonized System (HS) Code 8-digit level and the PRC’s exports at the HS 2-digit level, we construct three instrument variables at the same HS level for export volume. These instruments—documents required, time taken, and container charges incurred for goods traded across borders—represent trade costs obtained from the World Bank’s Doing Business Project. We find rising exports from the PRC lead to rising AD petitions against the country. Instrumental variable estimates indicate that a 1 percentage point rise in the PRC’s export volume raises the number of AD petitions against the country by about 0.3 percentage point, and the probability of receiving AD petitions by 3.6 %. These estimates are about 10 times larger than those found in ordinary least square regressions. Their quantitative significance underlines why it is important to consider the issue of export endogeneity in the estimation. Moreover, it highlights the failure of the current trade statistics to account for the true value-added of traded goods, and how this has particularly disadvantaged the PRC, given its position as the factory of the world.
F59|The Impact of Japan's Rivalry with China on Its Willingness to Pursue Free Trade Agreements|"This study explores the main causes that have led Japan to conclude an FTA with ASEAN. This paper appraises Japan­ASEAN relations and shows that closer relations between Japan and ASEAN have provided momentum for the launch of Japan's FTAs with ASEAN. Consequently, this paper explores the origins and progress of Japan­ASEAN FTA, as well as the strategies and initiatives embraced by Japan in its FTA negotiations with ASEAN. By examining the domestic, regional, and global factors that led to the launch of the Japan­ASEAN FTA, this paper concludes that the strategies adopted were primarily aimed at its main rival, China. The rivalry has resulted in both positive and negative consequences for East Asian Regional economic environment. The negative consequences include the creation of a ""spaghetti bowl"", which increases costs for Japanese firms operating abroad, and ""slows down the progress of the creation of an effective single regional institution""."
F59|Post-communist Economic Integration : Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia|The focus of this paper is the political economy of integration in the framework of the Customs Union and Single Economic Space. Clearly, Russia is a dominant power in this project, and her political interests may outweigh economic ones. However, neither Belarus nor Kazakhstan is forcefully pushed into the Customs Union and Single Economic Space. From the economic viewpoint, they join because Russia is the biggest and most accessible market for their exports, and is also rich in natural resources, which is particularly important for Belarus. There is likely to be both trade creation and trade diversion within the Customs Union and Single Economic Space, and it will concern mainly manufactures, which are now predominantly imported from the outside world. Increased demand for local manufactured goods, in turn, should lead to more employment opportunities in manufacture and agriculture sectors, and better social security for the workers of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia. On the political side, though, this will inevitably play in the hands of the increasingly undemocratic political regimes.
F59|Sraffa And Althusser Reconsidered; Neoliberalism Advancing In South Africa, England, And Greece|[Part I] Archival evidence is extensively elaborated from Piero Sraffa’s papers establishing that his concept of surplus and deficit industries in Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities is quite indebted to Marx’s theory of exploitation. A simple analytical model is also developed. This chapter is followed by utilization of conceptual work in the Sraffian tradition to present an empirical application for China. [Part II] The advance of neoliberalism in recent decades has many facets and three current instances are elaborated here, as disparate as they might otherwise seem. Suggesting uneven development as in Rosa Luxemburg, South African multi-billion dollar investments in two fossil-fuel industrial projects have recently cemented debtor relations to the World Bank and the Chinese Development Bank, while generating activist opposition in this century of climate crisis. Secondary school teachers in England face work that is increasingly commodified, and then judged similarly, a development that represents the penetration of abstract labor and alienation, as in Marx. Our third representation benefitting neoliberalism is the substantial expansion of the credit system in Greece after it adopted the euro, while the social relations of production there remained unchanged since the fall of the junta. [Part III] A critique of Louis Althusser’s interpretation of the Marxist philosophy of science is carefully developed, pointing to the problem of circularity therein, yet arguing that Roy Bhaskar’s work in critical realism is particularly important for recuperating Althusser’s project. Finally, the volume continues the discussion of the relevance of the concept of a labor aristocracy by engaging the work of Zak Cope, a proponent of its importance that was published previously.
F59|Sovereign wealth funds – public investment vehicles, foreign policy element. Comparative evolution in the international context|Sovereign funds are an important actor occurring on international financial markets in the last decade, being, in fact, state controlled international investments. Generally, they are financed from foreign currency reserves of the emergent countries they are constituted in, being managed apart of the official reserves and used for external expansion; they are likely to be detrimental to certain strategic interests. As public financial vehicles, they own, endorse or manage public funds of some emergent countries, freely invested by them in a great number of assets, being seen as a foreign policy element.
F59|Human Rights Treaty Ratification Behavior: The ASEAN Way of Creating Standards|The signing of the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration in 2012 supposedly provides a long awaited triumph for human rights in the region and a measure by which regional human rights can finally prevail in parallel with the new ASEAN Human Rights Body. The importance of the new ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights lies in it being the first commission of its kind in Asia and a signal that human rights is finally being mainstreamed and accepted. However, as AICHR undertook its first work-plan and drafted the AHRD which fell below international standards, ASEAN's rhetoric/reality gap again came into plain view. It is my argument that there are two primary challenges to realizing universal regional human rights standards; ASEAN?s constitutive norms/identity and fragmentation of human rights understandings in national legal interpretations of international human rights instruments. To substantiate this I will analyze primary documentation and treaty ratification behavior of ASEAN states in an attempt to find out what are interests and preferences of ASEAN states in terms of human rights by analyzing treaties and reservations/declaration/statements which are attached to international human rights instruments that ASEAN states sign/accede to. Furthermore, I will demonstrate that treaty ratification behavior of ASEAN states is generally consistent with two hegemonic strains of regional thought: sovereignty fears and cultural resistance to human rights norms and standards.
F59|Economic Sovereignty|Abstract: In this paper we analyze one aspect of the standard thesis that the globalization process leads towards desovereignization. For the purposes of this paper we have adopted a narrow definition of globalization as a process of global expansion of capital, primarily financial. The classic design of sovereignty of a nation state is compromised due to the proliferation of capital, and states are becoming less able to resist the power of multinational corporations, both in terms of taking over resources and imposing political decisions. This fact raises the question of the subject of sovereignty: whether governments represent the interests of citizens (people) who, as the source of sovereignty, transfer the executive power to the government or governments must adjust to the interests of anonymous centres of economic power. If the latter is the case, then we obviously encounter a new kind of sovereignty: economic sovereignty.
F59|Evolution Of The Turkey Democracy In Term Of Gezi Park Actions|The generally accepted assertion that Turkey democracy has provided the period of progress and reach a point to overcome chronic problems during AK Party Government. So, this assertion has become a tautology. However, the way of struts of the claims of those who adopt this view, it is the main reason of the obstruction of the social sciences in Turkey. Because of the succession of any social formation depends on the ability to solve the crisis while by referring to Turkey?s past action of the AK Party Government, managing the way, validating the approach to issues, the assessment made in this regard is the beginning unfounded leave. In the other words; in the historical process isn?t to provide any progress while it will create an anomaly contrary to the nature of things, the assessment of the post-2002 period of Turkey by the referring single-party period which has impact on social and political environment, it comes to mean that this is an aim to become empty of allegations that democracy of Turkey has improved. Beginning from this point; the Gezi Park demonstrations which had great impact on Western Media rather than Turkey media, this is sustainable parameter for evaluating Turkey?s democracy. In spite of the maintained debate on initiation, development, participating in demonstration and actions of the demonstrators political stance on style, Gezi Park is finally faced crisis of AK Party Government. Therefore, the demonstrations and ways to solve problem of Turkish Government on mentioned crisis, whether it will provide an solution over problematic or not.
F59|Political Risk Investing in Emerging Markets versus Economic Reality|Investment risk? is always accompanied with ?return?, it is one of the most important aspects to evaluate when doing business by private firms or making new decision on overseas investments by governments. According to the report ?World Investment and political Risk? provided by the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, investors keep ranking political risk as a prime obstacle for investments into developing markets (Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, 2014). The term ?emerging markets? originally brought into fashion in the 1980?s by the World Bank economist Antoine van Agtmael. Emerging markets are the world?s fastest growing economies, contributing to a great deal of the world?s explosive growth of trade. By 2020, the five biggest emerging markets? share of world output will double to 16.1 percent from 7.8 percent in 1992 (Marr & Reynard, 2010). Since the year 2000 share of emerging economies in global GDP (in Purchasing Power Parity) has increased from 37 percent to 50 percent in 2013 (Boumphrey & Bevis, 2013). They are critical participants in the world?s major political, economic, and social affairs and are seeking a larger voice in international politics and a bigger slice of the global economic pie. Recently some events such as Arab Spring, a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and protests in Brazil against corn upt spending when organizing the World Football championship have increased political risk in those markets. As a result, the issues of political risk analyzed in this article are currently relevant. The aim of the article is to research political risk and its influence on business investments in emerging markets as well as the methods to evaluate such risk precisely as much as possible. This article begins with the introduction to theories relevant for the analysis of the topic. It also presents the political risk and its influences on operations in a emerging market. Then the case study is presented with food industry is chosen for analysis and with application to Russian-Lithuanian situation after Russia has put the sanctions on import of food products (vegetables, meat, fish, milk and dairy products) from the EU member states, Australia, the US, Canada and Norway for a year.
F59|Choosing international organizations: When do states and the World Bank collaborate on environmental projects?|While international cooperation research emphasizes institutional design, states mostly interact with existing organizations. How do states choose organizations for cooperation? We develop a theory of agency choice for development projects, emphasizing the importance of domestic institutions, the scope of cooperation, and the resources of the implementing agency. If states are to cooperate with funding agencies that have abundant resources, such as the World Bank, they must accept more stringent conditions on project implementation. We argue states accept the stringent conditions that resourceful organizations demand if the public goods from project implementation are highly valuable. Empirically, this is the case for democratic states, large projects, and projects that produce national instead of global public goods. We test this theory using data on 2,882 Global Environment Facility (GEF) projects, 1991–2011. The GEF offers an ideal case because various implementing agencies are responsible for the actual projects. States implement projects in collaboration with the World Bank, which has the most expertise and resources among the GEF’s implementing agencies, if their regime type is democracy, the project size is large, and the benefits are primarily national. Qualitative evidence sheds light on causal mechanisms. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
F59|A theory of emerging order within institutional complexes: How competition among regulatory international institutions leads to institutional adaptation and division of labor|The article examines the consequences of functional overlap among regulatory international institutions for governance within institutional complexes. Whereas the existing literature assumes that states tend to exploit forum-shopping opportunities to pursue their parochial interests, we show that multiple members of several overlapping institutions operate in a setting of ‘nested games’. They have a general interest in some form of institutional complementarity within the complex and therefore take the implications for overlapping institutions into account when determining their behavior within either of these institutions. On that basis, we show first that the multiple members are likely to induce complementary processes of institutional adaptation, even if their interests diverge with regard to the specific form of institutional rearrangement; second, that a balanced distribution of power among the advocates of different institutions may be expected to produce particularly sophisticated forms of institutional adaptation that do not simply separate the domains of overlapping institutions, but establish patterns of permanent co-governance; and third that state-induced processes of institutional adaptation gradually produce a spontaneously emerging division of labor among overlapping institutions that organizes their governance activities. These theoretical claims are probed by two case studies on institutional complexes that are characterized by sharp distributional conflicts among the multiple members: First, we demonstrate the emergence of a sophisticated division of labor in the institutional complex on international trade in agricultural GMOs. Second, we show that an equally sophisticated division of labor has emerged in the institutional complex on public health-related intellectual property rights.

F59|La politica di coesione dell'UE nel periodo 2014-2020, con particolare riferimento all'Italia|EU cohesion policy in the period 2014-2020, with particular reference to Italy In this paper a brief but global illustration of the EU policy for economic, social and territorial cohesion, which shall be accomplished during the next seven years (2014-2020), has been conducted. Particular reference has been made to Italy, European country featured by a centuries-old imbalance of dualistic type. The work presents both the main features that differentiate the current policy from that conducted up to the middle of the last decade, and the most relevant elements which configure how a proper policy aimed to promote socio-economic development and, therefore, the most suitable to counteract the current phase of structural and employment crisis, which affecting the economic and productive system in Italy, within a certainly nonpositive international context.
F59|Mark my Words: Information and the Fear of Declaring one’s Exchange Rate Regime|This paper investigates the role of a free press and the circulation of information on the capacity of a country to declare an exchange regime that differs from the regime it implements de facto. We report consistent evidence that greater press freedom and easier access to information result in a lower probability of untruthfully reporting the de facto regime. These findings withstand a large set of robustness checks, including controlling for democracy and for the institutional and political environment, controlling for endogeneity, and using various estimation methods. The results are particularly strong for developing countries.
F59|Russian sub-national actors: paradiplomacies in the Arctic region|The paper aims at examining Russian sub-state units' Arctic 'foreign policies'. The paper starts from discussing which theories are applicable to explaining the phenomenon of paradiplomacy. Particularly, the paper focuses on the following strategies/methods of paradiplomacy: making direct agreements with international partners; attracting foreign investment; creating regions' positive image; cooperation with international organizations; establishing representative offices in foreign countries; city-twinning; participation in Euroregions and other sub-regional arrangements; capitalizing on national diplomacy and federal infrastructures, etc. The institutional framework available for the sub-state actors in the Arctic region is examined. The implications of paradiplomacy for Russia's Arctic strategy are analyzed.
F59|The Political Economy of FDI Flows into Developing Countries: Does the Depth of International Trade Agreements Matter?|There is considerable debate whether the domestic political institutions (specifically, the country’s level of democracy) of the host developing country toward foreign investors are effective in establishing the credibility of commitments are still underway, researchers have also analyzed the effect of international institutions such as (GATT-WTO) membership and Bilateral Investment treaties (BIT) in their role of establishing the credibility of commitment to attract foreign investments. In addition, most recent studies have examined the effect of International Trade Agreements (TAs) on FDI flows as they contain separate investment chapters and dispute settlement mechanism, thus providing confidence to investor regarding the security of their investments. We argue that there are qualitative differences among various types of trade agreements and full-fledged trade agreements (FTA-CU) provide credibility to foreign investors and democracy level in the host country conditions this effect whereas the partial scope agreements (PSA) are not sufficient in providing credibility of commitments and not moderated by democracy. This paper analyses the impact of heterogeneous TAs, and their interaction with domestic institutions, on FDI inflows. Statistical analyses for 122 developing countries from 1970 to 2005 support this argument. The method adopted relies on fixed effects estimator which is robust to control endogeneity on a large panel dataset. The strict erogeneity of results by using a method suggested by Baier and Bergstrand (2007) and no feedback effect found in sample. The results state that (1) More the FTA-CU concluded, larger the amount of FDI inflows are attracted into the developing countries and PSA are insignificant in determining the FDI inflow; (2) FTA CU are complementary to democratic regime whereas the conditional effect of PSA with democracy on levels of FDI inflows is insignificant<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F59|The relationship between services trade and government procurement commitments: Insights from relevant WTO agreements and recent RTAs|"To date, government procurement has been effectively carved out of the main multilateral rules of the WTO system. This paper examines the systemic and other ramifications of this exclusion, from both an economic and a legal point of view. In addition to relevant elements of the WTO Agreements, particularly the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), it derives insights from a large number of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) that embody substantive provisions on both government procurement and services trade. An important finding is that, from an economic perspective, general market access commitments with respect to services trade and commitments regarding government procurement of services are complementary and mutually reinforcing. In contrast, from a legal point of view and at the multilateral level, disciplines in the two areas have been ""divided up"" into two Agreements with different (but complementary) spheres of application: the key provisions regarding the scope of application of the GATS and the GPA make clear that each serves purposes that the other does not. Analysis of corresponding provisions of RTAs broadly supports and extends this finding. In light of the foregoing, a question arises as to possible ways of deepening disciplines in this area. Part 5 sets out, for reflection, several related options: (i) the built-in mandate in the GATS for negotiations on services procurement (Article XIII:2); (ii) ""multilateralization"" of the GPA; (iii) the reactivation of work in the (currently inactive) WTO Working Group on Transparency in Government Procurement; and (iv) the taking up of relevant issues in the context of bilateral or regional negotiations. Overall, we find that each of these possibilities has potential merits, though none is without related challenges."
F59|Assessment of German-Pakistani relations in trade, investment and strategic cooperation|German-Pakistani relations cannot be analyzed in isolation of the larger domestic and international trajectories, economic and political, on both sides of the partnership. After a recent democratic power transfer in 2013, Pakistan continues to face complex challenges. The instable security situation in the region exerts pressure on the Pakistani state, multiplying domestic challenges like macroeconomic and trade instability, societal conflicts and crises in energy supply and infrastructure. In light of these aspects, this paper explores the magnitude and development of German-Pakistani relations, focusing especially on trade, economic cooperation and strategic interests on both sides. The analysis of the German-Pakistani trade and investment relations over the last decade show only very moderate volumes with room for expansion. These dynamics are mirrored in private trade business relations with German SME's active on the Pakistani market (mostly through agents) and a lack of internationalization and economic diversification among Pakistan's private businesses. A related structural reason for these predicaments is the lack of a dedicated and clearly-defined policy infrastructure among both states, resembling the long-standing and amicable, though unenthusiastic German-Pakistani relationship. The recent EU-Waiver assignment, the adoption of the EU's GSP+ and related trade diversification programs signify the most significant parts of the EU-Pakistani partnership, and mirror an integral part of the discourse in German-Pakistani relations. Pakistan should attempt to reap the benefits of these developments. Strategic relationships between Germany and Pakistan need to be developed further and strengthened. The content of a recent bilateral signing of a multifaceted roadmap for strategic dialogue among Germany and Pakistan has to be implemented effectively.
F59|Why Tk Incompatible With Ipr: Practical Implications And Illustrations| The global economy has gone through a great transformation in recent years .Worldwide integration of economy has provided new opportunities with many fresh challenges. In the post TRIPs and WTO era, various cases of patents and other IPR related issues show the new complexities for the countryside population which has sustained the cumulative body of knowledge, know-how, practices and representations known as TK for generations. Protecting the locality of products is imperative for any developing country. The fundamental concern of this paper is to underscore the incompatibilities between TK and IPRs in general (within some initiatives taken by India and Hungary) which has begun to surface with the rapid globalization and acceptance of concepts and standards for intellectual property. Paper traces steps taken for the protection of TK and argues for the wider protection of TK at WTO level.
F59|Poland and the euro: Between lock-in and unfinished transition|In the otherwise rich debate on the eastward expansion of the Eurozone, fragmented approaches prevail, leaving several conceptual avenues of this process underexplored. The case of Poland — initially a fervent enthusiast of the euro adoption and a somewhat assertive endorser today — offers in this context an opportunity to add to the debate and deepen our understanding of the logic behind eastward expansion of the Eurozone. In what follows, Poland’s prospective Eurozone entry is examined from the broader angle of the historically determined conceptual and policy-making context of systemic transition. To this end, a conceptual nexus between Eurozone expansion and transition is established and examined through the historical institutionalist perspective. It is argued that rather than being solely a function of Poland’s EU membership, both the decision to adopt the euro and the attainment of real and nominal convergence are predominantly a function of the, as yet unfinished, transition process. Interestingly, as this paper suggests, the inconsistency inherent in the execution of the Maastricht convergence criteria not only creates disincentives that effectively delay Poland’s Eurozone entry but also triggers reform-drift and backsliding, thus casting a shadow on the prospect of the completion of the Polish transition and its sustainability.
F59|Foreign Policy as Part of Strengthening the Polish Economy in the World: the Ethical Aspect|The technological, economic and political advances of the 20th and 21st centuries have established new conditions for the development of civilization. The world economy has simultaneously expanded (the number of states/organization participating in world trade or the volume of heterogeneous transactions) and shrunk (close interrelations between transactions, no matter their geographic origins). Economic policy has gained an indispensable role in the creation of order in international relations and foreign policy. The tendency to prioritize foreign policy aims towards economic policy aims has resulted in ‘reverse flow’, i.e. foreign policy has become a central part of national economic policy. The engagement of external action services and public budget in economic promotion and investments triggers (inter alia) the ethics dilemma. The mentioned ethical aspect is often omitted when discussing ‘the economic foreign policy’. For instance, the ethics dilemma can appear when development and humanitarian aid are taken into account or when it comes to assessing the results (and membership) of economic missions. In this context, the author analyses the Polish foreign policy example and attempts to answer two questions. First, are the economic activities performed by external action services effective? Second, are the mentioned activities in accordance with the social ethical code of conduct? The author focuses on three elements – development and humanitarian aid, the participation of Polish diplomats in economic promotion, and economic missions.
F59|Does land titling matter? The role of land property rights in the war on illicit crops in Colombia|This paper analyzes the role of formalization of land property rights in the war against illicit crops in Colombia. We argue that as a consequence of the increase of state presence and visibility during the period of 2000 and 2009, municipalities with a higher level of formalization of their land property rights saw a greater reduction in the area allocated to illicit crops. We hypothesize that this is due to the increased cost of growing illicit crops on formal land compared to informal, and due to the possibility of obtaining more benefits in the newly in- stalled institutional environment when land is formalized. We exploit the variation in the level of formalization of land property rights in a set of municipalities that had their first cadastral census collected in the period of 1994-2000; this selection procedure guarantees reliable data and an unbiased source of variation. Using fixed effects estimators, we found a significant negative relationship between the level of formalization of land property rights and the number of hectares allocated to coca crops per municipality. These results remain robust through a number of sensitivity analyses. Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence on the positive effects of formal land property rights, and effective policies in the war on drugs in Colombia.
F59|What If Marx And Veblen Met…|The aim of this study is to analyse both the differences and the similarities between Marx and Veblen regarding historical specificity, evolution, and alienation. Starting with their discussions on these subjects, this article builds on the analyses of capitalism. The goal of this study is not to collapse Marx and Veblen into one another but rather to understand capitalism by presenting the complementary relationship of the two economists’ analyses and to introduce an appropriate analytical framework for understanding capitalism. This study consists of three parts. The first part examines how Veblen regarded Marx’s analysis, and how Marx especially viewed Darwin’s theory of evolution. Marx’s approach to evolution and Veblen’s criticism of Marx on this topic will constitute the general framework of this part. The second part of the study evaluates the level of agreement or disagreement between Veblen and Marx on the idea of historicism from the perspective of dialectical materialism. The last part a alyses Marx and Veblen’s different ideas of the concept of alienation. The two economists’ views on the capitalist system will be determined based on these three concepts, introducing the similarities between them as well as the differences.

Pro tehdejší republikové vyvstal nesmírný problém, s nímž neměli žádné zkušenosti ani oni, ani jejich předchůdci – vybudovat od základů fungující národní stát. V době euforických očekávání, kterou měsíce krátce po získané nezávislosti představovaly, zjednodušené vnímání komplikovaných lokálních a mezinárodních souvislostí bylo běžnou záležitostí; v plné míře se tudíž promítalo i do definování zahraničněpolitických cílů.

Vzájomná prepojenosť týchto determinantov významným spôsobom limituje víziu jeho obnovy a rekonštrukcie. Článok prináša pozitívne námety na to, ako sa vymaniť zo začarovaného kruhu zaostalosti a chudoby krajiny. Súčasne poukazuje na zložitosť a časovú náročnosť tohto procesu. Jedným z určujúcich elementov, ktorý bude Afgancom brániť v konsolidačnom procese, je drogový priemysel. Krajina je, v prenesenom slova zmysle, závislá od pestovania a spracovania ópia a ani medzinárodné spoločenstvo sa nevie zjednotiť na spôsobe, ako tento problém riešiť. (The development path of Afghanistan after 2014 will depend on militarypolitical and economic situation in the country. Mutual correlation of these factors significantly limits the vision for its reconstruction and development. The paper presents some positive ideas on possible ways of how to get out of the circle of backwardness and poverty. At the same time it points out the complexity and time constraints of this process. One of the crucial elements that limits Afghans in consolidation process is the drug industry. The country’s economy depends on growing and processing of opium and the international community cannot agree upon a common way to solve this problem.)
F59|Latin America's socail imagination since 1950. From one type of 'absolute certainties' to another - with no (far more creative)'uncomfortable uncertainties' in sight|"Latin America is a region whose critical social imagination has stalled, changing from a uniquely prolific period during the 1950s and 1960s - revolving around structuralism, 'dependency', Baran and Sweezy-type analysis of 'monopoly capitalism', French structuralism, the German Historical School, Keynesian and Post-Keynesian macroeconomics, and the ideas of endogenous intellectuals (such as Mariátegui) - to an intellectually barren one since the 1982 debt-crisis and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Although this has happened in most of the world, the downswing of the cycle of critical thinking and the process of re-legitimisation of capital have been more pronounced in Latin America, as neo-liberalism has conquered the region, including most of its progressive intelligentsia, just as completely (and just as fiercely) as the Holy Inquisition conquered Spain - transforming critical thinkers into an endangered species. A key problem of the pre-1980 critical social imagination had been its unremitting critique of the economy; consequently, once the 'new left' conceded the economy as the fundamental hub of the struggle, there seemed to have been little else left in terms of basic ideological principles to hold onto in a thoughtful way. It was as if 'progressive' thinking had lost not just some but all its relevance - making it very difficult to move forward ideologically in a creative way. As a result, in terms of development strategies and economic policies both the 'old' and the 'new' left are still mostly stuck in the past: while the former (as in Venezuela) tries to recreate somewhat mechanically what it perceives to be 'the best of the past', the latter (except for their policies on social expenditure) attempts to create a future which is fundamentally the exact opposite of that past (e.g., the 'new-left' in Brazil and Chile) - and in order to do so, it seems to have only one guiding economic policy principle: to transform practically everything that before was considered ""virtue"" into a ""vice"", and ""vice"" into a ""virtue"". Not surprisingly, neither approach has been very successful; in the case of the latter, their remarkably narrow 'reverse-gear' attitude has delivered not only a disappointing economic performance (especially in terms of productivity-growth), but also a political settlement characterised by a rather odd mixture of an insatiable oligarchy, a captured 'progressive' political élite (the dominant classes are quite happy to let them govern as long as they don't forget who they are), 'sterilised' governments, passive citizens, and a stalled social imagination - all made more palatable for the poor by an agenda of safety-nets. From time to time, this dull mélange is sparked off by outbursts of students' discontent. Meanwhile, the world (with its new technological and institutional paradigms) moves on, and Asia forges ahead."
F59|Reconciling Observed Tariffs and the Median Voter Model|Median voter theory applied to trade policy predicts positive tariffs in capital-abundant countries and negative tariffs in labor-abundant countries. Negative tariffs are rare, and this paper reconciles the median voter theory with observed protectionism across countries. By considering large countries, I show the optimal tariff is a sum of the median voter component and a positive in terms of trade component. Positive terms of trade effects raise tariffs in all countries, and can overcome the negative median voter component in labor-abundant countries. Testing the tariff prediction with cross-section and panel data from the 1990s, I show the median voter component is negative in labor-abundant countries and positive in capital-abundant countries. As expected, terms of trade effects raise tariffs across all countries and are stronger among non-members of the WTO.
F59|Who Runs the International System? Power and the Staffing of the United Nations Secretariat - Working Paper 376|National governments frequently pull strings to get their citizens appointed to senior positions in international institutions. We examine, over a 60 year period, the nationalities of the most senior positions in the United Nations Secretariat, ostensibly the world's most representative international institution. The results indicate which nations are successful in this zero-sum game, and what national characteristics correlate with power in international institutions. The most overrepresented countries are small, rich democracies like the Nordic countries. Statistically, democracy, investment in diplomacy, and economic/military power are predictors of senior positions--even after controlling for the U.N. staffing mandate of competence and integrity. National control over the United Nations is remarkably sticky; however the in influence of the United States has diminished as US ideology has shifted away from its early allies. In spite of the decline in US influence, the Secretariat remains pro-American relative to the world at large.
F59|Trade liberalization, democratization, and technology adoption|Abstract A general equilibrium theory with heterogeneous skills predicts a complementarity between trade and democracy in creating demand for superior technologies. Trade liberalization or democratization alone may lead to vested interests that limit technology adoption. We use panel data on technology adoption, at a disaggregated level, for the period 1980–2000. Exploiting within-country variation over time and the heterogeneous timing of trade liberalization and democratization, we document a significant and sizable positive interaction between trade openness and democratization for technology adoption. The result that transitions to open democracies are beneficial for technological dynamics is robust to a large set of checks.
F59|The Us-Eu Relation. Competition Or Cooperation|The United States and the European Union are considered, by the analysts, to be the most strategic partners in the international system nowadays. Because of their common interests, these two world powers are in constant competition and cooperation. For this reason, this paper emphasizes the most important aspects of the US-EU competition and cooperation policy in a multipolar world. The study includes also the analyze of domestic and international sources of the US-EU cooperation. In order to find out and to explain the sources of the US-EU cooperation, it is necessary to focus on exploring the causes of the international cooperation. Another direction of the analysis is to explain the importance of cooperation in transatlantic competition policy by investigating the negotiations of the transatlantic partnership between the United States and the European Union.
F59|More than Words and Good Intentions: The Political Agenda-Setting Power Behind Foreign Aid Mechanisms|In this paper, international aid is examined as a tool for political agenda-setting. A theoretical model is constructed for the analysis, incorporating the incentives created by foreign aid, on the political benefits of recipient governments. The model also incorporates the compensating benefits provided by these governments through the legitimization of the donor country's political agenda. The main results of this model indicate that governments which offer international assistance can influence the political agenda of recipient countries through two channels: 1) By reducing the political costs of official intervention in issues that receive aid, and 2) By generating incentives for additional political rent-seeking. The results are studied in the case of aid provided by the USA to Colombia during the period 1998-2012, which shows the power of US presidents to establish part of the Colombian political agenda related to drugs and terrorism. The results are obtained through a novel content analysis of presidential speeches in both countries and from a set of estimates corrected by possible problems of endogeneity in foreign aid allocation.

De hecho, la participación de los mercados del SEA en el comercio externo del país ha atravesado un pronunciado incremento desde 2003 hasta la actualidad. En este trabajo nos interesa explorar el devenir de las relaciones Argentina-Indonesia desde mediados de 2000 en adelante, analizando la profundización de los intercambios comerciales, los ajustes en las estrategias de acercamiento bilateral y los posibles escenarios bilaterales futuros dentro del marco de las vinculaciones Sur-Sur. El artículo se divide en tres secciones principales, en las cuales se abordan las vinculaciones bilaterales a partir de las dimensiones económico-comercial, político-diplomática y cultural. Argentina, Indonesia: strengthening trade relations and political awakening of interest in the context of South-South strategy Southeast Asia has started to hold a more relevant place in South America’s foreign agendas, and Argentina is no exception in this trend. In fact, SEA markets participation in the country’s external trade has increased since 2003. In this paper we aim to explore the development of Argentina-Indonesia relations since 2000 onward, analyzing the deepening of trade exchanges, the adjustments in the bilateral strategies and possible future scenarios from a South-South perspective. The article is divided in three main parts: economic-commercial relations, political-diplomatic ties and cultural links.
F59|German-Chinese Economic Relations: Opportunities and Risks for Germany|During the last few years, the People's Republic of China has become an increasingly important trading partner for Germany. Particularly in the wake of the global economic and financial crisis that began in 2008, trade with China has been an important driver of economic growth in Germany as German industry benefited from the increase in Chinese import demand more than other European countries. However, Chinese economic growth has slowed somewhat since then. After recording double-digit growth rates in the past, the new Chinese government is now attempting to stabilize annual economic growth at 7.5 percent. It is therefore likely that future German export growth rates to China will be lower than in recent years. Further, according to the government's new plans, Chinese economic growth should rely less on export and investment, as has been the case to date, and more on domestic performance and private consumption in the future. It is anticipated that this shift will also have a negative impact on German export industry, which is dominated by capital goods. Additionally, Chinese demand for imports is likely to decline as China's domestic production of cars and machinery expands.
F59|Mark my words: Information and the fear of declaring an exchange rate regime|This paper investigates the role of a free press and the circulation of information on the capacity of a country to declare an exchange regime that differs from the regime it implements de facto. We report consistent evidence that greater press freedom and easier access to information result in a lower probability of untruthfully reporting the de facto regime. These findings withstand a large set of robustness checks, including controlling for democracy and for the institutional and political environment, controlling for endogeneity, and using various estimation methods. The results are particularly strong for developing countries.
F59|Resource-based FDI and expropriation in developing economies|Globally, foreign direct investment (FDI) assets are expropriated more in resource extraction industries compared to other sectors. Despite the higher apparent risk of expropriation in resources, countries more likely to expropriate also have a larger share of FDI in the resource sector. An incomplete markets model of FDI is developed to account for this puzzle. The type of government regime is stochastic, with low penalty regimes facing a relatively low, exogenous cost of expropriating FDI, and country risk is measured by the variation in these costs across different regimes. The key innovation of the model is that the government, before the regime type is known, is able to charge different prices to domestic and foreign investors for mineral rights. Granting cheap access increases FDI and reduces the country's share of resource rents, increasing the temptation to expropriate in a relatively low penalty regime. In very high-risk countries, subsidizing resource FDI increases the total value of output by raising investment, and the net gains from expropriating in a low penalty regime outweigh the rents foregone under a high penalty one. However, a stochastic resource output price results in relatively low-risk countries restricting FDI inflows to the resource sector instead — “windfall profits” in this sector raise incentives to expropriate when prices are high, yet minimization of the ex ante risk of expropriation is preferred owing to the relatively high penalty for expropriating. These results imply a higher average share of resource-based FDI in countries most likely to expropriate, while resources account for a high share of expropriated assets compared to the sector's global share of FDI. We show that the model is able to reconcile observed patterns of foreign investment and expropriation for a sample of 38 developing and emerging economies.
F59|Donor ideology and types of foreign aid|We examine how donor government ideology influences the composition of foreign aid flows. We use data for 23 OECD countries over the period 1960–2009 and distinguish between multilateral and bilateral aid, grants and loans, recipient characteristics such as income and political institutions, tied and untied aid, and aid by sector. The results show that leftist governments increased the growth of bilateral grant aid, and more specifically grant aid to least developed and lower middle-income countries. Our findings confirm partisan politics hypotheses because grants are closely analogous to domestic social welfare transfer payments, and poverty and inequality are of greatest concern for less developed recipient countries.
F59|The global arms trade network 1950–2007|Using SIPRI data on all international transfers of major conventional weapons 1950–2007, we study the relationship between differences in polity and arms trade. To study whether states tend to trade arms within their political vicinity we estimate gravity models of the likelihood of trade at the bilateral level and study the evolution of the global network over time. We find a stable negative relationship between differences in polity and the likelihood of arms trade for the duration of the Cold War, but not in recent years. In line with these results, the global arms trade network changes drastically over the sample period in several respects: it grows more dense, clustered and decentralized over time. The differences between the NATO and Warsaw Pact sub-networks that we find corroborate the common perception that the Warsaw Pact was more strongly centralized around the USSR than NATO around the UK, the US and France.
F59|How close a relationship does a capital market have with other markets? A reexamination based on the equal variance test|The cointegration test cannot discriminate closer relationships from cointegrating relationships. In most applications, we must assess the degrees of cointegrating relationships, for example, to examine the comovement between international stock markets using the cointegration methodology. Lee et al. (2012) introduced a variance test of cointegration equilibrium errors to measure the similarity of these relationships. However, the key assumption of cross-sectional independence between a panel of two country-pair squared cointegrating equilibrium errors in their model is not desirable. The appearance of cross-sectional dependence of individual (stock) markets in a panel is a common existence. The current paper shows that the consideration of cross-sectional dependence and the method of estimating long-run variance are important. Our results, which extend the cross-sectional dependence of some Asian stock markets during the Asian financial crisis (1997–1998) documented by Lee et al. (2012), indicate that the similarity of background and business cooperation (or trading activities) are all crucial factors for determining the price patterns by the “equal variance test” proposed in this paper. The analysis of the 2007–2009 global financial crisis is included to confirm the robustness of the results.
F59|Professionalizing the role of Shari'ah auditors: How Malaysia can generate economic benefits|The paper presents arguments on the need for inventing the profession of Shari'ah auditing and why Malaysia should take the lead to create an Association of Chartered Shari'ah Accountants and Auditors (ACSAA) that can result in long run economic benefits for the country. The paper also critically analyzes how accounting and auditing membership is being exported worldwide by few dominant players to generate economic benefits for their respective origin countries and how existing Islamic accounting and auditing qualification suppliers have failed to deliver and create holistic Shari'ah accountants/auditors required to serve in an ideal Islamic economy. The paper proposes 2 models through which ACSAA can be made a practical reality.
F59|Reconciling observed tariffs and the median voter model|Median voter theory applied to trade policy predicts positive tariffs in capital-abundant countries and negative tariffs in labor-abundant countries. Negative tariffs are rare, and this paper reconciles the median voter theory with observed protectionism across countries. By considering large countries, I show the optimal tariff is a sum of the median voter component and a positive in terms of trade component. Positive terms of trade effects raise tariffs in all countries, and can overcome the negative median voter component in labor-abundant countries. Testing the tariff prediction with cross-section and panel data from the 1990s, I show the median voter component is negative in labor-abundant countries and positive in capital-abundant countries. As expected, terms of trade effects raise tariffs across all countries and are stronger among non-members of the WTO.
F59|Does Land Titling Matter ?The Role of Land Property Rights in the War on Illicit Crops in Colombia|This paper analyzes the role of formalization of land property rights in the war against illicit crops in Colombia. We argue that as a consequence of the increase of state presence and visibility during the period of 2000 and 2009, municipalities with a higher level of formalization of their land property rights saw a greater reduction in the area allocated to illicit crops. We hypothesize that this is due to the increased cost of growing illicit crops on formal land compared to informal, and due to the possibility of obtaining more benefits in the newly in- stalled institutional environment when land is formalized. We exploit the variation in the level of formalization of land property rights in a set of municipalities that had their first cadastral census collected in the period of 1994-2000; this selection procedure guarantees reliable data and an unbiased source of variation. Using fixed effects estimators, we found a significant negative relationship between the level of formalization of land property rights and the number of hectares allocated to coca crops per municipality. These results remain robust through a number of sensitivity analyses. Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence on the positive effects of formal land property rights, and effective policies in the war on drugs in Colombia.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F59|The Psychological And Symbolic Factor Of Great Britain'S Geostrategy In The Cyprus-Suez Issue|In the present paper I argue that, since Cyprus came under the British rule and for at least seven decades, Britain did not consider Cyprus a “territory of major strategic importance for the Crown”. I also argue that the policy makers of colonial Britain probably considered this island one of the “poor colonies”, since it did not have raw material deposits or any kind of industrial infrastructure. Thus, I suggest that Greek researchers should examine how Great Britain was perceiving the strategic importance of Cyprus until the end of World War II and, therefore, should not insist on blaming the Greek side that, supposedly, did not take into account Britain’s sensitivity and “unwisely sought the Union (Enosis) of Cyprus with Greece, which annoyed Britain and led to the well-known traumatic events”.
F59|Oilseed Meals|The article presents the evolution of the world oilseed meals market during 2013/2014 and projections for the following season. It contains an indepth analysis of the production, consumption, trade and stocks, by the main types of oilseed meals, at the world level and by the main countries. The international prices on the oilseed meals market have a differentiate evolution, with an upward trend in case of soybean meals - by far the major type of oilseed meals, reflecting the movement of the supply/demand balance.
F59|Price Movements in Commodity Markets in 2013 and Prospects for 2014|The article analyses the main developments of the world commodity markets in 2013, a difficult year for the world economy, and short-term prospects. The slowing economic growth, both at the world level and particularly in emerging China, the main global commodity consumer, had a great impact over prices, pushing them to lower levels, away from the upward trend ending in 2011. The most affected were metals, with prices declining sharply, as a result of increasing offer (due to the sustained investment policies during the past price boom) and declining demand (pushed downwards by the slowing economic growth), trend supposed to go on. The oil and agricultural raw materials prices remained at relatively high levels, but prospects were for a declining trend, based upon the markets oversupply.
F59|Trends in Global and Regional Integration by means of Trade|"In the present paper we aim to emphasize several aspects of the economic integration realized through the channel of trade, from a double perspective. The first point of view is given by the formal framework, de jure, composed by the multitude of preferential trade agreements, while the second one, de facto, market-driven, is concretized by the global production networks. The first stance is exemplified through the agreements negotiated or concluded by the traditional trade powers, EU, US and Japan. Although, economically, EU is more present in Asia-Pacific than the US, the latter are politically more active and seem to gain ground. The second stance is underlined by means of the Asian integration specificity. East and South-East Asia represents the core of ""Factory Asia"" and is governed by the activity of the transnational corporations, their investment and cross-border networks, which makes the production process more fragmented and the regional economies more mutually dependent."
F59|The dual political effect of foreign direct investment in developing countries|This study revisits the political effect of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on the level of democracy in developing countries. The author finds that FDI has dual political effects based on the panel corrected standard error (PCSE) analysis using panel data covering 124 developing countries from 1970 to 2005. Although the political effect of aggregate FDI is negative, FDI from developed democracies exerts a significant positive effect on democracy. FDI in the primary sector plays a negative role in the political development in developing countries. The author also finds a regional difference in the political effect of FDI due to uneven distribution of disaggregated FDI.
F59|The impact of Mena conflicts (the Arab spring) on global financial markets|It is believed that financial markets are integrated and sensitive to news – including political conflicts in some regions of the world. Furthermore, financial markets seem to react differently to information flows from one region to another. The purpose of this research is to discern the effects of the recent Middle East and North Africa (MENA) conflicts – commonly referred to as the Arab Spring – on the volatility of risks and returns of global and regional stock markets as well as Gold and Oil markets. To be more specific, we consider the main uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen and their impact on financial markets – as measured by the volatility of their risks and returns. In sum, we cluster 53 stock markets into 6 regions; namely, developed, developing, MENA, Asia, Europe, and Latin America countries, and use T-GARCH to assess the reaction of these regions to each uprising event independently. In addition, we use GARCH-M to assess the reaction of these regions stock markets as well as Gold and Oil markets to the uprisings of MENA as a whole. Our empirical findings suggest that the uprising events of MENA have more impact on the volatility of risks and returns of developed, developing, and Europe regions than MENA itself. In addition, although the results show that the volatility of both risks and returns of both developed and MENA regions are significantly affected by general conflicts in MENA, the volatility of MENA is affected during all intervals and with higher significance level. Furthermore, while MENA uprisings as a whole impact on the volatility of risk of oil (after 5 days) and gold (immediately after entering news) significantly, the returns of these markets are not affected by conflicts.
F59|The Eastern Partnership Of The Eu – The Challenges And The Opportunities In The Context Of The Ukraine’S Crisis|The aim of this paper is to highlight the political limits and the strategic and geopolitica ldilemmas of the European Union’s approach concerning the Eastern Neighbourhood. For this reason, the research will examine the main steps of the implementation of the Eastern Partnership and the main consequences and dilemmas of this implementation for the Eastern European Partners, especially for Ukraine. Also, the paper will investigate the impact of the Eastern Partnership for the Russian approach concerning the near western abroad and the European Union.
F59|Why do oil importers diversify their import sources politically? : evidence from U.S. firm-level data|"International politics affects oil trade. But why? We construct a firm-level dataset for all U.S. oil-importing companies over 1986-2008 to examine what kinds of firms are more responsive to change in ""political distance"" between the U.S. and her trading partners, measured by divergence in their UN General Assembly voting patterns. Consistent with previous macro evidence, we first show that individual firms diversify their oil imports politically, even after controlling for unobserved firm heterogeneity. We conjecture that the political pattern of oil imports from these individual firms is driven by hold-up risks, because oil trade is often associated with backward vertical FDI. To test this hold-up risk hypothesis, we investigate heterogeneity in responses by matching transaction-level import data with firm-level worldwide reserves. Our results show that long-run oil import decisions are indeed more elastic for firms with oil reserves overseas than those without, although the reverse is true in the short run. We interpret this empirical regularity as that while firms trade in the spot market can adjust their imports immediately, vertically-integrated firms with investment overseas tend to commit to term contracts in the short run even though they are more responsive to changes in international politics in the long run."
F59|The effects of international politics on oil-exporting developing countries|"International politics affects oil trade. But does it affect the oil-exporting developing countries more? We construct a firm-level dataset for all U.S. oil-importing companies over 1986-2008 to examine how these firms respond to changes in ""political distance"" between the U.S. and her trading partners, measured by divergence in their UN General Assembly voting patterns. Consistent with previous macro evidence, we first show that individual firms diversify their oil imports politically, even after controlling for unobserved firm heterogeneity. We conjecture that the political pattern of oil imports from these individual firms is driven by hold-up risks, because oil trade is often associated with backward vertical FDI. To the extent that developing countries have higher hold-up risks because of their weaker institutions, the political effect on oil trade should be more significant in the developing world. We find that oil import decisions are indeed more elastic when firms import from developing countries, although the reverse is true in the short run. Our results suggest that international politics can affect oil revenue and hence long-term development in the developing world."
F59|Efforts of Controlling Money Laundering of Narcotics Money in Saudi Arabia|Money laundering is a silent crime. Its goal is to cover up the source of large sums of money that criminals often gather from their criminal activities. This paper will analyze the situation of money laundering in narcotics as it applies in Saudi Arabia. To achieve this end, the paper will first define important terms such as money laundering and narcotics. It will then explain the relationship between money laundering, narcotics trade, and terrorism activities. This background information will form the base for analyzing the various efforts that the Saudi Arabia nation has in place for countering money laundering in narcotics trade. The paper will then explain the challenges facing these efforts, and the future of money laundering in Saudi Arabia. The largest criminal activity associated with money laundering is terrorism financing. The several terror attacks associated with Saudi Arabia’s terror groups like Al-Qaida have made the government realize the importance of curbing money laundering in an effort to counter terrorism. Thus, anti-money laundering strategies are set in place to address all the avenues of money laundering.
F59|Euroscepticism Across Europe: Drivers and Challenges|This paper addresses the issue of euroscepticism expansion across Europe. This phenomenon has steadily grown into one of the biggest challenges to the European construction, and has consequentially become a major concern to politicians, as well as regular citizens. This analysis uses data from Eurobarometer surveys regarding the decline of public trust in the European institutions. The findings suggest that some of the main drivers of eurosceptics stands include: disagreement with EU policies, economic challenges associated with the enlargement process, as well as the extent of national sovereignty within the EU. Thus, while European leaders develop policies to improve economic crisis, ordinary citizens are beginning to question the legitimacy of the EU, feeling they have been forced to accept things they did not want. This paper argues that the beliefs of the EU member states’ citizens confirm the fears of political actors. It seems extensive bureaucracy, and political failures seem to diminish the trust of the European citizens in the positive effects of further integration, and might support the opposite—disintegration.

F59|A Global Perspective on Effectiveness of Aid for Trade|Recent global initiatives on debt relief and development assistance call for increasing aid for trade to the poorest countries. We apply a multi-country computable general equilibrium model to measure the effectiveness of alternative aid for trade categories. Our findings show that aid for trade policies expand trade and alleviate international income inequalities in the recipient countries, that will benefit mainly from aid for trade adjustment and technical assistance.

F59|Current Developments in the Global Economy|Global economic situation crosses period in which forecasted indicators regarding economic growth have not been touched. This trend is increasingly observed in the other economies or groups around the world. The perspective from which we can now focus on the important aspects of global economy compels us, because of the economic, financial, political, social and ecological climate worldwide to synthesize relevant issues through the main economic actors. It's about how their economies help restore growth model capable of sustaining a general acceptable level situation that followed the economic and financial crisis which they faced. This phenomenon is called economic recovery and is a normal process in terms of theory, but does not always follow the same pattern, so that the effects generated are different. It's easy to understand that the economic crisis has not had the same effect for everyone, hence the differences between each economic approach whether to shelter or adapt to new changes.
F59|La Organización Mundial de Comercio, los acuerdos mega-regionales y los usos estratégicos del regionalismo/The World Trade Organization, Mega-Regional Trade Agreements and the Strategic Uses of Regionalism|La parálisis de la Ronda Doha, el desarrollo de grandes negociaciones ?mega-regionales? y la proliferación de acuerdos preferenciales han avivado los debates sobre la gobernanza del comercio internacional. Mientras que una interpretación benévola sobre estos acuerdos parece estar ganando lugar, en este artículo sostenemos que los atributos del ?regionalismo del siglo XXI? son menos novedosos que lo que se insinúa; y que existe una notable continuidad en los incentivos y las características del ?nuevo regionalismo? de los noventa y el llamado ?regionalismo del siglo XXI?. Afirmamos que aun cuando los componentes discriminatorios de estos regionalismos hayan sido atenuados por el contenido y naturaleza de la agenda regulatoria, el conflicto básico entre las dos modalidades de gobernanza del régimen de comercio internacional sigue vigente. The paralysis of the Doha Round, the proliferation of preferential trade agreement and the launching of mega-regional trade negotiations have encouraged the debate about the governance of international trade. In contrast to a benign interpretation of the relationship between ?XXI century regionalism? and the multilateral trade regime, we argue that there is a remarkable continuity between the incentives and characteristics of the ?new regionalism? and those of ?XXI century regionalism?. Even when the content of the regulatory agenda may have reduced the discrimi¬natory nature of the new agreements, the basic conflict between the two modalities of governance of the international trade regime remains in place.
F59|Greasing the wheels of entrepreneurship? A complement according to entrepreneurial motives|We consider the effects that corruption and regulation may have on entrepreneurship according to the underlying motivation compelling an individual to open a business. By doing this, we document the idea, widely studied within the context of economic growth, that corruption may be beneficial or detrimental according to its interrelationships with regulation. More specifically, we complement the findings by Dreher and Gassebner (2013) supporting the assumption that corruption “greases the wheels” (vs “sands the wheel”) of strict regulation for early-stage firms. We provide evidence that opportunity-driven entrepreneurs are much more affected by corruption and regulation than necessity-driven ones.
F59|Prospects for Russian Investments in Ukraine|The current half-year old systemic crisis in Ukraine has had a deep negative effect on almost all aspects of Russian-Ukrainian relations. Investment ties, which developed greatly during the previous decade, were no exception. In this article we try to assess the scale and identify the key trends of corporate integration between the two states before the crisis, find out the impact of the crisis on FDI dynamics, estimate the probability of nationalization of enterprises with Russian capital, and consider possible strategies of Russian companies, taking into account existing and hypothetical economic and political risks in Ukraine.
F59|M. I. Tugan-Baranovsky’s Ethical Economics and the Challenges of Global Development|"(To the 150th Birth Anniversary) In this paper, the ethical principles of M. I. Tugan-Baranovsky’s economic views and his civic activity are considered within the framework of ""moral landmarks"" of development. The aim of the paper is to appraise the possible application of this ethical approach in the theory and practice of modern world development. The author concludes that in the period of global economic crisis and institutional transformations this ethical method may be used for designing peaceful ways of solving conflicts based on ethical appreciation of human personality as the highest value."
F59|The Emerging World Order|It is common ground amongst almost all commentators that the world has changed radically over the past 25 years – the 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall heralded the ending of the Cold War, the reunification of a tragically divided Europe, and the acceleration of the process of globalisation which has its only comparable period in the decades leading up to the First World War in 1914. When analyzing the Emerging World Order it is important to cover more than Brazil economy or any other individual BRICs or other Emerging Powers. Instead, our analysis will provide a global view about the economic and political global power structures which are evolving and forming before our eyes, and then to talk about the challenges these emerging realities pose for us in Europe, and in the West in general.
F59|A New Managerial Tool For Scenarios In Scheduling|The purpose of this paper is to introduce a newly developed managerial tool, Quality Scheduling Index (QSI), which can be used at the improvement of quality and time consumption within not only manufacturing companies. The authors present this tool as a result of the actual market conditions of finding a way for managing and controlling the usage of time, quality of work and the costs associated with these two factors. The paper is focused on the area of Management of Production and Operations with the main goal of developing the area of scheduling research and main purpose of increasing the productivity of a manufacturing enterprise by using at maximum the available resources, without any additional costs or investments. A survey is realized regarding the market requirements and partial empirical results of the authors’ researches are presented, with conclusions being drawn for future studies. A scenario mainframe is also developed and a relation between QSI and scenarios is presented. The paper represents partial results of the grant projects GAČR P403/12/1950 and SGS13/191/OHK2/3T/12.
F59|Information and Communication Technologies Role in Risk Analysis and Risk Management|Although the category of “risk” is among the key words of our time, the theory in this sphere seems to lag behind, using outdated concepts of risk and risk management methods and instruments. The specifics of contemporary (to a large extent global) risks require that different aspects of globalization be included in the thinking about risk. Therefore, information and communication technologies (ICTs) are of special importance, as their interconnection with globalization is undeniable. Whereas ICTs can undoubtedly be viewed as a new risk factor, it is logical to rethink whether and to what extent they can be used as instruments for addressing new risks. This is why this paper examines the place of ICTs in the conceptual frameworks for risk analysis and management through several lenses. First, the role of ICTs on the separate stages of the risk analysis and management models was reviewed, where a special attention has been paid to the phase of risk communication. This was done on the basis of the frames set by the International Risk Governance Council model and the DPSIR model. Then, the discussion on the ICTs role was deepened by addressing the question of political control. In conclusion, directions for future research were outlined
