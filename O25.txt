O25|Do enterprise zones promote local business development? Evidence from Vietnam|We examined the effects of Vietnamese enterprise zones on local businesses based on different patterns of place-based policies as well as the ownership structure of the zone infrastructure developers (ZIDs). We constructed a panel of communes during 2000-2007 using a census survey of firms having more than nine employees and a census of zones and zone-based firms. We found that place-based policies led to growth in the number of jobs and firms in the communes where enterprise zones were located, even after excluding zone-based firms. Our findings also suggest that privately owned ZIDs worked best under corporate-tax incentives, while zones with a designated central government agency as the ZID had adverse spillover effects on business development in neighboring communes of the same district.
O25|Designing an Industrial Policy for Developing Countries: a New Approach|"In this study, the prevalent methodology for design of the industrial policy in developing countries was critically assessed, and it was shown that the mechanism and content of classical method is fundamentally contradictory to the goals and components of the endogenous growth theories. This study, by proposing a new approach, along settling Schumpeter's economic growth theory as a policy framework, designed the process of entering, analyzing and processing data as the mechanism of the industrial policy in order to provide ""theoretical consistency"" and ""technical and Statistical requirements"" for targeting the growth stimulant factor effectively."
O25|How to Set Budget Caps for Competitive Grants|We study how funding agencies should set budget caps for competitive grants. We show that budget caps influence the researchers' submission strategy and, in particular, whether they steer their project choice towards the agencies' favorite projects, and the level of funds they request. The welfare impact of alternative approaches depends on the level of competition, the cost of public funds and the social value of project implementation.
O25|The Unfinished Business of State-owned Enterprise Reform in the People’s Republic of China|This paper examines the progress of state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform in the People’s Republic of China. After defining SOEs and considering their scope of operation within the PRC economy, the focus of the paper is on the major reform waves that followed the deterioration of SOE profitability in the early 1990s. The oil industry serves to illustrate industry-specific SOE reform trends as well as the latest reform developments. Until today, a stable, successful, long-term arrangement of state ownership has remained elusive. SOE reform is incomplete as long as a number of fundamental governance issues are not resolved. But these are difficult to resolve in the context of Party-controlled state-owned enterprises.
O25|Política industrial moderna: fundamentos e importancia para el crecimiento económico y la igualdad|Este capítulo presenta las virtudes, requerimientos, vigencia y potencialidades de una política de desarrollo industrial para Colombia. Inicialmente se señalan los pasos necesarios para implementar una política de desarrollo industrial exitosa. Expone este trabajo, además, los enfoques teóricos que sustentan un modelo heterodoxo de política industrial. Entre ellos se destacan las propuestas de Young-Currie-Kaldor, que muestran el vínculo de esta política con el crecimiento acelerado e inclusivo en términos de generación de empleo y mejoras en la distribución del ingreso. A lo largo del documento se presentan las evidencias empíricas de países que muestran las mencionadas potencialidades de la política industrial. El artículo explica cómo Colombia puede responder al objetivo de una paz estable y duradera a partir de una estrategia de crecimiento económico inclusivo que busque el pleno empleo como objetivo fundamental y que, sustentada en una mayor diversificación, complejidad y sofisticación de su estructura productiva, permita avanzar hacia la construcción de una sociedad más igualitaria. *** This chapter presents the virtues, requirements, validity and potential of an industrial policy for Colombia. The article shows how to implement a successful industrial policy and exposes the theoretical approaches behind a heterodox model of industrial policy. Among them is possible to point out the proposals of Young-Currie-Kaldor that show the link between industrial policy, accelerated economic growth, employment and income distribution. The document presents evidence of countries that have exhibited the potential of industrial policy. It also explains how to achieve the objectives of peacebuilding and social justice in Colombia based on an inclusive and full employment model of economic growth. To achieve those goals, a model of economic development based on a greater diversification, complexity and sophistication of the economic structure is necessary.
O25|Obstáculos a la Innovación, Innovación y Productividad en Paraguay|En este trabajo analizamos la relación que existe entre diferentes tipos de obstáculos percibidos por las empresas (costos, conocimientos, mercados, institucionales) y la inversión en actividades de innovación, la innovación y la productividad de las empresas paraguayas. Los obstáculos financieros aparecen como la principal barrera a la inversión en actividades de innovación, a la innovación y al crecimiento de la productividad en Paraguay; los demás obstáculos se asocian con estas variables de forma más heterogénea. En este trabajo también exploramos heterogeneidades de estas relaciones de acuerdo a los tipos de innovaciones (tecnológicas vs. no tecnológicas) y tipos de empresas (por tamaño y productividad). Finalmente, a partir de los resultados encontrados extraemos implicaciones de política.
O25|Contract Enforcement and Productive Efficiency: Evidence from the Bidding and Renegotiation of Power Contracts in India|Weak contract enforcement may reduce the efficiency of investment in developing countries. I study how contract enforcement affects efficiency in procurement auctions for the largest power projects in India. I gather data on bidding and ex post contract renegotiation and find that the renegotiation of contracts in response to cost shocks is widespread, despite that bidders are allowed to index their bids to future costs like the price of coal. Connected firms choose to index less of the value of their bids to coal prices and, through this strategy, expose themselves to cost shocks to induce renegotiation. I use a structural model of bidding in a scoring auction to characterize equilibrium bidding when bidders are heterogeneous both in cost and in the payments they expect after renegotiation. The model estimates show that bidders offer power below cost due to the expected value of later renegotiation. The model is used to simulate bidding and efficiency with strict contract enforcement. Contract enforcement is found to be pro-competitive. With no renegotiation, equilibrium bids would rise to cover cost, but markups relative to total contract value fall sharply. Production costs decline, due to projects being allocated to lower-cost bidders over those who expect larger payments in renegotiation.

O25|Industrial Land Policy and Economic Complexity of Chinese Cities|Economies producing more complex products tend to be wealthier and grow more quickly. Therefore, a key issue for cities around the world is to develop new specializations into more complex industries. In China, local governments tend to use industrial land subsidy as a policy tool to attract new firms in desired industries and promote industrial growth. However, relatively little is known about the impact of this policy tool on the economic complexity of Chinese cities. Drawing upon the recent literature on the principle of relatedness and economic complexity, this paper investigates the impact of this industrial land policy (ILP) on the diversification of Chinese cities into more complex industries. The empirical results support our hypothesis that those cities providing higher intensity of land subsidy are more likely to enter new industries, in particular the most complex ones.
O25|Exploring the role of industrial structure for regional economic resilience|The evolutionary approach of regional economic resilience suggests that an external shock can lead to a structural change and the development of new industrial specializations. Among its determinants, a role is played by the industrial structure where a certain degree of specialisation or diversification may influence the response of regions to shocks. The article aims at investigating the role of the relatedness of new specialisations to the existing industrial structure in favouring resilience of territories. Evaluating the resilience of Italian provinces in relation to the economic crisis of 2008, the analysis seeks to understand if provinces who resisted and recovered better, followed a ?related? or ?unrelated? diversification strategy. Conclusions discusses the implications for the policy debate on smart specialisation.
O25|Smart Development Banks|The conventional paradigm about development banks is that these institutions exist to target well-identified market failures. However, market failures are not directly observable and can only be ascertained with a suitable learning process. Hence, the question is how do the policymakers know what activities should be promoted, how do they learn about the obstacles to the creation of new activities? Rather than assuming that the government has arrived at the right list of market failures and uses development banks to close some well-identified market gaps, we suggest that development banks can be in charge of identifying these market failures through their loan-screening and lending activities to guide their operations and provide critical inputs for the design of productive development policies. In fact, they can also identify government failures that stand in the way of development and call for needed public inputs. This intelligence role of development banks is similar to the role that modern theories of financial intermediation assign to banks as institutions with a comparative advantage in producing and processing information. However, while private banks focus on information on private returns, development banks would potentially produce and organize information about social returns.
O25|The visible hand of cluster policy makers: An analysis of Aerospace Valley (2006-2015) using a place-based network methodology|The paper focuses on cluster policies with particular attention to the role of R&D collaborative incentives in the structuring of knowledge networks in clusters. We disentangle the main network failures in regional innovation systems, and discuss the selection procedures designed by policy makers to foster knowledge collaborations. We draw evidence from the French Aerospace Valley cluster from 2006 to 2015. The case study is based on a dataset of 248 granted research consortia, from which we build 4-cohort knowledge networks that enable us evidencing the evolving structural properties of the cluster over time. We suggest avoiding the bias and limitations of 1 and 2-mode network analysis by developing an original place-based network methodology that emphasizes on structural equivalence and groups’ behaviors. We discuss the results focusing on the convergence degree between the structural properties of the cluster selected by the Program and the policy makers’ objectives. Finally, the methodology allows us to identify the agents of the structural and technological changes observed throughout the period.
O25|Where have all the factories gone?: Growth and concentration of sub-national manufacturing activity in India|The spatial distribution of manufacturing across the states of India is analyzed covering the period 2004-05 to 2015-16. We found that the spatial concentration of manufacturing activity has increased since 2004-05. More industrialized states (example Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu) are found to have continued their dominance measured in terms of their share of output, factories and workers in manufacturing. They are observed to have captured a greater share of incremental growth of factories and workers. This outcome may be attributed to their comparative advantage due to agglomeration economies. Differences in the net entry of factories (and workers) in registered and unregistered segments of manufacturing are observed between different states of India. The estimates of net entry of factories in five selected industry groups in registered manufacturing are found to be consistent with agglomeration at the sectoral level.
O25|Distribution of Industrial Research & Innovation Activities: An Application of Technology Readiness Levels|The Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) approach is relevant to map the functional decomposition of companies' R&D value chains. TRLs matter for corporate location choices. Knowing what distinct types of R&D&I activities (or TRLs) stay, go and come back in EU territories â€“ and why â€“ is central for policies supporting local industrial and innovation ecosystems and clusters, and the identification and integration into strategic value chains. Fast-developing local strengths of Asian countries such as China, Japan and South Korea, in Automotive, and in Electronics and related fields are shaping companies' geographical decomposition of R&D&I activities. While the EU has strong value chains in e.g. automotive (network of combustion engine) and pharma (highly skilled labour force and strong research institutions), corporate R&D&I investments are finding their way to novel applications in emerging technologies in Asia.
O25|Smart Specialisation Evaluation: Setting the Scene|This report presents a set of preliminary conceptual and practical considerations on the evaluation of the Smart Specialisation policy. It opens a discussion that aims to set the scene for more articulated and detailed reflections. It is important that evaluation exercises are focused on selected elements of the policy scheme; this facilitates identifying suitable evaluation questions and methodologies. Evaluation is meaningful only in the presence of well-specified evaluation questions, stemming from the specific information needs of the actors involved in Smart Specialisation Strategies. A well-defined intervention logic, linking clear ends with means, is essential for evaluation. Monitoring systems act as early-warning mechanisms signalling critical aspects in the implementation, which call for deeper assessment and understanding through evaluation exercises. To plan useful evaluations and increase the chances of their results being used require an ongoing commitment to develop a learning culture and build evaluation capabilities across institutions and stakeholders.
O25|Smart Specialisation from Concept to Practice: A Preliminary Assessment|This study assesses how and to what extent the principles characterising the Smart Specialisation approach are actually translated in policy implementation, by examining three of its complementary aspects: the nature of the priority areas for policy intervention, the mechanisms for project selection, and the type of policy measures. The results shows that regions and countries tend to circumvent the selective approach of Smart Specialisation. Priority areas broadly defined, loose alignment of policy instruments with priorities and the scarce customisation of policy measures to the specific innovation needs of the identified priorities are the tangible signs of this circumvention process. We advance the hypothesis that this could be the result of lobbying activities, higher political return from widespread support measures, risk-aversion, and lack of adequate institutional and administrative capacity. An additional explanation may lie in the incentive structure established at European Union level which did not fully support the intervention logic of Smart Specialisation. To assess the effects of Smart Specialisation, we suggest focusing on interventions that (i) address priorities consistently defined, (ii) apply policy measures selectively to those priorities, (iii) design policy measures around the specificities of each priority.
O25|The Past and Future of Manufacturing in Central and Eastern Europe: Ready for Industry 4.0?|In this paper we determine the industry 4.0 (I4.0) readiness of eight Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs): Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. We outline the nature of manufacturing in the region, describe three distinct time periods of industrialization since 1990, and explain the nature of I4.0. Using measures reflecting three key dimensions of I4.0-readiness, namely technological, entrepreneurial and governance competencies, we find that the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Hungary and Slovenia are most I4.0-ready, and that Bulgaria, Slovakia, Romania and Poland are the least ready of the CEECs. We make a number of recommendations. All the countries in the region could do more to promote entrepreneurship; to diversify and grow manufacturing export markets through focused trade facilitation and competitive exchange rates; and to cooperate regionally on industrial policy - through for instance establishing a regional CEEC I4.0 Platform.

O25|Do Innovation Subsidies Make Chinese Firms More Innovative? Evidence from the China Employer Employee Survey|The Chinese government has been using various subsidies to encourage innovations by Chinese firms. This paper examines the allocation and impacts of innovation subsidies, using the data from the China Employer Employee Survey (CEES). We find that the innovation subsidies are preferentially allocated to state owned firms and politically connected firms. Of these two (state ownership and political connection), political connection is more important in determining the allocation. We also find that the firms that receive innovation subsidies file and receive more patents, are more likely to introduce new products, but do not necessarily file and receive more patents abroad. Finally, the firms that receive innovation subsidies do not have higher productivity, more profits, or larger market shares. Overall, the results point to inefficiency of allocation of innovation subsidies and show that the subsidies encourage only incremental innovations and not radical ones.
O25|Experimental Innovation Policy|Experimental approaches are increasingly being adopted across many policy fields, but innovation policy has been lagging. This paper reviews the case for policy experimentation in this field, describes the different types of experiments that can be undertaken, discusses some of the unique challenges to the use of experimental approaches in innovation policy, and summarizes some of the emerging lessons, with a focus on randomized trials. The paper concludes describing how at the Innovation Growth Lab we have been working with governments across the OECD to help them overcome the barriers to policy experimentation in order to make their policies more impactful.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
O25|The digital innovation policy landscape in 2019|How are OECD countries supporting digital innovation and ensuring that benefits spread across the economy? This paper explores the current landscape of strategies and initiatives implemented in OECD countries to support innovation in the digital age. It identifies common trends and differences in national digital, smart industry and artificial intelligence (AI) strategies. The paper also discusses policy instruments used across OECD to support digital innovation targeting four objectives: First, policies aimed at enhancing digital technology adoption and diffusion, including demonstration facilities for SMEs. Second, initiatives that promote collaborative innovation, including via the creation of digital innovation clusters and knowledge intermediaries. Third, support for research and innovation in key digital technologies, particularly AI (e.g. by establishing testbeds and regulatory sandboxes). Fourth, policies to encourage digital entrepreneurship (e.g. through early-stage business acceleration support).
O25|Cyber Security Framework for the Internet-of-Things in Industry 4.0|This research article reports the results of a qualitative case study that correlates academic literature with five Industry 4.0 cyber trends, seven cyber risk frameworks and two cyber risk models. While there is a strong interest in industry and academia to standardise existing cyber risk frameworks, models and methodologies, an attempt to combine these approaches has not been done until present. We apply the grounded theory approach to derive with integration criteria for the reviewed frameworks, models and methodologies. Then, we propose a new architecture for the integration of the reviewed frameworks, models and methodologies. We therefore advance the efforts of integrating standards and governance into Industry 4.0 and offer a better understanding of a holistic economic impact assessment model for IoT cyber risk.
O25|Successes and failures of industrial policy: Lessons from transition (post-communist) economies of Europe and Asia|- Is industrial policy necessary for successful development or the market “knows” better, how to allocate resources? - If industrial policy is needed, how to select industries that need to be supported? - What are the appropriate tools / instruments to support particular industries? Eastern European countries in general did not have any explicit industrial policy, neither via tax concessions and/or subsidies, nor via under/overpricing the exchange rate. Many countries of former Soviet Union carried out large import substitution programs through regulation of domestic fuel and energy prices (directly and via export tax) that subsidized all energy consumers. They also provided subsidies to agricultural enterprises. China and Vietnam (and to some extent Uzbekistan) were carrying out export oriented industrial policy mostly via underpricing the exchange rate. The paper discusses pros and cons, achievements and failures of various models of industrial policy. It is argued that export oriented industrial policy via undervaluation of the exchange rate is the best possible option to promote export oriented catch up development based on export of manufactured goods. It is especially needed for resource rich countries (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan) that are prone to Dutch disease. Assistance to domestic producers via keeping low domestic prices for fuel and energy also helps to stimulate growth, but at a price of very high energy intensity. Industrial policy that is not targeting particular industries (general support for education, research and development and infrastructure) may be reasonable for counties at a higher level of development.
O25|Mission-Oriented Innovation Policies: A Theoretical And Empirical Assessment For The Us Economy|The paper investigates the determinants of economic growth from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective. The paper combines the Sraffian supermultiplier model of growth with the Neo-Schumpeterian framework that emphasizes the entrepreneurial role of the state. We aim to detect the macroeconomic effect generated by alternative fiscal policies: generic ones and “mission-oriented” ones. Using a SVAR model for the US economy for the 1947–2018 period, we show that mission-oriented policies produce a larger positive effect on GDP (fiscal multiplier) and on private investment in R&D (crowd-in effect) than the effect produced by generic public expenditures.
O25|How to Set Budget Caps for Competitive Grants|We study how funding agencies should set budget caps for competitive grants. We show that budget caps influence the researchers’ submission strategy and, in particular, whether they steer their project choice towards the agencies’ favorite projects, and the level of funds they request. The welfare impact of alternative approaches depends on the level of competition, the cost of public funds and the social value of project implementation.
O25|Determinants of Developing Countries' Export Upgrading: The Role of China and Productive Investment|This paper explores the determinants of developing countries' export upgrading measured by export sophistication. In particular, as a response to the recent debate on China's impact on developing countries' industrialisation, we examine a new hypothesis that the considerable growth in developing countries' trade with China may serve as a source of productive investment for their export upgrading. Dynamic panel estimations based on HS 6-digit export data on 62 developing countries during 1995-2014 show the positive effects of human capital, productive investment, and absolute gains from trade with China measured by income terms of trade vis-Â®Â§-vis China. Mediation analysis finds that the positive effect of trade with China on export upgrading takes effect largely through its enhancing effect on productive investment, which supports our hypothesis. By contrast, China's direct export-downgrading impact is minor. Our findings suggest that, for developing countries, China serves more as a stimulator of capital accumulation for industrial development than a competitor in manufacturing market or a predator of natural resources. This provides an alternative to the widespread argument of China's crowding-out and re-primarisation impact on developing countries. The priority for developing countries is therefore the appropriate use of the gains from trade for productive purposes.
O25|The middle-technology trap: The case of the automotive industry in Turkey|This paper argues that Turkey has fallen into a middle-technology trap on the borders of a weak innovation system (IS) and strong global value chains (GVCs). Detailed information from a primary R&D and innovation funding agency is used to show that the technological characteristics of the funded automotive R&D and innovation projects remained reasonably stable between 1995 and 2011. This result is cross-validated with two qualitative designs on beneficiary firms and automotive industry experts. The qualitative designs aided in identifying three mechanisms that explain how the Turkish automotive industry has fallen into a middle-technology trap. Analysis at the project, firm, and expert levels indicate that despite extensive upgrading and learning in manufacturing, the automotive industry has failed to build innovation capabilities. Turkey's delegated role in the automotive GVC, the joint venture (JV) structure and the lack of complementarities collectively work in creating a trap that impedes further technological development.
O25|Modern industrial policy in Latin America: Lessons from cluster development policies|Industrial clusters have developed in many regions and countries of Latin America. Active public policies have often supported them at the national (federal) and local levels, sometimes with the financial and technical assistance of international organizations. These experiences have been most remarkable, and share several elements of the 'modern' industrial policies that enjoy an increasing consensus in the literature. The vast experience of locally based forms of active policies that have proliferated in Latin America reflects a modern approach to industrial policies, and an example for other developing countries. Such approach has typically included clever interactions of private and government sectors, a process of search and discovery of the necessary public policy inputs, and an interactive design and implementation of these policies.
O25|Relatedness, economic complexity and convergence across European regions|The aim of this paper is to analyze how the heterogeneous structure of the European regions has affected their patterns of convergence or divergence. We analyse data collected by Eurostat, from a balanced panel of 191 regions and 55 economic branches over the period 2003-2015. In this way, we are able to describe and capture technological proximity across the regions and analyse how it has evolved over space and time. Limiting the analysis to the manufacturing activities, we are also able to measure the degree of economic complexity of the regional production systems and assess how this affects their patterns of growth. Our findings suggest that there are pushing (enhancing convergence) and pulling (exacerbating economic gaps) forces to economic convergence. Spatial effects tend to push towards convergence, with the Eastern regions that started from relatively low levels of GDP per capita and experienced higher growth rates. Nevertheless, the different level of economic complexity tends to widen the gaps between territories: for example, the German regions, whose economic structures are more complex, have kept on widening the gap between themselves and the other European regions. The two different forces are also interconnected as the Eastern regions combine a relatively low level of GDP per capita with a significant level of economic complexity. During the period considered, the improvement in living standards has corresponded to the upgrade of their manufacturing production structures.
O25|European Innovation Partnerships: How Successful Have They Been in Promoting Innovation in the EU?|The paper presents an analytical assessment of the implementation of European Innovation Partnerships (EIPs) launched as one of the commitments of the EU Flagship Initiative Innovation Union with the aim to achieve innovative breakthroughs addressing major societal challenges. The EU launched five EIPs to address important societal challenges (1) Active & Healthy Ageing; (2) Water; (3) Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability; (4) Raw Materials; and (5) Smart Cities and Communities. The paper reviews the rationale of introducing the EIPs as a policy intervention aimed at promoting innovation in the EU and traces the organic evolution and governance structures of the newly emerging formations. It then provides an analytical evaluation of this EU policy initiative based on factual analysis of its implementation experiences and a comparison of its objectives and actual outcomes. In particular, the paper analyses the role of the EIPs as drivers of systemic change in the European innovation ecosystem and catalysts of new innovation activity in Europe. This critical assessment serves as the basis for drawing some conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of the EIPs as a new policy approach to foster innovation activity in Europe. One central conclusion is that while the EIPs have been very efficient in promoting collaboration among innovation stakeholders they have fallen short of breeding innovation activity of the expected scope and scale. The paper analyses the reasons for this weakness and formulates some recommendations that could serve as possible remedies.
O25|Global Value Chains in economic development|Global Value Chains (GVCs) started to play an increasing and key role in the global economy from the 1990s on. The market mechanism in GVCs supports industrialisation in the Global South and under certain conditions product and process upgrading. But GVCs do not lead to the catching-up of countries in the sense of them approaching real GDP per capita levels comparable with developed countries. These arguments are supported by a critical interpretation of the traditional trade theory, the New Trade Theory and specific approaches to explain GVCs, especially different governance structures and power relationships. Several case studies support these arguments. For catching-up, countries need comprehensive horizontal and vertical industrial policy and policies for social coherence. The small number of countries which managed to catch up did this in different variations.
O25|Федеральное Агенство Развития. Оно Необходимо Для Разработки И Реализации Успешных Стратегий<BR>[Federal development agency. It is necessary to design and implement successful strategies]|It is shown that in the success of catching-up development, an important role was played by special structures - general development agencies- that coordinated the activities of ministries and offices. The functions of such agencies are considered, the main tasks that the similar Russian Federal Development Agency (FDR) should solve, are described. The creation in late 2016 of the Department of Project Activities of the Government Office of the Russian Federation can be considered as the first stage of the creation of FDR. A number of further steps are proposed for its formation.
O25|‘Economics’ of prosperity: Why the dominant perspectives may be unhelpful to make sense of underdevelopment|"The article is essentially a book-review of Professor Vijay Joshi's recent work, '""India's Long Road: The Search for Prosperity"". In this critical essay, I take a slightly revisionist approach when it comes to a 'typical'book review. For example, the length of this article goes well-beyond the standard convention. The ‘deviation’ from rules, however, has specific objectives. I have critically analyzed Dr. Joshi’s work and in so doing include relevant evidences, debates and questions not just from economics but also from other disciplines such as history and political science."
O25|Dissecting the Input-Output Structure of the Greek Economy|Using input-output table data and a system of basic and derivative indices, the analysis in this paper provides a dissection of the Greek economy for the years 2005 and 2010. The findings suggest that: (i) the structural features of the economy have been shaped well before the emergence of the so-called Greek (or PIIGS) crisis; (ii) a well-targeted effective demand management policy could be mainly based on the service and primary production sectors; and (iii) industrial policy would be necessary and could primarily focus on nine highly import-dependent commodities of the industry sector. Therefore, it seems that a change in the intersectoral structure of the Greek economy is necessary.

O25|Contemporary Trends in the Development of Industry in the World and Serbia|The authors offer a view on the current state of industry and contemporary tendencies in its development in Serbia and the world. Particularly, this academic paper analyzes the state of Serbian industry, which collapsed at the beginning of the last decade of the 20th century, after having gone through three waves of industrialization. Serbian economy and industry have not recovered from deindustrialization even after two decades of unsteady development in the current century. Lastly, it presents some possibilities to revitalize the industry and achieve its harmonious development.
O25|Integrierte Wirtschaftsförderung in Kufstein<BR>[Integrated Local Economic Development in Kufstein]|The present study takes stock of the local economy of Kufstein, Austria within the context of the regional economy of the Austrian state of Tyrol. Based on the findings of the analysis, the study proposes ideas for local economic development in Kufstein. The study characterizes the local economy of Kufstein sectorally and stakes stock of relevant agents and programs of local and regional economic development. The ideas elaborated on the basis of the analysis suggest a strategy of local economic development for Kufstein that integrates aspects of innovation and entrepreneurship support, tourism development, city marketing, and retail trade promotion and that is synchronized with the general orientation of the regional economic development policy pursued by the state of Tyrol.
O25|Agricultural Policy and Long-Run Development: Evidence from Mussolini’s Battle for Grain|This paper explores the effect of agricultural policies on industrialization and economic development over the long run. I analyze the differential effect of the Battle for Grain, implemented by the Italian Fascist regime to achieve self-sufficiency in wheat production, on the development path across areas of Italy. Employing time variation, along with cross-sectional variation in the suitability of land for implementing the advanced wheat production technologies, I find that the policy had unintended positive effects on industrialization and economic prosperity which have persisted until the present day. Furthermore, I find that the positive effect of the Battle for Grain on human capital accumulation was instrumental in this process, suggesting that the complementarity between human capital and agricultural technology may be a critical mechanism through which agricultural productivity may enhance the development of non-agricultural sectors.
O25|Foresight as a governance tool to help shape the next production revolution|The next production revolution (NPR; also called Industry 4.0 elsewhere) is likely to trigger complex changes via the interactions of new technologies, materials, processes, and business models. These changes would affect R&D and innovation activities; the labour market; income distribution and well-being; skill requirements; as well as several fields of regulation. Furthermore, digitalisation can be a major enabler of the circular economy. The policy implications of the NPR are so wide-ranging that it is difficult to mention a major policy domain, which would remain untouched by these sweeping changes. The need for policy orchestration is, therefore, rather strong. Foresight, a specific type of forward-looking activities (FLA), can assist policy-makers in dealing with these complex changes. First, it facilitates a systemic approach, considers multiple futures and draws on the diverse set of knowledge of participants. Second, a shared vision, developed – and thus ‘owned’ – by the participants, can reduce the uncertainties generated by NPR, and it helps building commitment among participants as an additional factor to keep up the momentum of orchestrated policy design and implementation. Third, a transformative foresight process, considering and assisting systemic changes triggered by NPR, can contribute to reshaping the prevailing power structures and invigorating policy rationales, decision-making processes, and thus improving the efficacy of policies. FLA projects dealing with NPR issues vary in their thematic coverage and their breadth of participation. Combining these distinctions, four different archetypes of FLA are identified – and illustrated by actual cases – in the paper. The expected impacts on policy-making vary by the type of prospective analyses. Participatory processes mobilise a wider set of knowledge, aspirations, and worldviews compared to an expert-based project. Hence, more novel ideas can be expected, contested from various angles, hence tested more thoroughly, given the diversity of participants. FLA projects focusing on innovation and manufacturing systems consider a broader set of issues than S&T-centred projects. Given the complex issues brought about by the NPR, such a systemic approach seems to be more appropriate as a foundation for devising effective policies. In certain contexts, S&T-centred FLA can also be useful, but different and only more limited benefits and impacts can arise from this approach. Foresight benefits are far from being automatic: the paper considers eight critical factors to achieve those. An astute embedding of foresight into policy-making enhances the likelihood of impact, but foresight recommendations are no substitute for policy decisions and actions.
O25|Asia’s Industrial Transformation: The Role of Manufacturing and Global Value Chains (Part 1)|This paper argues that the single most important factor that explains East Asia’s development success was its fast structural transformation toward industrialization, manufacturing in particular. Workers moved out of agriculture into manufacturing, and the sector diversified and upgraded its structure. Manufacturing activities are subject to increasing returns to scale, and many manufacturing goods have high income elasticities of demand. For these reasons, manufacturing is referred to as the “engine of growth.” It is in the context of industrialization that openness played an important role in East Asia’s success, i.e., the connection between “export-led growth” (the relaxation of the balance-of-payments constraint on foreign exchange) and industrialization. Part 1 of the paper documents the extent of structural transformation in developing Asia. Second, it analyzes the relationship between the exportled growth model (i.e., the relaxation of the balance-of-payments constraint on foreign exchange) and industrialization. Finally, it reviews the industrialization experiences of Japan and the Republic of Korea, and discusses the recent deindustrialization debate.
O25|Asia’s Industrial Transformation: The Role of Manufacturing and Global Value Chains (Part 2)|This paper argues that the single most important factor that explains East Asia’s development success was its fast structural transformation toward industrialization, manufacturing in particular. Workers moved out of agriculture into manufacturing, and the sector diversified and upgraded its structure. Manufacturing activities are subject to increasing returns to scale, and many manufacturing goods have high income elasticities of demand. As a consequence, the sector is referred to as the “engine of growth.” It is in the context of industrialization that openness played an important role in East Asia’s success, i.e., the connection between “export-led growth” (the relaxation of the balance-of-payments constraint on foreign exchange) and industrialization. Part 2 of the paper reviews the role of Asia’s developmental states in consciously accelerating industrial development and learning, as well as the region’s mixed experiences with industrial policies. Second, it provides a discussion of how Asian firms hooked up on to global value chains.
O25|Technology, business model, and market design adaptation toward smart electricity distribution: Insights for policy making|The transformation of the electricity sector towards a sustainable energy supply and use has a disruptive potential for infrastructure and utilities. The spread of digital technologies, renewable energy, and prosumers requires a swift and well-guided adaptation of the electricity distribution industry to smart grid technologies and related business models. This paper, based on the large technical systems (LTS) conceptual framework, investigates the complex evolution and company and market design adaptation needs. Challenges and opportunities are analyzed through nine multi-stakeholder workshops, held in two EU member states (Germany and Portugal) in 2016–2017, engaging distribution system operators, researchers, academics, and integrated utility companies. The results indicate considerable uncertainty for distribution system operators regarding the value of large-scale smart meter rollouts. Also, a corporate culture with resistance to change is observed, challenging the integration of novel technologies and processes. Traditional regulation is seen as a barrier to smart grid investments, and is associated with job losses and knowledge destruction. Policy-makers can benefit from these insights on the dynamics of DSOs, which can contribute to public policy design and market reform which traditionally has often been mainly concerned about operational efficiency in a steady-state, stable economy.
O25|Agricultural policy and long-run development: evidence from Mussolini's Battle for Grain|This paper explores the effect of agricultural policies on industrialization and economic development over the long-run. I analyze the differential effect of the \textit{Battle for Grain}, implemented by the Italian Fascist regime to achieve self-sufficiency in wheat production, on the development path across areas of Italy. Employing time variation, along with cross-sectional variation in the suitability of land for the implementation of the advanced wheat production technologies, I find that the policy had unintended positive effects on industrialization and economic prosperity which persisted until the contemporary period. Furthermore, I find that the positive effect of the \textit{Battle for Grain} on human capital accumulation was instrumental in this process, suggesting that the complementarity between human capital and agricultural technology may be a critical mechanism through which agricultural productivity may enhance the development of non-agricultural sectors.
O25|The Real Exchange Rate Policy Trilemma in Developing Economies|"This paper discusses some of the inter-temporal issues that arise in the pursuit of real undervaluation to achieve rapid development. Policy makers face a trade-off between achieving a capital stock target in a given amount of time on the one hand and boosting real wages and output in the short run, on the other. This generates a trilemma whereby development-focused policy makers can choose to pursue two out of three desirables: (1) use the real exchange rate as an instrument of development policy, (2) meet the development target within a politically relevant time frame, and (3) maintain political stability. The optimal path under a policy with ""unambitious"" aims will resemble the typical electoral business cycle trajectory whereby policy makers maintain real overvaluation over much of the cycle. By contrast, achieving relatively ambitious capital stock targets within a relatively short time requires the potentially unpopular strategy of choosing a highly undervalued real exchange rate at the beginning of the planning horizon and gradually increasing the degree of undervaluation thereafter as wages rise. Relevant structural differences between countries imply different initial levels of real undervaluation, distinct optimal trajectories over time, and hence, varying degrees of political trade-offs."
O25|Politics-Driven Exchange Rate Cycles : East Asia vs. Latin America|I develop the implications for real exchange rate cycles of different policy preferences, focusing in particular on broadly stylized features of major Latin American and East Asian economies. Recent political science literature has emphasized the role of factors such as the influence of the manufacturing sector and the nature of labor markets. I formalize some of these insights in a developing country framework with policy makers who inter-temporally optimize and voters/audiences that are incompletely informed. Given the choice between assigning greater weight to immediate worker purchasing power versus generating manufacturing employment and income over time, I show that countries where policy makers choose the former are more likely to experience cycles with overvaluation, current account deficits, and abrupt (postponed) devaluations.
O25|Global Value Chains and Upgrading: What, When and How?|This paper focuses on explaining how technological capabilities interact with trade and GVCs participation to foster upgrading. We analyse trade performance of 74 developing countries in 2000 and 2010 from a perspective of learning, to understand what variables account for technological diversification over time when countries trade, including through GVCs. We find that technological capabilities not only condition the initial determination of local firms in trade and GVCs, but they also determine the extent to which local firms in developing countries manage to leverage knowledge flows and move into activities of greater technological complexity from a dynamic perspective. Our results point to the critical role of national learning variables in countries' performance over time. While emerging economies have synergistic relationships between variables that explain technological capabilities and their trade and GVC performance, this is not the case for developing countries as whole in our sample.
O25|Modern industrial policy and public-private councils at the sub-national level: Mexico's experience in an international perspective|In recent years, the need for modern industrial policies has been increasingly acknowledged in the literature and by the praxis of developed and developing countries, including much of Latin America. Whether a country should have an industrial policy is no longer in question; rather, the issue is how to do it right. Nevertheless, research is still incipient on the experience with the specific institutional arrangements and governance structure required for effective modern industrial policy, and this is especially true in large countries with developed subnational governance structures. One institutional mechanism considered vital to effective modern industrial policy is the modality of public-private dialogue and problem solving that supports a search for obstacles and solutions to agreed development objectives. This paper addresses the institutional foundations of industrial policy at the subnational level, with new empirical evidence from a large federal state-Mexico. It presents a detailed analysis of the governance of 32 newly created public-private State Productivity Commissions. All evidence analysed point to the fact that most of these commissions were in a rudimentary state of development after more than three years since the federal law promulgated them. Problems of governance in many ways mirrored issues that often emerge in national councils, but were graver in their depth and covered even the most rudimentary elements. Moreover, the peculiarity of the CEPs emerging out of a federal labour law appears to have generated overly narrow agendas. Central government's entities have a major challenge to provide and mobilise technical, administrative, and possibly financial support for the sub-national commissions.
O25|Does Output Influence Productivity? - A Meta-Regression Analysis|The goal of this paper is to conduct a meta-regression analysis (MRA hereafter) regarding the effects of the Kaldor-Verdoorn effect – the relation between output/demand and productivity. The Kaldor-Verdoorn effect has been subject to many econometric studies and while the overwhelming majority of them finds a positive overall effect, there is no consensus on its size - the results vary quite a bit, especially according to the chosen econometric specification. This MRA estimates a 'true value' of the Kaldor-Verdoorn effect without interference from potential publication selection bias via the use of multivariate MRA. A series of moderator variables is used to check for their effect of excess variation, including amongst others the year of publication, the sectors and the countries studied. This MRA study uses available data from 22 published studies with 303 estimations of the Kaldor-Verdoorn effect. When examining the primary literature as a whole, there seems to be publication bias. While there seems to exist a genuine Kaldor-Verdoorn effect, its size varies considerably depending on the specification chosen.
O25|Resource based industrialisation: evidence from the Iron-Ore project in Brazil|This paper aims to engage in the contemporary debate around the opportunity to diversify and upgrade a country?s economic system through the contribution of natural resource sectors.Adopting a revisitation of Hirschman?s linkage theory, the analysis looks at mining arguing that the outsourcing process changed the dynamics of the sector, which is now characterised by the promotion of high-level technology and innovation. By focusing on the Brazilian mining sector, the development of consumption and backward linkages is examined in relation to the S11D iron ore project. The specificity of the case presents an in-depth analysis, permitting a caseby-case, one size-does-not-fit-?all evaluation approach, which is crucial in formulating appropriate policy solutions to problems facing developing economies. It is argued that, overall, mining had a positive impact on the region where it operates, with strong consumption linkages. Nonetheless, due to an absent formal public policy, while backward linkages related to innovation and knowledge services are well--??developed and very often at the technological frontier, the ones related to capital goods are weak and in the hands of foreigner subsidiaries
O25|Structural change and convergence across European regions|The aim of our paper is to analyze the structural diversity of the European regions assuming the complexity of production spaces approach (Hidalgo C.A., B. Klinger, A.L. Barabási, R. Hausmann 2007). This stream of economic literature is the natural companion of the evolutionary theory of economics, where development is seen as the endogenous learning process led by the initial knowledge basis, which tends to expand in its proximity (Boschma 2005). The first step of our analysis is to map the EU regions according to their economic structure. We exploit information conveyed by Eurostat data, which are available for a balanced panel of 241 regions and 86 economic branches in 2010 and 2015. In this way we are able to construct a space characterized by technological proximity of regions. The underlying assumption is that territories with similar production structures display similar production knowledge. The second step is the construction of the network space based on the correlation matrix. In order to obtain the clusters of regions based on the similarity of their economic structure, we apply a modularity algorithm to the network. Such measures define groups based on the degree of connectedness of the observations between them and allows to measure how such groups explain the network connections using as benchmark a case in which edges where assigned randomly. Our findings suggest that regions, which are more dynamic in terms of structural change, are those with manufacturing capabilities located in Eastern European countries. Such regions were able to upgrade their competences towards more complex productions and this resulted also in a fast catch-up of their GDP per capita level with respect to other mid income regions in Western Europe. Most prosperous regions are found to be urban areas with developed creative service activities and in regions with advanced manufactures (machinery, automotive, electronics, etc.); whereas backwardness is detected in regions with a cumbersome weight of tourism related activities.
O25|Asian Experiences with Global and Regional Value Chain Integration and Structural Change|This research report investigates the relationship between the growing integration into global and regional value chains (VCs) and structural change in the South and South East Asian (SEA) region. The analysis includes a sample of 60 developed and developing countries covered in the OECD’s Inter-Country Input-Output Tables. Focusing on the SEA region, we find the usual inverted U-shaped relationship between the manufacturing share and per capita income. With regards to the impact of growing VC integration, the econometric results suggest a small positive effect of the overall VC integration on the change in the manufacturing share at the global level. Very similar patterns are found for the South and South East Asian region, however, with a large degree of country heterogeneity. The main beneficiaries from VC integration in the region in terms of the relative importance of manufacturing in the economy include for example Korea and Thailand. Unexpectedly, no significant differences in the (manufacturing-related) structural impacts of regional and global VCs could be identified.
O25|Kazakhstan’s cotton sector reforms since independence|" With the goal of reducing the dependency on oil revenues, the Government of Kazakhstan has recently increased its budget allocations to prop up the domestic agricultural sector. Yet, many observers agree that it is less the amount of public spending that induces long-term growth than the quality of the regulatory environment. Against this background, the current paper analyses the nature and effects of state regulation in the cotton sector. In the early 2000s, it was considered to be the only example of private vertical coordination in Kazakhstani agriculture, which contrasted sharply with the state mandates imposed on producers in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. However, in 2007, regulation in Kazakhstan forced ginneries to use a complex warehouse receipt system without making sure that it was accepted by stakeholders and without appropriate institutions for implementing it in place. At the same time, it imposed financing restrictions on ginneries, which were major loan and input providers to farmers. Further measures included the establishment of a special economic zone to host a ""cotton cluster"". In the following years, private producers and investors turned away from cotton, and cotton area and output fell substantially. We argue that the cotton sector performance after 2007 shows how ill-designed regulation and government interference can turn a promising economic sector into decline. As an unintended side effect, the regulation promoted more diversified crop rotations based on high value crops.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
O25|Attracting FDI in middle-skilled supply chains|While popular opinion often pictures FDI flowing in search of lowest-wage, lowest-skilled activities in emerging markets, actual FDI to such countries increasingly addresses medium to high-skilled manufacturing sectors. Such FDI might be called 'Quality FDI' that contributes to the creation of decent and value-adding jobs, enhancing the skill base of host economies, facilitating transfer of technology, knowledge and know-how, boosting competitiveness of domestic firms and enabling their access to world-wide markets, as well as operating in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. To attract such quality FDI, host countries need mindfully tailored policies. Recent research offers evidence for strategies in developing countries that successfully turned FDI into such quality FDI.
O25|Development paths: A case for public investment as the alternative to the Washington Consensus|This paper's aim is to provide a different standpoint in the development debate, by focusing on the short-sightedness of the international institutions when they propose a development agenda. Focusing on macroeconomic performance and on privatisation, they have found a solution in PPPs, which offer financing opportunities for public investment and at the same time they reduce the burden on governments budgets. As an alternative this paper proposes a model based on investment and self-dependency with combining elements from post- Keynesian theory as well as the Beijing Consensus. The model rests on the importance of SOEs to use industrial policy as a tool to achieve independence from western powers as well as to increase investment. The theoretical claims are supported by empirical analysis based on 98 developing countries over a 15 year period.
O25|Die europäische CO2-Regulierung für Pkw nach 2021: Plädoyer für eine effizientere Regulierung|Die EU hat sich zum Ziel gesetzt, die CO2-Emissionen des Verkehrs im Zeitraum von 2005 bis 2030 um 30 Prozent zu senken. Damit das erreicht werden kann, müssen insbesondere die Emissionen des Pkw-Verkehrs sinken. Ohne weitere Regulierungsschritte wird der Verkehrssektor aber das Klimaziel verfehlen. Aus diesem Grund wird jetzt in Brüssel über die Fortschreibung der Emissionsgrenzwerte für neue Pkw diskutiert. Im Verkehr setzt die EU somit bislang nicht auf Mengen- oder Preissteuerung, sondern auf die Regulierung des Emissionspotenzials von Neuwagen. Der Autofahrer und die am Markt bestehende Nachfrage werden an dieser Stelle nicht adressiert. Eine große Schwäche, da alle Klimaschutzszenarien einen erfolgreichen Markthochlauf von Elektroautos erfordern, was ohne Akzeptanz beim Kunden scheitern muss. Brüssel sollte daher seinen Instrumentenkasten neu gewichten. Die Koppelung von Straßen- und Strom Sektor sollte ins Zentrum der Aufmerksamkeit rücken. Nichtsdestotrotz hat die Kommission einen Vorschlag zur Fortschreibung der Grenzwerte bis 2030 vorgelegt. Dieser ist laut Impact-Assessment zielkonform. Dennoch gibt es in Brüssel Stimmen, die eine deutliche Verschärfung der Vorlage fordern. Das ist aber der falsche Ansatz. Bereits der Kommissionsentwurf erfordert einen Markthochlauf der Elektromobilität. Dies erfordert aber, dass die Nachfrageseite das Zusatzangebot an Elektroautos auch akzeptiert. Das wird aber nur geschehen, wenn die Rahmenbedingungen passen. Insbesondere eine öffentliche Ladeinfrastruktur muss aufgebaut werden, was gerade in Deutschland noch auf Hindernisse stößt, die der Staat eigentlich schnell beseitigen könnte. Hierauf sollte der künftige klimapolitische Fokus gerichtet werden und nicht auf über den Bedarf hinausgehende Grenzwerte. Sonst droht eine Überregulierung des Angebotes und damit negative Auswirkungen auf den Industriestandort, Arbeitsplätze und auch für den Klimaschutz.
O25|Government-made bank distress: Industrialisation policies and the Russian financial crisis of 1899-1902|How can industrial policies lead to bank distress? In the 1890s, when undergoing rapid state-led industrialisation, the Russian Empire grew by foreign capital inflows into national debt and by state procurement of industrial output. Concurrently, state policies incentivised, but did not compel, commercial banks to finance industry. In 1899, the inflow of foreign capital fell sharply, initiating a financial crisis. Using newly-collected historical data and extensive narrative evidence, I find the banks which experienced greater distress in the crisis had more personal connections to the government officials who were close to the epicentre of policymaking. Moreover, these banks had more personal ties to the companies which had been most-stimulated by state policies to expand production. Taken together, these two findings suggest that national development policies had a destabilising impact on bank performance.
O25|Lessons Learned from Applications of IoT at Social Spheres| Although Taiwan made its well-respected economic achievements at the catch-up period, the country is in transition to innovation-driven economic upgrading, which is recently being promoted by a strategic policy package of so-called the Industrial Transformation Program, focusing on 5+N innovative industries. Unlike the previous focus on modularized intermediate goods in the industrialization stage, the new policy package calls for innovation with strong flavor of cross-fertilization, solution-orientation, software and hardware integration. A key issue of this paper is how a latecomer like Taiwan may innovate in a post catch-up manner, which requires a latecomer country to establish new technological trajectories for innovation in a changing competitive environment where scarce opportunity for imitation is present. The paper sets out to examine the ways in which how Taiwanese firms approach or harness IoT innovations, especially via applications at the social sphere. It seems to present more challenges than IoT applications inside the firm (for example Industry 4.0) for the reason that IoT applications at social sphere are related to the aspects of behavior and social interfaces of the broadly-defined customer space.As a result, for innovators in Taiwan, they need to address the social interface involved in an appropriate manner. In many cases, they also need compound innovations, especially in conjunction with business models, not just technological innovation alone. Therefore, innovators in Taiwan have to change the way in which they innovate and interact with the changing innovation ecosystems. Especially in the emerging innovative sectors as 5+N innovative industries targeted by the government, the evolving innovation ecosystems are intrinsically international. Based on two intensive case studies, we would like to draw some lessons learned in Taiwan, which may enrich our understanding of factors underlying industrial innovations in the era of the digital economy, especially for latecomer countries in transition.
O25|Towards increased complexity in Russian regions : networks, diversification and growth|Following Hausmann et al. (2011), we apply a network approach to measure the level of economic complexity and diversification opportunities of Russian regions. Using Russian and international export data, we find that the complexity of Russian regional economies varies substantially: rela-tively high in western and central regions, lower in southern and northern Russia and lowest in eastern regions. While Russian regions, on average, have poor diversification opportunities, regions can still diversify their exports by participating in international value-added chains or cooperating in developing group strategies. Our results are highly consistent with two well-established rankings of Russian regional R&D development based on numerous regional indicators, and imply that our network-based measure of complexity captures important features such as the level of regional R&D.
O25|Le tecnologie di Industria 4.0 e le PMI/Technologies of Industry 4.0 and SMEs|This paper concerns a study on the next production revolution called Industry 4.0 based on confluence of various technologies, mainly digital, with far reaching consequences especially for productivity and employment. This study considers the implementation of Industry 4.0 in SMEs and industrial districts that represent a great part of Italian industry. The latter represents certainly a major challenge to such implementation because of the existence of various obstacles constituted by availability of investment capitals, small scale productions and tendency to develop and to adopt only incremental innovations rather than radical ones typical of Industry 4.0. In this work we study the technologies involved in Industry 4.0, taking account of existence of specific technologies, called enabling technologies, whose confluence in the manufacturing industry determines the implementation of Industry 4.0. Such enabling technologies originate from the major fields of R&D activities such as nanotechnologies, biotechnologies, digital technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper we study the dynamic and possible evolution characterizing the formation of the various enabling technologies in a sort of ramification process, using specific models of technology, technology innovation and R&D, and their relation with manufacturing in SMEs and industrial districts. The results of the study underlines the importance of AI in determining possibilities and limits to Industry 4.0, the necessity to disrupt the tendency of SMEs in adopting only incremental innovations, the existence of “intranality effects” raising difficulties from the supply chain, and the importance of technology consulting firms in the integration of ICT in operating technologies of a manufacturing activity.
O25|Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform in the Developing World: Who Wins, Who Loses, and Why?|Fossil fuel subsidies are widespread in developing countries, where reform efforts are often derailed by disputes over the likely distribution of gains and losses. The impacts of subsidy reform are transmitted to households through changes in energy prices and prices of other goods and services, as well as through factor earnings. Most empirical studies focus on consumer expenditures alone, and computable general equilibrium analyses typically report only total effects without decomposing them by source. Meanwhile, analytical models neglect important open-economy characteristics relevant to developing countries. In this paper, we develop an analytical model of a small open economy with a preexisting fossil fuel subsidy and identify direct and indirect impacts of subsidy reform on real household incomes. Our results, illustrated with data from Viet Nam, highlight two important drivers of distributional change: (i) the mix of tradable and nontradable goods, reflecting the structure of a trade-dependent economy; and (ii) household heterogeneity in sources of factor income.
O25|Path creation, global production networks and regional development: a comparative international analysis of the offshore wind sector|The question of how regions and nations develop new sources of industrial growth is of recurring interest in economic geography and planning studies. From an evolutionary economic geography (EEG) perspective, new growth paths emerge out of existing economic activities and their associated assets and conditions. In response to the micro-economic and endogenous focus of much EEG research, this paper utilises a broader evolutionary perspective on path creation which stresses the dynamic interplay between four sets of factors: regional assets; key economic and organisational actors; mechanisms of path creation; and multi-scalar institutional environments and policy initiatives. Reflecting the importance of extra-regional networks and institutions, this framework is also informed by the Global Production Networks (GPN) approach, which highlights the process of strategic coupling between firms and regions and its political and institutional mediation by state institutions at different spatial scales. We deploy this framework to investigate regional path creation in the context of renewable energy technologies, focusing specifically on the offshore wind industry. We adopt a comparative cross-national approach, examining the evolution of offshore wind in Germany, the UK and Norway. Of the three cases, Germany has developed the most deep-rooted and holistic path to date, characterised by leading roles in both deployment and manufacturing. By contrast, path creation in the UK and Norway has evolved in more partial and selective ways. The UK's growth path is developing in a relatively shallow manner, based largely upon deployment and 'outside in' investment, whilst Norway?s path is emerging in an exogenous, ?inside-out? fashion around a fairly confined set of actors and deployment and supply functions. In conclusion, the paper emphasises the important role of national states in orchestrating the strategic coupling of regional and national assets to particular mechanisms of path creation.
O25|Tele-Communications 2.0: The Age of the Internet|Over the past few decades, the Internet has become the major tool for communication, greatly replacing the traditional telecommunication technologies. We use industry-level evidence from 21 European countries and the period 1997–2007 and identify the changing effects of traditional telecommunication technologies and the Internet on the functioning of markets. Specifically, we show that the effect of the traditional telecommunication technologies on competition in services and goods markets has dissipated and has become insignificant during this period. In contrast, the effect of the Internet has gained a significant momentum.
O25|Markups Dispersion and Firm Entry: Evidence from Ethiopia|This paper examines if and to what extent micro-level distortions affect structural transformation in a developing country by creating entry barriers. We show that while average price-cost margin trigger firm entry, a large dispersion of markups deters new firms from entering the market, thereby disrupting the process of new enterprise creation. We exploit information from the Ethiopian annual census of manufacturing establishments to estimate markups and then dispersion at sector and location-sector wide levels. Results show that higher markups dispersion significantly reduces entry rate into a market even in presence of expected positive average markups. Extension of our framework shows that market distortions caused by markup dispersion are related to a statistically significant drop in aggregate TFP and employment growth. Policies fostering competition on the other hand can reduce entry barriers created by market distortions.
O25|Quality screening and trade intermediaries: Evidence from China|We examine the qualityâ€ screening role played by intermediaries in international trade, exploiting export data at the product level for Chinese exporters. We uncover substantial heterogeneity among intermediaries, and distinguish two types: generalized and specialized intermediaries. We find strong evidence of a qualityâ€ verification role for specialized intermediaries: they are more prevalent in products with greater quality dispersion among local exporters, and export goods of higher quality than do generalized intermediaries. Our results suggest that specialized intermediaries have the capacity to reduce the incidence of quality problems.
O25|Still a long way to go: decomposing income inequality across Italy’s regions, 1871 – 2011|This article is the first study to explore to what extent labour productivity, structural change, participation rates and the age structure of the population contributed to the pattern of Italy’s regional economic inequality over the long run (1871-2011). We provide brand new regional estimates of participation rates and age structures, as well as the most updated figures on per capita GDP, per worker GDP and the employment rate (at ten-year intervals spanning from 1871 to 2011). First, regional inequality in per capita GDP (Y/N) is split into labour productivity (Y/L) and labour-market features (L/N). Then, the Caselli-Tenreyro decomposition is used to explore whether labour-productivity convergence (or divergence) at the NUTS-1 level was determined within or between sectors, and by labour reallocation. While labour productivity was central to the pattern of Italy’s regional development until the 1970s, since then the key factor of North-South divergence has been the participation rate. The results confirm the central role of national and local policies, influencing per capita GDP via productivity, employment, and participation rates.
O25|New ventures in Cleantech: opportunities, capabilities and innovation outcomes|Facing the challenge of climate change, innovations that imply environmental benefits create business opportunities for entrepreneurs. This paper analyzes innovation capabilities of startups in Cleantech and how the innovation outcomes of those startups develop over time. Based on the Mannheim Foundation Panel and applying propensity score matching, a cohort of 566 Cleantech startups is analyzed and compared with a control group of non-Cleantech startups. We find that startups in Cleantech have, on average, higher innovation capabilities compared with all startups. However, Cleantech startups are a heterogeneous group including ventures using common technology and those developing new technology. Our econometric evidence shows that, ceteris paribus, Cleantech startups are more likely to combine existing technology in a novel way. Finally, we find that Cleantech startups do, on average, develop more market novelties in later years compared to theirs peers.
O25|R&D offshoring and home industry productivity|Offshoring R&D commonly invokes concerns regarding the loss of high value jobs and a hollowing out of technological capabilities, but it can also benefit domestic firms by enabling them to tap into the global technological frontier. We study the effect of R&D offshoring on industrial productivity in the home country using industry-level data for 18 OECD countries over a 26-year period. Simultaneity between productivity and R&D offshoring is addressed by using foreign tax policy as an instrument for offshored R&D. We show that R&D offshoring contributes positively to productivity in the home country, irrespective of the host country destination.
O25|Impact of counterfeiting on the performance of digital technology companies|Counterfeiting activities target companies in various sectors, including digital technology companies, defined as companies that produce and/or commercialize at least one physical product that incorporates a digital technology, excluding the merchandising related to the company brands. Counterfeiting is a fraudulent activity that potentially damages the economic and innovation performance of companies and can pose major threats to global competition and economic growth. However, the actual impact of counterfeiting on the performance of companies has not been tested empirically, due to methodological problems, including the lack of data on counterfeiting at the firm-level. Furthermore, prior theoretical studies have speculated that counterfeiting could have in part a beneficial effect on the performance of companies, due to indirect advertising, calling for empirical investigations to shed light on the issue. The goal of the present study is to provide empirical evidence on the impact of counterfeiting on both the economic and innovative performance of digital technology companies at the firm-level and on the global scale. To this aim, a new database was created combining data on counterfeiting activities during 2011-2013 (OECD-EUIPO, 2016) with financial information and patent data from 2009 to 2015. The result is a firm-level database that enables unprecedented analyses on the impact of counterfeiting on performance of digital technology companies. About 9% of the seizures of counterfeits that were illegally traded across borders during 2011 2013 involved goods commercialized by digital technology companies, equivalent to about the 9.1% of the total value of seizures. Collectively, about 11% of companies affected by illegal international trade of counterfeits are digital technology companies. The majority of these (58%) are big corporations with Operating Revenues greater than USD 1 bn. These account for 77% of the number of total seizures, and 84% of the value of seizures related to the digital technology companies. SMEs, defined as those with Operating Revenues up to USD 50 million, represent 21% of digital technology companies targeted and account for 5% of total seizures and 6% of the total value of seizures. The industries mostly targeted are electronics (both consumers’ electronics and electronics for industrial use), automotive and digital media. The digital technology products commercialized in frauds of IPRs include computer hardware and electronic components, batteries, sensors, autoparts, optical instruments, videogames, and recording of movies and motion picture. About 34% of digital technology companies affected by international trade of counterfeits are located in the EU28 or EFTA, 41% are located in North America, 23% are located in Asia. Within the EU28, UK, Germany, France and Italy are the countries hosting the largest number of targeted digital technology companies. Within the EU28, Germany and UK, followed by Belgium and Ireland, are the most-common country of destination of seized counterfeits. The overwhelming majority of seized goods related to digital technology companies is imported from Asia. 51% of these are imported from China, 41% comes from Hong Kong, China, 3% from Singapore. Other economies of provenance account each for less than 1% of the seizures. The vast majority (93%) of seizures affecting digital technology companies are due to violations of trademarks, and only a minority are due to violations of design models (4%), and copyrights (2%). Less than 1% of the seizures are due to violations of patents. However, seizures enacted in defence of patents are those that have the highest mean value. The analysis of infringed companies with respect to a control samples of non-infringed companies indicates that counterfeiting targets specifically highly profitable companies, with high propensity to innovate. Indeed, digital technology companies are more likely to become target of counterfeiting when they have larger Operating Revenues, and when they perform at a higher level in terms of profitability (return on total assets), prior to the window of observation. Target companies also have on average larger patent portfolios, prior to the observation of counterfeiting activities. Digital technology companies located in EU28 are on average less likely than companies located outside of EU28 to be the target of counterfeiting activities. Results from impact analyses indicate lower growth rates of operating profits for digital technology companies targeted by counterfeiting with respect to control samples of firms not affected by counterfeiting. In particular the econometric models provide evidence of a negative impact of counterfeiting on both EBITDA (Earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation) and EBIT (Earnings before interest taxes). This result is robust across different estimation methods, model specifications and time windows. The data reveals only a weak negative impact on operating revenues, with limited statistical confidence. Conversely, there is no significant evidence that counterfeiting affected the investment in Fixed Assets of targeted firms with respect to the control sample. The results about the negative impact of counterfeiting activities on operating profits are in line with reports of greater costs incurred by these companies to enact anti-counterfeiting strategies, reported in prior descriptive literature. These practices include the broadening of product ranges, with fewer scale-economies and the enactment of anti-infringement procedures, such as ‘conspicuous packaging’, more screening and origin certifications, development of licensing downstream retailers and direct self-enforcement aimed at limiting the circulation of counterfeits. Results do not provide support for the existence of indirect positive spillover effects, as hypothesised by the theoretical literature, according to which infringed companies might benefit from an advertising effect due to the greater diffusion of brands from the counterfeiting activities. Indeed, at least for what concerns digital technology companies, there is no evidence of any positive effect of infringement on sales of original products. The digital technology companies that were affected by counterfeiting on average increased their patent portfolios during the observation period, but less than the digital technology companies that were not affected by counterfeiting. However, the result is not robust to the inclusion of control variables and to the adoption of alternative measures of innovation performance (Intangible Assets). It certainly merits further research, once more data on counterfeiting become available. Overall, the results indicate that counterfeiting activities harm the economic performance of targeted digital technology companies, by eroding their operating profits. The effect on innovative performance is negative, but still inconclusive due to insufficient dataset, and cannot exclude that counterfeiting may harm the propensity to innovate of digital technology companies. The analysis rules-out the existence of any positive spillover from counterfeiting.
O25|Smart Specialisation at work: Assessing investment priorities|This paper provides a methodology to assess how national and regional authorities define their research and innovation investment priorities for smart specialisation. It then tests the methodology empirically, based on a significant sample of research and innovation strategies for smart specialisation from Italy and Poland. The paper helps to fill a gap in the emerging literature on smart specialisation regarding the definition of investment priority areas, while providing useful analytical elements to orient policy impact evaluation exercises. We found that research and innovation priorities in Italy and Poland are defined in line with a multi-level, tree-like structure whose higher hierarchical level usually contains a few broad dimensions, and whose branches cover several specific activities. When considered individually, most of those activities represent suitable smart specialisation priorities. Yet, some of the examined strategies contain priorities that do not fully reflect the smart specialisation logic. Several strategies encompass tens or even hundreds of activities. It is beyond the scope of the present study to evaluate the appropriateness of a certain set of investment priorities in relation to the characteristics of a region or country. However, our analysis raises an important question about the capacity of the strategy management bodies to effectively support the development of huge sets of activities each of which potentially requires specific competences and dedicated administrative and technical resources. Also, large sets of priorities may de facto circumvent the smart specialisation principle of selective intervention, as the strategies ultimately cover broad economic areas.
O25|Smart Specialisation at work: The policy makers' view on strategy design and implementation|This paper illustrates the results of a survey on the Smart Specialisation experience across European regions and countries. By collecting and analysing the views of national and regional authorities, the survey intended to take stock of Smart Specialisation Strategies implementation, identify critical issues and challenges while drawing some lessons and recommendations in light of the debate on the post-2020 Cohesion Policy. Overall, despite being considered particularly challenging in terms of policy intelligence, skills and capabilities for public authorities and other stakeholders, Smart Specialisation experience is positively valued by the vast majority of respondents. Substantial improvements are detected with respect to: stakeholder engagement, priority setting, concentration of funding, level of trust and emergence of innovation potential; whereas, more efforts are needed in relation to the quality and effectiveness of monitoring activities and strategiesâ€™ outward-looking perspective. Further progress is still required as regards the policy regulatory framework, governance and institutional capabilities along with the involvement of relevant actors (notably SMEs and civil-society groups) who have remained at the margin of the decision making process thus far. With respect to the ultimate objective of the policy, national and regional actors are not observing significant progresses towards economic transformation yet. Respondents recommend to maintain the current policy framework for the future, while introducing new elements to improve strategiesâ€™ efficacy and make Smart Specialisation more responsive to the specific needs of different territories.
O25|Infrastructure Grants and the Performance of Microenterprises|"We evaluate the impact of a place-based infrastructure development scheme directed towards India's most ""backward"" districts, on the performance of microenterprises. ""Backward"" districts were selected based on a transparent score-based assignment mechanism. Using a Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design, we find that firms in treated districts had higher profits, revenues, and employment. Improvements in electrification was an important channel driving these results, as firms used more electricity and had a lower likelihood of facing a power cut. We also find increases in migrants, and proportion of new firms in treated districts, along with negative spillovers in areas closer to the treated districts."
O25|Structural Transformation and Spillovers from Industrial Areas|"Like many developing countries, India features a variety of land-use restrictions that make it difficult to establish industrial firms on agricultural lands. Such policies have received some of the blame for the slow pace of industrialization, and there is widespread agreement on the need for reform. Traditional agrarian economies, however, have many features that may serve as barriers to industrialization, making it unclear that land-use reform would be sufficient for promoting manufacturing growth in rural areas. To better understand the role played by such regulations, we study the effects of the Industrial Areas (IAs) program in India, which facilitated the establishment of industrial firms in areas that had previously been restricted to agriculture. We find that IAs caused a large increase in the number of firms and employment, and that there were substantial spillovers to neighboring villages. Furthermore, IAs trigger a classic ""structural transformation"" of the economy, with a shift of workers from agricultural to non-agricultural employment, and the creation of numerous small manufacturing and agricultural firms."
O25|The Industrialization of South America Revisited: Evidence from Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia, 1890-2010|We use new manufacturing GDP time series to examine the industrialization in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia since the early twentieth century. We uncover variation across countries and over time that the literature on industrialization had overlooked. Rather than providing a single explanation of how specific shocks or policies shaped the industrialization of the region, our argument is that the timing of the industrial take off was linked to initial conditions, while external shocks and macroeconomic and trade policy explain the variation in the rates of industrialization after the 1930s and favorable terms of trade and liberalization explain de-industrialization after 1990.
O25|Firm Scope and Spillovers from New Product Innovation: Evidence from Medical Devices|When firms span related product categories, spillovers across categories become central to firm strategy and industrial policy, due to their potential to foreclose competition and affect innovation incentives. We exploit major new product innovations in one medical device category, and detailed sales data across related categories, to develop a causal research design for spillovers at the customer level. We find evidence of spillovers, primarily associated with complementarities in usage. These spillovers imply large benefits to multi- vs. single-category firms, accounting for nearly one quarter of sales in the complimentary category (equivalent to four percent of revenue in the focal category).
O25|A Revisit to the Forgotten Debate after Half-Century: Balanced Versus Unbalanced Growth|The debate between balanced and unbalanced growth doctrines has generated much heat since the publication of Rosenstein-Rodan’s seminal work in 1943 but vanished in early 1980s. This paper intends to empirically revisit the forgotten debate by first compiling a harmonized international dataset that contains sectorial value-added data for up to 175 countries over 45 years. This dataset enables us to construct the index of sectorial imbalance for each country, which further allows us to update the key empirical tests for the balanced and unbalance growth hypotheses that appeared in the literature. Moreover, we also conduct cross-country growth regression analysis to systematically examine the effects of sectorial balance (or imbalance) on growth. Overall, we have found empirical support for the balanced growth hypothesis.
O25|In with the Big, Out with the Small: Removing Small-Scale Reservations in India|An ongoing debate in employment policy is whether promoting small and medium enterprises creates jobs. We use the elimination of small-scale industry (SSI) promotion in India to address this question. For 60 years, SSI promotion in India focused on reserving certain products for manufacture by small and medium enterprises. We identify the consequences for employment growth, investment, output, productivity, and wages of dismantling India's SSI reservations. We exploit variation in the timing of de-reservation across products and also measure the long-run impact of national SSI policy changes using variation in pretreatment exposure at the district level. Districts more exposed to de-reservation experienced higher employment and output growth. Entrants into the de-reserved product spaces and incumbents that were previously constrained by the size restrictions drove the increase in growth. The results suggest that dismantling India's SSI policies encouraged overall employment growth.
O25|Elements of Technical Democracy|The concept of technical democracy is both obvious and perplexing: with technology so often appearing to be a natural extension of science, why should citizens have any say in the matter? And yet how could we imagine or accept that technical systems, which have such an impact on individual and collective choices, could escape the deliberations of civic opinion and decision-making? Citizens must be able to acquire the skills of democratic expertise to then be able to exercise them when strategic decisions are being taken. If we are to move towards this objective, the stakes are very high. Even if a movement is initiated that aims to construct a fairer, more civic and more democratic society, the appropriation of technical issues in both education and the workplace is confronted with multiple types of inertia.

O25|Industry in Britain - An Atlas|"Living near a productive company can have considerable economic benefits. It means the chance of well-paid jobs, creates opportunities for suppliers of goods and services, and can be a boost to local retailers. This common-sense economic logic explains why policymakers consistently worry about the uneven spread of industry in Britain and, from time to time, conclude that it inefficient and unfair and that something new must be done. Now is one of those moments, with the government shortly set to launch a new ""Industrial Strategy"" which looks likely to include a new approach to regional policy. But while there is agreement across Britain's political parties that the distribution of industry is a problem, little new analysis on the location and performance of British firms with an explicitly regional focus has been published recently. This paper, part of ongoing work on the economics of British industry at the LSE's Centre for Economic Performance, starts to fill that gap. We present maps and charts setting out the latest data on firm location, together with geographic measures of employment, productivity, and innovation. Ten stylised facts emerge from our analysis, many of which challenge the prevailing wisdom: Finance is far less London-centric than the creative industries; the South-East is not the country's productivity engine, rather a band stretching west from the capital towards Bristol is; the East of England stands out in terms of R&D intensity; and in addition to the North-South divide, disparities between coastal and inland areas are concerning. This clarification of the starting point is just the first step in a data-driven approach to industrial policy. Bigger questions—in particular analysis of the ideal spread of industry that policy should target, and the best tools to get there—loom large and also require new analysis."
O25|The Chaning Patterns of Investment in the PRC Economy|The investment-intensive growth model of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is often viewed as state-driven and ultimately unsustainable. But largely unnoticed, a shift has taken place. This paper examines the changes in investment patterns since 2003 and the potential impact of industrial policies on these patterns. The point of view is macroeconomic, based on economy-wide data with various breakdown. Significant shifts in investment patterns across sectors and ownership forms have occurred over time, supporting a new growth model with a reduced role of the state, and these shifts appear driven more by market factors than by government policies.

O25|All in the family: State capture in Tunisia|We examine the relationship between entry regulation and the business interests of former President Ben Ali's family using firm-level data from Tunisia. Connected firms account for a disproportionate share of aggregate employment, output and profits, especially in sectors subject to authorization and restrictions on FDI. Quantile regressions show that profit and market share premia from being connected increase along the firm-size distribution, especially in highly regulated sectors. These patterns are partly explained by Ben Ali's relatives sorting into the most profitable sectors. The market shares of connected firms are positively correlated with exit and concentration rates in highly regulated sectors. Although causality is difficult to establish, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Ben Ali clan abused entry regulation for private gain at the expense of reduced competition.
O25|Can environmental innovation facilitate carbon emissions reduction? Evidence from China|Environmental innovation has been recognized as an efficient way of addressing environmental problems. However, how environmental innovation may affect carbon emissions in China and whether the effect may differ among various environmental innovation variables remain to be investigated. Therefore, based on the panel data of China’s 30 provinces during 2000–2013, we use a system generalized method of moments (SGMM) technique to estimate the effect of environmental innovation on carbon emissions in China. Also, we evaluate the effect on carbon emission reduction of China’s initial carbon emissions trading (CET) scheme. Empirical results indicate that, most environmental innovation measures in China reduce carbon emissions effectively. Among the various environmental innovation factors, energy efficiency exerts the most evident effect on carbon emissions abatement in China; meanwhile, resources for innovation and knowledge innovation also play prominent roles in this regard. However, the impact of governmental environmental policies on curbing carbon emissions reduction suffers from a lag effect, which mainly occurred during 2006–2013. Finally, despite the short time of operation and incomplete market mechanism, the pilot CET in China has appeared relatively promising with regard to carbon emissions reduction.
O25|The EU 2020 innovation indicator: A step forward in measuring innovation outputs and outcomes?|In October 2013, the European Commission presented a new indicator intended to capture innovation outputs and outcomes and thereby “support policy-makers in establishing new or reinforced actions to remove bottlenecks that prevent innovators from translating ideas into products and services that can be successful on the market”. This article aims to evaluate the usefulness of the new indicator against the background of the difficulties in measuring innovation outputs and outcomes. We develop a unique conceptual framework for measuring innovation outcomes that distinguishes structural change and structural upgrading as two key dimensions in both manufacturing and services. We conclude that the new indicator is biased towards a somewhat narrowly defined “high-tech” understanding of innovation outcomes. We illustrate our framework proposing a broader set of outcome indicators capturing also structural upgrading. We find that the results for the modified indicator differ substantially for a number of countries, with potentially wide-ranging consequences for innovation and industrial policies.
O25|Technology Parks versus Science Parks: Does the university make the difference?|Science and Technology Parks (STPs) has become fairly widespread through the world, although their effect on firms' innovation performance is still a very debated issue. A recent stream in the literature points to heterogeneity of tenants and of parks themselves being a key concept when assessing STPs effect on tenants' performance. An important source of STPs heterogeneity that has been disregarded so far is the degree of university involvement in these parks. At the extremes, there are parks that are owned and managed by universities, and parks with no formal links with a university. We use data from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) for Spain and a survey of STP park managers to analyse how the degree of involvement of a university in the STP is related to innovation outputs of its tenants and their links with universities. We show that higher involvement of a university in the STP is positively related to the number of patent applications, but negatively related to tenant's innovation sales. In addition, we find no robust evidence that higher involvement of a university in the STP is positively related to the propensity for park firms to cooperate with a university or to purchase external R&D services from the university.
O25|Smart Specialization policy in the EU: Relatedness, Knowledge Complexity and Regional Diversification|Smart specialization has become a hallmark of the EU's Cohesion Policy. Envisaged as a bottom-up initiative identifying local knowledge cores and associated competitive advantages, the operationalization of smart specialization has been rather limited, as a coherent set of analytical tools to guide the policy directives remains elusive. To tackle the weak underpinning of smart specialization policy, we propose a policy framework around the concepts of relatedness and knowledge complexity. We use EPO patent data to provide evidence on how EU regions develop new technologies in the period 1990-2009. We find that diversifying into more complex technologies is highly attractive but difficult for EU regions to accomplish. Regions can overcome this diversification dilemma by developing new complex technologies that build on local related capabilities. We use these findings to construct a policy framework for smart specialization that highlights the potential risks and rewards for regions of adopting competing diversification strategies. We show how potential costs of alternative strategies in regions may be assessed by making use of the relatedness concept, and how potential benefits of various smart specialization strategies can be derived from estimates of the complexity of technologies. A series of case-studies of different types of regions illustrate the utility of this policy framework.
O25|The formation and take-off of the Sao Paulo automobile-industry cluster|"""The bulk of the automotive-industry in Brazil, country which is ranked in the top-ten of world cars producer since the mid-1960s, has been concentrated around the city of São Paulo. We aim to explain the formation and growth of the São Paulo auto-industry cluster. In doing so, four explanations are used: the presence of external economies (Marshall, 1890; Porter, 1990); the capabilities of large companies, which act as regional hubs (Chandler, 1990; Markusen, 1996; Lazonick, 2010); the adoption of active industrial policies (Amsden, 1989, 2001; Chang, 2002); and the institutional environment (Bagnasco, 1977; Brusco, 1982; Becattini, 1990; Porter, 1998)."""
O25|The challenge of alignment and barriers for the design and implementation of science, technology and innovation policies for innovation systems in developing countries|This chapter aims at discussing the main challenges of designing and implementing science, technology and innovation (STI) policies in developing countries. In particular, it addresses the problems of: a) aligning STI policies with the national economic development agenda, as well as coordinating STI policies among different ministries and other public organizations, and among diverse government levels (horizontal alignment); and b) aligning rationales, objectives, instruments and specific problems of the system (vertical alignment). In addition, the main barriers for designing and implementing STI policies are examined. The chapter combines theory and concepts with examples of STI policy design and implementation in Asian and Latin American countries to illustrate the arguments. The analysis of STI policies as innovation system policies suggests that developing countries need policies that are comprehensive, evidence based, long-term and aligned.
O25|Against the odds: The evolution of the European naval shipbuilding industry|Despite a low volume of production at national levels, the European naval industry remains quite fragmented 25 years after the end of the cold war. Contrary to what might be expected from an industrial or budgetary perspective, neither cross-border consolidation nor cooperative programs have resulted in European restructuring. The sovereign nature of shipyards has led to the promotion of a domestically-centered industry transformation. Again, contrary to what might be expected, this appears to be a potentially sustainable approach due to the long-term relationship between navies and their domestic industrial partners. Even so, one can question the sustainability of the current economic model, reliant as it is on export contracts and insufficient margins to manoeuver.
O25|Organizational and Financial Modeling of Transnational Industrial Clusters Sustainable Development: Experience, Risks, Management Innovation|The article is devoted to a research of current trends and priorities of organizational and financial modeling of sustainable development. The experience of transnational industrial clusters formation and development is the object of the research. In this article authors conduct a research of the opportunities for sustainable development strategies modeling in the context of new phenomena and precedents, demonstrated by global economic system and revealing in convergence of risk events and divergence of their assessment: new phenomena, properties and characteristics of economic systems, important for the management systems modernization with the purpose to resolve problems of their theoretical and methodological support, had been analyzed; and as a result the method of system and diagnostic analysis, oriented on proactive modeling of management systems competitive performance, was proposed. The authors came to conclusion about the need to include system and diagnostic analysis in the methodological basis of social and economic systems management theory, including all forms of business entities in the industry. The stated improvement of management methodology will form instrumental and methodical apparatus of a new economic growth strategy modeling. Thus, the restructuring of the Russian economic system should be carried out considering the objective need to bring its organizational and financial model to the form of hyper-network super-system, which will enable preventive modeling and testing of the process of all sectors and clusters integration, maintaining a positive synergetic effect. As a result the authors concluded that the development of transnational industrial clusters should be conducted as a part of the adaptive stability provision concept, which is achieved by applying system and functional analysis as a methodological basis for organizational and financial modeling.
O25|Inter-industry relatedness and industrial-policy efficiency: Evidence from China’s export processing zones|In this paper, we evaluate whether the efficiency of industrial policies depends on the consistency of their focus with the local productive structure. We use sector-level data from Chinese manufacturing surveys over the 1998–2007 period to show that the efficiency of the export-promoting policies implemented in export processing zones depends on whether they target activities for which the necessary capabilities and resources are available. We find export benefits from the EPZ policy which are greater for sectors with denser links with the local productive structure. Our results suggest that industrial-policy effectiveness is magnified by pre-existing productive knowledge.
O25|Innovation policy for economic resilience: The case of Sweden|This paper provides an overview of the Swedish innovation system and the main strategies for Swedish innovation policy, with specific focus on VINNOVA’s place-based support to specialised areas integrating competences from different sectors in society. The overview reveals a recent shift from place-based specialisation to thematic areas underpinned by a societal challenge driven logic to policy intervention. The analysis indicates that a strong focus on R&D and science-driven innovation serves as a barrier for successful transition, and that the recent shift implies a greater need for policy coordination across different fields and scales. This makes agencies like VINNOVA less autonomous with regard to design as well as implementation of innovation policy and points to the need for reaching a balance between demand-oriented and supply-led strategies in which place-specific context matters and innovation policy must be attuned to and embedded in the particularities of the regional and national economies it aims to target. Linking smart specialisation strategies (S3), EU’s overall industrial and innovation policy for regional diversification and restructuring, with VINNOVAs new system innovation policy approach would be one way of doing this.
O25|Growth, Upgrading And Excess Cost In China’S Electric Power Sector|China’s electricity industry has recorded immense achievements in many areas: growth, technical upgrading and innovation, improved reliability, and universal service. This record of excellence coexists with massive inefficiency. Despite China’s multiple cost advantages, the unit cost of producing, transmitting and delivering electricity is at least 30 percent higher in China than in the United States. Latent potential for cost reduction clusters in coal-fired generation that supplies about two-thirds of total output. New reforms that deepen the influence of market forces will strengthen financial pressures and thus increase the likelihood of achieving potential cost reductions, perhaps increasing the output and share of coal-fired thermal plants.
O25|Growth Policy, Agglomeration, and (the Lack of) Competition|Industrial clusters are promoted by policy and generally viewed as good for growth and development, but both clusters and policies may also enable non-competitive behavior. This paper studies the presence of non-competitive pricing in geographic industrial clusters. We develop, validate, and apply a novel test for collusive behavior. We derive the test from the solution to a partial cartel of perfectly colluding firms in an industry. Outside of a cartel, a firm's markup depends on its market share, but in the cartel, markups across firms converge and depend instead on the total market share of the cartel. Empirically, we validate the test using plants with common owners, and then test for collusion using data from Chinese manufacturing firms (1999-2009). We find strong evidence for non-competitive pricing within a subset of industrial clusters, and we find the level of non-competitive pricing is about four times higher in Chinese special economic zones than outside those zones.
O25|Two to Tango: Public-Private Collaboration for Productive Development Policies|It takes two to tango. Strong public-private collaboration is key for discovering and implementing effective productive development policies to bring out the best in existing economic activities and to foster economic transformation. The 25 Latin American cases analyzed in this volume show how and why many public and private partners are dancing smoothly while others stumble or follow different drummers. This book is a resource for designing institutions to make public-private interaction a win-win strategy.
O25|Smart Specialisation at work: Analysis of the calls launched under ERDF Operational Programmes|The goal of this paper is to assess how and to what extent resources under Thematic Objective 1 (TO1) of national and regional Operational Programmes for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) were allocated to operations falling within the innovation and research priorities set in the respective national and regional smart specialisation strategies (S3) during the first phase of the 2014-2020 programming period. The analysis is based on information drawn from calls for proposals launched under 46 Operational Programmes in Italy, Poland, Portugal, Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania and Slovenia and published by 31 December 2016. In particular, the study assesses the coherence of calls with S3 priorities; it also looks at the concentration of resources on priorities by calculating the share of ERDF-TO1 funding made available to S3-related projects through calls. Moreover, the analysis explores the range of S3 priorities tackled by individual calls for projects, identifies the policy instruments utilised and the types of beneficiaries targeted by those instruments. The examination reveals that the S3 approach is being translated into practice from a formal point of view. In most of the examined calls, S3 alignment is a binding eligibility condition for funding. Nearly the total amount of the ERDF-TO1 resources made available through calls supports project proposals falling exclusively within S3 priority areas. This could be interpreted as positive evidence of improved prioritisation and more strategic spending patterns, yet results should be taken with caution given the relatively short time-span of the analysis.
O25|Smart Specialisation, seizing new industrial opportunities|This study offers a novel analytical approach to inform the regional search for new industrial opportunities, as promoted by smart specialisation in the EU Cohesion policy context. The analysis departs from the challenges of practicing smart specialisation and its entrepreneurial discovery process in a dynamic perspective. It argues that the adoption of a dynamic approach to identify new opportunities implies mapping regional business and innovation assets as well as, assessing their position within the global technological and industrial landscape. The study brings a case study of Lombardy region, spurring the S3 Lab initiative (in collaboration with Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Catalonia and Lapland), together with a comparative analysis of its technological profile. The empirical study combines patent data from OECD REGPAT and territorial proprietary micro-data from Lombardy region on firm creation in emerging industries (EI) â€“ new industrial sectors or existing sectors evolving into new industries (European Cluster Observatory). These industries represent a priority area for Lombardy's innovation-led development strategy. The initial observations confirm the importance of such industries in the region; they represent more than one-third of employment, almost a half of the regional value-added and feature together the majority of start-ups, suggesting the relevance of the regional strategic development choices. Also, in terms of productive advantages, Lombardy ranks high in some key EI. The mapping of technological competences through patent indicators, e.g. specialisation, diversification and ability to specialise in fast-growing and niche fields gives relevant insights on the technological potential of the region, providing further guidance for better targeted interventions.
O25|Internationalization of Indian multinational enterprises - motivations, strategies and regulation from the experience of Indian investments - a focus on Europe|This paper makes a critical assessment of Indian companies’ internationalization experience. It introduces a new theoretical framework in order to go beyond classical notion based on western companies’ global aspirations. Besides the theoretical modifications the paper provides an empirical collection about those successful Indian internationalization projects that sought to enter the European market. The question to be answered here is whether Indian firms are able to compete out dominant western companies in an increasingly multipolar world economy in the future. By applying the modified method on the question of internationalization from developing companies’ point of view, the aim of the paper is to detect future world economic trends to which Indian companies will need to accommodate themselves.
O25|Entrepreneurship, Education and the Fourth Industrial Revolution in Africa|The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is impacting on the industrialization options for Africa inter alia through three interrelated sets of technologies, namely automation, additive manufacturing and the Industrial Internet. In this paper I set out the case for why Africa should industrialize. I then explore the opportunities and threats the 4IR pose for Africa. Threats include job-losses and the re-shoring of manufacturing to advanced economies. Among the opportunities are products-as-services, the sharing (collaborative) economy, and digital services and digital exports. These are markets that are currently underdeveloped in Africa but have substantial potential given Africa's geography, demography and on-going urbanisation. In order for the continent to benefit from the 4IR more needs to be done to improve entrepreneurship and education. A number of policy recommendations for 4IRcompatible entrepreneurship and education policies are made.
O25|The Political-Economy Implications of the Transition from State-Owned to Mixed-Owned Enterprises: Evidence from the European Gas Sector|This paper analyses how the transition from State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to Mixed- Owned Enterprises (MOEs) in the European gas sector affected the European states’ ability to pursue public policy objectives. More specifically, the analysis focuses on the extent to which public and private interests can be reconciled within MOEs’ strategy. The paper suggests that the rise of profitability as the central objective for MOEs has prevented states from pursuing some, though not all, of the policy objectives that they could pursue before the transition. For example, states can no more pursue large-scale plans of economic and technological development through MOEs, or ensure consumers’ price affordability irrespective of market fluctuations. However, states may still be able to positively contribute to energy security thanks to the major shares held in MOEs, for instance by vetoing divestment from import infrastructure. The analysis suggests the need for states to devise alternative ways to pursue their objectives in the framework of national and European energy policy.
O25|Structural Transformation, Deep Downturns, and Government Policy|Most recessions are a result of some shock to the economic system, typically amplified by financial accelerators, and leading to large balance sheet effects of households and firms, which result in the effects persisting. But, over time, the balance sheets get restored. Even banks recover. But episodically, the “shock” is deeper. It is structural. Among advanced countries, the movement from agricultural to manufacturing in the last century, and the more recent movement from manufacturing to the service sector reflect such a large economic transformation. The associated downturns are longer lasting. The usual responses, in particular, monetary policy, are only of limited efficacy. Policies have to be designed to facilitate such transformations: markets on their own typically do not do well. This paper explains why such transformations are associated with persistently high unemployment, and describes the effects of particular government policies. It looks at the lessons of the Great Depression both for the advanced countries and the developing countries as they go through their structural transformations.
O25|Employment, Education and the State|The 2016 India Employment Report demolishes the myths of both `demographic dividend' and `jobless growth' in the India growth story. But it recognises that the growth of decent, productive employment is too slow even to absorb the annual increment of new workers in the workforce, let alone eliminate the huge backlog of open unemployment and low productivity underemployment. This paper argues that this challenge is a man-made problem, the consequence of a range of dysfunctional policies that have a strong anti-employment bias. Moreover, a long standing elitist bias in education policy has pre-empted the provision of quality basic education without which the bulk of the workforce cannot be suitably skilled for decent, productive employment. The paper suggests that these dysfunctional policies are attributable to a fractionalized polity and India's soft state, which stands in sharp contrast to the hard states seen in the dramatically successful East Asian model of guided capitalism.
O25|Where to get the best bang for the buck in the United Kingdom?: Industrial strategy, investment and lagging regions|The United Kingdom is preparing a modern industrial strategy to boost labour productivity across the whole country and to narrow regional gaps in living standards. This raises the question of the optimal allocation of scarce resources in meeting these targets. This study identifies industrial strengths of each region and scope to boost regional productivity through the channel of higher capital intensity. Overall regional investment ratios appear weakly linked to regional productivity, but the sectoral composition of regions and their type of investment are more important determinants. Each region has productivity leaders, but the concentration of such firms is the highest in the south of England. Differences in the representation of the most productive firms in regions are strongly related to differences in regional productivity. The empirical methodology quantifies the productivity effects of raising the capital intensity in each sector-region, focusing on viable firms falling behind the national productivity frontier in all but the finance and insurance sectors over 1995-2014. To enhance labour productivity of lagging regions, the industrial strategy should promote the catch up of firms with the national best performers in services sectors, in particular knowledge intensive services such as ICT and business services, but also wholesale and retail trade. This finding is consistent with the UK’s leading global position in high value-added services sectors. The type of investment matters: boosting research and development in the manufacturing sector in some lagging regions would also be effective in stimulating productivity. Manufacturing investment cannot be a substitute to investment in services given the small size of the manufacturing sector and its high exposure to competition from rapidly emerging global hubs. However, this study does not quantify the effects of skills, the benefits of greater industrial diversification and the positive impact that larger cities would have on agglomeration effects.
O25|Deepening regional integration within the Southern African development community|Deepening regional integration within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) will raise potential growth for all member countries. Integrated economies will increase market size, trade opportunities and improve resource allocation across member countries. Key pillars of functioning regional integration are the free circulation of goods and services, mobility of workers and interconnected infrastructure. To boost regional integration, remaining tariff barriers and non-tariffs barriers should be removed. Ensuring greater compliance to agreements by SADC members will also facilitate intra-regional trade and cross-investments. More co-operation between competition authorities should facilitate harmonisation of competition rules in particular in services and transport-related services which would ease circulation of good and services. The other key pillars of regional integration (industrial policy, infrastructure, investment, financial integration and tax) are also reviewed.
O25|Sales Range and Innovation Activity in the Industry System of Poland|In the literature, there is a discussion on the importance of the spatial distans to the user in the context innovation activity. Although, most of this kind of studies concentrate on exporting enterprises and compare them to domestic ones. Exporting activity is very important for catching-up countries, because of technology transfer in its background. The aim of this paper is to determine whether the innovative activity in Poland’s industrial system is a consequence of close interactions (local and regional), or perhaps conditioned by the imperative of functioning on the national and international market? Main hypothesis was to claim that on the current development level of Poland, the relationship between the range of sales and innovation activities are different from those in the more developed countries. Empirical studies was created in 2006-2012 as a result of the systematic collection of questionnaires filled by industry enterprises in Poland from all regions (5209 correct fulfilled questionnaires). Methodical analysis was based on the theory of probability - probit modeling, because dependent variables were binary (0 or 1). Local and regional environment is not conducive to stimulating innovation activity, but national spatial is a sufficient space, but high intensity observed only when the company has been working on the international market. It means, that the industry maturity level in Poland is good enough for creating a domestic innovation environment. This kind of an aggregation level should be stimulating by the government innovation policy.
O25|Halal Tourism Industry in Indonesia: Potential and Prospects|This study confirms that halal tourism is a tourism industry which has contributed to economic growth in Indonesia, although the world economy slows down. In Indonesia, halal tourism has long been grown in the form of a pilgrimage undertaken by people with religious motivation. Along with the development of the global Islamic economy, then this type of tourism is undergoing a metamorphosis that requires a change in modern ranging from attractions, hotels, up to marketing. The paper combines descriptive of halal tourism industry and practices of Islamic law in Indonesia. This approach found that halal tourism industry can not be separated from the religious practices of the majority of Muslims in Indonesia, but also economically contribute to the local community, and tourist sites that display the beauty and hospitality for tourists Muslims and non-Muslims. This study concludes that halal tourism has become part of the national tourism industry to position Indonesia as a center for halal tourism in the world in the future.

O25|Regional development in the context of economic reform: The case of Limassol|Regional development occurs in the larger context of national economies. Thus, the elaboration of regional economic development strategies cannot be separated from higher-level economic policy which frames and conditions opportunities and risks for regional development. As a Southern European country undergoing a process of profound structural economic reform, Cyprus provides a case for a policy context aiming towards the emergence of a new model of economic growth. Within this context, the Limassol region as one of the country’s major economic centers with a number of comparatively strong industries can serve as an example of how to promote regional development in the framework of national reform priorities such as moving the national economy closer towards a knowledge- and innovation-driven model. The present study analyses current reform priorities on the national and supra-national level, takes stock of the regional economic structure of Limassol district, and presents some preliminary ideas that could be further explored if and when a comprehensive regional economic development strategy for Limassol were to be elaborated.

Estimates of demand were elaborated with the aid of empirical instruments to gauge the price elasticity and projections of demand for broadband service. Results indicate that the eventual equalization of taxes incidence induces growth of the band penetration in Brazil, as well as generates positive effects on the aggregate of the tax revenue from satellite broadband providers.
O25|Трансакционные Издержки На Аграрном Рынке: Измерение, Регулирование, Оптимизация<BR>[Transaction costs in the agrarian market: measurement, regulation, optimization]|The monograph examines the scientific basis for the formation and management of transaction costs in the agricultural market, as well as their measurement, regulation and optimization in terms of the proportions between the transformation and transaction costs. The questions of the methodology for measuring transaction costs in agricultural organizations, the selection of the most rational chains in the sales system, and the direction of state regulation of the transaction costs of the agroindustrial complex are disclosed. The materials of the region show the dynamics of the cost component in the agrarian production of the regional agro-industrial complex. The analysis of transformation costs in the agricultural organizations of the region is carried out, costs in the sphere of production, marketing, management accounting are investigated. The information requirements of the participants of the agrarian market are considered, the classification of consumers of information is given, and information and analytical systems of the Internet are presented.The work is addressed to employees of regional government bodies, market research specialists, heads of organizations, farmers, scientists, teachers and students of agricultural universities.
O25|Разработка стратегий социально-экономического развития: наука vs идеология<BR>[Designing the Strategies for Socio-Economic Development: Science vs. Ideology]|"Strategies for socio-economic development in ""catching-up"" countries are designed on the basis of ideologies dominated in the society and, as a rule, fail. Until recently, economic science could not offer an alternative basis for designing strategies, but over the past twenty years the situation has changed. Nevertheless, scientific results are still weakly demanded by society. In this paper, the conflict between economics and dominant ideology is explored. On the one hand, ideology restrains the development of scientific research, and on the other hand it is changing under their influence. However, these changes are very slow for a number of reasons, analyzed in the paper. Ideology is inevitably connected with the interests of economic agents. The old elite prevents the emergence of a new ideology, since new concepts reveal the mistakes of past projects. In addition, the implementation of new ideas may require institutional changes that weaken the power of existing high-ranking officials. Meanwhile, in modern societies there are no regular mechanisms providing such transformations, and the probability of rational volitional decisions, which confront the dominant ideology, is small."

The European debt crisis broke the upward trend not only on the Bulgarian but also on the economies of all EU member states. On a comparative basis, the significance of the severity of the crisis for each country, the policy on gross public debt and the dynamics of economic development to overcome the crisis is assessed. The quality of institutions is seen as one of the main factors that hinder or help economic growth.
O25|Collaboration in international technology transfer: the role of knowledge boundaries and boundary objects|Firms increasingly use choose collaborative arrangements to get access to the most recent and advanced technologies instead of trying to develop them in-home. Several emerging economies use such arrangements particularly in the defence industry as a vehicle for technology transfer to the local industry. The effectiveness of technology transfer, however, is affected by many factors. This paper analyzes international technology transfer as a challenge of inter-firm collaboration and a challenge of cross-boundary knowledge management, and highlights the role of boundary objects to mitigate problems of knowledge boundaries such transfers. Building on a comparative case study of two international technology transfer projects, the paper contributes to the understanding of how collaboration problems can affect the transfer of knowledge across knowledge boundaries and how the use of appropriate boundary objects may improve collaboration management and the knowledge transfer.
O25|Religi, budaya dan ekonomi kreatif: Prospek dan pengembangan pariwisata halal di Cirebon<BR>[Religion, culture and creative economy: Prospect and development of halal tourism in Cirebon]|This article confirms that tourism activities including religious, cultural and creative centers in Cirebon are developing separately from local government policy and program implementation, but tourism development activities are getting more advanced in the city and district of Cirebon. With a trend-analysis approach, this article is based on data collected through interviews, exploration of events, news, and information from print media and electronic media, as well as documents from tourism organizers in Cirebon. This paper concludes that Cirebon positioned itself as one of the destinations for the development of halal tourism that became the centre of the tourism industry in the future.
O25|An Economic General Equilibrium Model for Evaluation of Production Support Policies in Developing Countries|This paper introduces a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model for the evaluation of production support policies in developing countries. It is a multi-sector, multi-market, multi-household model appropriate for what-if policy analysis. We describe the main aspects of the model. The model assumes small open economy, imperfect capital mobility, imperfect substitution between imported and domestic commodity, nested CES structure in production, nested CES structure in consumption, and heterogeneity of domestic products in one category. We consider transport margin, wholesale margin, import tariffs, import subsidy, production tax, value added tax, goods and services tax, and other transfer payments. We calibrate the model based on the 2001 Micro Consistent Matrix of Iran. The initial validation tests approve the validity of the model.
O25|Structural Transformation in Thailand: A Perspective Through Product Innovation|This paper examines Thailand's economic development through the perspective of structural transformation. Building on the insight that the products that a country exports tells much about the country's underlying capabilities, we study Thailand's evolving product structure both at the aggregate country level as well as at the firm level. We show that over the last 30 years, the diversification of Thailand's product structure has been impressive, with important footholds being established in many well-connected and increasingly sophisticated products. This positive overall picture, however, masks potentially serious distributional problems. The number of firms and the number of provinces that are actively engaged in and contributing materially to Thailand's product upgrading are highly concentrated. This may be limiting the gains to the economy more broadly. We confirm the importance of existing product structures at the country, regional, and firm levels for the evolution of firms' product structure over time. That is, the current basket of goods produced by firms, regions, and the country affect firms' decision over which products to introduce and which ones to drop. This path-dependent nature of product innovation has important implications for policy.
O25|Some Aspects Of Industrial Policy In Slovakia|In contrast to the fiscal and financial policy there is no precise, universally accepted definition of industrial policy. Industry influences crucially the development of each region, largely contributes to the development of the economy. The financial and economic crisis over the last decade affected the industry in Slovakia and other EU countries. Due to the fact that the Slovak Republic is a small open economy for purposes of comparison were chosen countries with small economies and a different competitiveness. Slovak Republic has the most developed automobile industry. It is necessary to ensure the competitiveness bear in mind the increasing employment, improving quality of life and reducing environmental pollution. Several results of a survey are presented, also some measures that could improve competitiveness as well as sustainable development.
O25|Productive Capacity and Economic Growth in Ethiopia|This paper examines the process of building productive capacity in Ethiopia over the past two decades and the roles played by the state, government, the private sector, foreign firms and development partners. Productive capacity is defined broadly as the natural resource potential, accumulation of human capital and the institutions that facilitate inclusive and sustainable economic growth. This process also encompasses the nurturing modern entrepreneurial skills in the private sector and fostering innovation. The paper starts with an overview of Ethiopia’s economic growth and the change in the domestic economic structure. The manufacturing sector is seen as the success of Ethiopia’s Growth, and its development to a large extent the product of an activist developmental state. The paper then examines growth and diversification of exports and the country’s recent efforts to effectively exploit its natural resources. An analysis of public and private investment and the underlying allocation of financial resources finds that a recent upturn in domestic investment has been financed largely by foreign aid, and that private financing remains too low. Finally, the paper addresses educational attainment, arguing that Ethiopia has some distance to go in its attempts to close the large human capital gap relative to other low-income countries.
O25|Applying the Growth Identification and Facilitation Framework to Nepal|This paper analyzes opportunities for growth in Nepal by applying the policy tool of New Structural Economics â€“ Growth Identification and Facilitation Framework (GIFF). Drawing on firm level surveys, stakeholder interviews, and existing datasets it aims to contribute to policy discussions in Nepal and to demonstrate the use of the GIFF for other least developed countries. The report argues that Nepal should seek to capture industrial transfer from China to establish a foothold in global value chains, create employment and catalyze structural transformation. The report identifies product-level advantages arising from preferential market access and sector-specific binding constraints, and proposes how to use Special Economic Zones to mitigate identified constraints to set Nepal on a path of structural transformation.
O25|Rentabilité et coût du capital dans le projet industriel algérien-Le cas de la Société Nationale des Véhicules Industriels (SNVI)|La restructuration des entreprises publiques en Algérie en vue de leur insertion dans un modèle d’économie de marché a nécessité depuis les années 1980 la mise en place d’un ensemble d’institutions et la transition d’un mode de régulation monopoliste vers un mode plus concurrentiel. Cependant, l’institution Etat est restée jusqu’à nos jours l’institution clé soutenant un régime d’accumulation dépendant des ressources en hydrocarbures. La politique budgétaire et financière de l’Etat a donc soutenu et financé la restructuration des entreprises publiques dans le cadre d’une nouvelle stratégie industrielle orientée vers la substitution d’importation et la diversification des exportations. La restructuration de la SNVI opérée depuis les années 1990 s’est inscrite dans une démarche globale de politique industrielle visant à assainir les entreprises publiques et refinancer les investissements productifs en vue de pouvoir soit privatiser, soit nouer des partenariats. Cette stratégie a nécessité le transfert de ressources budgétaires pour financer les investissements et assainir la dette et les découverts bancaires qui a constitué un coût du capital supporté par l’Etat. La politique de partenariat avec des investisseurs étrangers vise à poursuivre un processus de restructuration et de restauration de la compétitivité sur un marché ouvert à la concurrence mais sous régulation sous régulation de l’Etat.
O25|Global Value Chains and Structural Upgrading|Global value chains (GVCs) are increasingly seen as a part of the industrial policy toolkit as they facilitate the entry into global markets and MNEs have greater incentives to share knowledge within their production network. Making use of international input-output data for 53 countries, this paper investigates econometrically how countries’ participation in GVCs affects structural upgrading. A sizeable structural change bonus arising from increasing GVC trade is identified for emerging and transition economies. However, this bonus is not stronger for GVC trade than for trade in general. Therefore, the role of GVCs as an industrial policy tool should not be overestimated.
O25|A Delphi Approach to Boost an Open Innovation Policy|In this research paper we intend to find out whether open innovation approach may be a valid approach to the definition of innovation policy. To that, we use a method applied in various fields of study, including public policy and open innovation studies: the Delphi method. After the introduction (Section 1), we describe the Delphi method (Section 2) and the methodology used in this research (Section 3). The results of the application of the Delphi method are presented in Section 4, where we identify public policy priorities in an open innovation perspective. Then, we propose measures of public policy through which these priorities could be achieved (Section 5). Section 6 presents the main findings, concluding that the approach of open innovation may be considered for prioritization of innovation policy and policy measures.
O25|Институты Догоняющего Развития<BR>[Institutions of Catching-up Development]|"It is shown that the institutional trajectories of catching-up development in successful countries contained similar interim institutions; this similarity is explained by common technological, institutional and cultural constraints that should be taken into account and to overcome. Corporatism, indicative planning, the presence of the ""main"" development agencies with broad powers, maintaining an undervalued exchange rate - due to these and a number of other mechanisms, countries of economic miracle were able to initiate and maintain rapid growth, despite low level of human capital, underdevelopment of civic culture, and market failures. Institutes of catching-up development contributed to the formation of collaborative relationships between the government, business and society. They softened the existed constraints, and they itself were gradually modified to ensure the transition to modern democracy with effective market economy. The analysis allows to outline а plan of institutional reform , taking into account the institutional particularities of Russia. The principles of the administrative reform are considered. The problem of the formation of a hybrid national planning system is formulated, which includes indicative planning and program budgeting. To finance the planned projects, it is offered a mix of public-private partnership and project financing. It is proposed to use the Japanese experience of stimulating temporary association of companies for the development of modernization projects. The principles of reforming of the state property governance, as well as education and science sectors are discussed."
O25|Distance to the pre-industrial technological frontier and economic development|Abstract This research explores the effects of distance to the pre-industrial technological frontiers on comparative economic development in the course of human history. It establishes theoretically and empirically that distance to the frontier had a persistent non-monotonic effect on a country’s pre-industrial economic development. In particular, advancing a novel measure of the travel time to the technological frontiers, the analysis establishes a robust persistent U-shaped relation between distance to the frontier and pre-industrial economic development across countries. Moreover, it demonstrates that countries, which throughout the last two millennia were relatively more distant from these frontiers, have higher contemporary levels of innovation and entrepreneurial activity, suggesting that distance from the frontier may have fostered the emergence of a culture conducive to innovation, knowledge creation, and entrepreneurship.
O25|Икономическият Растеж В България – Алтернативи, Възможности И Политика<BR>[Economic Growth in Bulgaria – Alternatives, Opportunities and Policy]|The main achievements and problems of the change of the economic system in Bulgaria after 1989 and their impact on economic growth are analyzed. The main problem of the economic development of Bulgaria is the existence of a model of the functioning of the economy, whose main characteristic is the broad substitution of income from economic activity with the receipt of rent based on political and economic power, positions in the bureaucratic system, fraud and other non-economic factors. Public institutions do not work in the public interest but interfere with normal, market-oriented business. Defects in the functioning of the economy are caused by the way in which the change of the economic system in Bulgaria has taken place. The economy does not suffer from a lot of markets but from market failures.
O25|Investigating the Relationship of Disparity in Income, Private investment and wage rate in Indian states: A Panel Cointegration Approach|In this paper, we use enterprise level data from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) to examine the inter-relationships between per capita income, wage rate and private investment of the registered manufacturing sector across the Indian states in the years of trade and investment liberalization. The study uses cointegration and fully modified OLS estimators for a panel of 20 major states spanning the period 1993-2007. There is evidence of two long-run bidirectional relationships of per capita income with wage rate and private investment and a short-run bidirectional relationship between the per capita income and per capita private investment. The wage rate does not cause the per capita income in the short-run, and it does not cause the private investment in both the short and long run.
O25|Strategic decisions on industrialization: case of Galati Steel Works|The industrialization under a communist regime has some particularities generated by the state ownership, centralized administrative planning and, last but not least, by the communist leaders’ visions on the roles of industries. During the reign of Josef Stalin, who considered that major role in the economy had to be played by the heavy industries, in the Soviet Union there were built large industrial complexes where the former peasants were transformed in industrial workers. His successor, Nikita Khruhschev, who had a different vision on industrialization, assigned increasing roles to the consumer-oriented industries and agriculture. He promoted also the specialization among the economies of Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites. This new orientation met the opposition of Gheorghe Gheorghiu - Dej, the Romanian communist leader who initiated, since the late 1950s, a gradually emancipation from the Soviet tutelage. An episode of confrontation between the Romanian and Soviet communists on the industrial policies was the 1960 decision of building a gigantic steel mill at Galati, a town from the South – East of Romania where Gheorghiu - Dej spent his youth. Despite the De – Stalinization process launched in the Soviet Union in 1956, the Romanian communists’ initiative followed a Stalinist type of industrialization. Moreover, when the Soviet Government proposed, in the spirit of the division of labor within the socialist camp promoted by Khruhschev, that the new plant should transform in steel the pig iron produced by their industrial complexes, Romanian communists viewed this plan as a threat to the country’s economic development and they rejected it. This paper explores some circumstances of the decision on building of the new steel mill which dramatically changed the economic and social profile of Galati.
O25|Growing Pains of Industrial Renewal – Case Nordic Cleantech|Abstract To steer economies onto a sustainable path in a way that is compatible with the urgent priorities of economic developers, sustainability needs to come with new business opportunities, growing markets and, most importantly, new jobs. The big question becomes then how do you wed economic growth with sustainability? Enter the growth of cleantech and the emergence of green industries. Recent rankings place Finland in the top-3 of global leaders in cleantech, along with Israel and the US. Driven by an ambition to selectively invest in a ‘green’ economic turnaround, a number of strategy-level research documents and roadmaps have been produced in recent years on how to kindle new growth and create jobs in the Finnish CleanTech- and the Bio-economies. The three industry ecosystems frequently mentioned are efficient energy solutions (smart grid), mobility-as-a-service (smart mobility), and the bioeconomy. The ultimate questions to be answered are: In which industry ecosystems does Finland have the necessary assets to be an effective competitive contender? And given the existing asset base, what is the true potential of these sectors as engines of economic growth? To rise to the challenge, the report probes (a) the structure and direction of industrial activity that underlie the selected ecosystems, (b) the value capture potential of individual companies in them, and (c) the types of financing the companies are most compatible with. The results are somewhat sobering. They clearly show that for business and economic development purposes the only feasible approach to Cleantech is to deal with it by the ecosystem. The three ecosystems analyzed in this study all feature different industrial structures, make vastly different value propositions, address different markets and involve a very different set of stakeholders. There is little value in cursorily lumping them together under a quasi-common concept such as Cleantech or the Bioeconomy. These concepts have no substance as they do not refer to specific industrial or economic activity. Hence, it is also very challenging to develop concrete instruments for economic or business development purposes that are to promote such activity. At worst, scarce resources are put to suboptimal use, as they are allocated over a vast spread of individual companies and projects that might be a fit with the overall theme of Cleantech but have no common denominator in the form of an industrial ecosystem and its underlying value chains. Our results on a next to non-existent Bioeconomy provide for an excellent showcase. We further show that even the more promising ecosystems such as Smart Mobility and Smart Grids are in the throes of growing pains. There is much that economic developers can do efficiently to alleviate them. The poor leverageability of industry assets and connections for market access across the board speak of fragile, budding industry structures that make it difficult for companies to establish robust markets and steady businesses in the short term. Companies of different sizes suffer the symptoms in their own ways. On the one hand, large incumbents do wield the assets necessary to conquer the ecosystem – telecommunications operators seem to have an especially favorable vantage point in smart ecosystems – but shoot themselves in the foot by applying conventional, capital-intensive business models that leave the door open for more agile growth companies that harness the potential of digitalization to exploit opportunities. On the other, start-ups and SMEs indeed show the drive and lean on nimble enough business models but utterly lack the assets for a full-scale conquest. It is easy to envision a symbiotic relationship, in which incumbents provide the capital-intensive assets while their smaller peers introduce the competitive business models. Given the incipient structure of the ecosystems, however, just finding appropriate partners can incur considerable transaction costs. Here economic developers can step in, helping to find matches via collaborative accelerators that broker partnerships between industrial heavy-hitters on a mission of industrial renewal and small growth companies looking for resources and downstream assets. Finding partners is a formidable challenge in and by itself, but our conclusions point to even more systemic impediments to industrial renewal that lie outside the industry’s sphere of influence. One such is the lack of proper standards for the interconnectivity and interoperability of the various, often proprietary, IT systems that the numerous stakeholders to ecosystems run their businesses on. Especially smart ecosystems by definition build on the seamless interoperability across diverse system architectures and organizational boundaries. In the absence of universal standards, interconnectivity needs to be established one relationship at a time, building on contractually agreed, customized solutions that do not scale beyond the specific relationship. Economic developers can considerably speed up the construction of a digital business environment by introducing universal standards that promote the emergence of plug-and-play platforms for efficient interoperability. In a world of autonomous, self-driving vehicles and applications that affect offtake and feed into electricity grids, quality and safety controls for algorithms that govern these systems will be paramount for individual and societal safety.
O25|Indiaâ€™s Possible Response to the Challenge of the Mega-regionals|The mega-regional trade agreements, particularly the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, and the Trade in Services Agreement, represent a new phenomenon for the global trading system. As major preferential trade agreements that involve the worldâ€™s largest economies (the United States and the European Union), they cover a large share of global trade and, thus, generate large spillover effects on non-parties to the negotiations. Further, the ambitious rule-making agenda shifts the locus of global rule-making and standard-setting from the inclusive World Trade Organization to the small number of participants in these negotiations. These rules and standards will shape markets and, thus, amplify the direct effect of discriminatory preferences. This article discusses the factors driving the mega-regionals, considers the significance of these negotiations for excluded parties, and suggests how India, in particular, might respond.
O25|What can Uzbekistan tell us about industrial policy that we did not already know|This paper discusses Uzbekistan’s recent experience with structural shifts and industrial policy and the larger implications for existing theories of industrial policy. The paper has a particular focus on various industry policy instruments. Two major hypotheses are discussed: (1) the hypothesis of Haussmann, Hwang and Rodrik (the more technologically sophisticated the export structure, the better for growth) and (2) the hypothesis of Justin Yifu Lin (export specialization should build on existing comparative advantages and not jump over the necessary technological stages).
O25|The Effectiveness of Industrial Policy in Developing Countries: Causal Evidence from Ethiopian Manufacturing Firms|Prioritizing the growth of particular sectors or regions is often part of LDC growth strategies. We study a prototypical example of such policies in Ethiopia, exploiting geographic and sectoral variation in the form and scale of the policy for identification. Using product-level data on Ethiopian manufacturing firms we show that the policy was unsuccessful: There was no improvement in productivity, productive assets, or employment. The policy failed due to its negative effects on productivity of the entry of new firms and existing firms diversifying. Moreover, subsidised loans and tax-breaks led to an increase in capital but not in machinery.
O25|Industrial policy and exchange rate skepticism|The aim of the present paper is to put in historical perspective the development thinking on the relationship between industrial and exchange rate policies. The first section focuses on the thought of the so-called pioneers of development economics, specifically their preference for protectionism and their belated recognition that an exchange-rate policy could act as a substitute to it. In the second one, we analyze the exchange rate skepticism that arises out of the theories that identify a foreign constraint to growth, in addition to the one revealed by the pioneers. The third section briefly complements the previous discussion with reference to macroeconomic formulations that allow for short-run contractionary effects of a devaluation, reinforcing the skepticism in question. In the fourth section, we discuss the revival of development thinking in the 1980s and its discussion about East Asian trajectories, a literature that placed great emphasis on industrial policy. Finally, in the fifth section we discuss the new historical facts and the new development macroeconomics’ models that are putting an end to exchange rate skepticism.
O25|The impact of doing business regulations on investments in ICT|Abstract Using industry-level data from 14 OECD countries and doing business indicators of the World Bank, we analyze how country-level regulations of business activities affect investments in information and communication technologies (ICT). We find that investments in ICT decrease with the costs of starting and operating a business and registering property. Investments increase with the strength of legal rights. We also find that investments in software increase with the ability of shareholders to sue managers for misconduct, and investments in communication technologies decline with the extent of director liability for self-dealing.
O25|Industrial policy and the future of manufacturing|Abstract The paper aims at reconstructing the industrial policy debate by focusing on a number of theoretical issues, in particular the contested nature of industrial policy—its selectivity—also in relation to manufacturing and the different rationales for industrial policy making. The paper concludes by looking ahead into the future of manufacturing and focuses on the need for rethinking our understanding of global production and emerging technologies for increased prosperity.
O25|Job creation and trade in manufactures: industry-level analysis across countries|This paper examines industry-level responses of manufacturing employment in the context of globalization using a large sample of developed, developing, and transition economies. We find that developing countries need atypically high rates of value-added growth (about 10 %) to increase manufacturing employment appreciably (about 4 %). The employment benefits of export orientation are also modest even in “comparative advantage” industries of developing countries. However, diversifying the export basket contributes significantly to employment growth, particularly in the medium- and high-technology industries. Import competition does not undermine employment growth in low-technology industries of developing countries while it displaces jobs in the same industries in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and transition economies. For developing countries, import-induced job losses are higher in the more capital-intensive medium-technology industries. Jobs in high-technology industries are less sensitive to imports with positive relationships observed in the OECD. Investment also complements job creation in low-technology industries of developing countries that have yet to industrialize. JEL codes: J21, L60, O14, O25 Copyright Shiferaw and Hailu. 2016

O25|Research diversification and impact: the case of national nanoscience development|Abstract Newcomer nations, promoted by developmental states, have poured resources into nanotechnology development, and have dramatically increased their nanoscience research influence, as measured by research citation. Some achieved these gains by producing significantly higher impact papers rather than by simply producing more papers. Those nations gaining the most in relative strength did not build specializations in particular subfields, but instead diversified their nanotechnology research portfolios and emulated the global research mix. We show this using a panel dataset covering the nanotechnology research output of 63 countries over 12 years. The inverse relationship between research specialization and impact is robust to several ways of measuring both variables, the introduction of controls for country identity, the volume of nanoscience research output (a proxy for a country’s scientific capability) and home-country bias in citation, and various attempts to reweight and split the samples of countries and journals involved. The results are consistent with scientific advancement by newcomer nations being better accomplished through diversification than specialization.
O25|What bangs for your bucks? Assessing the design and impact of transformative policy|After an era of generic support for economic development and innovation, narrowly targeted transformation policy is back on the table. Recent advances in the fields of new industrial policy and transition thinking converge on the idea that achieving structural change requires governments to take an active role in overcoming inertia. Rather than just leveraging R&D investments and setting framework conditions, policy makers are urged to participate in the development of socio-economic systems around particular technologies. Associated policy support typically involves a diverse portfolio of system-specific interventions. The emergence of transformative policy, in this paper characterized by being selective, process-oriented and multi-instrumental, poses severe challenges to rising standards of public accountability. Evaluation methods for calculating the ‘bang for the buck’ of R&D-leveraging measures are ill-suited when policy mixes are supposed to enact economic transformation. We argue that, in order to see if aptly chosen policy design is bringing about actual change, assessments should gauge policy contributions to building up technological innovation systems (TIS). The TIS-literature provides a concrete but untapped basis for tracking how policy efforts affect conditions favoring the creation and diffusion of new economic activities. This premise leads us to introduce a scheme for structuring analyses concerned with (the links between) the organization, orientation and aggregate impact of transformative policy. We test it in a tentative assessment of the Dutch ‘Topsector approach’. Besides facilitating continuous policy learning, our assessment scheme also serves to strengthen policy maker’s ability to legitimize the adoption of heterodox economic approaches.
O25|Productive capacity and trade in the Solomon Islands|Economic growth, environmental sustainability and human development in the Solomon Islands have lagged much of the Pacific region since independence in 1978. Trade contributes insufficiently to development, partly because of the dominance of the logging industry but also due to the lack of emphasis on building productive capacities with a view to economic transformation toward higher productivity activities. Targeted soft industrial policies may help address these shortcomings, in the form of sectoral prioritisation; linkages policies; joint government-donor support to build appropriate infrastructure; and the development of human resources in specific areas. Government institutional capacity will only be allowed to improve if policymakers are permitted true ownership over policies and if they are allowed to make mistakes.
O25|Applying the Growth Identification and Facilitation Framework to the Least Developed Countries: The Case of Uganda|This paper aims to draw insights from New Structural Economics by applying its practical policy tool – the Growth Identification and Facilitation Framework (GIFF) – to least-developed countries (LDCs) with a special focus on the case of Uganda. The GIFF offers practical development paths for enabling developing countries to follow comparative advantage in its industrial development and to tap into the potential of advantages of backwardness in industrial upgrading in an effort to achieve sustained and dynamic growth. After a brief introduction of the GIFF, we present an overview of Uganda’s recent economic and social performance and analyses Uganda’s factor endowments, i.e., land (or natural resources), labour and capital that can be used in the production process. After identifying tradable goods and services which would fit Uganda’s latent comparative advantage, we diagnose sector-specific binding constraints in starting and scaling up the selected subsectors and discuss how to remove or mitigate these key constraints. Finally, we conclude with main findings and policy recommendations. The take-home message is that developing countries should not focus on what they lack but what they have when formulating their development strategies.
O25|The determinanths of industrialisation in developing countries, 1960-2005|Industrialisation is generally considered a synonym of economic development. This paper contributes to the literature on the engine of growth hypothesis with an empirical analysis of the determinants of industrialisation. The paper goes back to the Cornwall (1977) model of manufacturing as an engine of growth and estimates the first equation of the model, i.e. the equation of manufacturing output growth. Hausman and Taylor models are estimated for a sample of 74 countries for the period 1960-2005. The results indicate that industrialisation is faster for larger countries with an undeveloped industrial base, strong export performance, and undervalued exchange rates. Skills and knowledge accumulation played an increasingly important role since the mid-1990s. Robustness checks corroborate the validity of these findings.
O25|Competitiveness and industrial policy: from rationalities of failure towards the ability to evolve|This article elaborates a dynamic rationale of industrial policy, focusing on how to strengthen the socio-economic system’s ability to evolve, i.e. how to achieve high real income together with qualitative change. It highlights that the ubiquitous rationalities of failure, be it of markets, governments or systems, are rooted in a peculiar habit of accepting hypothetical perfect states as normative benchmarks. In contrast, a dynamic logic of intervention should start from the question, what the system aims to accomplish. Combining the structuralist ontology of micro-, meso- and macro with the functional principles of evolutionary change, the paper proposes a general typology of economic policies based on their respective contributions to the system’s ability to evolve.
O25|Does having the right visitor mix do the job? Applying an econometric shift-share model to regional tourism developments|Abstract This paper is the first to apply an econometric shift-share model to tourism. The approach allows us to isolate the growth contributions of changes in regional touristic attractiveness from those induced by the structure of visitors, but does not share the caveats of the conventional shift-share approach. Our application to regional tourism in Austria reveals important results: First, differences in long-run performance between regions are mostly related to idiosyncratic changes in the tourist appeal of individual regions rather than a result of more or less favorable structures of visitors. Second, none of several mega-events during the period observed seem to have left prolonged positive effects on the tourist performance of the host regions. And third, performance appears uncorrelated with tourism intensity of a region. Thus, from a policy and destination management perspective, tourism authorities and local suppliers should mainly focus on upgrading the permanent destination attractiveness rather than investing too much effort into landing mega-events or targeting the visitor mix toward promising source markets.
O25|Relationship between value chain governance and value chain integration (as an outcome of a public private partnership to promote value chain competiveness at the regional level). The case of the value chain cotton/textile/clothing in Tolima (Colombia)|Relationship between value chain governance and value chain integration (as an outcome of a public private partnership to promote value chain competiveness at the regional level). The case of the rice value chain in Tolima (Colombia) Alexander BlandÃ³n LÃ³pez PhD. Lecturer Universidad del Tolima Janeth GonzÃ¡lez Rubio MA Lecturer Universidad del Tolima This paper focuses on the study of the relationship between value chain governance and value chain integration (as an outcome of a public private partnership to promote value chain competiveness at the regional level). The study expands and disaggregates Gereffi's Global Commodity Chain framework and applies some of its analytical categories (input output structure and governance amongst others) to the study of regional value chains. The governance structure embodies the 'authority and power relations that determine how financial, material, and human resources are allocated and flow within the chain' (Gereffi 1994: 97). In this sense, the concept relates to the 'power relations in the chain and the institutions which mould and wield this power' (Kaplinsky and Morris 2000). There is a directed network form of coordination of the rice value chain. Historically there had been developed systems of formal and informal agreements between producers and rice threshing entrepreneurs on subjects such as payments, rice varieties and quantities. Other forms of coordination such as support strategies for rice producers, supply of packing inputs, financing and technical assistance have also been developed (Corpoica 2000: 54). These practices provided a basic common ground for the discussion and signing of the competitiveness agreement as an instrument of coordination for the value chain rice threshing in Tolima (Colombia). From a governance point of view, it can be stated that a domestic oligopsony of an agricultural raw material protected by the national government reduces the likelihood of success for the expected developmental outcomes of a competitiveness agreement. A domestic market protected from imports introduces as a main contention point between agro-producers and industrialists in a competitiveness agreement the issue of price determination. At the end, the government has to arbitrate. Finally, a competitiveness agreement embodies for a regional government a potential instrument for social and economic policy interventions. First, governments can participate in this scheme, having in mind the promotion of social policies (employment generation and smallholder income improvements), particularly in depressed areas with a tradition or a potential for raw material production. Second, competitiveness agreements offer to the public sector a scope of action to deal with regional economic restructuring processes and to promote endogenous development policies with active involvement and contribution of several regional stakeholders Blandon, L.A (2012) Economic restructuring and value chains.

O25|Economic issues of innovation clusters-based industrial policy : a critical overview|"Criticisms vis-à-vis cluster policy are numerous, often confusing and really unhelpful; while some authors systematically question the merits, others on the contrary play a genuine role of counsel in his favour. This paper attempts to refocus the debate and analyses the economic issues, impacts and implications of the innovation clusters policy. To do this, we take a critical view of the literature on clusters, focusing on analysis of the effects of three industrial dynamics in perpetual movement within clusters, especially research and development, industrial location and technology cooperation. We assume that innovation cluster ""potentiates"", by a synergistic action, the beneficial effect of each of these three industrial dynamics in favour of localised firms. However, it appears from the analysis that the hopes and expectations invested in cluster policy must be reconsidered and relativised. So the reasons for the rising power of cluster policies must be sought elsewhere than in a necessarily consensual and tangible evidence of positive impacts of clusters."
O25|Ethiopia's high growth and its challenges: Causes and prospects|"The paper analyses the enigmatic high growth in Ethiopia from 2004 to 2015 (10.9% p.a.) and gauges the prospects for the future. In 2000, Ethiopia was the poorest country on the globe in per capita GDP - a mere 124 USD in current prices. The main finding is that the take-off was driven by heterodox monetary and fiscal policy which targeted public expenditure for infrastructure. This triggered an increase in domestic demand, reinforced by strongly rising terms of trade under buoyant growth of the global economy until 2008. The combination of favourable factors induced strong productivity leaps mainly in agriculture and lifted millions of smallholder peasants at least partially out of subsistence economy toward participation in markets. Aggressive expansionary macroeconomic policies triggered bulging fixed investment, much beyond a narrow public expenditure boom. Despite two heavy inflation episodes, inflation and the emerging high current account deficit seem under control in 2016. The main downside of the strategy followed by Ethiopian authorities is the unabated appreciation of the real effective exchange rate and the unclear consequences of the past commodity price boom. Tolerated high inflation, mainly due to commodity hikes on the world markets, was not sufficiently offset by nominal depreciation. Despite the stellar achievements in poverty reduction and other developmental goals, the strategy incorporated in the ""Growth and Transformation Plan"" (GTP) does not sufficiently address the failure of industrialisation, focused on manufacturing. Ethiopia has the third lowest rank in manufacturing as a share of GDP in the group of low-income countries, reaching only half of the average in this group. Without a surge in industrialisation the country is unlikely to find an escalator toward a middle-income economy by 2025 as envisioned in GTP II. This would require a turnaround to direct industrial policy (beyond establishing ""industrial parks"") and real undervaluation of the currency, which would require a change in monetary policy. A possible alternative route for the medium term could be to further postpone massive industrialisation and correction of the exchange rate and focus intensively on full eradication of poverty and malnutrition. This could unleash productivity gains in agriculture with vast positive external effects. The strategy switch to industrialisation would then come after this phase. We leave the choice of options open in this paper. The prospects of continued very high growth in GTP II seem over-optimistic in face of the slowdown of commodity prices and problems of industrialisation. But good development is not necessarily growth maximisation."
O25|Heterogeneous Entrepreneurs, Government Quality and Optimal Industrial Policy|This paper presents a theoretical model exploring the effects of industrial policy (IP) when entrepreneurs are characterized by different ability levels and sectors are heterogeneous as for their profitability and social externalities generated. The optimal structure of IP in terms of monetary transfers is shown to crucially depend on the distribution of entrepreneurs abilities. Moreover, we find that IP increases aggregate welfare under very general conditions, also in the presence of Government failures. In an extension of the model, we consider the case in which the Government can use also the provision of business training to entrepreneurs as an additional instrument of IP. Based on these results, policy implication for industrial policy in developing countries are discussed.
O25|Industry Vietnam 2005-2014: Status, Issues and Development Orientation|Although with a low starting point, Vietnam’s industry has achieved positive results with the average growth rate of over 10% per year, a positive contribution to the economic- social development in Vietnam. However, from 2010 to now, the average growth rate of industrial output value has declined. In fact, growth of industry that bases on outsourcing (outputs of manufacturing based on mainly inputs from foreign markets) has lasted for many years. This has clearly revealed the inefficiency and lack of sustainability of the domestic industry. Vietnam's industry is currently characterized by the industries belong to first generation, including industrial products that using more labor, unskilled labor and the products of industry that base on outsourcing). The imbalance in industrial structure of Vietnam is one of the problems noted in the recent years. This is reflected in the lack of supporting industries to manufacture capital goods and industries have high scientific content. In addition, development of industries still has spread over country, lack of key industries to make tower cranes for the development of whole industry. Therefore, in order to become a developed industrial country with over 80 million inhabitants, Vietnam’s industry require to have an accelerated development strategy and reasonable implement policy.
O25|Technical Change, Non-Tariff Barriers, and the Development of the Italian Locomotive Industry, 1850–1913|"This paper examines the dynamics of technical change in the Italian locomotive industry in the period 1850-1913. From an historical point of view, this industry presents a major point of interest: it was one of the few relatively sophisticated ""high-tech"" sectors in which Italy, a latecomer country, was able to set foot firmly before 1913. Using technical data on the performance of different vintages of locomotives, we construct a new industry-level index of technical change. Our reassessment reveals the critical role played by non-tariff barriers for the emergence and consolidation of national manufacturers in this field.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
O25|Dynamique technologique et politique régionale d’innovation : l’apport de l’analyse statistique des réseaux|A policy of structural change in regions has been initiated by the European Commission through the innovation policy. Smart specialization has emerged as a key concept raising some theoretical and methodological issues. In this paper, statistical analysis of networks is used to characterize evolutionary trends in the techno-industrial potential of a region and to study its consequences in terms of public innovation policy. The statistical analysis of networks characterizes the structure of interactions between agents and can be used to follow the development of these connections and dissemination of technologies. The data used are those of publicly funded technological innovation projects submitted in the Franche-Comté region from 2007 to 2012. JEL Codes: O38, O25

O25|Una Nota sobre la Evolución de la Tasa de Protección Efectiva y la Tasa de Protección Nominal en Colombia (2002 – 2014)|El presente documento tiene como objetivo evaluar el impacto de la política arancelaria en la estructura de protección de 137 ramas industriales, 59 productos agrícolas y 10 productos pecuarios en Colombia para el periodo 2002 y 2014. El análisis se realiza a partir de la Matriz Insumo – Producto del Departamento Nacional de Planeación (2014) y el arancel ponderado por tiempo propuesto por Nieto (2015). Los resultados obtenidos muestran que la Tasa de Protección Efectiva (TPE) y Tasa de Protección Nominal (TPN) tuvieron una tendencia decreciente para el sector industrial a partir de 2009, año a partir del cual Colombia no tuvo la obligación de cumplir con el Arancel Externo Común (AEC) de la Comunidad Andina de Naciones (CAN). En los sectores agrícola y pecuario ambos indicadores mantienen o registran una tendencia creciente.
O25|El reto del crecimiento económico en México: industrias manufactureras y política industrial|El artículo se enfoca en un problema estructural de la economía mexicana: el bajo crecimiento económico. Se argumenta que las industrias manufactureras son el motor del crecimiento económico. En este sentido, se supone que una de las principales causas del bajo crecimiento en México es la insuficiencia dinámica de las manufacturas. Para verificar lo anterior, se usaron series de tiempo trimestrales de 1982 a 2015, de la producción manufacturera, no manufacturera y total, con las cuales se probó estacionariedad y cointegración y se aplicó un test de causalidad de Granger. Se encontró que la serie de producción manufacturera es causa estadística de la producción no manufacturera y total, lo cual es consistente con el marco teórico sectorial-estructural usado como referencia. Con base en los resultados, el artículo discute la actual política económica y sugiere mejoras, particularmente tener un enfoque más activo en relación con la promoción del desarrollo de la producción manufacturera, para asegurar que la economía se dinamice y entre en un círculo virtuoso de causación acumulativa.******The article focuses on a structural problem of the Mexican economy: low economic growth. It is argued that the manufacturing industries are the engine of economic growth. In this sense, it is assumed that one of them maincauses of low growth in Mexico is the insufficient dynamic of the manufacturers. To verify the above, the authors used quarterly time series from 1982 to 2015, of the manufacturing output, non-manufacturing output, and total, through which they then proved stationarity and co-integration. They also applied a Granger causality test. The authors found that the manufacturing output series is a statistical effect of the non-manufacturing output and total, which is consistent with the sectorial-structural theoretical framework used as reference. Based on the results, the article discusses the current economic policy and recommends improvements, particularly in terms of procuring a more active focus in relation to promoting the development of the manufacturing output, to help the economy become more dynamic and enter a virtuous circle of cumulative causation.
O25|Una nota sobre la evolución de la estructura arancelaria de Colombia 2002-2014|El presente documento tiene como objetivo presentar un panorama general sobre el desarrollo de la política arancelaria entre 2002 y 2014. Para ello, se revisó la evolución del Arancel Externo Común (AEC) de la Comunidad Andina de Naciones (CAN) y de las modificaciones normativas recomendadas por el Comité de Asuntos Aduaneros, Arancelarios y de Comercio Exterior. Se concluye que desde el momento en el que Colombia no tuvo la obligación de cumplir con el AEC, el Gobierno nacional pudo realizar una política arancelaria más activa. Además, mediante el cálculo del Arancel Nominal Ponderado por Tiempo, que capta las modificaciones normativas realizadas durante cada año, se muestra que el arancel nominal promedio anual ha tenido tendencia decreciente desde 2008 y que se ubicó en un nivel promedio de 6% en 2014. Finalmente, el inventario de modificaciones normativas elaborado muestra que el arancel nominal es un instrumento de política comercial de vital importancia, ya que permite al Gobierno nacional enfrentar cambios en la dinámica de crecimiento del país.
O25|Does firm ownership structure matter? Evidence from sugar mills in India|This paper examines the effect of firm ownership structure on firm behavior and the economic outcomes of upstream suppliers by comparing privately owned sugar mills to cooperatives and public mills in India. In this setting, government support for cooperative and public mills allows meaningful variation in ownership structure to be observed, while the “command area” zoning system – whereby mills are given monopsony power to operate within an assigned area – helps tackle the identification challenge. The borders of command areas allow for a geographic regression discontinuity design, where underlying soil, weather, and institutional characteristics are exactly the same but ownership structure changes across boundaries. Using satellite images overlaid on digital maps to measure sugarcane grown along the borders, as well as a survey to determine the effects of crop choices on farmer welfare, I find that private mills encourage sugarcane production. Greater cane cultivation is tied to better credit provided by private mills, and it results in higher income and consumption for farmers.
O25|Stages of diversification in Africa|This paper investigates the relationship between manufacturing diversification and level of economic development for 29 African countries. Three diversification stages are identified. Considerable differences in diversification are found over the first stage at the low end of the per capita income scale. Diversification alone will not encourage development in poorer countries until obstacles such as weak institutions, poor governance and a lack of infrastructure are addressed. Diversification slows down over the remaining stages as countries develop. Results show countries further along the African economic development path successfully diversified manufacturing.
O25|Regional business climate and interstate manufacturing relocation decisions|In this study, we use the National Establishment Time Series (NETS) database to study relocation by manufacturers based on differences in the business climate between the origin and destination states. We model interstate relocations for manufacturers in aggregate and for three subgroups characterized by their industry-level research and development (R&D) intensity. The analysis suggests that very few manufacturing firms relocate across state lines in any given year and the vast majority of those that do are small in size and move to adjoining states. Our results also reveal that interstate migration by manufacturing establishments varies with their R&D intensity. Whereas a number of factors considered in this study are statistically significant, marginal effects at the mean are infinitesimal. This implies that states attempting to encourage manufacturing firms to relocate from other states via traditional perspectives on business climate are unlikely to be successful.
O25|Technology foresight and industrial strategy|When Technology Foresight (TF) began to be adopted in industrial countries, it tended to be still somewhat a marginal activity in developing countries. Today globalization radically transformed the range of economic activities that developing countries can perform. Production is fragmented and organized along global value chains. Dense flows of knowledge and technology are available, but need to be fully employed in the framework of coherent industrial strategies.
O25|Potential and partnerships in innovations in EU-funded research projects|We analyse the relationship between the composition of innovation partnerships and the potential of their innovations developed within EU-funded research projects under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7), the European Union's Research and Innovation funding programme for 2007-2013. Innovation potential is assessed using a formal framework capturing three different dimensions: innovation readiness, management and market potential. Both the analysed innovations and innovators were identified by external experts during periodic Framework Programme reviews. Thus, our population includes participants in the FP7 projects that are considered as key organisations in the project delivering innovations in FP7 projects. We show that the innovative potential of research output of homogenous partnerships, e.g. between two SMEs or two large companies, is likely to be higher, as compared to heterogeneous partnerships, e.g. an SME and a large company. The impact of universities on the potential of innovations is unclear. The total number of key organizations in delivering an innovation has a negative impact on its potential. Neither project funding nor duration affects the potential of innovation. Our results contribute to the discussion on the most appropriate design of R&D consortia of organizations in publically-funded projects.
O25|Industrial cluster policy and transaction networks: Evidence from firm-level data in Japan|Cluster policy is designed to facilitate inter-firm networking. We examine industrial clusters in Japan based on firm-level transaction data. Firms in clusters expand transaction networks at a higher speed, but significantly only with firms in the agglomerated core Tokyo, not with local firms within the same region. We confirm the robustness by regional historical background as instruments. By disaggregating firms by their main bank types, we find that cluster firms expanding networks are mainly financed by regional banks, not by banks with nation-wide operations. This suggests the importance of intensive relationship with the main banks for inter-firm network formation.
O25|Smart Specialization, diversificazione correlata e resilienza regionale: note a margine di un dibattito|Il concetto di ‘diversificazione correlata’ rappresenta un fattore di successo della Smart Specialization Strategy. Mentre l’impatto della related variety sulla performance economica regionale e d’impresa è stato ampiamente studiato, l’analisi del suo ruolo sulla capacità di una regione di adattarsi a shock esogeni - capacità di resilienza - non sembra aver attratto particolare attenzione. Questo lavoro analizza la relazione tra diversificazione correlata e resilienza regionale a livello dei 686 Sistemi Locali del Lavoro italiani. Dall’analisi emerge una relazione positiva tra related variety e resilienza: sistemi locali caratterizzati da una maggiore related variety sembrano aver mostrato una maggiore capacità di adattamento alla crisi.
O25|Innovation, Competition and Technical Efficiency| Contradictory empirical and theoretical evidence on the relationship between innovation and competition has been reconciled in a model that yields an inverted U-shaped curve. I test whether the predictions of the model are supported by the data with an unbalanced panel of firms for 1990-2003 in a high productivity growth, high-tech industry, Finnish ICT manufacturing. In particular, I investigate how well alternative, yet rigorous measures of innovation and the technology gap, such as R&D intensity, R&D elasticity, technical change, technical efficiency and total factor productivity fare with respect to competition measured by the Lerner index. The results prove sensitive to the choice of variable. Overall, the model is not supported by the empirical evidence of the industry.
O25|State Capacity and Public Goods: Institutional Change, Human Capital, and Growth in Early Modern Germany|What are the origins and consequences of the state as a provider of public goods? We study legal reforms that established mass public education and increased state capacity in German cities during the 1500s. These fundamental changes in public goods provision occurred where ideological competition during the Protestant Reformation interacted with popular politics at the local level. We document that cities that formalized public goods provision in the 1500s began differentially producing and attracting upper tail human capital and grew to be significantly larger in the long-run. We study plague outbreaks in a narrow time period as exogenous shocks to local politics and find support for a causal interpretation of the relationship between public goods institutions, human capital, and growth. More broadly, we provide evidence on the origins of state capacity directly targeting welfare improvement.

O25|Heterogeneous Entrepreneurs, Government Quality and Optimal Industrial Policy|This paper presents a theoretical model exploring the effects of industrial policy (IP) when entrepreneurs are characterized by different ability levels and sectors are heterogeneous as for their profitability and social externalities generated. The optimal structure of IP in terms of monetary transfers is shown to crucially depend on the distribution of entrepreneurs abilities. Moreover, we find that IP increases aggregate welfare under very general conditions, also in the presence of Government failures. In an extension of the model, we consider the case in which the Government can use also the provision of business training to entrepreneurs as an additional instrument of IP. Based on these results, policy implication for industrial policy in developing countries are discussed.
O25|Lock-in of mature innovation systems, The transformation toward clean concrete in the Netherlands|Energy-intensive processing industries like the concrete industry form the base of the economy and account for a large part of greenhouse gas emissions. Sectoral transformation to cleaner basic materials is therefore crucial, and institutional pressure to do so is increasing. These sectors have nevertheless been largely omitted by socio-technical studies. This paper therefore sets out to analyze the systemic problems that inhibit the transformation of the mature innovation system of the concrete sector toward the development, diffusion and adoption of clean concrete innovations, for the case of the Netherlands. A coupled structural-functional approach has been frequently applied to identify such systemic problems, but has been limited to emerging technological innovation systems. Consequently, the approach tends to overlook the systemic lock-in that arises from interdependent systemic problems and vested interests that characterize mature innovation systems. This paper analyzes these characteristics to extend the application of the structural-functional approach to the transformation of mature innovation systems. Interviews with 28 stakeholders were conducted and triangulated with reports, websites and other documents. A list of systemic problems was identified that originate within actors, institutions, networks, technology and infrastructure and that impaired the performance of all system functions except knowledge development. Systemic problems are indeed found to be strongly interdependent, leading to systemic lock-in. Through strategic, often collective action, established firms with vested interests were able to reinforce these systemic problems to inhibit clean concrete innovation. The study concludes that systemic lock-in inhibits the sustainability transformation of the mature innovation system of concrete in the Netherlands and confirms that the application of the structural-functional approach can be extended from emerging to mature innovation systems.
O25|Foresight Applications to the Analysis of Global Value Chains|The objective of this paper is to analyse the scope for improving the empirical and methodological foundation of global value chains (GVCs) research and for making relevant political decisions, primarily through applying Foresight methodology. The authors review the major trends of global value chains’ development, specific features of Russia’s participation in them, and the necessary steps to increase the quality and efficiency of this participation, in particular in the changing geopolitical context. Special attention was paid to the theoretical, methodological, and empirical aspects of GVC research which are far from adequate (we primarily mean international databases such as TiVA and WIOD developed with the participation of the OECD and the WTO): they need to be supplemented with advanced tools to improve their forecasting potential, as well as their practical and strategic orientation. To this end, approaches which would make it possible to research the interconnections between global processes and trends with regional and national innovation-based development tendencies become of crucial importance. Application of Foresight methodology may significantly contribute to researching the GVC phenomenon, being a major logical step towards creating advanced research and policy tools to mobilise available resources and coordinate stakeholders’ actions to increase global competitiveness. The paper presents several case studies which describe the practical application of Foresight methodology to analyse Russian participation in various GVCs, giving examples of specific product and service groups. The authors conclude that both full-scale Foresight studies and specific components thereof could be applied for the purposes of GVC analysis, strategic planning, and political decision making.
O25|The Main Vectors of Cross-Border Development in the CIS Industrial and Economic Space: Convergence, Potential, Cross-Country Gaps|The main goal of the study is to identify the scope and trends in the manufacturing development of Russia and other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the context of integration effectiveness, industrial policies quality and competitiveness growth. Under current unfavorable conditions – the fall in world oil prices, devaluation of national currencies, and reduction of business activity due to uncertainty of future strategies – the essential issue is whether the favorable integration possibilities of the past periods of intensive rise in 2005-2008 and 2010-2012 in the national economies development in the CIS region to build competitive potential for reindustrialization were fully realized. The analyzed period 2005-2014 is presented by the authors as a reference period of economic dynamics, covering for Russia and the CIS countries a full business cycle from the beginning of one deep recession (2008-2009) until another recession (2014).The research object is manufacturing sectors in Russia and other CIS countries. The study results show that in the analyzed period, large-scale industrialization has not occurred in these countries, largely due to the lack of the national economies structural transformations. The impressive manufacturing growth in a number of smaller CIS countries has not led to those countries’ participation in the highly competitive international processes. By the end of the analyzed period, the need for diversification of the national economies and exports and implementation of balanced economic policies only intensified. These policies should support both structural reforms and demand and be aimed to increase productivity, eliminate barriers of the manufacturing development and enable foreign markets access.
O25|Public Policy For Venture Capital: A Comparative Study Of Emirates, Saudi Arabia And Egypt|This study presents an integrated public policy framework for supporting the emergence of a venture capital industry, from both supply and demand perspectives. The framework is applied to the case of venture capital evolution in three Arab countries, namely United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. In each country case study, five public policy mechanisms are analyzed using both primary and secondary information. Comparative analysis of the country case studies shows that the three countries have made varying levels of progress on company registration procedures and development of an entrepreneurial ecosystem. More work is needed to simplify bankruptcy and other regulatory obstacles to venture capital funds, such as the limited partnership structure and the use of convertible stock. The three countries have limited venture capital supply from a few government and private venture capital funds, primarily due to demand side weaknesses and a meager flow of investible enterprises. Strengthening the demand side should form the primary focus of government reforms in the near future, in addition to demonstrating successful and profitable venture capital investment. The latter is a key step in putting together the pre-conditions for the emergence of active venture capital industries in the three countries

O25|Economic reforms and industrial policy in a panel of Chinese cities|Abstract We study the effect of place-based industrial policy on economic development, focusing on the establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in China. We use data from a panel of Chinese (prefecture-level) cities from 1988 to 2010. Our difference-in-difference estimation exploits the variation in the establishment of SEZ across time and space. We find that the establishment of a state-level SEZ is associated with an increase in the level of GDP of about 20 %. This finding is confirmed with alternative specifications and in a sub-sample of inland provinces, where the selection of cities to host the zones was based on administrative criteria. The main channel is a positive effect on physical capital accumulation, although SEZ also have a positive effect on total factor productivity and human capital investments. We also investigate whether there are spillover effects of SEZ on neighboring regions or cities further away. We find positive and often significant spillover effects.
O25|The nature of innovation in emerging industries in China: an exploratory study|Abstract In China, traditional manufacturing industries have been world leaders in low-cost manufacturing for overseas multinationals. It is well-known that these “traditional industries” depend on overseas parent firms for innovation. In recent decades, China’s desire is to encourage and promote innovation-based emerging industries within its borders. By definition, “emerging industries” are composed of domestic Chinese firms without an overseas parent firm. We know very little about the innovation practices in these emerging Chinese industries; we hypothesize that the innovation practices in these firms are quite different from traditional Chinese industries with overseas parents. The Kunshan region in China has attracted both traditional and emerging industries that have contributed to unparalleled economic growth in the region. This is a significantly large region with a population of 1.65 million with a regional GDP of USD 32 billion (2010). In this study, we use survey data from companies in this thriving region to compare R&D and innovation practices of the firms in the traditional and emerging industries in this region. We do not know enough about the innovation practices of emerging industrial firms in China, who may have a profound influence on the industrial China of the future much like South Korean firms such as KIA, Hyundai, Samsung, etc. The findings of this exploratory study based on data collected from the Kunshan region enables us to recommend avenues for future research.
O25|Industrial Cluster Policy and Transaction Networks: Evidence from firm-level data in Japan|Cluster policy is designed to facilitate inter-firm networking. We examine industrial clusters in Japan based on firm-level transaction data. Firms in clusters expand transaction networks at higher speeds, but do so significantly only with firms agglomerated in Tokyo and not with local firms within the same region. By disaggregating firms according to their main bank types, we find that cluster firms expanding networks are mainly financed by regional banks and not by banks with nationwide operations. This suggests the importance of intensive relationships with main banks for inter-firm network formation.
O25|Does government promote or hinder capital accumulation? Evidence from Japan' s high-growth era|Governments occasionally intervene in private sector economic activities to promote specific industries and enhance economic growth. During Japan's high-growth era, the government used various policy tools to intervene in private sector capital investments. We examine the effects of these policy tools on capital accumulation. We employ firm-level data sets, identify policy actions using historical records and find that they were applied intensively to specific sectors and firms and that government intervention partially affected those firms f capital investment decisions. For some industries, such as steel, chemicals and textiles, investment-promoting policy tools resulted in accelerating capital investments or relatively higher resource allocations of capital to labour. There were also cases in which policy actions aimed at curbing investments resulted in slower investments or lower allocations of capital to labour, but the effects were weak and small. Discouraging policy tools had contradictory effects on some industries and enhanced capital investments. The latter phenomenon was observed when the government attempted to control private sector capital investments based on the current share of production or production capacities.
O25|Controlling SO2 emissions in China: A panel data analysis of the 11th Five-Year Plan|We investigate the impact of policy measures to reduce SO2 emissions during 11th Five-Year Plan of China (2006-2010). By using a provincial-level panel data set, we find that installation of the flue-gas desulfurization equipment and closure of small coal- fired power plants contributed to a statistically significant reduction in SO2 emissions. While estimation results suggest that these two policy measures played an important role in reducing SO 2 emissions in China during this period, the size of the estimated coefficients shows that the effects might have been weaker than those predicted by ex-ante cost-benefit analysis.
O25|Az újraiparosodás térbeli kérdőjelei Magyarországon<BR>[Territorial questions of reindustrialization in Hungary]|"Az elmúlt két és fél évtizedben a hazai feldolgozóipar szervesen integrálódott a globális gazdaságba, egyre nagyobb teret nyert a külföldi működőtőke, megjelentek a modern iparágak, és jelentőssé vált az export. Ez a folyamat megtorpant 2008-ban, a válság generálta új kihívásokra adott gazdaságpolitikai válaszok között pedig megjelent az ""újraiparosítás"" fogalma. Tanulmányunkban azt vizsgáljuk, hogy a válság mélypontját követően, 2009 és 2014 között megfigyelhető-e újraiparosodás Magyarországon. Ha igen, akkor melyik térségben és iparágban, továbbá adottak-e a feltételek az újraiparosodás felgyorsításához? Vizsgálatainkból kiderül, hogy 2009-et követően az újraiparosodás csak néhány vidéki térségben érhető tetten, ott is csupán egy-két iparágban, míg például a fővárosban és vonzáskörzetében, valamint a nagy kutatóegyetemekkel rendelkező várostérségekben inkább az ""ipartalanodás"" bontakozik ki. A kevésbé fejlett kisvárosi térségek újraiparosodása lassú folyamat, amit helyalapú, alulról szerveződő, integrált gazdaságfejlesztéssel lehetne hatékonyabbá tenni.

O25|Lessons from Enterprise Reforms in China and Vietnam|This paper surveys a few key features of SOE reforms in China and Vietnam, focusing particularly on the evolution of ownership structures and on the relative weight of market regulatory mechanisms, and discusses their general implications for socialist development. It tentatively concludes that some broad principles informing and constraining any feasible socialist-oriented economic strategy can indeed be identified.
O25|The Effectiveness of Industrial Policy in Developing Countries: Causal Evidence from Ethiopian Manufacturing Firms|Prioritizing the growth of particular sectors or regions is often part of LDC growth strategies. We study a prototypical example of such policies in Ethiopia, exploiting geographic and sectoral variation in the form and scale of the policy for identification. Using product-level data on Ethiopian manufacturing firms we show that the policy was unsuccessful: There was no improvement in productivity, productive assets, or employment. The policy failed due to its negative effects on productivity of the entry of new firms and existing firms diversifying. Moreover, subsidised loans and tax-breaks led to an increase in capital but not in machinery.

Analisi testuale della comunicazione dei poli di innovazione|"There is an increasing attention on the needs to support SMEs in enhancing their innovation op-portunities and capabilities. Through a policy measure to foster the regional innovation system, 12 innovation poles were active in Tuscany in the period 2011-2014 to provide to their members (af-filiation is needed) a range of knowledge-intensive services such as knowledge and technology mapping, R&D partnership formation, technical assistance in R&D projects, technology transfer. Each pole was created as a consortium of organizations operating as public or private research cen-tres and service centres (universities, innovation centres or technology transfer centres and firms).

O25|The Russian government approach to import substitution planning in industry|The article examines the conditions and results of the organization process of import substitution in the Russian industry. The approaches to forecasting, development of import substitution plans, realization of projects are described and proved. The key feature of the planning process is described: it is based not on traditional action plans and road maps but on the potential projects list. The product-project approach is proposed for forming long-term strategic planning documents.
O25|Organizational-Managerial Approaches in the Realization of Industrial Enterprises’ Innovational Process|The article presents an overview of the wide variety of organizational and managerial approaches that can be employed for the realization of innovations. The author studies the innovation process as an uninterrupted cycle that begins with the original idea which, after a situational analysis, goes through planning, programming, specific actions for realization and making decisions for future actions. Taking the existing risks and the complexity of innovational decisions into account, specific approaches are offered that can be used for solving some typical classes of problems and goals.
O25|"Competitive Exhibitions and the Branding of Regional Agricultural Products : the Case of ""Aomori"" and ""Tsugaru"" Apples in Modern Japan"|The Japanese government, after making inspection tours of western countries, designed policies for industrial promotion. One of them was staging nationwide competitive exhibitions, and this project started in 1877. The purpose of this study is to clarify how these exhibitions became a springboard for the branding of regional agricultural products, especially apples, during the 1870s to the 1900s. We obtained the following results. Naikoku-kangyo-hakurankai, the largest national exhibition and a model for other exhibitions in modern Japan, served as a contested arena, not only for individual exhibitors, but also for group exhibitors representing a prefecture. Therefore, if one group representing a prefecture was recognized as the leading and trustworthy grower of an agricultural product in the exhibition, that prefecture fs sales of the product were superior to those of other prefectures in the market. This could lead to a situation wherein all farmers engaged in the cultivation of the agricultural product in the prefecture gain economic benefits. Therefore, in some prefectures, both public and private sectors worked together to organize a delegation under the leadership of local magnates, aiming to win many awards in the exhibition. The case of Aomori prefecture, especially which of Tsugaru area, is a representative one. In the 1870s, when the government started to organize exhibitions, many new varieties of fruit, including over a hundred kinds of apples, were introduced from western countries under the government fs initiative. Among these, the Japanese of the time preferred the sweet, red, and shiny ones. In fact, such consumer tastes were reflected as the criteria for grading apples in exhibitions. In response to this trend, the leading growers of apples in Aomori prefecture promptly undertook of the investigation not only of a cultivation method reflecting consumer tastes and the evaluation criterion, but also of an effective and extensive distribution system for their apples. They shared their knowledge with other farmers in the same region. In addition, they organized their own local exhibitions as a practice run for Naikoku-kangyo-hakurankai. These proactive steps evolved into the formation of a system that enabled apple farmers in the Aomori prefecture to increase the quality of their apples supportively and competitively. Through this process, they surpassed the leading producers at the time, such as Hokkaido and Iwate, grew into major production area of apples, and succeeded in the branding of gAomori h and gTsugaru h apples. This could not have been achieved without the existence of competitive exhibitions.
O25|Health Insurance Coverage and Firm Performance: Evidence Using Firm Level Data from Vietnam|In literature, there is limited direct evidence regarding the effect of health insurance coverage on firm performance and worker productivity. We study the impacts of health insurance on medium- and large-scale domestic private firms’ performance and productivity in Vietnam, using a large firm level census dataset. We find statistically, but suggestive, positive health insurance effects on both aggregate profit and profit per worker for both complying and non-complying firms when using the full sample. We further restrict the sample to specific industries. The positive health insurance effects could exist for both complying and non-complying firms in the heavy manufacturing and construction sector, while such positive effects could be only significant for complying firms in the wholesale/retail sectors. We could not find any evidence of positive health insurance effects in the light manufacturing sector. These results imply that the impacts of health insurance could be industry specific.
O25|Soft budget constraints and regional industrial policy: reinterpreting the rise and fall of DeLorean|The rise and fall of DeLorean Motor Cars Limited has traditionally been interpreted as either the result either of John DeLorean’s psychological flaws or as confirming the supposed limitations of activist industrial policy. However when the episode is examined in greater historical detail, neither of these interpretations is compelling. The reinterpretation outlined here draws on institutional analysis as well as a range of archival sources, much of it previously unreleased. The inefficiencies within the original contractual agreement are highlighted. The lack of credibility associated with this agreement was in turn traceable to the institutional environment (with its associated risk–reward implications) under which industrial policy operated. This environment had a political element: it had been distorted by the Troubles and the resulting fears policymakers had of a cumulative causation relationship between violence and unemployment. Officials in Belfast, against Treasury opposition, advocated state-led entrepreneurship as a policy response.
O25|Which firms benefit more from being located in a Science and Technology Park? Empirical evidence for Spain|The aim of this work is to analyse the heterogeneous effect of Science and Technology Parks (STPs) on firms’ innovation outcomes, contingent on firms’ size and innovation effort. Despite the worldwide diffusion of STPs and the increasing literature aimed at analysing their effect on tenants’ performance, empirical evidence on the heterogeneous effect of STPs' location on different firms is very scarce. We use information for a representative sample of 39,722 Spanish firms, 653 of them located on 22 of the 25 official Spanish STP. Results show, on the one hand, that firm size is negatively related to an STP location effect and, on the other, that only a small amount of internal innovation effort is required to achieve a very high return from park location. However, firms without innovation efforts do not benefit from a park location. Finally, as internal innovation efforts increase, the park effect reduces, but is still at a high level.
O25|Industrial Policy and Competition|Using a comprehensive dataset of all medium and large enterprises in China between 1998 and 2007, we show that industrial policies allocated to competitive sectors or that foster competition in a sector increase productivity growth. We measure competition using the Lerner Index and include as industrial policies subsidies tax holidays, loans, and tariffs. Measures to foster competition include policies that are more dispersed across firms in a sector or measures that encourage younger and more productive enterprises.

O25|The Rise and Decline of General Laws of Capitalism|Thomas Piketty's (2013) book, Capital in the 21st Century , follows in the tradition of the great classical economists, like Marx and Ricardo, in formulating general laws of capitalism to diagnose and predict the dynamics of inequality. We argue that general economic laws are unhelpful as a guide to understanding the past or predicting the future because they ignore the central role of political and economic institutions, as well as the endogenous evolution of technology, in shaping the distribution of resources in society. We use regression evidence to show that the main economic force emphasized in Piketty's book, the gap between the interest rate and the growth rate, does not appear to explain historical patterns of inequality (especially, the share of income accruing to the upper tail of the distribution). We then use the histories of inequality of South Africa and Sweden to illustrate that inequality dynamics cannot be understood without embedding economic factors in the context of economic and political institutions, and also that the focus on the share of top incomes can give a misleading characterization of the true nature of inequality.
O25|The Agricultural Product Space: Prospects for South Africa| South Africa’s sluggish economic growth and limited structural transformation are at the core of the country’s high levels of unemployment and poverty. Why some countries are able to grow and others not has been the subject of much academic debate, with recent literature exploring the relationship between growth and a country’s productive structure. Although the magnitude of the role of agriculture in economic development is contentious within the context of an upper middle-income country, like South Africa, the sector has unmistakably a contribution to make in the much needed transformation and growth process. Therefore, this study analyses the structure of the agro-complex through the application of the ‘product space’ framework. This methodology investigates the product-level relatedness within the sector and arrives at a structure of an agricultural product space network. This structure allows potential diversification pathways to be identified which can form the basis of transformation within South Africa’s agro-complex.
O25|New Lessons from an Old Strategy: Import Substitution, Productivity and Competitiveness|This paper examines the relation between import substitution, labour productivity and industrial competitiveness. More specifically this paper tests if the import substitution enhances both labour productivity and competitiveness in Korean and Turkish manufacturing industries. The data used in the analysis are obtained from UNIDO Industrial Demand Supply (2013) and UNIDO Industrial Statistics (2013) databases and cover the period of 1981-2001. Our results show that Turkish economy has really left import substitution after 1980. However, we found significant share of import substitution in total production in professional and scientific equipment, transportation equipment, electrical machinery, miscellaneous petroleum products, industrial chemicals industries and petroleum refineries in Korea especially in the 1990s. The results based on unbalanced dynamic panel data estimations showed that import substitution did not enhance labour productivity in manufacturing industry of both Korea and Turkey. However, we found that import substitution affects industrial competitiveness positively in both Korea and Turkey. Apart from the positive impact of import substitution on competitive-ness, we also found in this study that while Korean manufacturing industry competitiveness is closely associated with labour productivity, competitiveness of Turkish manufacturing industry depends on the factors such as exchange rates, wage differentials rather than labour productivity.
O25|Powering Africa: Facing the Financing and Reform Challenges|Africa faces chronic power problems, including insufficient generation capacity, low connectivity, poor reliability and high costs, all of which constrain development. Power capacity additions in Sub-Saharan Africa (excl. SA) since the 1990?s were minuscule. Historically, investments in the power sector in Africa have come mostly from governments or public utilities (with foreign aid support). In recent years these sources of funding have been flat. The fastest new sources of funding are from Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and from China. To understand the determinant of the new sources, the paper analyses the effect of several key factor and find non-expected results, such as there is no obvious correlation between unbundling, or the presence of an independent regulator, and the level of private investment through IPPs; or that there is no correlation between Chinese investment in generation and resource rich countries (dispelling the myth that Chinese firms are only interested in Africa?s resources). The paper delivers several recommendations that indicate that more attention needs to be given to issues related to planning, procurement and contracting as well as securing revenue flows.

O25|International technology transfer and domesticinnovation: evidence from the high-speed rail sector inChina|How does the transfer of advanced technology spur innovation in developing countries? This paper exploits the large-scale introduction of high-speed railway (HSR) technology into China in 2004 as a natural experiment to address this question. The experiment is unique in the sense that this wave of technology transfer is large, abrupt and arguably exogenous in timing, covering a variety of technology classes and a large number of geographically-dispersed railway-related firms. With detailed information on the types of technology transferred and the identities of the receiving firms, as well as their product market specializations, we are able to depict a clear picture of how foreign technology is digested and spurs follow up innovation in and out of directly receiving firms. Our findings suggest that technology transfer leads to significant growth in HSR-related patents in cities with direct receivers of imported technology after 2004 in a triple-difference estimation. We also observe sizable spill overs to firms that are not directly related to the railway industry. Technology similarity plays an important role in technology diffusion, but we do not observe any significant impacts of geographic proximity. Previous university research strength in relevant fields is also conducive to stronger technology spill overs.
O25|Modeling Software Piracy Protection: Monopoly versus Duopoly|The economic analyses of software piracy typically rely on the simplifying assumption that the product is o¤ered by a single producer. We argue that a realistic description of the software market and associated economic aspects of software piracy might be also captured by studying competition between software developers. Using an illegal version of software violates intellectual property rights (IPR) and, due to public protection (such as copyrights), is punishable when discovered. If a developer nonetheless considers the level of piracy to be high, he may introduce his own private protection. The focus of our analysis is on the interaction between public and private IPR protection in the two market structures under considerations. We show that, unlike in cases of monopolies, there is no conflict of interest between the regulator and producers in duopoly setup. Moreover, unlike in a monopoly, the optimal public IPR protection in duopoly does not affect the developers' choice of software quality.

La progression des échanges extérieurs du pays continue à être plus rapide que celle du commerce international, mais ses ressorts sont différents de ceux qui prévalaient avant la crise globale. La participation de l'économie chinoise aux chaînes mondiales de production, à travers les activités de processing, n'est plus le moteur principal de ses performances commerciales. Le nouveau moteur des échanges réside dans le commerce ordinaire émanant d'une offre fondée principalement sur les intrants locaux, et d'une demande intérieure chinoise.
O25|Diferencias en la evolución de la productividad regional en la industria colombiana: un análisis sectorial a partir de fronteras estocásticas de producción time varying: 1992-2010|Este artículo analiza las diferencias en la evolución de la productividad industrial entre sectores y regiones de la industria colombiana en las últimas dos décadas, a partir de la eficiencia técnica predicha vía estimación de fronteras estocásticas de producción time varying. Los resultados evidencian una alta heterogeneidad individual, con un fortalecimiento industrial de las principales ciudades y una profundización en el rezago del resto. El análisis de descomposición de varianza de la eficiencia técnica identificó una correlación positiva entre cambios en la eficiencia promedio y ganancias por reasignación de recursos, más fuerte a nivel regional. La dinámica temporal en la reasignación de recursos ha estado liderada por procesos de profundización en la especialización sectorial, y de concentración regional y sectorial de la actividad económica. Se confirma la importancia de definir estrategias con base en sectores
O25|Una nota sobre la evolución de la estructura arancelaria de Colombia 2002 – 2014|El presente documento tiene como objetivo presentar un panorama general sobre el desarrollo de la política arancelaria entre 2002 y 2014. Para ello, se revisó la evolución del Arancel Externo Común (AEC) de la Comunidad Andina de Naciones (CAN) y de las modificaciones normativas recomendadas por el Comité de Asuntos Aduaneros, Arancelarios y de Comercio Exterior. Se concluye que desde el momento en el que Colombia no tuvo la obligación de cumplir con el AEC, el Gobierno nacional pudo realizar una política arancelaria más activa. Además, mediante el cálculo del arancel nominal ponderado por tiempo, que captura las modificaciones normativas realizadas durante cada año, se muestra que el arancel nominal promedio anual ha tenido tendencia decreciente desde el 2008 y que se ubicó en un nivel promedio de 6% en el año 2014. Finalmente, el inventario de modificaciones normativas elaborado muestra que el arancel nominal es un instrumento de política comercial de vital importancia, ya que permite al Gobierno nacional enfrentar cambios en la dinámica de crecimiento del país.
O25|Productividad y competitividad del Sistema de Ciudades|Este estudio caracteriza el Sistema de Ciudades de Colombia desde el punto de vista de la productividad y la competitividad, y analiza los factores que inciden en ellos con el fin de proponer estrategias y políticas para fortalecerlos. Se encuentra que las diferencias en la productividad por hora trabajada son las que explican en mayor grado las diferencias en el PIB per cápita entre las trece principales áreas metropolitanas. A su vez, las diferencias en productividad están positivamente asociadas con la densidad empresarial formal, el tamaño promedio de los establecimientos formales, el capital humano y la presencia de clústers de alta productividad. Con base en estos resultados se discuten políticas transversales y verticales que permitan la consolidación de un Sistema de Ciudades en Colombia a través de un aumento sustancial de la productividad de sus centros urbanos.
