M30|Advertising, innovation and economic growth|This paper analyzes the implications of advertising for firm dynamics and economic growth through its interaction with R&D investment at the firm level. We develop a model of endogenous growth with firm heterogeneity that incorporates advertising decisions. We calibrate the model to match several empirical regularities across firm size using U.S. data. Through a novel interaction between R&D and advertising, our model provides microfoundations for the empirically observed negative relationship between both firm R&D intensity and growth, and firm size. Our model predicts substitutability between R&D and advertising at the firm level. Lower advertising costs are associated with lower R&D investment and slower economic growth. We provide empirical evidence supporting substitution between R&D and advertising using exogenous changes in the tax treatment of R&D expenditures across U.S. states. Finally, we find that R&D subsidies are more effective under an economy that includes advertising relative to one with no advertising.
M30|Promise, Trust and Betrayal: Costs of Breaching an Implicit Contract|We study the cost of breaching an implicit contract in a goods market, building on a recent study that documented the presence of such a contract in the Coca-Cola market, in the US, during 1886‒1959. The implicit contract promised a serving of Coca-Cola of a constant quality (the “real thing”), and of a constant quantity (6.5oz in a bottle or from the fountain), at a constant nominal price of 5¢. We offer two types of evidence. First, we document a case that occurred in 1930, where the Coca-Cola Company chose to incur a permanently higher marginal cost of production, instead of a one-time increase in the fixed cost, to prevent a quality adjustment of Coca-Cola, which would be considered a breach of the implicit contract. Second, we explore the consequences of the Company’s 1985 decision to replace the original Coke with the “New Coke.” Using the model of Exit, Voice, and Loyalty (Hirschman 1970), we argue that the unprecedented public outcry that followed the New Coke’s introduction, was a response to the Company’s breaching of the implicit contract. We document the direct and quantifiable costs of this implicit contract breach, and demonstrate that the indirect, although unquantifiable, costs in terms of lost customer goodwill were substantial.
M30|If You Think 9-Ending Prices Are Low,Think Again|9-ending prices are a dominant feature of many retail settings, which according to the existing literature, is because consumers perceive them as being relatively low. Are 9-ending prices really lower than comparable non 9-ending prices? Surprisingly, the empirical evidence on this question is scarce. We use 8 years of weekly scanner price data with over 98 million price observations to document four findings. First, at the category level, 9-ending prices are usually higher, on average, than non 9-ending prices. Second, at the product level, in most cases, 9-ending prices are, on average, higher than prices with other endings. Third, sale prices are more likely to be non-9 ending than the corresponding regular prices. Fourth, among sale prices, 9-ending prices are often lower, on average, than comparable non 9-ending prices. The first three findings imply that although consumers may associate 9-ending prices with low prices, the data indicates otherwise. The fourth finding offers a possible explanation for this misperception. Retailers may be using 9-ending prices to draw consumers’ attention to particularly large price cuts during sales, which perhaps conditions the shoppers to associate 9-ending prices with low prices.
M30|Peer effects in product adoption|We study the nature of peer effects in the market for new cell phones. Our analysis builds on de-identified data from Facebook that combine information on social networks with information on users’ cell phone models. To identify peer effects, we use variation in friends’ new phone acquisitions resulting from random phone losses and carrier-specific contract terms. A new phone purchase by a friend has a substantial positive and long-term effect on an individual’s own demand for phones of the same brand, most of which is concentrated on the particular model purchased by the friend. We provide evidence that social learning contributes substantially to the observed peer effects. While peer effects increase the overall demand for cell phones, a friend’s purchase of a new phone of a particular brand can reduce individuals’ own demand for phones from competing brands—in particular those running on a different operating system. We discuss the implications of these findings for the nature of firm competition. We also find that stronger peer effects are exerted by more price-sensitive individuals. This positive correlation suggests that the elasticity of aggregate demand is substantially larger than the elasticity of individual demand. Through this channel, peer effects reduce firms’ markups and, in many models, contribute to higher consumer surplus and more efficient resource allocation.
M30|Cooperation in the climate commons|This paper surveys the existing empirical evidence on the scope for cooperation in the climate commons and on the effectiveness of possible interventions to spur it. Given the global public good properties of climate change mitigation, mitigation efforts have to rely on the willingness of individuals to contribute voluntarily to this public good, by reducing the demand on the environmental commons either in the form of ‘green’ consumer behaviour or through the acceptance of costly climate policy. Both are likely to be necessary. The authors survey evidence that suggests a central role for local social norms in the provision of global public goods. They discuss the importance of the visibility of norms and the role of beliefs when such visibility is lacking, concluding that some actors may behave as conditional cooperators when confronted with global dilemmas, similarly to what takes place in the local commons.

M30|The Effect of Product, Service, and Customer Satisfaction on Word-of-Mouth Behavior|Objective - Banks are financial intermediaries which are vital to support the economy of a country. Banks can be interpreted as the financial institutions whose activities are collecting funds from the community, distributing the funds back to the community, and providing other banking services. The development and improvement of service quality from the banks should be the center of public attention. This is because of the tight competition in terms of quality of the services, products, and marketing strategies undertaken by the banks. In an environment of tight competition, the top priorities of service companies such as banks are customer satisfaction and excellent service quality in order to improve customer loyalty and word-of-mouth behavior. This research aims to study, analyze, and explore the effect of product, service, and customer satisfaction on word-of-mouth (WOM) behavior at PT Bank Jakarta. Methodology/Technique - The models used in this research is a descriptive and associative model using SPSS 19. This study uses a simple random sampling technique with a total sample of 80 people. The research instrument used as a measuring tool in this study is a questionnaire consisting of 40 statements. Findings & Novelty - The result of this research show that product (X1), service (X2), and customer satisfaction (X3) simultaneously affect word-of-mouth behavior (Y). The results conclude that PT Bank Windu Kentjana International Tbk Jakarta should improve the quality of its products and services delivered to its customers and prospective customers in order to build their loyalty and improve their word-of-mouth.
M30|The Impact of Market Orientation and Dynamic Marketing Capability on the Marketing Performance of 'Make-To- Order' SMEs|Objective - Literature suggest that companies should focus their Market Orientation (MO) on good marketing and business performance. However, previous research in this area deals mostly with large companies. The objective of this research is to study the significance of MO for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with the specific production strategy of Make-To-Order.Methodology/Technique - The sample of this study is 111 Indonesia SMEs. The descriptive research design is supported by exploratory research. The structural model is analysed using the Structural Equation Modelling approach with LISREL 8.8 and SPSS 16.00.Finding - The result shows that MO does not have a significant impact on Marketing Performance. In the context of MTO, SMEs do not need to have a high Market Orientation to have satisfactory performance. It is more important for them to take care of the relationship with their principal companies. Government regulations, such as raw material regulations, also have an impact on SMEs performance. It is recommended that future research explore the types of capabilities of SMEs relating with the era of Industry 4.0. Other strategic orientations, such as production orientation, could be considered as factors in future research. Type of Paper - Empirical.
M30|How to Manage Customer Satisfaction through Brand Association and Perceived Value Strategy|Objective - The purpose of this study is to identify which factor has a stronger influence on customer satisfaction: perceived value or brand association. By understanding the influencer, the seller understands what policies and implications should be addressed to maintain and even enhance customer loyalty.Methodology/Technique - This empirical study uses a quantitative method and employs a PLS program to ensure a correlation between the constructs. Finding - The study concludes that brand association is a crucial determinant factor in customer satisfaction. Brand associations influence satisfaction relatively more than perceived value does. From the customer perspective, brand associations are affected more by salesman personality than brand image. Type of Paper - Empirical.
M30|The Influence of Online Review on Consumers' Purchase Intention|Objective - The development of cafe businesses in Indonesia has recently increased, making the level of competition become tighter. This is what makes cafe business able to maintain the loyalty of the customer, due to consumers' tending to try new things or places. In this context, research was conducted to determine the impact of online reviews on a review website platform on consumer purchase intention in choosing the first visited cafe. Methodology/Technique - The customer's decision-making is affected by various factors such as review platforms, other customer reviews, and property characteristics as well as the customer's profile itself. Previous research models have become a reference for this study, and this study was conducted by collecting data from questionnaires that were distributed using an online survey. Finding - This study identified six features of online review content and one source attribute, namely timeliness, reviewer expertise, usefulness, volume, positive online reviews, negative online reviews, and comprehensiveness. Regression analysis was used to examine the impact of these attributes on consumer purchase intention. Novelty – The results of the regression analysis showed significant relationships among variables like usefulness, volume, timeliness, positive online reviews, negative online reviews, and comprehensiveness, along with property characteristics on consumer's purchase intention. Type of Paper - Empirical.

Novelty – The present research is expected to clarify the potential research topics in the field of Thai tourism development. Type of Paper - Empirical.
M30|A step-by-step approach to social marketing in energy transition|By examining social marketing this articles has featured a step-by step approach for residential behavioural change towards sustainable energy transition. Specifically, this article considers the value-based approach instead of rational information campaigns for behavioural change of energy users. The proposed framework is based on environmental values and designed to transform the selected destructive behaviour into a sustainable one. The framework consist of five steps: (1) selecting the behaviour, (2) user orientation, (3) exchange, (4) marketing mix: elements of intervention, (5) measuring behaviour change. As behavioural change is the final goal of any energy efficiency campaign, it becomes also a starting point and an objective of the rest of the activities in the framework. Second, we suggest using the user orientation concept that divides the society into three groups based on their attitude towards environmental issues, i.e. environmentalist, the environmentally concerned and the disinterested. In the third step we apply the exchange theory; whereas in the step of â€˜marketing mixâ€™ a conceptual combination of six elements for energy transition is reasoned: proposition, cost, communication, communities and partnership. Finally, the fifth step stresses on the measurement of the behavioural change that enables energy transition. The proposed step-by step framework is based on theory and builded on current practice in a field that is analysed in the article.
M30|Encouraging appropriation: immersion as a strategy to enhance the online video, watching experience appraisal|"To set up successful experiences, academics and managers need to identify and promote the ""positive"" experiential trajectories that lead to the enjoyable experiences such as flow states, presence, or immersion, and limit ""negative"" processes such as hedonic adaptation (HA) (Carù & Cova, 2007; Hoffman & Novak, 2009). Hedonic adaptation is psychological mechanism that occurs following prolonged exposure to a stimulus (Alba & Williams, 2013; Bao & Lyubomirsky, 2012). This process is often inferred, or measured with physiological apparatus like galvanic skin response (GSR) (Brechman, Bellman, Robinson, Rask, & Varan, 2016) but to our knowledge there is currently no measurement scale for hedonic adaptation despite its importance, most of the papers remain conceptual only. In this article, we distinguish between two types of digital contents: (a) contents with a narrative structure (ie: presence of storytelling like films), and (b) contents with non-a narrative structure (ie: rhetorical and information based, like documentaries). The literature suggests that both these contents can be negatively affected by the hedonic adaptation (HA). In this paper, we first propose a conceptualization for this concept and demonstrate through two empirical studies the reliable psychometric properties of the new developed (HA) measurement instrument. In the second part of this paper, we demonstrate that consumers prefer longer contents with a narrative structure (ie: based on storytelling), and shorter ones when they are rhetorical because of the hedonic adaptation."
M30|Procesamiento neuronal de señales de seguridad y riesgo online: un estudio neurocientífico|El incremento exponencial de las transacciones en el entorno web está siendo acompañado de desconfianza y altos niveles de riesgo percibido por parte del consumidor. Las señales de confianza online (sellos de seguridad, sistemas de puntuación o declaraciones de garantía) se han constituido como los principales medios que crean confianza en el entorno web. No obstante, no existe consenso en torno al tipo de señal que produce mayor confianza o la faceta del riesgo que ejerce mayor impacto en el consumidor (financiero, de resultados o privacidad). Este es el primer estudio que utiliza un enfoque multimetodológico (medidas neurológicas y de auto-reporte) para solventar ambas problemáticas. Los resultados sugieren que los sellos de seguridad son las señales que provocan mayor recompensa subconsciente, mientras que el riesgo financiero es el que confiere subconscientemente la menor aversión y valores negativos.
M30|Retail forecasting: research and practice|This paper first introduces the forecasting problems faced by large retailers, from the strategic to the operational, from the store to the competing channels of distribution as sales are aggregated over products to brands to categories and to the company overall. Aggregated forecasting that supports strategic decisions is discussed on three levels: the aggregate retail sales in a market, in a chain, and in a store. Product level forecasts usually relate to operational decisions where the hierarchy of sales data across time, product and the supply chain is examined. Various characteristics and the influential factors which affect product level retail sales are discussed. The data rich environment at lower product hierarchies makes data pooling an often appropriate strategy to improve forecasts, but success depends on the data characteristics and common factors influencing sales and potential demand. Marketing mix and promotions pose an important challenge, both to the researcher and the practicing forecaster. Online review information too adds further complexity so that forecasters potentially face a dimensionality problem of too many variables and too little data. The paper goes on to examine evidence on the alternative methods used to forecast product sales and their comparative forecasting accuracy. Many of the complex methods proposed have provided very little evidence to convince as to their value, which poses further research questions. In contrast, some ambitious econometric methods have been shown to outperform all the simpler alternatives including those used in practice. New product forecasting methods are examined separately where limited evidence is available as to how effective the various approaches are. The paper concludes with some evidence describing company forecasting practice, offering conclusions as to the research gaps but also the barriers to improved practice.
M30|Promise, Trust and Betrayal: Costs of Breaching an Implicit Contract|We study the cost of breaching an implicit contract in a goods market, building on a recent study that documented the presence of such a contract in the Coca-Cola market, in the US, during 1886?1959. The implicit contract promised a serving of Coca-Cola of a constant quality (the “real thing”), and of a constant quantity (6.5oz in a bottle or from the fountain), at a constant nominal price of 5¢. We offer two types of evidence.

Second, we explore the consequences of the Company’s 1985 decision to replace the original Coke with the “New Coke.” Using the model of Exit, Voice, and Loyalty (Hirschman 1970), we argue that the unprecedented public outcry that followed the New Coke’s introduction, was a response to the Company’s breaching of the implicit contract. We document the direct and quantifiable costs of this implicit contract breach, and demonstrate that the indirect, although unquantifiable, costs in terms of lost customer goodwill were substantial.
M30|MARKETING FACTORS AND BRAND EQUITY IN ON THE CONSUMER?S BUYING DECISION OF MODERN TRADE THE DOHOME IN BANGKOK AND ITS ViCINITY|The objectives of this research were to study the marketing factors and brand equity influence on the buying decision of modern trade Dohome in Bangkok and its vicinity. The samples for the research were 385 people who purchased product in the modern trade Dohome in Bangkok. The questionnaires were used for the research tool, whereas the statistics used for analyzing the obtained data were percentage, frequency, mean, standard deviation and multiple regression analysis. The results showed that overall level of opinions on marketing factors and brand equity of modern trade Dohome is high level. Furthermore, overall level of purchasing decision is high level too. Results of the hypothesis test showed that marketing factors in product and price influences buying decisions and brand equity in perceived quality influences buying decisions of the modern trade Dohome with a statistical significance at a 0.05 level.
M30|The Factors Which Lead Brands To Use Social Media In External Corporate Communication|Social media is the new form of today?s communication. People spend a lot of time on social media to be informed about and to interact with the happenings in their social environments, and in the meantime they want to reach their favourite brands. Therefore, many brands have started to open brand fan pages in different social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to get in touch with their consumers. There are many factors which have led brands to use social media in external corporate communication; however, these are not pointed out in detail in the literature. This paper aims to cover the factors which have motivated brands to use social media in external corporate communication. The paper first explores the reasons behind the decline of trust towards traditional advertisements and the advertisements on the Internet. Afterwards, it discusses why websites have recently lost their popularity against social media platforms. Lastly, it looks at why consumers want a presence of brands in social media. The results show that today?s consumers tend to trust electronic word of mouth in social media platforms more than traditional advertisements since they can learn online the experiences of people who have tried the products and services of brands. Furthermore, many consumers feel bothered from the advertisements which drop into their e-mail boxes and the Internet banners which pop up. Interactivity in social media is the main factor which has caused social media to get one step more forward than the websites. Today?s consumers want to engage in dialogues with their favourite brands and have in touch with them on social media. This paper will contribute to the literature of corporate communication from the aspect of social media.
M30|Exploring In-Game Advertising and Brand Recall|Digital gaming is increasingly recognized as one of the most important entertainment sectors worldwide, turning it into a promising medium for advertisers. Games are extremely engaging, interactive and challenging, as a result, it attracted advertisers who are seeking the attention of the customers through a nontraditional medium to convey their advertising messages. Along with this growth in digital games, there are several important contextual factors to consider in the selection and placement of the advertising messages in digital games. The objective of this research was to explore the effect of in-game advertising on brand recall processing. The quantitative approach was employed and a survey was distributed on 201 respondents applied on FIFA game players in Egypt. The results showed that in-game advertising has an effect on brand recall. Additionally, the position of the advertisement and time of appearance appear to be the most significant factor in affecting brand recall.

M30|Selling Ability in Export Market|This study is motivated by two contradictory observations. The first is that indirect exporters and carry-along exporters share the same productivity distribution. While indi- rect exporters export through trade intermediaries, carry-along exporters not only export their own goods, but also carry goods for other indirect exporters. The second is that direct exporters that have the highest average productivity only export their own goods without carrying goods for others. To rationalize these two observations, we propose a determinant we term “selling ability.” We first establish a heterogeneous firm model with two-dimensional heterogeneities: production ability (productivity) and selling ability. We then show evidence of selling ability that is consistent with the model implications. Based on the model, we also investigate a policy of the elimination of the direct trade rights restriction in China and find evidence consistent with the model predictions.
M30|Navigating new marketing technologies, channels and metrics|Modern technologies in all industries are drastically changing the behaviour of the consumers as well as their purchasing patterns. Companies are directing their marketing investment resources into mobile and online while the traditional marketing channels slowly become less effective because of the new generation of consumers and more effective targeting possibilities. New retail technologies offer many possibilities for reaching consumers directly through their mobile phones when they are in the store. A variety of marketing analytics tools helps the companies to measure marketing performance in both online and mobile channel. The goal of this paper is to analyse the advantages of today’s marketing technologies, marketing channels and marketing metrics and to identify some of the difficulties which companies face in navigating them. The conclusion is that companies which resist to use new technologies, channels and metrics are only hurting their business in the long run. Research methodology includes study of literature and scientific articles on digital marketing and researching YouTube videos on retail and mobile marketing.
M30|Unaprjeđenje strategije konkurentskog pozicioniranja poduzeća primjenom marketinške revizije|Revizija marketinga može pomoći poduzeću bolje upravljati podacima o marketingu s kojima raspolaže, kao i podacima koje tek treba prikupiti, sistematizirati i integrirati u izvještaje te kvalitetno upotrijebiti za poboljšanje svojeg poslovanja i strategije nastupa na tržištu. Marketinška revizija može pomoći poduzeću prestići konkurenciju i ostvariti veći tržišni udio zbog toga što će bolje poznavati okruženje u kojem djeluje, želje i potrebe potrošača i društva, te u odnosu na konkurenciju primjenjivati bolji način poslovanja. Ako poduzeće redovito provodi reviziju marketinga, moći će u kratkom vremenskom razdoblju doći do informacija o događanjima na tržištu. Kontinuiranom evaluacijom podataka koji su ključni za marketing, jasnije će razumjeti svoju tržišnu poziciju i razloge zaostajanja za konkurencijom. Revizija marketinga može rukovodstvu poduzeća ukazati na potrebu za promjenom u strateškom pozicioniranju koju je nužno potrebno provesti kako bi se ostvarilo uspješnije konkurentsko pozicioniranje poduzeća. Također, revizija marketinga uputiti će rukovodstvo na odabir ispravne strategije reagiranja na konkurentske prijetnje te potom na pronalaženje adekvatnih rješenja za poteškoće u poslovanju do kojih će doći ukoliko se ne reagira pravovremeno. Informacije prikupljene putem marketinške revizije mogu poslužiti kao smjernice za odabir i oblikovanje strategije konkurentskog pozicioniranja, u zavisnosti od inicijalnog razloga / svrhe i cilja provođenja revizije marketinga. Primjerice, ukoliko svrhu primjene revizije marketinga predstavlja želja rukovodstva za boljom procjenom adekvatnosti marketinških aktivnosti, provoditi će se revizija marketinškog okružja. Tada će u fokusu revizije biti mjerenje učinkovitosti sustava planiranja i kontrolnih postupaka, utjecaj asortimana proizvoda na marketinške ciljeve, te usklađenost cjenovnih i distribucijskih ciljeva, strategije, procedura i aktivnosti s marketinškim strategijama i ciljevima. Rezultati ovakve revizije marketinga poslužiti će kao temelj za odabir i oblikovanje strategije konkuriranja pomoću marketinškog miksa. Bez obzira na to koju strategiju konkurentskog pozicioniranja poduzeće odluči koristiti, revizija i mjerenje učinkovitosti marketinga imati će pozitivan utjecaj na poslovanje poduzeća u kratkom i u dugom roku.

M30|Household preferences for socially responsible investments|We analyze revealed and stated household preferences for socially responsible investments (SRI). Using a questionnaire specifically designed for this purpose and administered to a Dutch representative household panel, we investigate the actual and latent demand for SRI products. Respondents reported whether they owned SRI products, the reason behind this decision, but also answered stated choice questions on traditional investments and hypothetical SR products with an explicit return penalty and/or an in-kind compensation. Our results show that social investors are willing to pay a price to be socially responsible rather than needing a little nudge, such as a gift (a book or a voucher). Highly educated individuals have a substantial latent demand that is currently unexploited. Keeping education constant, individuals who consider themselves financially literate are less interested in SR products than others. Particularly at the intensive margin, the stated demand for SRI funds is sensitive to the return penalty.
M30|An Anatomy of U.S. Firms Seeking Trademark Registration|This paper reports on the construction of a new dataset that combines data on trademark applications and registrations from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office with data on firms from the U.S. Census Bureau. The resulting dataset allows tracking of various activity related to trademark use and protection over the life-cycle of firms, such as the first application for a trademark registration, the first use of a trademark, and the renewal, assignment, and cancellation of trademark registrations. Facts about firm-level trademark activity are documented, including the incidence and timing of trademark registration filings over the firm life-cycle and the connection between firm characteristics and trademark applications. We also explore the relation of trademark application filing to firm employment and revenue growth, and to firm innovative activity as measured by R&D and patents.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
M30|The differences in degree of identification with the brands among generations| Consumers are still faced with more and more offerings of various companies from many channels. Because of increasing competitive the companies have to be constantly trying to differentiate from the others. The brands are the means, which help the companies with dis-tinguishing them. There is no doubt anymore that the brand is important. That is why the companies should be focusing on the building the strong brand, because it collaterally leads consumers to connect products with the quality, emotions, functions, and the design. There-fore, the aim of this paper is to investigate the consumers’ degree of identification with the brand in the relation with the age of consumers, accordingly with the cohort, which they are members of. For achieving this aim the questionnaire as the primary research technique was used. The analysis was based on the number of 840 respondents. The respondents were heavy social network users. The consumers were questioned about their attitudes to brands, their perceptions of the brands and opinions about the degree of importance of the brands in their lives.
M30|Reference Dependence and Choice Overload|This paper offers an explanation for choice overload based on reference-dependent preferences. Consumers construct an ideal object that combines the best attributes of all objects in their choice set, and use this as a reference point. When the choice set expands, it is more likely to find a better object, but meanwhile the reference point improves, which makes all existing objects appear worse. We characterize when the latter reference-dependence effect dominates such that choice overload arises. We also show that purchase probability can decrease with object complexity, measured by the number of attributes.

M30|Experimental marketing and the crisis of postmodernism. Problems and perspectives|In this paper, we outline some fundamental aspects of Experiential Marketing Ð or EM Ð, which distinguish it from more traditional forms of Marketing and bestow its distinctive character upon it. We also spell out EMÕs relation to different philosophical traditions, on one hand, and to different scientific trends, on the other, highlighting some heretofore underestimated aspects of its theoretical background. In particular, we delve into the relationship between EM and Romanticism, on one hand, and Phenomenology, on the other. Our analysis focuses upon the relevance of three notions for EMÕs theoretical discourse and practice: experience, authenticity, and reality. All these notions are only apparently na•ve; on the contrary, as we show, they are rooted in complex philosophical paradigms, and are inhabited by conceptual tensions. EM inherits those tensions, as we point out, tensions expressed in paradoxical forms in some of its most prominent formulations, e.g. in the works of Holbrook and Hirschman, Pine and Gilmore, and in those of Schmitt. As we show, most of those contradictions derive from the allegiance of EM to postmodernist metaphysical assumptions, pertaining to the notion of reality and to its relation to the one of experience.

M30|Using Social Network Activity Data to Identify and Target Job Seekers|An important challenge for many firms is to identify the life transitions of its customers, such as job searching, being pregnant, or purchasing a home. Inferring such transitions, which are generally unobserved to the firm, can offer the firm opportunities to be more relevant to its customers. In this paper, we demonstrate how a social network platform can leverage its longitudinal user data to identify which of its users are likely job seekers. Identifying job seekers is at the heart of the business model of professional social network platforms. Our proposed approach builds on the hidden Markov model (HMM) framework to recover the latent state of job search from noisy signals obtained from social network activity data. Specifically, our modeling approach combines cross-sectional survey responses to a job seeking status question with longitudinal user activity data. Thus, in some time periods, and for some users, we observe the “true” job seeking status. We fuse the observed state information into the HMM likelihood, resulting in a partially HMM. We demonstrate that the proposed model can not only predict which users are likely to be job seeking at any point in time, but also what activities on the platform are associated with job search, and how long the users have been job seeking. Furthermore, we find that targeting job seekers based on our proposed approach can lead to a 42% increase in profits of a targeting campaign relative to the approach that was used at the time of the data collection.

M30|Self-Scanning and Self-Control: A Field Experiment on Real-Time Feedback and Shopping Behavior|Payment and checkout at retail stores is increasingly being replaced by automated systems. One recent technological invention in this area is mobile self-scanning in which customers carry a mobile scanner while shopping. Mobile self-scanners give real-time feedback on spending. The device increases price saliency and enables customers to keep track of the total amount spent. Using a field experiment, we test if mobile self-scanning affects shopping behavior. Consumers of two grocery stores were allocated randomly to use a mobile self-scanner or not. Overall, we find that using the self-scanner has a negative but insignificant effect on total amount spent. However, the response to using the scanner is heterogeneous and for customers with low self-control, it significantly reduces both their spending and number of items bought when using the mobile scanner. Moreover, we find that consumers with low self-control are more likely to use the self-scanner than individuals with high self-control. Taken together, our results suggest that sophisticated individuals, that is, individuals who are aware of their self-control problem, use the scanner to control their spending.
M30|Heuristics as an Aid to Inter-organizational Value Creation|The purpose of this paper is to analyze the moderating effects of heuristics on the relationship between asset specificity, formal contracting/relational contracting and value creation. More importantly, this paper explores the role of heuristics on the inter-organizational relationships. An integrative theoretical framework is proposed, grounded on literature review on transaction cost economics and heuristics. Then, the relationships between heuristics, asset specificity, formal contracting/relational contracting and value creation are analyzed, using the proposed theoretical framework. Heuristics has different implications to the choice of governance mechanisms (formal contracting and relational contracting) and value creation. Moreover, this work develops hypotheses indicating how heuristics moderates the relations between these constructs and highlights future research directions relating to inter-organizational relationships. Heuristics, assets specificity and governance mechanisms alone have limited capacity of improving inter-organizational value creation, but combined they can support improvement initiatives. Nevertheless, heuristics, assets specificity and governance mechanisms can also suppose some novel obstacles to effective inter-organizational value creation. Several studies have analyzed value creation in the inter-organizational relationships, but, to the best of our knowledge no study has focused on the role of heuristics. This work can draw attention of the managers by making them aware of how important is heuristics as a decision-making tool which can influence governance of asset specificities

M30|The long-term performance of new product introductions|This study investigates the long-term stock market performance of firms following announcements of new product introductions (NPIs). We find that firms announcing NPIs experience significantly positive abnormal stock returns in the three- and five-year post-announcement periods. Further, firms’ marketing capabilities and industry background, firm size, and the timing new products are introduced significantly affect shareholder gains from NPIs. The Carhart four-factor model, the zero-investment portfolio method, and the buy-and-hold return procedure yield consistent results. Our findings show that investors on average do not fully capture the valuation impact of new products nor incorporate the information contained in the initial announcements.

M30|The external presentation of organizational identity orientation: A study of employment advertisement s 1975-2015|This longitudinal study analyzes organizational identity labels and their implicated organizational identity orientations. The data consist of 1348 self-presentation texts retrieved from employment advertisements published in a major Norwegian newspaper over a 40 year period and containing more than 3,000 identity labels. The study shows that the expression of organizational identity orientation is an organization-level phenomenon, that the contents of labels and orientations change over time, and that identity labels should be understood as malleable and dynamic. More specifically, identity orientations change (1) in terms of their composition, suggesting that the same identity orientation is communicated through different labels over time, and (2) in terms of their relative prevalence, suggesting that organizations may shift the emphasis from one orientation to another over time. Implications for the expression of organizational identity orientation, the contents of external identity communication, and the nature of organizational identity labels are discussed.

M30|Strategic Positioning for Soft Drinks in the Algerian Market|The aim of this research is to identify the positioning of Algerian soft drink product compared with foreign competitor products by applying a survey to determine the image and prestige of the Algerian product in the consumer's perspective compared to foreign products. The study has touched a random sample consisting of 601 consumers from all of Algeria. We result from the research that soft drinks local institutions recorded vulnerable and a deterioration in its competitive positioning compared to positioning perceived of soft drinks to foreign institutions, as they do not bother to focus more on the dimensions of which are of paramount importance to customers, as opposed to foreign products which differentiate it in line with the wishes and expectations of the Algerian customer.
M30|The sequencing of gift exchange: A field trial|There is now an extensive literature on “gift exchange” showing that when principals and agents can trade “gifts” (rewards that should not emerge in a competitive equilibrium), exchange becomes more efficient. However, it is not obvious how gift exchange should be organized if the principal's goal is to increase the performance of a reciprocal agent. Specifically, who should make the first gift, the principal or the agent? Although both orderings, by themselves, have been hypothesized and examined in theory and experiments, the literature is largely silent on the comparison. I report the results of a field experiment that compares the principal-first and agent-first orderings to each other and a gift-less control. Consistent with the previous experimental literature, I find that principal-first, gifts do increase agent performance. Unlike the literature, however, I find that agent-first, gifts are also effective. Comparing the two, I see that the agent-first ordering works best, is clearly cheaper to implement and differences appear on both the extensive and intensive margins.
M30|Willingness to Pay for Low Water Footprint Food Choices During Drought|In the context of recent California drought years, we investigate empirically whether consumers are willing to pay for more efficient water usage in the production of four California agricultural products. We implement an internet survey choice experiment for avocados, almonds, lettuce, and tomatoes to elicit consumer valuation for water efficiency via revealed choices. We estimate a model of consumer choices where a product is defined as a bundle of three attributes: price, production method (conventional or organic), and water usage (average or efficient). Varying the attribute space presented to consumers in the experimental choice design gives us the data variation to estimate a discrete choice model—both conditional logit specifications and random coefficient mixed logit specifications. We find that on average consumers have a significant positive marginal utility towards water-efficiency and estimate that there is an implied positive willingness to pay (WTP) of about 12 cents per gallon of water saved on average. Moreover, informing consumers about the drought severity increases the WTP for low water footprint options, but not significantly. We find that there is heterogeneity in the WTP along respondents' education, race, and also with respect to stated environmental concern. Our findings have policy implications in that they suggest there to be a market based potential to nudge consumers who want to decrease their water footprint and follow a more sustainable diet, namely, by revealing information on the product's water footprint in a form of a label. Simulations of removing low water footprint labels from the choice set attributes imply significant consumer surplus losses, especially for the more educated, white, and more environmentally concerned respondents.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
M30|Customer Satisfaction And Loyalty: A Study Of Interrelationships And Effects In Nigerian Domestic Airline Industry|The debate concerning the interrelationships and effects between customer satisfaction and loyalty has been tossed back and forth, without a consensus opinion. This study examines the linkages between customer satisfaction and loyalty in Nigerian domestic airline industry. The study adopted correlation research design to elicit information via questionnaire from 600 domestic air passengers drawn through convenience sampling technique. The data obtained from the respondents were analysed with Pearson correlation analysis, linear regression, and One-way analysis of variance. Based on 383 completed data, the results provide support for the association and influence of customer satisfaction on customer loyalty. The study also found out that frequent air travelers displayed more loyalty tendency towards airline carriers compared to non-frequent air passengers. On the basis of aforementioned findings, the study concludes that customer satisfaction is extremely important in building and enhancing customer loyalty. Therefore, airline carriers should implement strategies that will guarantee long-term relationship with air travellers by offering service quality that will meet and exceeds their expectations and by extension customer satisfaction.

M30|Younger Customers' Outlooks when Selecting and Changing a Financial Services Provider: The Case of Maltese Students|In order for banks to supplement their market share, it is crucial for them to entice new customers such as students who are expected to join the workforce at a subsequent stage. The main aim of this paper is to survey the banks' tactics in this regard, the response of students to such schemes, and the aspects which such customers consider when selecting a particular service provider or when switching to another one. We conduct interviews with bank representatives and distribute questionnaires to first year university students in order to gauge whether particular factors are more important than others in the selection of a financial services provider. We find that there are various aspects which banks may leverage upon to entice potential customers to switch away from competing service providers, especially due to the fact that switchers tend to respond differently to given characteristics in their decision making process.
M30|Perceived price complexity of dynamic energy tariffs: An investigation of antecedents and consequences|Dynamic tariffs have the potential to contribute to a successful shift from conventional to renewable energies, but tapping this potential in Europe ultimately depends on residential consumers selecting them. This study proposes and finds that consumer reactions to dynamic tariffs depend on the level of perceived price complexity that represents the cognitive effort consumers must engage in to compute the overall bill amount. An online experiment conducted with a representative sample of 664 German residential energy consumers examines how salient characteristics of dynamic tariffs contribute to perceived price complexity. Subsequently, a structural equation model (SEM) reveals that the depth of information processing is central to understand how price complexity relates to consumers’ behavioral intentions. The results suggest that it will be challenging to convince European consumers to select complex dynamic tariffs under the current legal framework. Policymakers will need to find ways to make these tariffs more attractive.
M30|Rational and Emotional Messages Amid Online News Exposure of the Brand|Customers receive a large amount of information from today?s online world. It has been increasingly difficult for the marketers to monitor and respond to different types of messages affecting their brand. At the same time, marketers also need to communicate with customers through various types of messages. It is interesting to understand the roles of message appeals have while customers expose to different types of online news about the brand. We conduct an experiment with 240 randomly selected subjects on a 2 message appeals (rational and emotion) X 4 online news exposure (no exposure, positive news exposure, negative news exposure and both positive and negative news exposure) factorial design to explore their effects on five aspects of consumer responses: attitude toward the ad, credibility, persuasion, attitude toward the brand and purchase intention. The results revealed both message appeals and online news exposure significantly affect attitudes toward the ad and the brand. Message appeals have a significant effect on persuasion and only the interactions of both factors affect purchase intention. Discussion and implications on the findings will be provided.
M30|The Pay-What-You-Want game: What can be learned from the experimental evidence on Dictator and Trust Games?|This paper introduces the Pay-What-You-Want game which represents the interaction between a buyer and a seller in a Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) situation. The PWYW game embeds the dictator game and the trust game as subgames. This allows us to use previous experimental studies with the dictator and the trust game to identify three factors that can influence the success of PWYW pricing in business practice: (i) social context, (ii) social information, and (iii) deservingness. Only few cases of PWYW pricing for a longer period of time have been documented. By addressing repeated games, we isolate two additional factors which are likely to contribute to successful implementations of PWYW as a long term pricing strategy. These are (iv) communication and (v) the reduction of goal conflicts. The central contribution of this study is an attempt to bridge the gap between laboratory experiments and the research on PWYW pricing, which relies largely on evidence from the field. By reviewing the relevant experiments, this study identifies factors crucial for the success of PWYW pricing and provides guidance to developing long-term applications of PWYW pricing.
M30|Intellectual Structure and Emancipation of Word of Mouth Research: A Bibliometric Analysis of a Multidisciplinary Research Field|Word of mouth (WOM) information have become an integral part of consumer decision-making and have revitalized investigations of a social phenomenon to serve marketing objectives. This study addresses the fast-growing yet diverse WOM literature with its heterogeneous background. An objectified and methodologically enriched analysis is carried out to synthesize the literature and realign the richness of online WOM publications with their intellectual foundations. Drawing on meaningful publications, the present analysis systematically processes relevant knowledge to address statistically distinguishable research streams in the field of WOM, their coherence, as well as temporal developments. Results provide evidence of a shared core of WOM research as well as six (sub)streams of varying importance over time that describe two higher research orien-tations. Practical implications can be derived concerning most influential journals dedicated to specific research on WOM. By discussing the various findings, avenues for future research are revealed.

M30|Profitability Of Children’S Market|The main purpose of this paper is to point out and verify the profitability of children’s market. 30-40 years ago, children were not considered as an important market and they were treated as savers and future consumers. Today, they are perceived as consumers and spenders and are actively engaged in the marketplace as buyers, users and recipients of consumer goods. Nowadays, children are viewed as a viable market by many manufacturers and retailers. Namely, two recent trends have increased manufacturer and retailer’s interest in child market. First, both the discrecionary income of children and their growing power to influence parents purchases and second growing media space (television, Internet, mobile phones, computers, video games, etc) that through advertisments and promotions attract younger population. In order to understand children as consumers, one has to recognize the impact of the marketplace in children’s everyday lives and to consider the ways in which they experience the commercialized world. Many marketing experts discuss the negative effects and consequences that marketing activities have on children, as eating disorders and childhood obesity, tremendous behavior changes, family stress, violence and delinquency, alcoholism, increased materialism among children. Nevertheless, companies have recognized the role of children as consumers and acknowledged their contribution to family decision making. Some experts claim that companies play on children’s dreams and vulnerabilities. Companies are interested in making high profits by selling their products and services to a broad, extended public, including children. They will do their outmost to make profits, even though they can damage the health and dreams of children. This paper describes the exposure of children and teenagers to marketing programs, benefits for companies, disadvantages arising from it and the role of children as consumers, providing recommendations for their protection. Finally, it describes the impact of marketing activities to Macedonian children and their involvement as consumers to the marketplace.

M30|To Extend or Not to Extend: Advantages and Disadvantages of Brand Extension Strategy|Launching new products is one of the most used strategies for companies to grow. While line extension is the less risky one, more companies are using the strategy of brand extension as offering more opportunities for the business. The following article is intended to present the strategy of brand extension with its advantages and disadvantages. The purpose is to drive the attention of the management to what they can achieve while entering more categories with the same brand and which are the main risks they have to try to prevent or overcome and how they can do so. The main advantages being investigated are transferring of the brand associations to the new product, increased brand awareness, decreased marketing budget, economies of scale, increased brand visibility, consumer acceptance, prolonged brand life cycle, increased brand equity. On the other hand the company should be careful against diluting the image of the parent brand, adding negative associations, cannibalization, increased consumer expectations and the possibility of increased costs. By maximizing the first ones and minimizing the second group the brand can find place amongst some of the best practice examples which are to be seen in the article.

M30|Уніфікація Методології Оцінювання Конкурентоспроможності<BR>[Unification of the methodology of competitiveness evaluation]|"Метою статті є порівняння сучасних методів оцінки конкурентоспроможності та практична апробація отриманих результатів на виробничому підприємстві з метою уніфікації методології. Аналіз літературних джерел показав, що велике різноманіття методів оцінки конкурентоспроможності ускладнює вибір методу, інтерпретацію результатів, що підтверджує актуальність класифікації методів та їх уніфікації. Авторське бачення зводиться до того, що уніфікований метод оцінювання конкурентоспроможності повинен поєднувати матричний та графічний методи. В результаті дослідження нами доведено, що SWOT-аналіз необхідно виконувати у два етапи: по-перше, виокремлювати сильні та слабкі сторони підприємства, які враховують такі фактори: маркетинг, виробництво, економічний і фінансовий стан, технологія, адміністративне управління та персонал; по-друге, можливості та погрози повинні враховувати політичну й правову сферу, економічний стан, вплив ринку, соціально-культурні та природно-екологічні фактори. Проведена апробація запропонованої методології оцінювання конкурентоспроможності на виробничому підприємстві ТОВ «Ольвіта», що динамічно розвивається й успішно функціонує на плодоовочевому ринку України та спеціалізується на переробці, логістиці та дистрибуції свіжих і заморожених овочів, фруктів і ягід, а також м’ясних напівфабрикатів. Отримані висновки свідчать, що оцінка конкурентоспроможності залишається актуальним питанням, яке потребує використання простих і достатньо демонстративних методів, одним з яких є метод, що поєднує матричний і графічний підхід. Перевагою запропонованого методу є достатньо високий рівень візуалізацій та можливість врахувати особистісний підхід при визначенні бальних оцінок сильних і слабких сторін, а також можливостей і загроз. В перспективі авторами планується розглянути і систематизувати показники, що використовуються при оцінюванні конкурентоспроможності. The purpose of the study is the comparison of the modern methods of competitiveness evaluation and testing the results in practice at a production plant in order to unify the methodology. Analysis of the publications shows that the existing diversity in methods of the competitiveness evaluation complicates the choice of a method and interpretation of the results, which confirms the need to classify and unify the methods available today. The authors suggest that the standardized method of competitiveness evaluation should combine matrix and graphical methods. In our study, we have shown that SWOT-analysis should be carried out in two stages: firstly, it is necessary to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the company, taking into account the following factors: marketing, production, economic and financial situation, technology, the administration and personnel; secondly, it is essential to assess the opportunities and threats with the allowance for the political, legal, and economic situation, the impact of market as well as social, cultural and natural environmental factors. The proposed methodology of competitiveness evaluation has been tested at the industrial enterprise ""Olvita ltd"", which is dynamically developing and successfully operates on the food market of Ukraine; it specializes in processing, logistics and distribution of fresh and frozen vegetables, fruits and berries, as well as ready-to cook meat products. The results have shown that the competitiveness evaluation remains a pressing issue that requires simple and fairly demonstrative methods, one of which is a method that combines both graphical and matrix approaches. The advantage of the proposed method is its sufficiently high visualizations and record of personal approaches in evaluating the scores for strengths and weaknesses as well as opportunities and threats. In the future, the authors are planning to examine and systemize the indicators used in the competitiveness evaluation."

Даний діяч посідає важливе місце у історії розвитку освіти та економіки, завдяки його завзятій громадській позиції та дослідженню історії ко-оперативного шкільництва. Дослідження діяльності Карла Коберського, як свідчить практика, описують здебільшого або з точки зору історії або з позиції педагогіки. Наша мета характеризувати діяльність вченого та його економічну думку з економічної сторони та її значення на фінансово-економічну та кооперативну освіту. Активна пропагандистська та організаційна діяльність К. Коберського вагомо вплинула на піднесення сільської культури, поширення кооперативного руху, торгівлю, банківську справу та розвиток підприємництва. Вагомий етап економічного та суспільного становлення Західної України відбувся після воєнних дій, коли з’явилася необхідність відновлення господарств та навчання фахових спеціалістів на селі. Інтелігенція краю прагнула залучити селянство до економічної самоорганізації. Педагоги того часу розглядали професійну освіту як чинник соціального розвитку та незалежності. В умовах жорстких заборон та утисків почало формуватися кооперативне шкільництво. Досить поширеними були різноманітні громадські організації, об’єднання та спілки, що сприяли формуванню національної свідомості населення. Подальшого поглибленого дослідження вимагає праця Карла Коберського та його місце у кооперативно-економічній сфері, яке дасть змогу вдосконалювати управління навчальними закладами та ефективно розвивати фінансово-економічну та кооперативну освіту. На сьогодні, коли має місце процес розвитку ринкових відносин, ідеї освітньо-економічної спадщини Карла Коберського набувають актуальності, бо вони можуть використовуватися з метою покращання напрямків економічної освіти та наукової і методичної роботи в установах економічного спрямування. Карл Коберський як відомий громадський діяч зміг багато досягти у фінансово-економічній сфері, зокрема шляхом написання статей про кооперацію та пропагування даних ідей на селі. The article analyses the public-elucidative activity of theorist, co-operator and economist Carl Koberskyi and his influence on the development of financial-economical and co-operative education. This figure occupies an important place in the history of education and economy, due to his zealous public position and research of history of co-operative schooling. As practice testifies, research of Carl Koberskyi’s activity is described mostly either from the point of view of history or pedagogic. Our aim is to characterize the activity of the scientist and his economic ideas from the point of view of economics and to define their value for finance-economics and co-operative education. Carl Koberskyi’s active propagandist and organizational activity influenced the development of rural culture, distribution of co-operative motion, trade, banking and development of enterprise greatly. Weighty stage of economic and public establishment of western Ukraine took place in the after-war time, when the necessity of proceeding in economies and studies of professional specialists appeared in rural districts. Intelligent workers of the region strived to involve the peasantry into economic self-organization. At that time teachers considered trade education as a factor of social development and independence. Co-operative schooling began to be formed in the conditions of hard prohibitions and oppressions. Various public organizations, associations and unions that assisted the formation of national consciousness of population were quite widespread.Carl Koberskyi’s labour activity and his place in the co-operatively-economic sphere require further deep research, which will enable to improve the management of educational establishments and to develop finance-economics and co-operative education more effectively. Today, in the time of market relations development, Carl Koberskyi’s ideas of educationally-economic inheritance acquire special actuality, as they can be used with the aim of improvement of economic education directions, scientific and methodical work in establishments, connected with the sphere of economics. Carl Koberskyi as a well-known public figure managed to achieve much in the finance-economics sphere, in particular by writing articles about co-operation and promoting these ideas in villages.
M30|Мода Та Її Вплив На Поведінку Споживачів<BR>[Fashion and its influence on consumer behavior]|У статті розглядаються питання, пов’язані з впливом моди на поведінку споживачів. Значимість цього дослідження обумовлена, насамперед тим, що в сучасному світі наростає процес розвитку суспільства споживання і саме мода є соціальним регулятором людської діяльності. Метою даної статті є з’ясування, який саме вплив здійснює мода на поведінку споживачів (негативний чи позитивний), і чи є вона засобом індивідуалізації людини. Результати дослідження показали, що слідування моді виявляє ставлення споживача до суспільства, до навколишнього світу, до самого себе. З одного боку, особистість хоче зберегти свою індивідуальність, з іншого боку, прагне ідентифікувати себе з іншими членами суспільства. Приховане бажання підкорятися моді бореться з прагненням бути незалежним від неї, не наслідувати інших, а відрізнятися від них. The questions related to the influence of fashion on consumer behavior are researched in the article. The importance of this research is conditioned, first of all, by the fact, that in the modern world the process of the development of the society of consumption is growing, and it is fashion that has become the social regulator of human activity. The aim of this article is to find out, what influence fashion produces on the behavior of consumers (negative or positive), and whether it is a means of human individualization. The research results show, that following fashion demonstrates the attitude of a consumer to society, to the surrounding world, to himself. On the one hand, a person wants to preserve his or her individuality, on the other hand, strives to identify himself with other members of society. The hidden desire to submit to the fashion contests the aspiration to be independent of it, not to imitate others, but to be different from them.

Современная экономическая ситуация характеризуется большой динамичностью, что требует дополнительного изучения влияния времени на экономические процессы, оценки результатов влияния. В процессе рассмотрения выявлено, что современное представление о времени, как об экономическом факторе, находится на стадии формирования. По результатам исследования показано, что фактор времени рассматривается в зависимости от двух основных признаков: масштаба экономического агента и длительности временного интервала, для которого рассматривается процесс. The aim of the article is to study the effect of time, as a parameter, on economic processes and the identification of peculiarities of such influence. The current economic situation is characterized by a great dynamism that requires further study of time effect on economic processes and estimation of the results of this effect. During consideration, it was revealed that the modern idea of time as an economic factor exists at the stage of formation. The study shows that the time factor is considered as a function of two main features: the scale of the economic agent and the duration of time interval for considered process.

M30|Використання Статистичних Методів Управління Якістю В Логістичному Процесі<BR>[Using statistical methods of quality management in logistics processes]|"Метою статті є дослідження особливостей використання статистичних методів управління якістю логістичних процесів та апробація теоретичних досліджень на крупному промисловому підприємстві. Аналіз літературних джерел показав, що дослі-дженню управління якістю присвячена значна кількість робіт, як українських, так і закордонних авторів, але ж статистичні методи управління якістю були досконало проаналізовані лише незначною частиною науковців, оскільки саме ці методи віднесені до класичних, тобто таких, що вважаються загальновідомими й не потребують додаткової уваги сучасних науковців. Авторське бачення зводиться до того, що логістичний процес є процесом трансформації, переміщення матеріального й супутніх йому потоків шляхом забезпечення управлінської свободи в умовах послідовних взаємозалежностей, стандартизації, синхронізації, спільного використання інформації й узгодженості стимулів, використовуючи інноваційні методи і моделі. В результаті дослідження доведено, що при управлінні логістичними процесами доцільно використовувати такі статистичні методи управління якістю: описова статистика, планування експериментів, перевірка гіпотез, вимірювальний аналіз, аналіз можливостей процесу, регресійний аналіз, аналіз надійності, вибірковий контроль, моделювання, карти статистичного контролю процесу, статистичне призначення допуску, аналіз часових рядів. Проведена апробація використання запропонованих статичних методів управління якістю в логістичних процесах на великому промисловому підприємстві – АТ «Дніпропетровський агрегатний завод», що спеціалізується на виробництві гідророзподільників. Отримані висновки свідчать, що головна мета в області якості логістичних процесів полягає в безперервному поліпшенні виробництва продукції гірничошахтної апаратури та устаткування, що відповідає вимогам і очікуванням замовника на основі застосування інноваційних технологічних процесів, управлінських систем і інформаційних технологій. Доведено, що збільшення інтенсивності виробництва гідророзподільників негативно позначається на якості продукції; для зменшення кількості рекламацій підприємству необхідно збільшить кваліфікацію робітників всіх змін. Перспективами подальших досліджень у даному напрямі є систематизація теоретичних знань і практичних підходів щодо підвищення якості продукції та отримання унікальних конкурентних переваг. The purpose of the paper is to study the application of statistical methods of logistics process quality management at a large industrial enterprise and testing the theoretical studies. The analysis of the publications shows that a significant number of works by both Ukrainian and foreign authors has been dedicated to the research of quality management, while statistical methods of quality management have only been thoroughly analyzed by a small number of researchers, since these methods are referred to as classical, that is, those that are considered well-known and do not require special attention of modern scholars. In the authors’ opinion, the logistics process is a process of transformation and movement of material and accompanying flows by ensuring management freedom under the conditions of sequential interdependencies; standardization; synchronization; sharing information, and consistency of incentives, using innovative methods and models. In our study, we have shown that the management of logistics processes should use such statistical methods of quality management as descriptive statistics, experiment planning, hypotheses testing, measurement analysis, process opportunities analysis, regression analysis, reliability analysis, sampling, modeling, maps of statistical process control, specification of statistical tolerance, time series analysis. The proposed statistical methods of logistics processes quality management have been tested at the large industrial enterprise JSC ""Dniepropetrovsk Aggregate Plant"" that specializes in manufacturing hydraulic control valves. The findings suggest that the main purpose in the sphere of logistics processes quality is the continuous improvement of the mining equipment production quality through the use of innovative processes, advanced management systems and information technology. This will enable the enterprise to meet the requirements and expectations of their customers. It has been proved that the increase in intensity of the hydraulic control valve production affects the quality of the products; to reduce the number of complaints, the company needs to improve the skills of workers in all their changes. Prospects for further research in this direction are systematization of theoretical knowledge and practical approaches, which should be aimed at improving the product quality and obtaining unique competitive advantages."

M30|A rising e-channel tide lifts all boats? The impact of manufacturer multi-channel encroachment on traditional selling and leasing|Organizing and managing channels of distribution is an important marketing task. Due to the emergence of electronic commerce on the Internet, e-channel distribution systems have been adopted by many manufacturers. However, academic and anecdotal evidence both point to the pressures arising from this new e-channel manufacturing environment. Questions marks therefore remain on how the addition of this e-channel affects the traditional marketing strategies of leasing and selling. We set up several two-period dual-channel models in which a manufacturer sells a durable product through both a manufacturer-owned e-channel and an independent reseller (leaser) who adopts selling (leasing) to consumers. Our main results indicate that, direct selling cost aside, product durability plays an important role in shaping the strategies of all members. With either marketing strategy, the additional expansion of an e-channel territory may secure Pareto gains, in which all members benefit.

M30|Effect of Power Supply on the performance of Small and Medium Size Enterprises: A comparative analysis between SMEs in Tema and the Northern part of Ghana|Electricity provision in Ghana has been marred by low generation, poor supply and frequent power outages. The situation compel firms to adopt strategies to cope with this poor public supply of power for their business. To this end, this study analysed the effect of power supply on the performance of SMEs: a comparative analysis between two regions in Ghana where Small and Medium firms are located. The study uses the current World Bank 2013 Enterprise Survey on Ghana which consist of 710 firms. The study employs both chi-square and t-test to do pattern analysis. In addition, ordinary regression analysis (OLS) was employed to regress firm performance variable on electricity supply variable and other covariates. The results show that, the presence of power outages, thus, the number of times power outages experienced and hours of power outages negatively affected firms performance (profitability). In addition, it was further realized that power outages (power interruptions) severely affects SMEs located in the Northern part of Ghana than SMEs located elsewhere. The study therefore recommends that government should implement policies and programs such as power mix approach and renewable energy and bring in private sector participation to install competition and efficiency. This is in the interest to mitigate the unreliable electricity supply. Also, SMEs should consider alternative sources of power such as solar power, inverter, biogas, generators, which would help curb the cost power outage brings to their production and to boost output.
M30|Retail channel management in consumer search markets|We study how a monopoly manufacturer optimally manages her contractual relations with retailers in markets with consumer search. By choosing wholesale prices, the manufacturer affects the degree of competition between retailers and the incentives of consumers to search. We show that depending on whether or not the manufacturer can commit to her price decisions and on the search cost, the manufacturer may be substantially better off choosing her wholesale prices not independent of each other, consciously allowing for asymmetric contracts. Thus, our analysis may shed light on when we may expect sales across different retailers to be positively or negatively correlated. Our model may be able to generate loss leaders at the wholesale level and show the rationale for creating “premium resellers”.
M30|Adoption of Social Media for Public Relations by Museums|Conceptual evolution of the Internet and Web, substantiated through Web 2.0 and the emergence of online social networks, reinvented the way that enterprises interact with their customers. Museums, as cultural institutions with an important mission, are not unaffected by that change, however.

The goal of this paper is to analyze and compare the social media presence of museums in two European capitals. It focuses on museums in Prague and Berlin, and considers their general Web presence and the dynamics of activities on Facebook. In order to understand the integrative social media approach of museums in both regions, we investigated additionally Twitter and Youtube presence among museums with a Facebook account. The study reveals a lower presence of Prague museums both on the Web and in the identified social media networks, in comparison to Berlin museums. Moreover, we conclude that the presence of both regional museums on social media networks is low, while the integration and simultaneous application of more networks at the same time are negligible, both for Prague and Berlin museums.

M30|Consumer Loss Aversion, Product Experimentation and Implicit Collusion|"Two firms supplying experience goods compete to attract loss averse consumers that are uncertain about how well these goods fit their needs. To resolve valuation uncertainty, firms can allow perspective customers to test (experiment) their products before purchase. We investigate firms' dynamic incentives to allow experimentation and analyze the resulting effects on the profitability and the stability of horizontal price fixing. The analysis shows that, depending on the regulatory regime in place | i.e., whether experimentation is forbidden, mandated or simply allowed but not imposed (laissez-faire) | the degree of consumer loss aversion has ambiguous effects both on the profits that firms can achieve through implicit collusion and on the extent to which these agreements can be sustained. Moreover, we also show that while in static environments consumer welfare is always maximized by a policy that forbids experimentation, the opposite might happen in a dynamic environment."

For this reason, Facebook accounts of these hotel services has been studied through content analysis method.
M30|Cultural congruency and shocking buzz campaigns: contrasting the opinions of professionals and consumers|Buzz marketing in social networks is often seen by announcers as an opportunity to reach the biggest audience. However, the risk of failure of buzz campaigns proves not to be negligible and its consequences may be serious for the company. In order to succeed in such buzz campaigns, this research study focuses on cultural aspects, and more particularly on the central role of cultural congruency. To explore these aspects, a qualitative study, based on 36 face-to-face interviews with marketing professionals/advertisers and consumers, has been carried out. The results highlight the importance of cultural values for consumers in Arab-Muslim countries, especially when buzz marketing campaigns touch the taboos. Terms used in the advertisement are also decisive in the success of a buzz campaign.
M30|Evaluating Gaps in Consumer Behavior Research on Organic Foods: A Critical Literature Review under Bangladesh Context|The global demand for organic foods has inspired the academicians and practicing professionals to explore consumer purchase behavior in this sector. The multiple promises that organic foods hold for the future – like sustainable food production, food safety, food security, nutrition and reduction of green-house gases – all might have influenced the recent rise of behavioral research in the organic food sector. Interestingly, Bangladesh has been a producer of organic foods since the early ‘80s; however, only a handful of studies could be traced that actually studied consumer behavior in this sector. The current paper explored the important roles that organic foods might play in Bangladesh, synthesized findings of past studies under Bangladesh context, and justified probable areas that might be investigated in future. Therefore, plausible gaps were explored in the existing literature pertaining to Bangladesh context and a tentative research agenda for future researchers was proposed.
M30|This paper examines the effect of message characteristics on donation behavior using an economic|This paper examines the effect of message characteristics on donation behavior using an economic model of giving. The utility of giving can come from one’s own contribution and possibly from the combined contributions of others. Donors are assumed to be constrained utility maximizers, and the message attributes affect the degree to which they react altruistically or egoistically. The model is estimated with data from an incentive-aligned study of South Korean consumers, and implications for message optimization and donor targeting are explored.

In the next part of the paper, different types of motivation are identified (e.g. proactive vs. reactive, egocentric vs. altruistic). The core part of the paper consists of the analysis of 5Rs and their interrelations. Finally, the author has identified the main challenges created by de-consumption for marketers. The paper is conceptual, and it is based on an extensive literature review.
M30|A Survey of the Empirical Evidence on PWYW Pricing|We review a large number of empirical studies on Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing. We distinguish between laboratory experiments, field experiments, survey experiments and case studies. Based on this survey we identify the following two gaps in the recently flourishing literature on PWYW pricing: (1) studies on PWYW pricing for goods with high cost, and (2) studies on the long-term effects of PWYW pricing.
M30|Fairness in Strategy: A Fair Process Evaluation of Strategy Schools|The ‘strategy creation’ process – the process of formulating and implementing strategy – has been under critical study for decades for not delivering the desired results. The discussion on how a strategy process should be run has resulted in a number of ‘strategy schools’.Procedural justice theory is relevant to this discussion. It states that when people impacted by a process consider the process as ‘fair’ they demonstrate a higher level of trust and commitment, and performance increases. This article evaluates the extent to which traditional ‘strategy schools’ comply with the tenets of procedural justice theory and highlight the non-compliance with these tenets for each of these schools. We then propose a new strategy process model which has a greater fair process dimension than any of the more traditional ‘strategy schools’ and as such offers the potential to bring greater effectiveness to the strategy process.
M30|Opening your product: impact of user innovations and their distribution platform on video game success|Abstract The focus of this paper is the impact of user innovations on the success of video games. Through the use of secondary data sources, a dataset of 204 video games and their expert and user ratings, user innovation and distribution platform support, as well as the number of available user innovations, is constructed and analyzed. The results highlighted in particular the impact of supporting the main distribution platform for modifications, the Steam Workshop. Hypotheses related to the support of user innovations alone were not supported, but platform support did show a significant positive effect on both number of available user innovations as well as user ratings. The number of user innovations itself did not have an impact on the user ratings.
M30|Influence of print advertising layout complexity on visual attention|Abstract In the contemporary overcrowded market there is a high competition for capturing consumers’ attention. Few decades ago attracting consumers’ visual attention was easier; however, modern consumers become advertising-resistant. Moreover, people even tend to ignore ads before seeing them. Such advertising resistance leads to a situation when the creativity becomes important. As creativity in advertising has many aspects, we considered the advertising complexity as one of them. The aim of the research is to determine the influence of the complexity of print advertising on visual attention. Three objectives are set to reach the aim: (1) to determine the theoretical criteria of advertising complexity; (2) to select sample advertisements meeting each selected criterion; (3) to provide the eye-tracking experiment with the chosen advertisements. The research reveals that advertising complexity has a positive influence on consumers’ visual attention to the advertisement, but negative influence on consumers’ visual attention to the brand presented in the advertisement. The research enables the eye-tracking-based determination of the best suitable level of advertising complexity to attract visual attention. The analysis of experiment participants’ number of eye fixations and mean viewing time enables the determination of guidelines for advertising creation.
M30|Who's holding out? An experimental study of the benefits and burdens of eminent domain|A substantial literature identifies seller holdout as a serious obstacle to land assembly, implying that eminent domain is an appropriate policy response. We conduct a series of laboratory experiments to test this view. We find that when there is no competition and no eminent domain, land assembly suffers from costly delay and failed assembly: participants lose 18.8% of the available surplus on average. Much of the inefficiency is due to low offers from the buyers (“buyer holdout”) rather than strategic holdout among sellers. When buyers can exercise eminent domain the participants lose 19.4% of the surplus on average. This loss comes from spending money to influence the fair market price and forcing sellers to sell even when the sellers value the property more than the buyer. Introducing weak competition in the form of a less valuable substitute parcel of land reduces delay by 35.7% and virtually eliminates assembly failure, so that only 10.1% of the surplus is lost on average.
M30|Price Aspects Of “Craft” Beer’s Competitiveness In Bulgaria|“Craft” beer is a special part of the “Wine production” class which attracts even more consumers in the last couple of years. The opportunity for an informed choice of a product or service that satisfies specific needs of consumers shifts the focus from the low price to th e product of high value for which it must be paid. The goal of this article is to empirically develop the determinants that influence the choice of “Craft” beer based on theoretically proven determinants of competitiveness of price. The scientific tasks can be summarized as: developing the determinants that form the value accepted and theoretical motivation of its relation with price flexibility; theoretical motivation of the relation between price flexibility and price competitiveness; empirical development of the key determinants of price competitiveness of the “Craft” beer in Bulgaria. In this paper there are used the methods of analysis and synthesis, surveys through questionnaires, statistical methods, market research and others.

M30|Does having the right visitor mix do the job? Applying an econometric shift-share model to regional tourism developments|Abstract This paper is the first to apply an econometric shift-share model to tourism. The approach allows us to isolate the growth contributions of changes in regional touristic attractiveness from those induced by the structure of visitors, but does not share the caveats of the conventional shift-share approach. Our application to regional tourism in Austria reveals important results: First, differences in long-run performance between regions are mostly related to idiosyncratic changes in the tourist appeal of individual regions rather than a result of more or less favorable structures of visitors. Second, none of several mega-events during the period observed seem to have left prolonged positive effects on the tourist performance of the host regions. And third, performance appears uncorrelated with tourism intensity of a region. Thus, from a policy and destination management perspective, tourism authorities and local suppliers should mainly focus on upgrading the permanent destination attractiveness rather than investing too much effort into landing mega-events or targeting the visitor mix toward promising source markets.
M30|The effectiveness of offering food samples to increase purchase involvement in supermarket settings|This study contributes to researching and strengthening the role of the concept of purchase decision involvement in the management decision processes. The results of the study provide information on how to boost sales innovation in supermarkets and which product categories to choose in order to encourage shopper involvement and improve customer loyalty. Products included in the survey are items usually found in the shopping basket of today’s consumers that have been assessed as important items of store promotions in several national retail markets in Europe. It is important to discuss how to accommodate the costs arising from new operations and how this would reflect on other operations and merchandise categories. The study examines consumer attitudes in the context of the Southeast European market. The paper suggests that offering food samples moderately affects the level of consumer purchase involvement. The results for all three categories of food included in the empirical study show that providing grocery store shoppers with an opportunity to taste food while they are shopping is an effective way to change their attitudes. The proposed hypotheses were confirmed.
M30|Kopieren, transformieren, kombinieren: Ideenklau und Plagiarismus in der Werbung|Die Allgemeinfreiheit und rechtliche Schutzunfähigkeit von Ideen - und somit gleichermaßen von Werbeideen - gilt als eiserne Regel unserer Gesellschaft. Die Möglichkeit, bereits bestehende Ideen als Basis freischaffender Kreativität zu nutzen, sie umzuformen, neu zu erfinden und mit eigenen Gedanken anzureichern, sichert den kulturellen, wirtschaftlichen und technischen Fortschritt. Und dies kommt schließlich allen zu Gute. Warum sollte sich eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit also mit dem Schutz von Werbeideen beschäftigen? Die Antwort ist so einfach, wie entscheidend: Ideen sind Kapital! Ideen sind die Existenzgrundlage aller kreativ Schaffenden - und so insbesondere auch der Kreativen in der Werbebranche. Herausragende Werbung ist heute, in Zeiten von Informationsüberlastung und Aufmerksamkeitsverknappung, sowohl für werbungtreibende Unternehmen als auch für Werbeagenturen von existentieller Bedeutung. Einzigartige Werbeideen erzeugen ihre Aufmerksamkeit jedoch nicht nur bei den Adressaten der Werbung, sie dienen gleichermaßen als Maßstab sowie als Inspiration für viele Werbeschöpfungen anderer Kreativer in der Werbebranche. Und so kommen immer wieder Fälle von Ideenübernahmen ans Licht, die in der Branche vielfach diskutiert und kritisch - meist jedoch ausschließlich subjektiv - reflektiert werden. So herrscht eine fatale Diskrepanz zwischen der einerseits alltäglichen Präsenz von Plagiarismus und Ideendiebstahl in der Werbebranche und der andererseits fehlenden objektiven Ursachenanalyse sowie des stark fragmentierten und äußerst komplexen Status Quo rechtlicher Schutzmöglichkeiten.

M30|Exploring Multi-Channel Shopping Behavior Towards It & C Products, Based on Business Students Opinions|Young people have rapidly adopted the practice of using a variety of channels through which to shop, especially for products that require thorough information on features and price. IT & C products fall into this category, and buyers using multiple channels benefit from the advantages of information from online stores and reduced risks associated with the acquisition from traditional stores. The aim of this article is to identify young people preference for buying IT & C products from companies that distribute them across multiple channels. In this regard, an exploratory research was conducted on a sample of 340 students. The main results showed the high frequency use of Internet as a means of searching the information needed for purchasing IT & C products, the low share of exclusively online purchase, the fact that they are being perceived by students as both a need and a desire, and the weak expression of views about products purchased in the virtual environment. Price and quality are the main criteria in choosing them. Originality of this article is determined by identifying students’ preference for firms practicing multi-channel distribution strategy for IT & C products. Basically, people that we investigated gather online information about these products, from companies’ sites, but they mainly buy them in traditional stores.
M30|Profiling Private-Label Avoiders| Many food retailers offer private-label products because of the strategic benefits they provide. Growing private-label sales could be advantageous for both retailers and private-label manufacturers. Conventional wisdom leads us to believe it would be ineffective to use traditional market segmentation and targeting to grow private-label sales because socio-demographics are not strongly linked with private-label attitudes or purchases. However, many studies found that perceived risks are associated with private-label attitudes and purchases. This study uses a survey to identify individuals who perceive there to be significant risks with private-label purchases or use. The profile of these private-label avoiders could provide retailers and private-label manufacturers with segmentation and targeting information and help them grow their businesses.
M30|Systemic Approach Of The Consumer Behavior|"In an era of globalization, we witness the encounter of cultures and the exchanges between them. Often, the cultural influences affect the consumer's decision to purchase goods. Many cultures have their own specific product offer, which is a way of promoting them. In this regard, a good example is the media culture called ""anime"". As a result, the consumer is faced with many decisions and its choice is influenced by many internal and external factors. When studying the market fluctuations due to the social, cultural, or otherwise influences, which may create new categories of consumers, we consider it is important to analyse the consumer behavior in the systemic terms, which could lead us to a new overview of the effects of these various influences. This paper proposes a mathematical model, starting from an original scheme, based on the Veblen theory. The study uses a simple matrix algorithm for the optimal solution of the dynamical systems with quadratic cost function."
M30|Can Money Buy Convenience: A Study On Income As A Motivator Of Online Shopping?|The fast and hectic life of professionals has created an essence of convenience and urgency in their activities and behavior. With the advent of technology and the swift internet era online activities are on a growing trend. This growing trend in online shopping has led to the consideration of this paper which aims to explore the role of individual income as a motivator of online shopping behavior. This study is descriptive in nature. It consists of primary survey of customers belonging to different individual income levels. The researcher has classified respondents on the basis of their individual income earned per annum into low, medium and high category. It investigates the influence of demographic factor income on shopping experiences of users of the major shopping websites of India. Data has been collected both from primary as well as secondary sources. The sampling technique used is convenience with a sample size of 755.The research results reveal that there is no significant effect of income on product categories purchased online. The effect of income on frequency of online shopping is not significant. There is no significant effect of income on payment mode in online shopping. Further there is no significant relationship between income and satisfaction in online shopping.The managers can benefit immensely from the results. Customers are offer driven in case of all items except necessary and emergency goods. The necessary items would sell even if there is no discount and offers on them. For other items offers and discounts influence the shopping behavior. The higher the offer the better the sale. Moreover to gain competitive advantage online marketers need to provide products and brands of higher value to customers. The cash on delivery facility should be applied to all product categories across the country so that every customer benefits from it. Care should be taken to manage reverse logistics as there should be a pick up facility from the delivered address if the product is not liked by the customer. Other services associated with the shopping process such as customer complaint handling and order processing should be made easier and smoother.This paper studies the gap in literature on motivator of individual income on online shopping trend. Extant literature has found studies on the relationship between household income and online shopping but not on individual income. Moreover the income has been categorized into low, medium and high levels of income as motivators for online buying behavior. It further draws on the research domino effects for implications for shopping website management and design, then suggests some ways to enhance performance for the website shopping industry.
M30|Complementarity Between The Functions And Instruments Of Internal Marketing And Human Resource Management|This paper aims to present comparatively the Internal Marketing and Human Resource Management’ domains, firstly through a theoretical perspective, and secondly, through a practical outlook. Therefore, in the first part of the paper, our main objective is to cover a complex literature review concerning the two concepts, in order to identify and analyze their functions and instruments. Moreover, in this first part of the paper, aiming to contribute to the approaches identified in the existing literature, we framed and presented a personal point of view regarding the functions and instruments of Internal Marketing. The second part of the paper is dedicated to the study of the managers’ perception regarding the interaction between Internal Marketing and Human Resource Management, in terms of functions and instruments. We carried out a qualitative analysis of the data obtained from guided in-depth interviews with managers from various hierarchical levels, in order to identify whether the interaction between the two domains can be perceived as overlapping, inclusion through extension, complementarity or independence. The results distinguish the complementarity between the above mentioned domains, from the point of view of the managers from different hierarchical levels involved in our research. The final part of the paper, draws a schematic list of the conclusions regarding the interaction between this two domains, as well as of several recommendations for companies in order to optimize their relationship with the employees, to improve their motivation, and, implicitly, to improve the individual and organizational performance.
M30|Influence Factors For Store Format Choice In The Apparel And Footwear Market|The choice of retail formats has been a highly debated topic in international academic literature for a long time. In Romania, this topic has been hardly approached. This study investigates the buying habits of apparel and footwear, as well as the factors related to the purchase decision from a particular store format. Factors considered are both socio-demographic (education, occupation, net income per family member, size of discretionary income, household (family) size, number of cars owned and shopping motivation.

M30|Aligning The Brand Identity And Brand Image After Rebranding|The brand identity and brand image are two concepts used extensively in positioning. Many brands underwent a rebranding process attempting to improve their positioning. The rebranding process can bring minor changes or substantial changes. Following the substantial changes, there can appear a mismatch between the desired identity and brand image. Brand image is persistent and it takes time to change it. This paper explores the challenges involved by the calibration of the identity and of the image in the process of rebranding. The alignment process is a dynamic one, an interactive and not a normative one. The results of this study highlight the elements that support the brand identity and image alignment: marketing communication, product characteristics and internal brand strength. On the other side, the efforts to align the brand identity and brand image are negatively affected by the attitudes of the consumers and their past experience with the brand.

M30|Service Quality Measurement And Demand For Insurance: An Empirical Study From Nigerian Insurance Industry|Insurance provides financial protection to the insured, though; its acceptance by Nigerian insuring public is still low. This can sharply be traced to low awareness of insurance service. More importantly, quality of service to the few who embraced it had been low. Therefore, insuring public perceives insurance service as defective because customers’ expectations are not met. The objective of this research is to find out whether application of service quality measurement will drive demand for insurance products. Hypothesis was tested to find out whether SERVQUAL measurement is not significantly related to demand for insurance products in Nigeria. The study adopts descriptive research design; hypothesis was tested using regression analysis. The study reveals that there is a significant relationship between application of SERVQUAL measurement and demand for insurance. It is recommended that insurance companies operating in Nigeria should adopt SERVQUAL measurement which will further increase customer retention and loyalty.
M30|Resource Allocation Heuristics for Unknown Sales Response Functions with Additive Disturbances|We develop an exploration-exploitation algorithm which solves the allocation of a fixed resource (e.g., a budget, a sales force size, etc.) to several units (e.g., sales districts, customer groups, etc.) with the objective to attain maximum sales. This algorithm does not require knowledge of the form of the sales response function and is also able cope with additive random disturbances. The latter as a rule are a component of sales response functions estimated by econometric methods. We compare the algorithm to three rules of thumb which in practice are often used for this allocation problem. The comparison is based on a Monte Carlo simulation for five replications of 192 experimental constellations, which are obtained from four function types, four procedures (i.e., the three rules of thumb and the algorithm), similar/varied elasticities, similar/varied saturations, and three error levels. A statistical analysis of the simulation results shows that the algorithm performs better than the three rules of thumb if the objective consists in maximizing sales across several periods. We also mention several more general marketing decision problems which could be solved by appropriate modifications of the algorithm presented.

M30|An Analysis of the Impact of Service Quality and Passenger Satisfaction on Passenger Preferences for Airlines: A Study of the Indian Aviation Sector|The primary objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between airline service quality, passenger satisfaction and preference. This study identifies the main factors of airline service quality, passenger satisfaction and preference and proposes a model examining the directional relationship among these three constructs. It is based on an empirical influence of the data collected from 200 passengers with Indian airlines during July and August 2015. The data are analyzed using a variety of statistical techniques. Factor analysis is used to identify the main factors of airline service quality and passenger satisfaction and preference. The segmentation of airline passengers according to their preference levels and psychographic characteristics is performed using cluster analysis techniques. LISREL 8 and path analysis techniques are used to investigate the relationships among the three constructs namely: Service quality, passenger satisfaction and passenger preference. The key findings of the study indicate that overall service quality is highly related to both passenger satisfaction and preference. The relationship between passenger and preference toward a specific airline is less clear.
M30|Consumers’ Purchasing Decision towards Food Products of Small and Medium Enterprises|The gross domestic product (GDP) of Malaysia has continuously increased from year to year. All industry sectors are responsible for contributing to Malaysia’s GDP, including the food and beverage (F&B) industry. The sales within the Malaysian F&B retail industry were forecast to grow yearly. This study is to examine Malaysian consumers’ acceptance of F&B products of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In depth, this study also tries to investigate whether consumers use experience when making a decision to buy SMEs’ F&B products in the hypermarket. Results from structural equation modeling shows that consumers are barely aware of the existence of SMEs’ F&B products and prefer to buy establish brands’ products in the hypermarket. Hence, we suggest SMEs be more prominent in marketing their products. This action will influence consumer decisions in choosing SMEs brands over established brands’ products
M30|The Impact of Service Quality on Customer Satisfaction: A Study on Selected Retail Stores in India|Shopping in India has undergone a revolution with the introduction of modern formats, multiple channels and huge shifts in consumer buying behavior. Modern retailing has entered into India as is observed in the form of sprawling shopping centers, multi-storied malls and the huge complexes that offer shopping, entertainment and food all under one roof. Several studies have shown that customer satisfaction in retailing depends to a large extent on the perceived quality of service offered by the retailer. Managing perceived service quality means that the firm has to match the expected service and perceived service to each other so that consumer satisfaction is achieved. This paper aims to understand the importance and impact of service quality on the satisfaction of customers in selected retail stores in 3 Indian cities using SERVQUAL and GAP models. The paper also looks at the various service quality models and tries to assess their relative importance in successfully measuring service quality. Weighted averages and analysis of variance is applied in relevant places in order to critically examine the customers’ perception towards service quality which will ultimately contribute information for the growth of performance of the organized retail outlets.
M30|Perceived Risk, Trust and Information Seeking Behavior as Antecedents of Online Apparel Buying Behavior in India: An Exploratory Study in Context of Rajasthan|The growing use of social media is changing the consumer buying behavior across countries and regions. However, consumers in a developing region like Rajasthan are generally described as risk reluctant and hence the impact of social media on consumer online buying behavior is a pertinent topic of interest to marketers and researchers. Evidence of empirical research in this area is very limited. This research paper attempts to study the purchase behavior of consumers who buy apparels through the e-commerce system of social media by examining a random sample of 404 consumers from Rajasthan. Factors driving consumers to purchase online apparels through e-commerce in social media included information seeking, perceived risk, and trust. The empirical research findings through an SPSS 22 analysis suggest that there is a moderate to significant effect of social media on online apparel buying behavior in Rajasthan, with trust being the most significantly affected element followed by perceived risk and information seeking behavior.
M30|Consumer Brand Relationships|We have investigated the dynamics of how consumer make relationship with brand (non-human entities) that is consumer brand relationships. This relationship is like the same relationship between two people in the society. Meta-analytic literature review has been conducted to explore different aspect of this relationship dynamics. The investigation reveals that brands work as a relationship partners with consumers. Relationship dimensions, which are considered as ground of relationship types, constructed by authors differs resulting different types consumer brand relationships. However, various authors measure relationship quality based on the same ground relationship strength and feelings using different theories. This research has implications for both academicians and practitioners as they can comprehensively conceptualize the consumer brand relationship, its nature, type and dimensions explored by researchers and their present state.
M30|Effects of Technological Innovation in Relationship between Green Supply Chain Management Practices and Green Performance|Although scholars have conceptualised on green supply chain management practices (GSCMPs) and green performance (GP), evidence to validate the conceptualisation was lacking, albeit in the context of small and medium enterprises. In addition, effect of technological innovation on supply chain practices and GP was largely unexplored by researchers. Therefore this study validates and provides empirical evidence on the relationship between GSCMPs, technological innovation and GP, in the context of manufacturing small and medium enterprises in Nigeria. A well-structured questionnaire was administered on conveniently selected manufacturing small and medium enterprises in Yola, Adamawa State of Nigeria. Both descriptive and inferential statistical tools such as frequencies, means, standard deviation, Pearson correlation, multiple regression, independent samples t-test and analysis of variance were used in analyzing data and reporting results. Findings revealed that positive significant relationship exist between GSCMPs and GP in small and medium enterprises. Also, technological innovation was found to have influenced the GP of small and medium enterprises, thereby exhibiting partial mediating effect in the conceptualised relationship. This study has succeeded in validating the aforementioned conceptualization as well as advancing the GSCM theory in emerging economies. Practical implications on how to enhance supply chain practices within the context of manufacturing small and medium enterprises in Nigeria were discussed. Recommendations for future research were stated accordingly.

M30|Better the devil you know? How product familiarity affects usage versatility of foods and beverages|Appropriateness of use evaluations can be used to explore consumers’ associations between products and usage situations. The degree of familiarity consumers have with a certain product has recently been suggested as a mediator of these evaluations, influencing both the number and the type of associations consumers hold with food and beverages. In this work, we extend previous results across multiple product categories, hereby generalizing the findings. Four consumer studies were conducted using fruit names (N=246), white wine images (N=112), chocolate bar images (N=192), and kiwifruit images (N=302) as test stimuli. In each study, consumers rated their perceived familiarity with each stimulus and evaluated the appropriateness of use in a range of situations relevant to the product category. Familiarity was confirmed as a moderator of appropriateness of use evaluations, and was positively linked to product versatility. Since familiarity is related to an individual’s exposure to a product, this could indicate that consumers use past experience with a product as a heuristic for their appropriateness evaluations. The variance in appropriateness evaluations explained by familiarity alone was, however, limited, and product-context associations were also contingent upon specific product characteristics. Taken together, the four studies reported here confirm that product familiarity is related to usage versatility, and indicate that consumers may find it challenging to envisage how unfamiliar food products can be incorporated into their existing dietary practices.

M30|Le banche di fronte alla sfida del social banking|I social media rappresentano un fenomeno attuale e rilevante per il settore bancario: il loro impiego accanto o al posto degli sportelli tradizionali influenza il modo di comunicare lâ€™offerta di servizi finanziari e la gestione delle relazioni con clienti e stakeholders. Anche per gli istituti di credito, dunque, cresce lâ€™importanza di conoscere e di monitorare lâ€™attivitÃ che si sviluppa sulle piattaforme di networking, soprattutto in una fase storica in cui per le note vicende di cui sono state protagoniste le banche (in Italia e nel mondo) si avverte lâ€™esigenza di recuperare la fiducia perduta anche attraverso la ricerca di una piÃ¹ stretta social intimacy con il pubblico. Lo scopo di questo lavoro Ã¨ duplice: da un lato, conoscere i contenuti che le banche e gli utenti condividono su due tra i piÃ¹ noti e frequentati social media e, dallâ€™altro, comprendere il ruolo dei canali digitali nei nuovi modelli di business degli istituti di credito.Per raggiungere tali obiettivi Ã¨ stata registrata lâ€™attivitÃ su Facebook e Twitter di 4 importanti banche, rilevando oltre 11.500 contenuti nel corso di 18 mesi di osservazione. I dati, elaborati mediante content analysis, mettono in evidenza analogie e differenze nellâ€™uso dei social media e mostrano come i nuovi canali digitali possono contribuire allo sviluppo delle relazioni clienti-banche e, piÃ¹ in generale, alla creazione di valore.
M30|Nation Branding in the XXI century – A Conceptual Approach|In a more and more globalized world, countries must make high efforts to differentiate between them and to create a competitive advantage. Given the economic development at present, no country can afford to remain isolated from the world economy and should make consistent efforts to adapt quickly. The market became almost homogenous and that’s why nations must explore every niche they find. But in order to be successful they need to make those niches relevant to the consumers. And one of the ways to do this is through nation branding. The aim of this paper is to analyze the steps which led to nation branding and to explain the concept by making a review of one of the most important authors who studied this phenomenon. What is nation branding? How this concept appeared and why countries should brand themselves instead of allowing the stereotypes to define them completely are the questions that this article tries to answer.
M30|Small Firms Internationalization: Reducing The Psychic Distance Using Social Networks|This article investigates the role of social networking sites in the internationalization of small businesses. More specifically, we explore the effect social networks have on the level of psychic distance and how these new tools are used in order to reduce the perceived risk and strengthen business relationships. The multiple case study based on a two-year observation period shows that, besides their cost advantage in terms of advertising and communication, social networks support crucial marketing efforts such as the identification of new business opportunities and foster the development of professional and personal relationships with foreign partners. In turn, these tools facilitate and sometimes, accelerate, the internationalization of small businesses by lowering the perceived risks and the psychic distance characterizing new foreign markets.
M30|Do Consumers Recall Productsâ€™ Warning Labels? A Meta-Analysi|Meta-analysis is a statistical technique that allows one to combine the results from multiple studies to glean inferences on the overall importance of a certain phenomenon. This study employs a substantive metaanalysis approach to quantitatively summarize the results of empirical studies of the direct impact of productsâ€™ warning labels on consumersâ€™ recall. When all the available estimates are combined and averaged, there seems to be a genuine and positive effect of warning labels on consumersâ€™ recall (average effect size = 0.34, aggregate n = 1882). The findings of this study significantly refine the body of knowledge concerning the impact of productsâ€™ warning labels on consumersâ€™ recall, and thereby offer an improved conceptual framework for marketers and warning label designers.

M30|Eficiencia Del Plan De Marketing Como Técnica De Aprendizaje Cooperativo / Effectiveness Of Marketing Plan As Cooperative Learning Technique|Es innegable la importancia que el trabajo en equipo tiene como capacidad transversal en los nuevos planes de estudio universitarios. Por ello, es importante conocer qué es el aprendizaje cooperativo y su eficiencia sobre los equipos de estudiantes que lo utilizan. El objetivo de este artículo consiste en operacionalizar el concepto de aprendizaje cooperativo y estudiar sus consecuencias sobre el aprendizaje individual de los miembros de un equipo y el rendimiento global obtenido por el mismo. Se utilizan los modelos de ecuaciones estructurales sobre una muestra de 319 alumnos en una asignatura de marketing en una universidad pública española. Los resultados obtenidos señalan que el aprendizaje cooperativo mejora el aprendizaje de la asignatura en la que se aplica y el rendimiento del equipo, por lo que abogamos por que se favorezca su uso en las aulas y proponemos nuevas líneas de investigación para completar nuestro conocimiento sobre el aprendizaje cooperativo. / The importance of teamwork as a core capacity in the new university curricula is beyond all doubt. It is therefore crucial to know what cooperative learning is and how efficient it is for teams of students that use it. Thus, the aim of this paper is to operationalise the concept of cooperative learning and to study its consequences on both the individual learning of the members of a team and on the overall performance achieved by the team as a whole. Structural equation models were used on a sample of 319 students in a marketing subject at a Spanish public university. The results obtained show that students learn better in subjects in which cooperative learning is applied, and the team’s performance also improves. We therefore fully endorse fostering its use in the classroom. Lastly, several new lines of research are proposed to complete current knowledge about cooperative learning
M30|Does Online Group Buying Benefit or Destroy Retail Businesses?|There is Before adopting a group buying strategy, retailers need to recognize the role of group buying and whether this strategy is beneficial or detrimental. Our data are a product of surveys from over 200 customers. The results revealed that group buying agent is beneficial to retailers.

Our research also showed that customer satisfaction positively influences repeated purchases through group buying agents and future purchases with retailers at regular price.
M30|The Effects of Publicity on Demand: The Case of Anti-Cholesterol Drugs|Over the past 10 years there has been increased recognition of the importance of publicity as a means of generating product awareness. Despite this, previous research has seldom investigated the impact of publicity on demand. We contribute to the literature by (i) proposing a new method for the interpretation of publicity data, one that maps the information in news articles (or broadcasts) to a multidimensional attribute space; (ii) investigating how different types of publicity affect demand; and (iii) investigating how different types of publicity interact with firms’ own marketing communication efforts. We study these issues for statins. We find that publicity plays an important role both for expanding the market for statins and for determining which statins patients or physicians choose. We also find evidence that publicity can serve as either a substitute or a complement for traditional marketing channels depending on the complexity of the information type. We argue that the interaction results are driven by the relative strengths of the corroborative and rational inattention functions in publicity. These results suggest that managers should be aware of the interactions between publicity and traditional marketing channels to better determine how to allocate their marketing expenditures.
M30|Market Orientation and Business Performance: a Study of Interrelationships and Effects in a Small sized Hotels within Lagos State Metropolis|The relationship between market orientation and business performance has been a subject of debate in marketing literature. To date, there is no consensus opinion and empirical study in the context of small sized-hotels in Nigeria is scanty. This study examines the relationship between market orientation and business performance. Cross-sectional survey research design was adopted. Questionnaire was used to obtained data from 300 employees of the selected hotels within Lagos metropolis. Data collected were analyzed using correlation and regression analysis. The results suggest that only customer orientation is significantly contributing to the performance of the small sized hotel operators. Specifically, both competitor orientation and inter-functional coordination, though practiced by the hotels are not significantly linked to its performance. Furthermore, the study discovered that market orientation practices significantly influence business performance of the selected hotels. Based on the findings, the study concludes that hotel operators need market orientation practices to enhance their performance. Hence, market orientation will continue to be a vital strategy not only in improving firm’s understanding of customers’ and competitors, but to enhance synergy across the organization. From the preceding conclusion, the study recommends that hotel operators should commit substantial resources and effort in cultivating a customer oriented culture, and transmit it across the organization to create strategic alignment. Furthermore, the competitive environment should be closely monitored to identify profitable business opportunity and threats that could affect their growth and sustainability.

M30|Impact of Brand Dynamics on Insurance Premiums in Turkey|"This paper examines influences of brand dynamics on insurance premium productions in Turkey using a dynamic GMM panel estimation technique sampling 31 insurance firms over 2005-2015. The results reveals that brands trust appears as a chief driving force behind premium production where its unit increase augments premium outputs by 5.32 million Turkish Liras (TL). Moreover, the brand value of firms also appears a statistically significant determinant of premium sales, but its size impact remains limited comparing to brand trust, i.e. a million TL increase in brand value generates only 0.02 million TL increase in sales. On the other hand, the study also documents a strong momentum driven from past years premium production with trade-off magnitude of 1 to 0.85. This might imply a higher loyalty-stickiness of customers in Turkey, as well as a self-feeding ""bandwagon effect""."

M30|Perception of Local Food Labelling by Generation Z: An Eye-Tracking Experiment|The subject of this research is to reveal the customer’s approach towards local food in general and to explore the impact of its labelling on consumer perceptions. The main objective is to find out if an eco-label, a local-label or a bio-label has an impact on consumer behaviour. The following methods were used during the research: eye-tracking technology, in-depth interviews, the A/B testing method, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test and the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test for testing hypotheses. Data were collected from the eye-tracking device in December 2015 and additionally revised for higher validation. In total, the observation contains 121 respondents (63 participants in the reference group – A, and 58 participants in the control group – B). Participants are defined as being from generation Z. It is assumed that the presence of the label on a product has an effect on consumer behaviour. The experiment itself took place at the eye-tracking laboratory of the Faculty of Business and Economics at Mendel University in Brno.
M30|The effect of backroom size on retail product availability – operational and technological solutions|Amid the conditions of increasingly fierce competition, retailers are doing their best to meet the demands of their customers as efficiently as possible. Through the ever-growing level of product availability they raise the quality of service, which is positively reflected not only on the growth in sales, but also customer satisfaction. In the opposite case, the out-ofstock problem emerges, affecting not only customers, but also retailers and their suppliers. Bearing in mind, that the causes of the given problem occur most frequently in the last metres of the supply chain, in this paper we investigated the effect of backroom size on product availability, depending on the retail format. For this purpose, we used moderated regression analysis on the sample of 80 fast moving consumer goods in retail stores located on the territory of the Republic of Serbia. The obtained results pointed to opposite movements in the smallest and the largest format. Whereas in superettes the out-of-stock level lowers with the increase in the backroom size, it tends to drop in hypermarkets. Therefore, we pointed to some in-store problems that cause product stock-outs in different store formats. In addition to indicating the potential causes of analyzed relations, this paper also presents certain operational and technological solutions related to their mitigation.
M30|Towards Sustainable Marketing: Strategy in Slovak Companies|Despite the growing attention that is being paid to sustainability in the literature, little empirical research has been conducted on developing the link between sustainability and marketing strategy and moreover, only a few empirical studies have investigated this issue in Central and Eastern Europe. The conducted empirical survey examines the relationship between marketing strategy and sustainability from the perspective of enterprises in Slovakia. The authors have used binary logistic regression as an evaluation method. The empirical findings are based on 896 responses from different forms of companies in Slovak Republic. The results show that the legal form of a business organization is a relevant determinant of philosophy of sustainability when organization defines a marketing strategy and implements it into corporate strategy. Based on the results it can also be concluded that the environmental aspect of sustainability is determined by the size of organization and the sector of national economy where a company operates, while the social aspect is mainly determined by the share of foreign capital in the ownership structure of an organisation. This study contributes to the European research that studies the relation between sustainability and the marketing strategy by means of an empirical investigation in business organisations in a transition economy such as Slovakia.
M30|The Impact of Corporate Sustainability Strategies on the Financial Performance of Romanian Companies in the Context of Green Marketing|The current research paper aims at making a comprehensive analysis of the current green marketing initiatives adopted by the top performing Romanian companies, in order to understand the determinant factors that influence their green approach and to evaluate the impact of the sustainability strategies implemented on their financial performance. The research of business sustainability strategies in 31 top performing companies in Romania is conducted by analyzing their green marketing initiatives, the ability to communicate online current and past Corporate Sustainability (CS) actions (substantive action) and their future commitments towards green marketing (symbolic action). The authors also analyzed the impact of companies’ dimensions on their green performance and commitment, substantiating that the size of a company is a significant influential factor. The analysis of the impact of substantive and symbolic action on the financial performance of the companies shows that there is not a significant correlation between these indicators.

M30|Events Marketing 4-D Research|In this article, there is presented a 4-D research regarding events. If a 360-degree research takes into account the direct audience at the event, the organization that ordered the event and the company that organized the event, it undertakes a 3-D research, bearing in mind that the event is seen from three different points of view. A 4-D research, implies the indirect audience of an event as well, as it may be very important for each and every one of them. At a first glance, although the indirect public does not seem to be very important for the success of an event, they must be borne in mind for further editions of the event as those from the indirect audience might turn into direct audience. In this paper, we will reveal the most profitable communication channels for this kind of audience. And consequently, those, who organize an event, should be interested not only in how to modify the behavior and the way direct audience views the organizations, but also the ways and means by which the indirect audience's behavior can be changed at the same time with the manner they value the organizations.
M30|Can Voluntary Nutrition Labeling Lead to a Healthier Food Market?| This article reviews approaches to voluntary nutrition labeling (VNL), such as front-ofpackage (FOP) labels, that emerged in the 2001-2014 period to provide simplified nutrition information, thus lowering the search cost for nutritional information. We present a market model to assess consumer and producer responses to changes in information search cost brought about by VNL. We specifically focus on the introduction of VNL in the ready-toeat cereal (RTEC) market and illustrate trends in labeling and the overall healthfulness of RTEC products. Both the conceptual and empirical evidence suggest that VNL has been instrumental in attaining a healthier RTEC market. Finally, we suggest a research agenda to further theory development and empirical (experimental and big data) research to better comprehend the role of VNL in relation to market healthfulness.
M30|A New Vision In Sales: Satisfying Customer Needs And Social Responsibility|The new vision in sales requires, among other things, changing the salespeople's position towards the potential client by applying a philosophy that involves taking into consideration the people they come into contact with and providing solutions to address their needs in a disinterested manner, without having to pretend reciprocity. All this must be based on the concept of total sales utility, solutions to solve clients' immediate needs: the urgent ones, those who are directly related to them (financial needs), but also those arising from the use of goods purchased by the seller. The purpose of this article is to analyse how easily we can discover clients' real needs; under what conditions these needs can be satisfied through sales activities, and which the social responsibilities of the salespeople are.
