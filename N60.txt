N60|Early 20th Century American Exceptionalism: Production, Trade and Diffusion of the Automobile|The beginning of the twentieth century provides a unique opportunity to explore the interaction of rapid technological progress and trade barriers in shaping the worldwide diffusion of a new, highly traded good: the automobile. We scrape historical data on the quantity and value of passenger vehicles exported from the United States to other destination countries, annually from 1913 to 1940. We model the rise of US automobile from global obscurity toward a level dependent upon the extent of long-run pass-through of US prices into destination markets and destination GDP per capita. The results based on a diffusion model with CES preferences and non-unitary income elasticity shows that 62% of the gap in diffusion levels between the U.S. and the rest of the world is due to price frictions such as markups, tariffs, and trade costs, while the remaining 38% is due to income effects.

N60|Resource Abundance, Market Size, and the Choice of Technology|How resource abundance and market size affect the choice of increasing returns technologies is studied in an overlapping-generations general equilibrium model in which manufacturing firms engage in oligopolistic competition. The model is surprisingly tractable. First, for the steady state, the wage rate, the level of technology, and capital stock are not affected by the amount of natural resources. An increase in the share of agricultural revenue going to natural resources leads to a lower wage rate and firms choose less advanced technologies. Second, an increase in market size increases the equilibrium wage rate, level of technology, and capital stock. Finally, other things equal, a country with a lower endowment of natural resources or a higher market size has a comparative advantage in producing the manufactured good.
N60|The impact of real exchange rate shocks on manufacturing workers: An autopsy from the MORG|We study the impact of large real exchange rate shocks on workers in sectors initially more exposed to international trade using the Current Population Survey’s (CPS) Merged Outgoing Rotation Group (MORG) from 1979 to 2010 combined with new annual measures of imported inputs, a proxy for offshoring. We find that in periods when US relative prices are high, and imports surge relative to exports, workers in sectors with greater initial exposure to international trade were more likely to be unemployed or exit the labor force a year later, but did not experience significant declines in wages conditional on being employed. Contrary to the usual narrative, we find negative wage effects for higher-wage, but not lower-wage workers, particularly for those who are less-educated.
N60|Structural transformation to manufacturing and services: what role for trade?|Understanding how and why economies structurally transform as they grow is crucial for sound national policy making. Typically analysts of this issue focus on sectoral shares of GDP and employment. This paper extends that to include exports, including of services. It also considers mining in addition to agriculture and manufacturing, and recognizes some of the products of those four sectors are nontradable. The theory section’s general equilibrium model provides hypotheses about structural change in different types of economies as they grow, and tests them econometrically with annual data for a sample of 117 countries for the period 1991-2014. The results point to the futility of adopting protective policies aimed at slowing de-agriculturalization and subsequent de-industrialization in terms of sectoral shares, since those trends inevitably will accompany economic growth. Fortuitously governments now have far more efficient and equitable ways of supporting the adjustments needed by people choosing or being pushed to leave declining industries.
N60|How did Regional Economic Structures in the EU Change during the Economic Crisis?|10 years on, many countries and regions in the EU still bear the scars of the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Countries and regions have recovered at different rates and undergone different structural changes. While the asymmetric impact of the crisis across regions and sectors has had a short-term impact on concentration and specialisation patterns; long-term forces, such as global economic and supply chain integration, continue to shape the economic landscape of European regions. In our empirical analysis, we describe the development of regional economic structures in terms of sectoral employment and production (gross value added) during the crisis. We focus on the location pattern of sectors (concentration), i.e. in which regions economic activities in a sector tend to be located, and the specialisation of regions, i.e. which sectors are particularly important in a region. Our analysis shows that the impact of the crisis on overall specialisation patterns appears rather limited, although some regions have been more affected than others. In addition, the general trend of sectoral location patterns in the EU becoming more similar over time has continued, albeit at a slower pace since 2009, especially in Central and East European Countries. In terms of sectors, employment and production concentration in the construction and manufacturing sectors, which displayed clustering before the crisis, have been dispersing since 2009. The data also show that regions with large employment losses during the crisis were mainly specialised in agriculture, low-tech manufacturing, construction and less-skilled services such as trade, accommodation/restaurants and transport. This suggests that local economic structures may have played a role in the economic resilience of regions during the crisis.

Particularly, this academic paper analyzes the state of Serbian industry, which collapsed at the beginning of the last decade of the 20th century, after having gone through three waves of industrialization. Serbian economy and industry have not recovered from deindustrialization even after two decades of unsteady development in the current century. Lastly, it presents some possibilities to revitalize the industry and achieve its harmonious development.
N60|From central planning toward a market economy: The role of ownership and competition in Vietnamese firmsâ€™ productivity|This paper examines the role of ownership and market competition in Vietnamese firmsâ€™ total factor productivity (TFP) from 2001 to 2011. Making use of a large panel dataset of Vietnamese manufacturing firms, we find that, on average, both foreign-owned enterprises (FOEs) and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have performed better than privately owned enterprises (POEs) in terms of their TFP levels. However, while FOEs ranked the highest in terms of TFP in the period 2001â€“2006, SOEs â€œclosed the gapâ€ with FOEs in the period 2007â€“2011. SOEsâ€™ good performance may be the result of the state-led development policies undertaken during the 2000s. We also find that market competition has been effective in enhancing average firm productivity and reducing the gaps in efficiency across firms of different ownership types. Based on these results, we compare Vietnamâ€™s transition path with those followed by other countries.
N60|Análisis de la producción y del comercio de maquinaria agrícola argentina en la competencia regional (2002-2014)|Durante la última década, el sector de maquinaria agrícola fue señalado como puntal de un aparente nuevo modelo productivo. Este escenario estaba motivado por nuevos emprendimientos y el crecimiento en las exportaciones de ciertos productos de la rama, a mercados como Venezuela y Rusia, entre otros. No obstante, la crisis de 2014 desnudó los inconvenientes de la actividad. En ese sentido, reconstruimos los indicadores generales del mercado de maquinaria agrícola y de su mercado externo, sin obviar la perspectiva histórica, para comprender los factores que permitieron su desarrollo y también los que lo limitaron. El objetivo es aportar a la comprensión de los límites exportadores de la industria argentina. Buscamos comprender si los problemas actuales responden a una situación coyuntural o pasajera; o bien, si representan límites estructurales de este tipo de producción.
N60|Differential impacts of currency undervaluation on growth and exports in natural resource vs. manufacturing exporting countries|In the existing literature, we find a huge debate on the impact of exchange rate undervaluation (depreciation) on growth and exports. Some argue that undervaluation has positive effects on growth, especially in the case of developing countries. However there is ample criticism against the undervaluation leads to growth argument as well. The critics argue that large undervaluation discourages investment and in fact may lead to negative economic growth. Our premise is that the impact of currency undervaluation (overvaluation) would be different in countries with different exports structure, particularly between manufacturing vs. mineral exporting countries. This paper aims to analyze the differential impact of exchange rate undervaluation on growth and exports in different countries. We consider two sets of countries in our dataset-18 countries are included in manufactures- exporting sample while 16 countries are included in the minerals-exporting sample; Countries included in the former group have at least 70 percent share of manufactured products in total exports in 2010; while those in the latter contribute to more than 40 percent in total exports. This paper uses a cross sectional panel analysis using both five years average data and one year average data; pooled OLS, panel fixed effects, random effects estimations. It controls for the endogeneity problem by using a system generalized method of moments estimations. Estimation results of our study suggest currency overvaluation is good for mineral resource exporting countries. Moreover, results show a negative impact of undervaluation on growth and exports in both the long-run and the short-run for mineral and manufacture exporting countries. At the same time, negative coefficients on share of mineral exports on growth and exports implies the need of export diversification in many Latin American countries and Africa.

The latter can be termed ""welfare state sabotage"" and is a wholesale assault on essential public sector institutions and macroeconomic stabilization features that were built during the New Deal era and ushered in the ""golden age"" of the American economy. Starting in the late '70s, many of these institutions were significantly eroded by Republicans and Democrats alike, paving the way for the rise of Trump but paling in comparison with what is to come."
N60|Trade Shocks, Taxes, and Inequality|We study the impact of trade shocks on inequality using newly constructed micro and macro data. First, we use the Current Population Survey’s (CPS) Merged Outgoing Rotation Group (MORG) from 1979 to 2010 combined with new annual measures of imported inputs, a proxy for offshoring. We find that in periods when US relative prices are high, and imports surge relative to exports, workers in sectors with greater initial exposure to international trade were more likely to be unemployed a year later, but did not experience significant declines in wages conditional on being employed. Contrary to the usual narrative, we find negative wage effects for higher-wage, but not lower-wage workers, particularly for those who are less-educated. Second, sectors most exposed to trade shocks do not experience relative increases in inequality. Third, using aggregate international data for 31 countries, we find that various trade shocks, such as increases in trade with China, are not generally correlated with changes in the income distribution. Instead, using new historical data, we confirm a close connection between top marginal tax rates and top income shares, and find that the level of top marginal tax rates impacts changes in the top 1% share of income, implying that top income shares are a function of historical marginal tax rates.
N60|The business of fashion in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries|Fashion is a complex social and cultural phenomenon with strong economic implications. Historical analysis reveals that the mechanisms of creating and spreading fashion have not remained constant, but have varied according to social structures, forms of producing and distributing apparel and social media, while the level of influence of fashion on society has increased in line with economic development. This special issue of Investigaciones de Historia Económica-Economic History Research is dedicated to fashion as an economic phenomenon in the contemporary period. The four articles which make it up show the plurality of the subject areas, sources and methodological approaches in the current research on this topic. KEY Classification-JEL: N60. N82. N84

N60|Patterns of Manufacturing Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa: From Colonization to the Present|This paper reviews the Ôlong twentieth-centuryÕ development of ÔmodernÕ manufacturing in Sub-Saharan Africa from colonization to the present. We argue that classifying Africa generically as a Ôlate industrializerÕ is inaccurate. To understand the distinctively African pattern of manufacturing growth, we focus our discussion on the dynamic interplay between the regionÕs specific endowment structures, global economic relationships and government policies. We conclude that the case of Sub-Saharan Africa is best characterized as interrupted industrial growth instead of sustained convergence on world industrial leaders. This is partly because, until very recently, the factor endowments made it very costly for states to pursue industrialization; and partly because successive rulers, colonial and post-colonial, have rarely had both the capacity to adopt and the dedication to sustain policies that modified the regionÕs existing comparative advantage in primary production, by using their fiscal and regulatory powers effectively to promote industrialization.

N60|Strategic decisions on industrialization: case of Galati Steel Works|The industrialization under a communist regime has some particularities generated by the state ownership, centralized administrative planning and, last but not least, by the communist leaders’ visions on the roles of industries. During the reign of Josef Stalin, who considered that major role in the economy had to be played by the heavy industries, in the Soviet Union there were built large industrial complexes where the former peasants were transformed in industrial workers. His successor, Nikita Khruhschev, who had a different vision on industrialization, assigned increasing roles to the consumer-oriented industries and agriculture. He promoted also the specialization among the economies of Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites. This new orientation met the opposition of Gheorghe Gheorghiu - Dej, the Romanian communist leader who initiated, since the late 1950s, a gradually emancipation from the Soviet tutelage. An episode of confrontation between the Romanian and Soviet communists on the industrial policies was the 1960 decision of building a gigantic steel mill at Galati, a town from the South – East of Romania where Gheorghiu - Dej spent his youth. Despite the De – Stalinization process launched in the Soviet Union in 1956, the Romanian communists’ initiative followed a Stalinist type of industrialization. Moreover, when the Soviet Government proposed, in the spirit of the division of labor within the socialist camp promoted by Khruhschev, that the new plant should transform in steel the pig iron produced by their industrial complexes, Romanian communists viewed this plan as a threat to the country’s economic development and they rejected it. This paper explores some circumstances of the decision on building of the new steel mill which dramatically changed the economic and social profile of Galati.
N60|Energy Consumption, Institutional Quality and the Performance of the Manufacturing Sector in Nigeria (1999-2013)|This study assessed the effect of energy consumption and institutional quality, on the performance of the manufacturing sector in Nigeria between 1999 and 2013 through the use of the ordinary least square technique. The study used three measures of institutional quality: Economic freedom index, corruption perception index and contract intensive money. On the other hand, the industrial sector consumption of electricity (CSL), the total consumption of gas (GCS) and the total consumption of petroleum (PCN) were used as proxies for the consumption of energy. The results of the study show that industrial sector consumption of electricity, petroleum and gas do not have a significant impact on manufacturing sector performance. The results also indicated that the level of corruption perception has a significant effect on the performance of the manufacturing sector. Based on this, the study makes several recommendations including: the improvement in the country’s capacity to refine petroleum products; the maintenance of the current policy stand in the electricity industry by the new government; the removal of executive interference in the operations of the country’s institutions.
N60|Section 4. Real sector of the economy|Analysis of the dynamics of the Russian economy macroeconomic indices for the period 2009–2014 showed that the gradual decline of economic growth was accompanied by increasing disparity in production, a decrease in innovation by manufacturers and increased problems related to the imbalance of the technical and technological characteristics of the basic funds and investments in fixed assets in basic economic activities. Development, based on the extensive use of the main factors, increase in production costs reduced the competitive ability of the Russian economy. Expanding domestic consumer demand was supported by the growth of salaries outstripping labour productivity. The growth of investments in fixed assets did not result in a corresponding increase in return per unit of the resources used.

In 15 years, 60% of producers have disappeared. The main objective of this research is to analyze factors that influence business management, to contribute to the design of public policies and strengthen decision-making. The survey instrument was applied to 74 owners. The research design was not experimental. The study is descriptive and transversal. The results show that 84% do not have basic services. 89% have no landline, however 88% have cell; 62% have no email; 95% do not use online banking and 100% have no website. Informality prevails, and 91% do not bill. The most pressing needs were found in formalization, business management, marketing, finance and production. If appropriate measures are not taken, this activity is not sustainable for the regional environment that involves constant degradation of ecosystems.
N60|Explorative versus exploitative alliances: evidence from the glass industry in China| How do firms learn from their alliance partners? Do alliance learning outcomes vary among different types of alliances? Are the learning differentials contingent upon contextual factors in an emerging economy? To address these important questions, this study empirically delineates the nature of explorative and exploitative alliances, examines how they affect product and process innovations, and investigates how such effects vary in different contexts. Using a sample of 220 Chinese firms in the glass industry, we use the structural equation modeling procedure to analyze the data. We find that explorative alliances have a stronger impact on both product and process innovations than do exploitative alliances, product, and process innovations are positively related to both market and efficiency performance, and environmental turbulence enhances the impact of product and process innovations. Our findings provide implications for choosing between explorative and exploitative alliances in line with alliance objectives and firms’ resources, and environmental contexts.
N60|Can general purpose technology theory explain economic growth? Electrical power as a case study|Does the concept of General Purpose Technologies help explain periods of faster and slower productivity advance in economies? The paper develops a new comparative data set on the usage of electricity in the manufacturing sectors of the USA, Britain, France, Germany and Japan and proceeds to evaluate the hypothesis of a productivity bonus as postulated by many existing GPT models. Using the case of the diffusion of electrical power in the early twentieth century this paper shows that there was no generalized productivity boost from electrical power diffusion as postulated by many existing GPT models. The productivity gains from this GPT varied widely across economies and industries, suggesting that the power of GPTs to predict aggregate or sectoral growth is limited.
N60|The Construction-Development Curve: Evidence from a New International Dataset|Using a new dataset of construction investment in countries across the world for the period 2000-2011, this paper provides novel evidence of a bell-shaped relationship between the share of construction in GDP and economic development. The relative level of construction activity tends to increase in developing countries, to peak during industrialization and to decrease at a slowing pace in industrialized countries, approaching stabilization in mature economies. The curve fits better if economic development is measured by alternative indicators instead of per capita GDP, namely, life expectancy and an Economic Development Index (EDI) which takes into account per capita income, life expectancy, maternal mortality ratio and the share of agriculture in employment. On average, the peak in construction activity is reached at a per capita income level of almost €5,000 (at PPP, 2011 prices), or when life expectancy in the country has reached around 67 years. At its peak, construction accounts for about 14% of a country’s GDP. The curve is robust to the inclusion of control variables. Population density, demographic growth and credit expansion do not explain cross-country variation in the share of construction in output, while there is weak evidence that a less concentrated income distribution is positively related to the size of the construction sector.
N60|Determinants of success and failure in the internationalisation of the cork business: A tale of two Iberian family firms|The trajectories of internationalisation followed by family firms can be viewed from several theoretical approaches ? phases of the internationalisation process; international entrepreneurship, sociological perspective, family business theory. An historical perspective of the internationalised family firms, allowing the integration of these several approaches, is useful to a deep understanding of the internationalisation process of different sectors and countries. The main purpose of this paper is to identify the facilitating and the restricting factors during the internationalisation path of family firms, considering their competitive advantages, the ownership structure and management attitudes, innovation and intangible assets and other relevant factors, internal and/or external to the firm. It makes a long run analysis (more than one century) of two companies acting in the cork business in Spain and Portugal: Mundet and Amorim & IrmÃ£os. One of these companies - Mundet ? has been closed in the 1980s and the other - Amorim & IrmÃ£os ? became, and is by now, the leading company in the cork worldwide business. The careful comparison of these two stories, one of failure and the other of success, allows an accurate identification of the determinants of a successful internationalisation. In fact, it is useful for understanding several characteristics of both firms, some similar and other different, allowing the test of several hypothesis in the context of the theoretical approach to the internationalisation of family firms. First of all, both are family firms operating in the same business and since their origin orientated to foreign markets. Second, their story went along much of the twentieth century and so both faced similar national and international constraints but in the end both became leading firms in the cork business, although in different time periods. Third, their location choices were different and, although in both cases benefiting from agglomeration forces in certain phases of the business, they were also important determinants of the opposite destinies of these two emblematic Iberian cork family firms.
N60|The Economic Performance of Clustered and Non Clustered Firms along the different Phases of the Cluster Life Cycle: The Portuguese Cork Industry Case|This paper is about the relative economic performance of clustered and non-clustered companies in the different phases of the cluster life cycle. It starts with the explanation of a puzzling localization behaviour, namely that most of the Portuguese cork manufacturing firms are concentrated in Santa Maria da Feira, a small county in the north of the country, whereas the bulk of the cork is produced in the south (Alentejo and Ribatejo). The historical roots and past and path dependence of the trajectory of this cluster are examined, as well as the identification of its life cycle phases. A comparative analysis of the economic performance of firms localized in Santa Maria da Feira and in other regions of the country is then made, using labour productivity data for a long time span of several decades. This exercise is a quantitative illustration of the crucial importance of history for the understanding of cluster dynamics, as well as many other (evolutionary) economic phenomena.
N60|Relative Prices, Hysteresis, and the Decline of American Manufacturing|This study uses new measures of real exchange rates to investigate the decline of American manufacturing employment in the early 2000s, comparing it to the smaller decline in the 1980s. I find that US manufacturing sectors with greater initial exposure to trade in the 1970s were disproportionately affected by the ensuing dollar appreciation in the 1980s, and that more open sectors in the 1990s also suffered comparative declines in output and employment when US unit labor costs appreciated relative to US trading partners. Employment losses in both the 1980s and in the early 2000s were due to increased job destruction and suppressed job creation, and appear to exhibit hysteresis. Additionally, more open sectors experienced relative declines in shipments, value-added, investment, production worker wages, and total factor productivity as US relative unit labor costs in manufacturing rose. I explain the persistent effects of exchange rate movements on manufacturing using a Melitz model extension with sunk fixed costs, which leads to a dynamic gravity equation whereby shocks to trade have persistent effects that decay over time. The appreciation of US relative unit labor costs can plausibly more than two-thirds of the decline in manufacturing employment in the early 2000s.
N60|Performance trends in the construction industry worldwide: an overview of the turn of the century|This paper presents an exploratory study to assess the efficiency level of construction companies worldwide, exploring in particular the effect of location and activity in the efficiency levels. This paper also provides insights concerning the convergence in efficiency across regions. The companies are divided in three regions (Europe, Asia and North America), and in the three main construction activities (Buildings, Heavy Civil and Specialty Trade). We analyze a sample of 118 companies worldwide between 1995 and 2003. Data envelopment analysis is used to estimate efficiency, and the Malmquist index is applied for the evaluation of productivity change. Both methods were complemented by bootstrapping to refine the estimates obtained. A panel data truncated regression with categorical regressors is used to explore the impact of location and activity in the efficiency levels. The results reveal that the efficiency of North American companies is higher than the European and Asian counterparts. Other important conclusion points to a convergence in efficiency levels across regions as in North America productivity remains stable, whereas in Asia and Europe productivity improves.

The method was to examine the existence of a linear relationship between the variables with cross correlation and regression modelling. The examined period includes the nadir of the crisis and the first years of recovery. In the textile and food industries co-movement of time series show a strong correlation between output and staff number. There is a strong positive correlation in the case of the automotive industry, but no linear relationship can be proved between the variables in the chemical industry.
N60|Neo-Liberalism and Protest in West Bengal: An Analysis through the Media lens|Neo-liberalism is revival of liberalism that is radically dismantling the state and sifting power to the private sector. People favour welfare state and oppose any move against it. This paper attempts to gauge the protest in West Bengal against neo-liberalism. The recent protest in West Bengal that led to the electoral defeat of the Left Front is not only about land acquisition and loss of livelihood. Instead, it goes to the core of over three decades of left rule and raises serious questions about the policies adopted by the Left Front governments. This paper demonstrates that land reform and decentralisation of rural power, through institutions of local government, consolidated the authority of the CPI-M in the state but were detrimental to capital formation, necessary for industrialisation. Lack of adequate capital forced the left leadership to lure private investors to cope with the instability caused by increased aspiration in a globalised set up coupled with technological innovation. This being paradoxical to the political doctrine of the left resulted in a tension in the midst of an already unstable situation caused by economic stagnation and lack of adequate job creation in the state. The actions of the government to ward off the protests raise moral questions as to whether the CPI-M has the authority to claim to be representing the poor.

These conversion factors are based on economic census data of the countries involved, and from this information price ratios are estimated, which show the differences between the outputs of each country. The potential of the industry of origin approach lies on its sectoral comparative level analysis of productivity. This methodology was applied in this case for the manufacturing sector in Uruguay and the United States in 1988.

N60|Portugal before and after the European Union: Facts on Nontradables|The rise of nontradable sectors has been mentioned as one of the causes of low economic growth and external imbalances in the Portuguese economy. In this paper we describe the main trends and jumps in the evolution of nontradable sectors, since the mid-1950s, using four different databases to shed light on different dimensions of this issue. We show that, despite the pattern of the growth of the share of services being similar to that observed in other developed countries, since the early 1990s it has been significantly larger than in most countries. We find that the shift to nontradables in Portugal has been fast and that it occurred essentially at the expense of agriculture in the period 1953-95, and essentially at the expense of industry in the period 1995-2009. In 2009, the share of nontradables in total GVA reached 61%, if we exclude open service sectors, and 74.4%, if we treat all service sectors as nontradable. We also find that more than half of the change towards nontradables since joining the European Union took place in the period 1988-1993. Finally, we show that construction and services facing a strong Government demand were the main drivers of the increasing weight of nontradables in the Portuguese economy since 1986.

N60|Infant Industry Protection and the Growth of Canada's Cotton Mills: A Test of the Chang Hypothesis|I argue that the 19th century Canadian cotton textile industry was an extremely successful infant industry. Judging the industry's performance by seven widely-employed measures of success â€“ growth in output, contemporary opinion, size, the use of the most modern machinery, exports, and relative total factor productivity â€“ it is shown that the growth of Canada's cotton mills provides strong support for Chang's provocative hypothesis that infant industry protection was the way the rich countries of today grew rich in the nineteenth century.
N60|Rust Belt Politics: The national NAFTA debate during recent US presidential election cycles|The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) once again became a newsworthy topic in the US media, this time during the contested Spring 2008 Democratic primary for the US presidency, particularly from campaign talking-points originating within Midwestern Rust-Belt states. Although the merits of NAFTA were central to the dialogue during this campaign season, similar debate did not warrant deliberation during the time of the general election in the Fall of 2008. An examination of media coverage dedicated to NAFTA in the lead-up to the past three American general elections confirmed these tendencies. Even though the Rust Belt, which is considered the key political toss-up region in the for the US presidency, has the most at stake concerning NAFTA’s effects, it remains to be seen if the trade pact will elicit debate from the presidential candidates during the Fall election in 2012.
N60|Interpreting the Roles and Economic Importance of Cooperative Enterprises in a Historical Perspective|Cooperative enterprises have been in existence in all fields of economic activity for around 200 years, but they have tended to bunch in some sectors. This paper will examine which sectors have the most cooperatives at a world level, attempt to sketch out a typology and enquire into the reasons for this bunching. There are essentially four cooperative forms: Users cooperatives, Producers cooperatives,Workers cooperatives, and Social or community cooperatives. While workers cooperatives have received a disproportionate amount of attention from the theoretical literature, I argue that historically this has been the least successful type of cooperative and only recently has seen some revival in the service sector. The role of capital, management styles and intrinsic motivations will be considered to explain this historical evidence. The final section of the paper is devoted to drawing lessons from the historical material analyzed in the paper.
N60|Interlocking complementarities and institutional change|In biology, the laws that regulate the structuring and change of complex organisms, characterised by interlocking complementarities, are different from those that shape the evolution of simple organisms. Only the latter share mechanisms of competitive selection of the fittest analogous to those envisaged by the standard neoclassical model in economics. The biological counterparts of protectionism, subsidies and conflicts enable complex organisms to exit from long periods of stasis and to increase their capacity to adapt efficiently to the environment. Because of their interlocking complementarities, most institutions share the laws governing the structure and change of complex organisms. We concentrate on the complementarities between technology and property rights and consider historical cases in which organisational stasis has been overcome by mechanisms different from (and sometimes acting in spite of) competitive pressure. The evolution of institutions cannot be taken for granted; but even when institutions seem frozen forever by their interlocking complementarities, their potential for change can be discovered by analysis of those interactions.
N60|The Expansion of Silk Textile Export in Northern Italy, 1919-1929|The purpose of this article is to examine the expansion and the aspect of silk textile export in Northern Italy, especially in Como district, during the period of 1919-1929, when the Italian silk textile industry gained an international competitive advantage. The author would like to propound some views to which little attention has been given. Generally speaking, the modernization of management organization in the early 1920 fs accelerated the development of silk textile industry. Firstly, the textile machine industry concurrently came to grow, which made it possible to improve the quality of textiles and helped for the silk industry to acquire the new markets for its goods. Secondly, the increasing use of artificial silk from the early 1920 fs drastically changed the situation around silk textile. Thirdly, the silk textiles with the new additional raw material came to be woven under the mass production system. Fourthly, the silk textile industry tried to improve the design of silk textiles for couture, and succeeded in reaching the forefront of Italian fashion, cooperated with the government. All of the above-mentioned facts did start when the British government imposed tariff barriers on the silk textile. At that time, Italy had no choice but to develop overseas market. In the second half of the 1920s, capturing the new markets of Asia, Africa and South America, the export of silk textiles including artificial silk as new mass products remarkably increased.
N60|Was Canadian Manufacturing Inefficient before WWI? The Case of the Cotton Textile Industry, 1870-1910|Is it possible that generations of Canadian economists and historians have got it wrong and Canadian manufacturing before WWI was fairly efficient? Yes, because they do not pay enough attention to the measurement of efficiency. New cliometric evidence supporting the revisionist side of this question is presented on total factor productivity and five other measures of efficiency for the Canadian cotton textile industry, 1870-1910, an industry long thought to be grossly inefficient, which shows the industry performed strongly relative to the U.S. cotton textile industry and other cotton textile industries elsewhere in the world.
N60|An Evaluation of Asymmetric and Symmetric Effects of Oil Exports Shocks on Non-Tradable Sector of Iranian Economy|This study analyzes the relationship between changes in crude oil exports and nontradable and tradable sections to investigate Dutch Disease syndrome in Iran by applying a rolling linear regression and a VAR approach. We find a co-movement of oil exports with construction and service variables from the rolling regression. The non-linear model reveals that oil exports movements cause asymmetric reaction of construction, service and other variables under study. The variance decomposition shows that crude oil exports contribute to the variability of the key variables. We find a strong relationship between oil exports changes and tradable sector. Decreases in oil exports appear to play a greater role in construction variation than oil exports increases. For variable of service, positive oil shock plays a considerable role as a source of variable fluctuations. Moreover, we observe Dutch Disease through reactions of key variables to oil exports changes.
N60|"""Global since Gold"" The Globalisation of Conglomerates: Explaining the Experience from South Africa, 1990 - 2009"|The internationalisation of enterprises is one of the essential ways to strengthen the competitiveness of firms from developing countries (UNCTAD, 2005c: 3). Strong growth in outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) from developing countries has become the distinguishing feature of the twenty-first century. This OFDI flows from state-owned enterprises, sovereign wealth funds (SWF) as well as private enterprises operating as multinational companies from a home base or as free-standing companies. Multinational corporations have commenced activities since the 1960s by moving operations to resource-rich, low-cost labour and capital markets (Wilkins, 1970; 1974; 1988; Jones, 1994; 2005). The first wave of OFDI during the 1960s and 1970s was motivated by efficiency and market-seeking factors. This wave was dominated by firms from Asia and Latin America. A second wave of OFDI followed in the 1980s, led by strategic assetseeking enterprises from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea (Dunning et al., 1996; UNCTAD, 2005b: 3s). Since the 1990s China, Brazil, India, Russia (the so-called BRIC countries) Malaysia, Turkey and South Africa are among the countries expected to add significantly to OFDI growth (UNCTAD, 2005c: 4). The flow of investment funds from developed countries was expected, but the reverse trend displayed the emerging capacities in countries and firms outside the core of the international economy, which challenged the dominance of developed countries and companies from developed countries. These developments have prompted several questions: how do developing country firms succeed in entering global markets? Do these firms improve their competitiveness through OFDI? This paper investigates this phenomenon from the experience of South Africa. The emergence of EMNC (Emerging Market Multinational Corporations) prompted extensive analysis and debates about the nature of and motives for EMNCs, but has also led to more in-depth analysis of specific country characteristics and firm-specific reasons for OFDI.
N60|European acquisitions in the United States: re-examining Olivetti-Underwood fifty years later|While Italy's catch-up in the course of the 20th century has been nothing short of extraordinary, it has failed to produce a large number of global business players. Nonetheless, half a century ago an Italian company concluded what was at the time the largest-ever foreign takeover of a US company. The paper analyzes the Olivetti's acquisition of Underwood and frames it in the broader picture of the literature on the management and performance of foreign companies in the United States. We provide a historical narrative focused on three main issues: 1) head office control and subsidiary autonomy; 2) Olivetti's adaptation to the American business system; 3) the development of internal knowledge resources within the subsidiary. Lessons and implications are relevant for business historians and management scholars in general.
N60|Does hedonic price indexing change our interpretation of economic history? Evidence from Swedish electrification|Rapid price decreases for ICT products in the 1990s have been largely attributed to the introduction of hedonic price indexes. Would hedonic price indexing also have had large effects on measured price and productivity during earlier technological breakthroughs? This article investigates the impact of hedonic and matched model methods on historical data for electric motors in Sweden from 1900–35. The results show rapidly decreasing prices in the industry producing electric motors in the 1920s. However, the price decreases of electric motors in the 1920s were not on a par with price decreases for ICT equipment in the 1990s, even if hedonic indexing is used.
N60|General Purpose Technologies and Economic Growth: Electricity Diffusion in the Manufacturing Sector Before WWII|This paper evaluates the diffusion of electricity within the context of a GPT perspective. The paper develops a new comparative data set on the usage of electricity in the manufacturing sectors of the US, Britain, France, Germany and Japan and proceeds to evaluate the hypotheses of a productivity slowdown and of a productivity bonus as postulated by many existing GPT models.
N60|Virtual Teams: A New Opportunity to Develop a Business|Virtual teams give many advantages to organizations, including increased knowledge sharing and improve organizational performance. Virtual teams have altered the expectations and boundaries of knowledge worker’s interactions and make a new opportunity to develop the business. In this paper, we present summary results of an online survey. The online questionnaire was emailed by using a simple random sampling method to 356 Malaysian manufacturing small and medium –sized Enterprises (SMEs). The findings of this study show that SMEs in Malaysia are gaining to use virtual teams, and it can be concluded that virtual teams provide a new platform for developing the business in SMEs. Based on the study, we suggest avenues for future research that are important to advancing our understanding of virtual team effects on business growth.
N60|La evolución histórica e importancia económica del sector textil y del vestido en México|El objetivo de este artículo es analizar la importancia económica y social que ha tenido el sector textil en el impulso de la economía capitalista en México, a través del análisis de su evolución histórica en cuanto a su aportación a la inversión física, la generación de empleo, el volumen de exportaciones y la industrialización en México. El análisis muestra que el avance del sector ha estado asociado a las políticas gubernamentales de apoyo a la inversión extranjera, los esfuerzos para promover la industrialización del país, los acuerdos de libre comercio y la situación económica del país. Se concluye que si bien estos factores favorecieron en ciertos períodos el desarrollo del sector no ha habido esfuerzos concretos para mejorar las capacidades productivas de las empresas ni para la integración de la cadena textil-vestido. La revitalización del sector depende de la posibilidad de moverse hacia una producción flexible de paquete completo, aumentar la seguridad y a decrecer el comercio ilegal de prendas de vestir.
N60|Development Agency or Bank? Vision and Strategy of the World Bank in the 50’s and 60’s|Until the late 1960s, the World Bank presented itself as an institution devoted to making sound and directly productive project loans. This paper brings together historical analysis and theories of organization development to reveal that the Bank was unwilling to lend for housing programs not because these were not sound, but because they were geared toward achieving social welfare objectives and were not directly linked to productive investment projects, such as dams, power stations, and railroads. It was not until the late 1960s that the Bank began to take social issues into consideration, rather late compared with other multilateral institutions.
N60|Revealed Technological Advantage of the Finnish Industry|This study analyzes trends in specialization of the Finnish industry since the 1980s. Low technology industries, such as pulp and paper, have had traditionally a large proportion of the Finnish industrial output. During the recent decades their share of output has decreased significantly and Finland has specialized more and more in high technology industries, especially in ICT. The pattern of the Finnish revealed technological advantage with focus on ICT, and pulp and paper technologies differs from the pattern of the revealed technological advantage of many other countries. Internationally compared Finland has some technological advantage also in special purpose machinery, such as papermaking machines, special purpose vessels, elevators and transfer equipments, and in basic metals.

N60|The Demarcation of Land and the Role of Coordinating Institutions|This paper examines the origins and economic effects of the two dominant land demarcation systems: metes and bounds (MB) and the rectangular system (RS). Under MB property is demarcated by its perimeter as indicated by natural features and human structures and linked to surveys within local political jurisdictions. Under RS land demarcation is governed by a common grid with uniform square shapes, sizes, alignment, and geographically-based addresses. In the U.S. MB largely is used in the original 13 states, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The RS is found elsewhere under the Land Ordinance of 1785 that divided federal lands into square-mile sections. We develop an economic framework for examining land demarcation systems and draw predictions. Our empirical analysis focuses on a 39-county area of Ohio where both MB and RS were used in adjacent areas as a result of exogenous historical factors. The results indicate that topography influences parcel shape and size under a MB system; that parcel shapes are aligned under the RS; and that the RS is associated with higher land values, more roads, more land transactions, and fewer legal disputes than MB, all else equal. The comparative limitations of MB appear to have had negative long-term effects on land values and economic activity in the sample area.
N60|Latvian and Europe construction comparison: stability and reasons of crisis|Recently construction industry in Latvia has experienced substantial changes. Stabile increase of construction since 2002 has transformed to a boom in 2006-2007. Year 2008 characterizes with continuation of the boom in first half-year and with the rapid downslide in the second half-year. The downslide can cause the protracted recession not only in construction industry, but also in the whole national economy. In the paper Latvian construction industry is comprehensively evaluated and compared with the Baltic States and the European Union. State of dwelling funds, dynamics of construction industry and factors influencing demand, including solvency of population, desires and necessities; factors of commercial and government demand are presented. Industry costs are analyzed separately: natural resources, production of building materials, fixed assets and attraction of money capital, personnel costs. Possibilities to obtain profit while working in construction were analyzed. Basing on the analysis, suggestions for improvements in the industry activities are elaborated.
N60|Managerialism and the Demise of the Big Three|This essay is about the crisis of US automobile management and the difficulties that management educators and practitioners in America have had facing up to that crisis. It focuses on Detroit’s Big Three but it also looks at the role Japanese firms played in transferring JMS (Japanese Management Systems) to America, particularly the transfer of TPS (the Toyota Production System) to Georgetown, Kentucky. It opens (I) with a discussion of the triumph of a science-based “New Paradigm” in business school management education and in industry, with reference to its critics, in order to establish the institutional framework within which US automobile management expanded and operated after World War II; then (II) a more general discussion ensues in which U.S. managerialism and JMS are compared, and the pathways and barriers to the transfer of JMS to America both to US firms and to Japanese transplants are explored, before in the last part (III) the focus narrows to a specific case of transfer: H. Thomas Johnson’s analysis of Toyota’s successful alternative Production System (TPS) at Georgetown and how it supersedes in theory and practice the managerial methods of the Big Three.
N60|Industrialisation as an engine of growth in developing countries|This paper examines the emergence of manufacturing in developing countries in the period 1950-2005. It presents new data on structural change in a sample of 63 developing countries and 16 advanced economies. Industrialisation is seen as a single global process of structural change, in which separate countries follow different paths depending on their initial conditions and moment of their entry into the industrial race. With a few important exceptions such as Mexico, Brazil, India and China, developing countries embarked on industrialisation after 1945. The paper argues that successful catch up in developing countries is associated with industrialisation. It examines the theoretical and empirical for the thesis that industrialisation acts as an engine of growth and attempts to quantify different aspects of this debate. The statistical evidence is not straightforward. Manufacturing has been important for growth in developing countries, but not all expectations of the engine of growth hypothesis are borne out by the data. The more general historical evidence provides more support for the industrialisation thesis.
N60|"Neoclassical growth and the ""trivial"" steady state"|"According to a common perception, the neoclassical economy void of capital cannot evolve to strictly positive levels of output, if capital is essential. We challenge this view and claim for a broad class of production functions, encompassing the neoclassical production function, that a take-off is possible even though the initial capital stock is zero and capital is essential. Since the marginal product of capital is initially infinite, the ""trivial"" steady state becomes so unstable that the solution to the equation of motion involves the possibility of a take-off. When it happens, the take-off has no cause."
N60|Competitive Industrial Performance Index and It’s Drivers: Case of Turkey and Selected Countries|Competitiveness of manufacturing industry is regarded as one of the basic determinants of long run sustainable growth of a country. Therefore it is important to have an understanding of relative positions of countries in terms of competitiveness and determinants of competitive ability. This study aims to reveal the standing of Turkey in a group of countries and analyze determinants of competitive ability. The competitive industrial performance (CIP) index, taken to be an indicator of relative competitive ability, has been calculated for a sample of 33 countries for years 1985, 1990, 1998 and 2002. Panel data methods then have been employed to reveal sources of competitive ability. Conducted analysis reveals Turkish manufacturing industry to be lagging behind many of the sample countries and presents a grim picture for sustainable development in medium and long run.
N60|Vertical integration or specialisation: producing and commercialising cotton goods (1815-1913)|This article describes the ways in which cotton goods were commercialised during the nineteenth century and the first third of the twentieth. Several national cases are analysed: Britain, as the Workshop of the World; France, Germany, Switzerland and the US, as core economies; and Italy and Spain as countries on the European periphery. The main question that we address is why some cotton industries vertically integrated their production and commercialisation processes, but others did not. We present a model that combines industrial district size and product differentiation to explain why vertical integration was present in most cases and why there was vertical specialisation in Lancashire and Lowell.

N60|The Anglo-German Industrial Productivity Paradox, 1895-1938: A Restatement and a Possible Resolution|Recent research on international productivity comparisons with historical data has encountered large discrepancies between benchmark comparisons and time series extrapolations from other benchmarks. Broadberry and Burhop (2005) have recently argued that for Hoffmann’s (1965) widely accepted time series for German industrial output, there is no such productivity paradox, while for a revision of that series recently suggested by Ritschl (2004), the discrepancy between the Anglo-German benchmark and the time series projection is considerable. Attempting to reconcile the time series evidence and the productivity benchmarks, they discard the revised series in favor of the original, disregarding mounting evidence on its lacking reliability. The present paper restates this productivity paradox and proposes a possible resolution. We draw on recent archival discoveries by Fremdling and Staeglin (2003) and Fremdling (2005) that confirm the revisions to the Hoffmann series. We also draw on recent advances in the reconstruction of a German industry census of 1936, and argue that the productivity paradox is largely the consequence of mismeasurement in all versions of the German series. Correcting for the omissions, much of the Anglo-German productivity paradox disappears.
N60|The rise of China’s manufacturing sector : challenges and opportunities for ASEAN-5|This study investigates the trends of manufacturing export from China and ASEAN-5 (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore). The Balassa revealed comparative advantage (RCA) method was used to study the trade flows from these nations. The strength of the export specialization of the countries was measured using the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. The study was conducted using the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) product categories at three-digit level for the period 1993-2004. The results showed that China is not only active in labor and resource-based industries, but is also moving up in the innovation value chain—that is, it is increasing its presence in technology and knowledge-intensive industries as well. The dual-strategy adopted by China has serious implications on the manufacturing industries in ASEAN-5. The paper discusses the strategies and policies to enhance the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector in ASEAN-5.

The paper illustrates the strong link between economic ideas and policies with liberal ideals as the proper way to create a good environment for economic development and civilization.
N60|Cotton Textiles and the Great Divergence: Lancashire, India and Shifting Competitive Advantage, 1600-1850|The growth of cotton textile imports into Britain from India opened up new opportunities for import substitution as the new cloths, patterns and designs became increasingly fashionable. However, high silver wages in Britain as a result of high productivity in other tradable goods and services, meant that British producers of cotton textiles could not use labour-intensive Indian production methods. The growth in British labour productivity that resulted from the search for labour-saving technological progress meant that unit labour costs became lower than in India despite the much higher wages in Britain. However, the full effects of the rise in British productivity were delayed until after the Napoleonic Wars by increasing wage and raw cotton costs before supply adjusted to the major increase in demand for inputs. On balance, the effects of British protective measures were neutral.
N60|Cotton textiles and the great divergence: Lancashire, India and shifting comparative advantage, 1600-1850|"""The shift of comparative advantage in cotton textiles from India to Britain was a key episode in the Great Divergence of living standards between Europe and Asia.

N60|Do hedonic price indexes change history? The case of electrification|Rapid price decreases for ICT-products in the 1990s have been largely attributed to the introduction of hedonic price indexes. Would hedonic price indexing also have large effects on measured price and productivity during earlier technological breakthroughs? This paper investigates the impact of hedonic and matched model methods on historical data for electric motors in Sweden 1900–35. The results show that during the productivity boom of the 1920s, current prices for electric motors decreased by 13.2 and 12.2 percent per year depending on whether hedonic or matched model price indexes were used. This indicates high productivity growth in the industry producing electric motors in 1920–29. In contrast to Sweden, the US annual total factor productivity growth was only, according to current best estimates, 3.5 percent in Electric machinery compared to 5.3 percent in manufacturing in 1920–29. However, hedonic price indexes were not used to calculate US productivity. Finally, it is shown that the price decreases for electric motors in the 1920s were not on par with the price decreases for ICT-equipment in the 1990s, even if hedonic indexing is used in both cases.
N60|The Industrial Startup In Romania At The Beginning Of The 20th Century|The paper dedicated to the mechanised industry start-up shows the transformations triggered within this sector by shifting in various sectors from manual labour and technique to mechanised labour and technique, the latter turning out to represent in just a few decades the industrial production of the country. The industrial revolution, based on import, and the beginning of the industrialisation process have recovered over half of the century the economic delay in Romania’s development.

N60|China in the international fragmentation of production: Evidence from the ICT industry|This paper investigates the position of China in the international fragmentation of production in the ICT industry, the most dynamic and globally dispersed sector in the world economy. The evidence shows that during the 1990s China dramatically increased its market shares in ICT products and now ranks among the top three world exporters. Moreover, China has upgraded from mere assembly of imported inputs to the manufacturing of high-tech intermediate goods. As a result, import dependence has declined and the domestic value added of exports has increased. This supports the hypothesis that industrial upgrading occurred in some tradable sectors through technological learning associated with processing trade. Therefore, a pattern of specialization initially dominated by processing trade could be favourable to a country's long-term development, to the extent that entering at the lower end of high-tech sectors is promotive of catching up in more sophisticated technology-intensive production
N60|Industrialization and Urbanization: Did the Steam Engine Contribute to the Growth of Cities in the United States?|Industrialization and urbanization are seen as interdependent processes of modern economic development. However, the exact nature of their causal relationship is still open to considerable debate. This paper uses firm-level data from the manuscripts of the decennial censuses between 1850 and 1880 to examine whether the adoption of the steam engine as the primary power source by manufacturers during industrialization contributed to urbanization. While the data indicate that steam-powered firms were more likely to locate in urban areas than water-powered firms, the adoption of the steam engine did not contribute substantially to urbanization.
N60|Complementarity constraints and induced innovation: some evidence from the first IT regime|This book takes up the challenge of developing an empirically based foundation for evolutionary economics built upon complex system theory. The authors argue that modern evolutionary economics is at a crossroads. At a theoretical level, modern evolutionary economics is moving away from the traditional focus of the operation of selection mechanisms and towards concepts of ‘complex adaptive systems' and self-organisation. On an applied level, new and innovative methods of empirical research are being developed and considered. The contributors take up this challenge and examine aspects of complexity and evolution in applied contexts.
N60|Electricity Diffusion and Trend Acceleration in Inter-War Manufacturing Productivity|This paper evaluates the link between the diffusion of electricity and the increase in labour productivity growth in the manufacturing sector during the inter-war period. A comparative analysis of the USA, Britain, Germany, and Japan shows that the trend acceleration in labour productivity is common to all these countries except Germany and is correlated with electricity diffusion. Germany’s labour productivity growth was nevertheless sustained in 1925 - 1938. The USA saw an earlier acceleration because the diffusion of electricity-based general-purpose technologies in production was much faster than in the other countries examined.
N60|Ronald Reagan and the Politics of Declining Union Organization|New union members in the United States are typically gained through workplace elections. We find that the annual number of union elections fell by 50 per cent in the early 1980s. A formal model indicates that declining union election activity may be due to an unfavorable political climate which raises the costs of unionization, even though the union win-rate remains unaffected. We relate the timing of declining election activity to the air-traffic controllers' strike of 1981, and the appointment of the Reagan Labor Board in 1983. Empirical analysis shows that the fall in election activity preceded these developments.

On the basis of this framework, we study the adoption of early information technologies, such as typewriters, calculators or Hollerith machines in US manufacturing in the period between 1870 and 1930. We show how the presence of a distinct bias in technical change in US manufacturing led to the opening of a window of opportunity for early information technologies, and how the presence of this bias influenced the technological search and adoption process of firms and how this found its final reflection in the rules and heuristics of the new regimemulation is found."
N60|Canadian manufacturers' relative productivity performance, 1907-1990|In this paper I calculate TFP ratios for a sample of Canadian manufacturers relative to their American counterparts on an annual basis throughout most of the twentieth century. The data used to calculate these ratios are drawn from both industry-level and firm-level statistical sources. I find that, in contrast to the relative labour productivity evidence in the literature, when TFP is used as the measuring stick, there is virtually no evidence of consistent and substantial relative technical inefficiency on behalf of the Canadian manufacturers represented in my sample.
N60|Brand Names Before the Industrial Revolution|In emerging markets today, legal protections for intellectual property are weak and enforcement is lax. Counterfeiting of consumer goods and infringement on patents, copyrights, and trademarks cost corporations hundreds of billions of dollars each year. Strengthening laws and intensifying enforcement has done little to alleviate the affliction. No end to the epidemic appears in sight. Cures for this modern ailment may be found in medieval wisdom by investigating the methods manufacturers used to market durable goods before legal protections for the initial expansion of industry in Europe.

N60|Evolution of organizational structure and strategy of the automobile industry| This paper is a historically oriented study of the automobile industry. It sets out to understand why have the structure and strategy of the dominant companies in the automobile industry changed in the way they have done. Our findings suggest three factors at work, namely the knowledge of car production and of customers, the capability of the technological system, and the business environment. The knowledge system represents the level of know-how and the availability of information. In a sense the knowledge system in the automobile industry refers to the level and the degree of diffusion of knowledge of how to make a car on the one hand and the know-how of customer demands on the other hand. In the history of the automobile industry the knowledge system has improved continuously and gradually. The technological system of car production consists of clusters of technologies that together form the technological base necessary to support or shape the car production. The business environment refers to the social system (economy, prosperity), the market system (the quantity and direction of the market demand), the intensity level of competition, the culture, the legislation, etc.
N60|Patents, licensing, and market structure in the chemical industry|The strategies of rent appropriation and market structure are inter- dependent. How firms use patents depends upon industry structure, and in turn, affects industry structure. In the early part of the history of the chemical industry, market leaders combined patents and secrecy to deter entry. Patents were also used to within cartels to organize technology licensing. The role of patents changed in the less concentrated post war markets. In bulk organic chemicals and petrochemicals, even chemical producers use licensing as an important means of generating revenue from process innovations. The increased importance of technology licensing is closely related to the emergence of a class of specialized process design and engineering firms that have played an important role in the development and diffusion of process innovations. In so doing, they have helped lower entry barriers and increase competition in the industry.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

N60|Két forradalom előtt?<BR>[Are we facing two revolutions?]|Nyugat-Európa a 18. század közepétől addig nem ismert gyorsaságú gazdasági fej- lődési szakaszba lépett. Különböző elképzelések, magyarázatok, amelyek közül nem egy elméletté is kristályosodott, születtek arról, hogy miért éppen akkor és ott tör- tént meg az ütemváltás, kezdődött el a máig is tartó radikális változások sora a gaz- daságban. Peter F. Drucker amerikai közgazdász1 legújabb könyvében a magyaráza- tot az emberi tudásnak a gazdasági életben való fokozott alkalmazásában véli meg- találni (Drucker [1993]). Érvelésében abból indul ki, hogy korábban a tudás általános volt, önismeretre, önfejlődésre irányult, vagy arra, hogyan fejezze ki jól magát az ember. A kialakuló kapitalizmus és az ipari forradalom azonban megváltoztatta jelen- tését. Ettől kezdve a különféle ismereteket már a gazdasági életben is gyümölcsöz- tetik. A tudás ezáltal erőforrássá vált, aminek hasznossága van. Drucker szerint a változás első száz évében, az ipari forradalom során a tudást az eszközökre, a folya- matokra és a termékekre alkalmazták. A második szakaszban, 1880-tól a második világháború körüli időkig a munkára. Ennek következménye lett a termelékenységi forradalom. A harmadik fázisban, a második világháborút követően a gazdaság még szélesebb körben hasznosítja a tudomány eredményeit. Túllépve a szűk anyagi szfé- rán, az válik a legfontosabb feladattá, milyen irányokban kell magának a tudomány- nak fejlődni a hatékonyabb és szélesebb körű gazdasági felhasználás érdekében. Mivel ennek az új tudásnak az alkalmazása a termelési folyamatokat vezető, szerve- ző, átfogó menedzserek feladata, ezek a változások a menedzsment forradalmának is tekinthetők.
N60|Human Capital and Productivity in Manufacturing during the Twentieth Century: Britain, Germany and the United States|In this paper we relate trends in the accumulation of human capital in Britain, Germany and the United States to overall production strategy and productivity trends. In the United States a strategy of standardized mass production led to high levels of labour productivity and concentration on the development of managerial capabilities, but neglect of the skills of the shop-floor labour force, while in Britain and Germany concentration on craft production led to greater emphasis on shop-floor skills. After the Second World War, however, British firms made an unsuccessful move towards standardized mass production. Since shop-floor skills were neglected, British firms were left in a weak position to take advantage of the recent switch of technological leadership away from American mass production methods to German modern craft production or `flexible production' methods, intensive in the use of skilled shop-floor labour within a small batch industrial environment. British manufacturing also adopted an American style `mission oriented' approach to R&D in contrast to the German style `diffusion oriented' approach, which helped to reinforce the move away from craft production. Since the 1980s, Britain has returned to a more skilled labour intensive strategy but still has a large skills gap to make good.
N60|Comparative Productivity in East and Wst German Manufacturing before Reunification|We provide comparisons between East and West Germany before reunification of relative levels of output per hour in manufacturing industries. The comparisons are based on the industry of origin approach which makes use of information on value added and employment derived from production statistics. Output is converted to a common currency with unit value ratios which are based on values at producer prices for individually matched products. This study shows that for the manufacturing sector as a whole, value added per hour worked in East Germany was 28.6% of the level in West Germany in 1987. The comparative productivity performance in food products and beverages and in chemicals in East Germany is well above this average, but the productivity level in machinery and equipment is below 20% of the West German level. The study deals with the problems involved with quality differences, and it discusses the reasons for the more unfavourable performance of East Germany when based on comparisons of value added rather than gross output. We conclude with a discussion of the changes in comparative output and productivity performance in the past five decades. It appears that even after adjustments of the East German time series on real output in manufacturing to a factor cost standard, the comparative productivity level of East Germany in 1950 extrapolated backwards from 1987 would tend to be unrealistically low compared to earlier benchmarks. This calls for a more detailed study of East German growth between 1947 and 1990 as well as for more historical benchmark comparisons between the two regions.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N60|Manufacturing and the Convergence Hypothesis: What the Long-Run Data Show|The commonly accepted chronology for comparative productivity levels, based on GDP data, does not apply to the manufacturing sector, which shows evidence of a much greater degree of stationarity of comparative labor productivity performance among the major industrialized countries of Britain, Germany, and the United States. These results for manufacturing suggest that convergence of GDP per worker must have occurred through trends in other sectors and through compositional effects of structural change. The persistent, large labor productivity gap between the United States and Europe cannot be explained simply by differences in capital per worker, but is related to technological choice.
