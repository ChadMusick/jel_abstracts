D89|Uncertainty Shocks and Financial Crisis Indicators|The current paper broadens the understanding of the role played by uncertainty in the context of macroeconomic fluctuations. It focuses on the implications of uncertainty shocks for indicators that tend to precede financial crises. In an empirical analysis we show for a set of four euro area countries that negative uncertainty shocks, while boosting economic activity, are followed by unfavorable reactions of financial crisis indicators. We conclude that standard uncertainty measures contain some useful information on the potential buildup of vulnerabilities in the financial system.
D89|Selective Sampling with Information-Storage Constraints|A decision-maker acquires payoff-relevant information until she reaches her storing capacity, at which point she either terminates the decision-making and chooses an action, or discards some information. By conditioning the probability of termination on the information collected, she controls the correlation between the payoff state and her terminal action. We provide an optimality condition for the emerging stochastic choice. The condition highlights the benefits of selective memory applied to the extracted signals. The constrained-optimal choice rule exhibits (i) confirmation bias, (ii) speed-accuracy complementarity, (iii) overweighting of rare events, and (iv) salience effect.
D89|When do people exploit moral wiggle room? An experimental analysis in a market setup|We investigate if decision makers exploit moral wiggle room in green market settings. We therefore implement a laboratory experiment in which subjects purchase products associated with externalities. In six between-subjects treatments, we alter the availability of information on the externalities, the price of revealing information as well as the nature of the externality, which could either affect another subject or change the amount spent by the experimenters on carbon offsets. We find that subjects do not exploit moral wiggle room when revealing information is costless. When a very small cost of revealing information is introduced, their behavior depends on the relation between prices and externalities. In situations in which it is relatively cheap to have a large impact on the recipient's payoff, subjects exploit moral wiggle room in order to choose selfishly. For other parametrizations, subjects behave either honestly egoistically or altruistically.
D89|Strategic ignorance in repeated prisoners’ dilemma experiments and its effects on the dynamics of voluntary cooperation|Being ignorant of key aspects of a strategic interaction can represent an advantage rather than a handicap. We study one particular context in which ignorance can be beneficial: iterated strategic interactions in which voluntary cooperation may be sustained into the final round if players voluntarily forego knowledge about the time horizon. We experimentally examine this option to remain ignorant about the time horizon in a finitely repeated two-person prisoners’ dilemma game. We confirm that pairs without horizon knowledge avoid the drop in cooperation that otherwise occurs toward the end of the game. However, this effect is superposed by cooperation declining more rapidly in pairs without horizon knowledge during the middle phase of the game, especially if players do not know that the other player also wanted to remain ignorant of the time horizon.
D89|Identifying a Better Management Method in Project Management Practice under Uncertainty Circumstances: A Systematic Literature Review|The aim of this paper is to propose a better management method of the practice under different circumstances for formulating strategy in project management of construction industry. The empirical data were absorbed from 40 studies related to project management between 1997 to 2017 by using Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach. Based on these data, the researcher analysed and identified the better management methods: the uncertainty management, and also found some opportunities and gaps of further research. In conclusion, a better management method for project management under uncertainty circumstance may be able to enhance the strategy formulation of project management.
D89|Momentum and Disposition Effect in the stock market of USA|This paper analyze whether momentum effect drives disposition effect and vice versa during the period of January 1963 to 2017 in the stock market of USA. To examine the relationship, Fama and Macbeth (1973) cross sectional regressions are performed in the study. The results show that disposition effect drives momentum but not the other way around. Furthermore, this relationship is also examined for three sub-samples, and we find that relationship between momentum and disposition effect varies over the time and one possible reason could be crisis as sample is divided on the basis of the dot-com bubble and global financial crisis. Another finding of the study is that along with the disposition effect, size also has an impact on the momentum effect. To further analyze the impact of size on momentum and disposition effect, we test the relationship between momentum and disposition effect on the basis of size deciles. The results demonstrate that relationship does not vary significantly over the size of stocks but it does have an impact on momentum and disposition effect as past cumulative returns, and capital gain varies monotonically with the increase in the size of stocks.
D89|Global Evidence on Economic Preferences|This paper studies the global variation in economic preferences. For this purpose, we present the Global Preference Survey (GPS), an experimentally validated survey dataset of time preference, risk preference, positive and negative reciprocity, altruism, and trust from 80,000 individuals in 76 countries. The data reveal substantial heterogeneity in preferences across countries, but even larger within-country heterogeneity. Across individuals, preferences vary with age, gender, and cognitive ability, yet these relationships appear partly country specific. At the country level, the data reveal correlations between preferences and bio-geographic and cultural variables such as agricultural suitability, language structure, and religion. Variation in preferences is also correlated with economic outcomes and behaviors. Within countries and subnational regions, preferences are linked to individual savings decisions, labor market choices, and prosocial behaviors. Across countries, preferences vary with aggregate outcomes ranging from per capita income, to entrepreneurial activities, to the frequency of armed conflicts.

D89|The Preference for Monotone Decision Problems|This paper spells out conditions under which a rational decisionmaker will commit ex ante to certain choice restrictions, in order to get extra information about an uncertain state of nature. We show that the envisioned limitations will then bring the decision-maker to solve a monotone decision problem. This provides a first rationale for the observed recurrence of this type of problem in economic life. From another angle, the analysis also explains why individuals and organizations resort to automatic responses and routines in some circumstances, and how this contributes to shape their environment.
D89|A Dual Process in Memory: How to Make an Evaluation from Complex and Complete Information? An Experimental Study|"In this paper, we will put forward an original experiment to reveal empirical ""anomalies"" in the process of acquisition, elaboration and retrieval of information in the context of reading economic related content. Our results support the existence of the memory dual process suggested in the Fuzzy Trace Theory: acquisition of information leads to the formation of a gist representation which may be incompatible with the exact verbatim information stored in memory. We give to subjects complex and complete information and evaluate their cognitive ability. To answer some specific questions, individuals used this gist representation rather than processing verbatim information appropriately."
D89|Do consumers choose to stay ignorant? The role of information in the purchase of ethically certified products|The paper analyzes how consumers access information about ethical certificates and how access to this information influences consumers’ purchasing decisions. Using an experimental market game and letting consumers choose between a certified and an uncertified product, this study finds that consumers do not ignore information about the effectiveness of ethical certificates in a systematic manner. Also, as long as the access to information is costless, varying the way it is provided to consumers does not influence the purchasing decision between a certified and an uncertified product. However, consumers are extremely price sensitive: once a small cost for information is introduced, most consumers are not willing to access it, and the share of consumers buying the certified product decreases significantly.
D89|O Mercado Segurador em Portugal: O Papel dos Gestores na Constituição de Provisões|As empresas seguradoras têm que constituir provisões técnicas com vista a assegurar que responsabilidades futuras perante os seus clientes e terceiros são cobertas. Estas provisões baseiam-se em estimativas não só incorporando dados passados, mas incluindo igualmente as expectativas de evolução da economia e da própria empresa. É assim expectável que o grau de otimismo dos diretores financeiros das empresas (Chief Financial Officers, CFOs) e as expectativas que criam estejam associadas às provisões que calculam e registam. Analisando as consequências da racionalidade limitada dos agentes económicos, das suas preferências sociais e na ausência de autocontrolo, Richard Thaler mostrou como estes traços humanos afetam sistematicamente as decisões individuais e os resultados, o que lhe conferiu a atribuição do prémio Nobel da Economia de 2017. O presente artigo encontra uma relação negativa entre o otimismo dos CFOs, e a constituição de provisões no mercado segurador em Portugal, no período compreendido entre 2007 e 2016. Estes resultados que têm impacto no ambiente concorrencial deverão interessar os reguladores, os acionistas e os profissionais do sector.
D89|Equilibrium-Disequilibrium Dynamics of the US Housing Market, 2000-2015: A Quantal Response Statistical Equilibrium Approach|In this article, we demonstrate that a quantal response statistical equilibrium approach to the US housing market with the help of maximum entropy method of modeling is a powerful way of revealing di erent characteristics of the housing market behavior before, during and after the recent housing market crash in the US. In this line, a maximum entropy approach to quantal response statistical equilibrium model (QRSE), introduced by Scharfenaker and Foley (2017), is employed in order to model housing market dynamics in di erent phases of the most recent housing market cycle using the S&P Case Shiller housing price index for 20 largest- Metropolitan Regions, and Freddie Mac housing price index (FMHPI) for 367 Metropolitan Cities for the US between 2000 and 2015. Estimated model parameters provide an alternative way to understand and explain the behaviors of economic agents, and market dynamics by questioning the traditional economic theory, which takes assumption for the behavior of rational utility maximizing representative agent with self-fulfilled expectations as given.
D89|The Intergenerational Effects of Parental Incarceration|We estimate the causal effect of parental incarceration on children’s medium-run outcomes using administrative data from Sweden. Our empirical strategy exploits exogenous variation in parental incarceration from the random assignment of criminal defendants to judges with different incarceration tendencies. We find that the incarceration of a parent in childhood leads to significant increases in teen crime and pregnancy and a significant decrease in early-life employment. The effects are concentrated among children from the most disadvantaged families, where teen crime increases by 18 percentage points, teen pregnancy increases by 8 percentage points, and employment at age 20 decreases by 28 percentage points. In contrast, there are no detectable effects among children from more advantaged families. These results imply that the incarceration of parents with young children may increase the intergenerational persistence of poverty and criminal behavior, even in affluent countries with extensive social safety nets.
D89|Ranking by rating|Ranking by Rating consists in evaluating the performances of items using exogenous rating functions, and ranking these items according to their performance ratings. Any such method is separable: the ordering of two items does not depend on the performances of the remaining items. When performances belong to a finite set, ranking by rating is characterized by separability and a property of consistency; this characterization generalizes to the infinite case under a continuity axiom. Consistency follows from separability and symmetry, or from monotonicity alone. When performances are vectors in R₊^{m}, a separable, symmetric, monotonic, continuous, and invariant method must rank items according to a weighted geometric mean of their performances along the m dimensions.
D89|Varieties of risk elicitation|We explore a variety of risk preference elicitation procedures that involve direct choice from a set of lotteries, including budget lines (BL) and binary choice lists (HL). We find statistically significant violations of the expected utility hypothesis (EUH) consistent with disappointment aversion, and also find violations of first order stochastic dominance, but both sorts of violations are mostly small and only slightly impair the predictive power of a parametric implementation of EUH. The estimated coefficient of relative risk aversion, gamma, varies widely across individual subjects (consistent with EUH) and also across elicitation tasks (inconsistent with direct implementation of EUH). An alternative nonparametric measure of risk preferences displays similar patterns. The two risk preference measures are highly correlated with each other for each elicitation task. Each separate measure varies widely across individual subjects and across elicitation tasks, with low to nil correlation between BL tasks and HL tasks. Some of the variation across tasks can be explained by attributes such as graphical vs text representation that have no role in decision theory.
D89|Multiple switching behaviour in different display formats of multiple price lists| A common approach to elicit risk attitude is the multiple price list with a series of binary choices. However, a frequently observed problem when using multiple price lists is that participants switch more than once from the safer to the riskier option, thus exhibiting multiple switching behaviour. The present study analyses whether the visualization of different multiple price lists reduce multiple switching behaviour. Therefore, we conduct two types of multiple price lists in two different display formats. Participants are randomly assigned into a textual or a visual group and carry out both multiple price lists in the corresponding display format. Our results reveal that different types of multiple price lists lead to differences in the extent of multiple switching behaviour. Moreover, we show that the visualization of a multiple price list can be an instrument to greatly reduce multiple switching behaviour.
D89|The Impact of Price Information on Consumer Behavior: An Experiment|"We conduct blind tests to examine the connection between consumer’s choices and price differentials, for two goods with different levels of observable quality, bottled spring water and toilet paper (we pose that toilet paper’s quality is more easily observable). We gave subjects two samples of those goods, with no labels for their brands, but with two different prices. Given that the samples were exactly the same, we aimed at testing whether the price differentials influenced their perceptions of quality, for a given level of quality observability. The most striking result is that quality information inferred via price differentials have significant effects on consumer choices, when such difference is relatively high and quality is not easy to observe. Moreover, in such a case, prices shape the perceptions of quality: ""If it is expensive, it tastes good"". In contrast, when quality is easy to observe, we find no significant relationship between price differentials and perceived quality."
D89|Bayesian Decision Theory and Stochastic Independence|Stochastic independence has a complex status in probability theory. It is not part of the definition of a probability measure, but it is nonetheless an essential property for the mathematical development of this theory. Bayesian decision theorists such as Savage can be criticized for being silent about stochastic independence. From their current preference axioms, they can derive no more than the definitional properties of a probability measure. In a new framework of twofold uncertainty, we introduce preference axioms that entail not only these definitional properties, but also the stochastic independence of the two sources of uncertainty. This goes some way towards filling a curious lacuna in Bayesian decision theory.
D89|Equilibrium trust|Trusting beliefs can be exploited. A trustful player who is cheated too often, should start trusting less, until her beliefs are correct. For this reason we model trust as an equilibrium phenomenon. Receivers of an offer to transact choose whether or not to cheat. Cheating entails a cost, with an idiosyncratic component and a socially determined one, decreasing with the mass of players who cheat. The model either has a unique equilibrium level of trust (the proportion of transactions not cheated on), or two — one with high and one with low trust. Differences in trust can result from different fundamentals or from different equilibria being realized. Surprisingly, under certain conditions these two alternatives are partially identifiable from an empirical point of view. Our model can be reinterpreted with the cost of cheating arising from an enforcement mechanism that punishes cheaters in a targeted way using limited resources.
D89|Sequential order as an extraneous factor in editorial decision|Abstract Does the sequential order in which manuscripts are submitted to an academic journal have any effect on the editorial decision? As an extraneous factor, the order of submission has no relation to the manuscript’s content. However, an editor facing a list of new submissions could be subject to decision fatigue or order bias, which would in turn affect the editorial decision. Empirical analysis of nearly 10,000 (first) submissions to a leading academic journal shows that manuscripts which were submitted earlier on a given day were up to 7% more likely to be desk rejected, without any order effect on the likelihood of a rejection after peer review.

D89|Description-dependent Choices|The standard model of choice behavior relies on an implicit assumption that a decision maker is not affected by different descriptions of a given problem (description invariance). However, the behavioral economics and psychology literatures provide well-established evidence that descriptions do in fact influence decision makers. In this paper, we distinguish between descriptions of objects of choice and consequences of objects of choice in order to deduce a decision maker's preferences over the descriptions from observed choices over the consequences. We provide a choice theoretical foundation for maximizing preference relations subject to the class of framing effects where description invariance is violated. JEL Classification: D89, D90, D91.
D89|The Reach of Radio: Defection Messaging and Armed Group Behavior|We study the role of FM radio messaging in discouraging violent conflict by armed groups. Focusing on the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), we collected unique information about defection messaging by radio stations in the four countries (DR Congo, Central African Republic, South Sudan and Uganda) where the LRA has operated. We exploit time and geographical variation, along with the randomness of topography that influences radio coverage, to capture the causal effect of the intensity of messaging on violence, and on the LRA’s strategic behavior. Higher intensity of defection messages leads to a decrease in violence, measured in both number of events and fatalities. We show that this outcome is mainly explained by an increase in defections among LRA members. In areas with higher intensity of messaging, we observe a strategic shift as the LRA tries to compensate these membership losses with increased abductions to recruit new members, and increased looting to reward members.

D89|Analysis Of Sustainable Development Using Fuzzy Logic Prediction Models And Artifical Neural Networks|ustainable development is a priority of policies in countries all over the world, regardless of their level of development; this is a dynamic and complex concept based on indicators with vague and difficult to measure characteristics such as resources, labor, education, infrastructure, the existence of modern equipment to ensure manufacturing performance and flexibility. A model of approach and analysis of sustainable development using these indicators with vague characteristics can be achieved by combining prediction models: artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic. Artificial neural networks are used in the study, as they have the advantage of working with hidden layers, and recursive backpropagation algorithms to predict the size of indicators for a certain period, while fuzzy logic is used for three-dimensional interpretation of interdependencies and trends of indicators. The model provides long-term, flexible management decisions by eliminating bottlenecks and assessing deviations from a target defined so that the final result ensures a fast and flexible solution through fast and durable reconfiguring.
D89|Social media and the design of an innovative enterprise|In the Knowledge era, innovation and knowledge are intertwined, being innovation a knowledge intensive process that firms must manage to become innovative. This study aims to analyze the relationships between the design elements required to build an innovative enterprise and the implementation of social media. It investigates how the practices of knowledge management are affected and continuously renewed under the pressure of internal/external forces like new technological tools/ habits and marketplace imperatives. The paper adopts a conceptual analysis approach, exploring different domains of the literature. A comparative analysis of short cases, based on a documentary research, illustrates theoretical hypothesis. In the effort to design an innovative enterprise, social media are useful as support to foster interpersonal interactions, restoring the human dimension to the core of organizational concerns. They do not create innovation but they may spur efficiency, agility and innovation if appropriate governance and strategic intent are at play. JEL Codes: D89
D89|What Are Analytic Narratives?|"The recently born expression ""analytic narratives"" refers to studies that have appeared at the boundaries of history, political science, and economics. These studies purport to explain specific historical events by combining the usual narrative way of historians with the analytic tools that economists and political scientists find in rational choice theory. Game theory is prominent among these tools. The paper explains what analytic narratives are by sampling from the eponymous book Analytic Narratives by Bates, Greif, Levi, Rosenthal, and Weingast (1998) and covering one outside study by Mongin (2008). It first evaluates the explanatory performance of the new genre, using some philosophy of historical explanation and then checks its discursive consistency, using some narratology. The paper concludes that analytic narratives can usefully complement standard narratives in historical explanation, provided they specialize in the gaps that these narratives reveal and that they are discursively consistent, despite the tension that combining a formal model with a narration creates. Two expository modes, called alternation and local supplementation, emerge from the discussion as the most appropriate ones to resolve this tension"
D89|How partisan voters fuel the influence of public information|I study sincere voting equilibria in elections with public information in a large Poisson game. In addition to rational voters, the electorate is characterized by the presence of partisan voters who vote according to their ideological position. I show that the set of public signals compatible with sincere voting becomes smaller as the number of partisan voters vanishes which suggests that, when the number of partisan voters is small, public information hardly manipulates voting decisions.
D89|Rational bidding in a procurement auction with subjective evaluations|In practice, procurement auctions often involve subjective evaluations of bids, especially when consisting of quality or design parameters which are hard to quantify. We formally define a notion of subjectivity in an auction environment and analyze the implications for rational bidding behavior. Our findings explain some observed bidding behaviors that are inconsistent with standard equilibrium predictions. Finally we examine the way subjectivity facilitates the practice of favoritism on part of the auctioneer.
D89|How corporate derivatives use impact firm performance?|It is an empirical question over whether the use of derivatives hedging among firms is actually effective in mitigating financial risks, and hence positively contributes to firm performance. This study uses three performance models (firm market value, ROA and ROE) and a two-stage regression to simultaneously estimate the performance and derivatives use models, to address any possible endogeneity problem. It provides empirical evidence, which is rare in Malaysia and developing markets, of the effectiveness of using derivatives for hedging among firms. Specifically, this study finds that capital market imposed a ‘discount’ on derivatives users – derivative use is negatively associated with firm market value. However, derivative use contributes to better ROA (and ROE), a key driver of firm market value. Firms with lower operating income margin tend to use derivatives to protect this already thin margin from the potential financial risks. Finally, derivatives users are, overall, better at generating sales from assets than non-users because derivatives use allow them to manage the associated incremental financial risks better.
D89|Intellectual property rights hinder sequential innovation. Experimental evidence|In this paper we contribute to the discussion on whether intellectual property rights foster or hinder innovation by means of a laboratory experiment. We introduce a novel Scrabble-like word-creation task that captures most essentialities of a sequential innovation process. We use this task to investigate the effects of intellectual property allowing subjects to impose license fees on their innovations. We find intellectual property to have an adverse effect on welfare as innovations become less frequent and less sophisticated. Introducing communication among innovators does not reduce this detrimental effect. Introducing intellectual property results in more basic innovations, with subjects failing to exploit the most valuable sequential innovation paths. Subjects act more self-reliant and non-optimally in order to avoid paying license fees. Our results suggest that granting intellectual property rights hinders innovation, especially for sectors characterized by a strong sequentiality in innovation processes.

D89|Decision Making And Saint Petersburg Paradox: Focusing On Heuristic Parameters, Considering The Non-Ergodic Context And The Gambling Risks|The Saint Petersburg Paradox is still a contemporary issue because of the great impact on the probabilistic theory and decision-making. This article proposes some hints on avoiding the trap of the infinite expected value (EV). The highly stochastic mechanism and its EV have always to be contextualized in the limited period where we take our choices taking into account all possible limitations deriving from the theory (including the non-ergodic features and some inappropriate consequences we may attribute to the EV). This contextualisation is one of the most important factors to consider especially when we deal with infinite quantity coming from models that may misrepresent our field of application and therefore generate paradoxes.
D89|Abnormal real operations, real earnings management, and subsequent crashes in stock prices|We study the impact of firms’ abnormal business operations on their future crash risk in stock prices. Computed based on real earnings management (REM) models, firms’ deviation in real operations (DROs) from industry norms is shown to be positively associated with their future crash risk. This association is incremental to that between discretionary accruals (DAs) and crash risk found by prior studies. Moreover, after Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002, DRO’s predictive power for crash risk strengthens substantially, while DA’s predictive power essentially dissipates. These results are consistent with the prior finding that managers shift from accrual earnings management to REM after SOX. We further develop a suspect-firm approach to capture firms’ use of DRO for REM purposes. This analysis shows that REM-firms experience a significant increase in crash risk in the following year. These findings suggest that the impact of DRO on crash risk is at least partially through REM. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016
D89|Another Solution for Allais Paradox: Preference Imprecision, Dispersion and Pessimism|Although there are alternative models which can explain the Allais paradox with non-standard preferences, they do not take the emerging evidence on preference imprecision into account. The imprecision is so far incorporated into these models by adding a stochastic specification implying the errors that subjects make. However, there is also the inherent part of the preference imprecision which does not diminish with experience provided in repeated experiments and these stochastic specifications cannot explain a significant portion of the observed behavior in experiments. Moreover, evidence on imprecision suggests that subjects exhibit higher imprecision for a lottery with a higher variance. This paper presents a new model for decision under risk which takes into account the findings of the literature. Looking at the indifference curves predicted by the new model, the new model acts like a mixture of Expected Utility Theory and Rank Dependent Utility Theory depending on which part of the probability triangle the lottery is located.
D89|Radical uncertainty, non-predictability, antifragility and risk-sharing Islamic finance|Under conditions of radical uncertainty, risk sharing renders financial systems antifragile. The goal in this introductory paper is to show that risk-sharing Islamic finance shares the characteristics of an antifragile system by mapping some characteristics of antifragility onto those of risk-sharing Islamic finance. We compare the benefits of a risk-sharing financial system to those of the dominant risk-transfer/risk-shifting conventional system of finance, basing ourselves on the criteria of antifragility. We focus on the argument that the antifragility principle of “skin-in-the-game” is equivalent to risk-sharing Islamic finance requirement of “no gain without risk.”
D89|Uncertainty, specific investment, and contract duration: evidence from the MLB player market|Abstract This study empirically investigates how uncertainty and specific investment determine contract duration. Using detailed individual labor contracts of Major League Baseball players, the empirical estimations find that, given that players are more risk-averse than clubs, contract length exhibits a positive relationship with the level of productive uncertainty. This implies that the risk-sharing hypothesis dominates the competing hypothesis of efficient production in individual labor contracts. Moreover, contract length is positively related to specific investment, highlighting that the prediction of the transaction cost theory also holds on individual labor contracts.
D89|Dynamic Competition in Deceptive Markets|In many deceptive markets, firms design contracts to exploit mistakes of naive consumers. These contracts also attract less profitable sophisticated consumers. I study such markets when firms compete repeatedly and gather usage data about their customers which is informative about the likelihood of a customer being sophisticated. I find that in sharp contrast to a model with only rational consumers, this customer information is of great value to its owner despite perfect competition. Formally, I introduce a two-period model in which all consumers are aware of a transparent price component. Naives additionally pay a hidden fee, e.g. for an add-on service, that they do not take into account. Competing firms cannot discriminate between new consumers, but in period 2 can employ their private information to offer type-dependent contracts to their first-period customer base. I find that in period 2, firms offer a transparent discount to continuing naives but not to sophisticates, thereby making the less profitable sophisticates more prone to switch to poaching competitors. Uninformed competitors therefore adversely attract unprofitable sophisticates, leading them to compete less vigorously. This allows firms to earn positive margins on continuing naives, while breaking even on sophisticates. Since the adverse attraction of sophisticates mitigates competition, margins from naives increase in the share of sophisticates and firms prefer an even mix of both customer types. I also show that if firms can educate (some) naives about hidden fees, competition is already mitigated when firms compete for customers in the first period with symmetric information. Intuitively, firms coordinate prices in period 1 to prevent education in period 2. As a result, total profits increase already before firms learn about their customersâ€™ naivetÃ©. I analyze a policy that discloses customer information to all firms and thereby increases consumer surplus, and illustrate the robustness of results through several extensions.
D89|A note on uncertainty and perception concerning measurable utility|A linkage to reconcile measurable utility derived from intensity comparisons or from probability mixtures is provided in this note. This brief note is in honor of Lloyd Shapley whose relatively unknown seminal paper on measurable utility from axioms involving the fineness of perception offered a different view on utility measurement.
D89|Vigilant measures of risk and the demand for contingent claims|We examine a class of utility maximization problems with a non-necessarily law-invariant utility, and with a non-necessarily law-invariant risk measure constraint. Under a consistency requirement on the risk measure that we call Vigilance, we show the existence of optimal contingent claims, and we show that such optimal contingent claims exhibit a desired monotonicity property. Vigilance is satisfied by a large class of risk measures, including all distortion risk measures and some classes of robust risk measures. As an illustration, we consider a problem of optimal insurance design where the premium principle satisfies the vigilance property, hence covering a large collection of commonly used premium principles, including premium principles that are not law-invariant. We show the existence of optimal indemnity schedules, and we show that optimal indemnity schedules are nondecreasing functions of the insurable loss.
D89|The evolution of networks of innovators within and across borders: Evidence from patent data|Recent studies on the geography of knowledge networks have documented a negative impact of physical distance and institutional borders upon research and development (R&D) collaborations. Though it is widely recognized that geographic constraints and national borders impede the diffusion of knowledge, less attention has been devoted to the temporal evolution of these constraints. In this study we use data on patents filed with the European Patent Office (EPO) for OECD countries to analyze the impact of physical distance and country borders on inter-regional links in four different networks over the period 1988–2009: (1) co-inventorship, (2) patent citations, (3) inventor mobility and (4) the location of R&D laboratories. We find the constraint imposed by country borders and distance decreased until mid-1990s then started to grow, particularly for distance. The intensity of European cross-country inventor collaborations increased at a higher pace than their non-European counterparts until 2004, with no significant relative progress thereafter. For geographical networks of mobility, R&D activities and patent citations we cannot detect any substantial progress in European research integration above and beyond the common global trend.
D89|An experiment in political trust|Trust is foundational in principal-agent relationships. I explore political trust through an experiment in which representative agents can improve their own welfare at the expense of voters. Collective voting and valuable seniority advantage make it difficult to foster accountability for trust betrayal. Subjects participate in a voting game with uncertain payoff redistribution, which allows agents to conceal self-interested behavior. The treatments vary the amount of information to voters compared to a baseline in which they are only aware of their payoff each period. I test to see whether revealing the intentions of the agent spurs a reaction to trust betrayal and whether accountability is comparison dependent. The collective-action problem and value of seniority affect observed accountability, but having a yardstick comparison across agents significantly increases accountability.
D89|Searching secrets rationally|We study quantitative information flow, from the perspective of an analyst who is interested in maximizing its expected gain in the process of discovering a secret, or settling a hypothesis, represented by an unobservable X , after observing some Y related to X . In our framework, inspired by Bayesian decision theory, discovering the secret has an associated reward, while the investigation of the set of possibilities prompted by the observation has a cost. We characterize the optimal strategy for the analyst and the corresponding expected gain (payoff) in a variety of situations. We argue about the importance of advantage , defined as the increment in expected gain after the observation if the analyst acts optimally, and representing the value of the information conveyed by Y . We also argue that the proposed strategy is more effective than others, based on probability coverage. Applications to cryptographic systems and to familial DNA searching are examined.
D89|Co-authorship and the Measurement of Individual Productivity|Consider a database of academic papers where each paper has a scientific worth and a group of authors. We propose a new way of measuring individual academic productivity by evaluating authorship, the extent of an author's contribution to each paper. Our method, CoScore, uses the varying levels of success of all academic partnerships to infer, simultaneously, overall individual productivity and authorship: the worth of a paper is distributed proportionally to each co-author's productivity, defined as the sum of her contributions to all papers. The CoScores of all authors are determined endogenously via the solution of a fixed point problem. We show that CoScore is well-defined and that it is uniquely characterized by three properties: consistency, invariance to merging papers, and invariance to merging scholars. We illustrate CoScore for the two thousand most cited papers in economics.
D89|Do Individuals Make Sensible Health Insurance Decisions? Evidence from a Menu with Dominated Options|The recent expansion of health-plan choice has been touted as increasing competition and enabling people to choose plans that fit their needs. This study provides new evidence challenging these proposed benefits of expanded health-insurance choice. We examine health-insurance decisions of employees at a large U.S. firm where a new plan menu included a large share of financially dominated options. This menu offers a unique litmus test for evaluating choice quality since standard risk preferences and beliefs about one’s health cannot rationalize enrollment into the dominated plans. We find that a majority of employees – and in particular, older workers, women, and low earners – chose dominated options, resulting in substantial excess spending. Most employees would have fared better had they instead been enrolled in the single actuarially-best plan. In follow-up hypothetical-choice experiments, we observe similar choices despite far simpler menus. We find these choices reflect a severe deficit in health insurance literacy and naïve considerations of health risk and price, rather than a sensible comparison of plan value. Our results challenge the standard practice of inferring risk attitudes and assessing welfare from insurance choices, and raise doubts whether recent health reforms will deliver their promised benefits.
D89|The Welfare Cost of Perceived Policy Uncertainty: Evidence from Social Security|Policy uncertainty reduces individual welfare when individuals have limited opportunities to mitigate or insure against the resulting consumption fluctuations. We field an original survey to measure the degree of perceived policy uncertainty in Social Security benefits and to estimate the impact of this uncertainty on individual welfare. Our central estimates show that on average individuals are willing to forgo 6 percent of the benefits they are supposed to get under current law to remove the policy uncertainty associated with their future Social Security benefits. This translates to a risk premium from policy uncertainty equal to 10 percent of expected benefits.
D89|Perspectives Of The Uncertainty Avoidance Cultural Dimension In Galati County Organizations|"Quantification of cultural dimensions is an innovative idea, comparing the scores obtained on the basis of the cultural dimensions makes it possible to analyze the organizational culture level. Based on data collected as part of the COMOR Project for the analysis of organizational culture in the Romanian business environment, developed by The Scientific Society of Management from Romania, we have initiated, using Business Intelligence tools, a scan of the characteristics of organizational culture for Galati County. The study is based on the views of a representative sample of respondents from the business element from Galati in order to assess the current situation and the desired one. The administration of the questionnaires was conducted with the support of the project team of the University ""Dunărea de Jos"". The proposed aim is, from the analysis of the determined statistical indicators based on the questionnaires from the Galati county, leaving behind the classical linear thinking, to identify new relationships, connections that can be revealed by analyzing the database, obtaining information about organizational culture that highlights the evolution of environmental trends Business in Galati, the practical goal of the research being to provide useful results and conclusions necessary to the local organizational development process. An important topic of the research is to identify the factors that influence managerial behaviour at the level of the Romanian organizations in order to promote and to guide the change at the level of the microeconomic structures."
D89|Online Social Networks and Trust|Abstract We use Italian data from the Multipurpose Household Survey to explore how participation in social networking sites (SNS) such as Facebook and Twitter affects the most economically relevant aspect of social capital, trust. We account for measures of trust in strangers (often referred to as social trust), trust in neighbours (particularized trust) and trust in the police (institutional trust). We address endogeneity in the use of SNS by exploiting the variation in the availability of broadband for high-speed Internet, which relates to technological characteristics of the pre-existing voice telecommunication infrastructures. We find that all the forms of trust significantly decrease with participation in online networks. We discuss several interpretations of the results in light of the specific features of Internet-mediated social interaction.
D89|Alegerea soluţiilor pentru expunerile faţă de risc<BR>[Choosing solutions to risk exposures]|In the framework of the risk management process, after a risk was identified, the exposure was analyzed and the solutions were generated, a decision about the best way to treat the exposure has to be adopted. In this paper we approach some techniques to optimize such a decision. We approach also some factors of the risk attitude.
D89|Worker problem-solving and the nature of the firm: new theory, new evidence|This paper proposes a different theory of the firm and demonstrates how it can be employed to yield hypotheses about differences in innovation and human resource strategy according to the shareholder/stakeholder and liberal/coordinated market dichotomies. The theory assumes that feasible production and demand sets are nonconvex due to interaction among activities; thus firms exist to permit the identification and exploitation of profit opportunities through coordinated action. This implies that firms face a nonconvex profit landscape comparable to the fitness landscapes invoked in evolutionary biology. Given the complexity of these landscapes and the uncertainty of the location of profit hills, there is a tradeoff between exploiting existing or adjacent hills and prospecting for more distant ones: the first minimizes risk, the second maximizes potential profit. A further assumption is then introduced, that shareholder firms seek to maximizes the present value of expected future profit streams, while stakeholder firms maximize the likelihood of achieving profitability over a given time horizon. Combining these theoretical priors, we characterize the likely innovation, organizational and human resource characteristics of the two types of firms and the effects exerted by their external environment, as described in the Varieties of Capitalism literature. These theoretical predictions are confirmed in a set of case studies of a stakeholder firm in liberal and coordinated environments and a shareholder firm in a coordinated environment. This is seen through differences in the role of worker problem-solving, which brings together innovation and learning, organizational structure and human resource strategy.
D89|La creación del conocimiento e innovación a través de los sistemas de calidad Tres estudios de caso|Actualmente las firmas rivalizan en mercados en donde predomina la incertidumbre y es por eso necesario que busquen nuevas formas de competir, gestionar y desarrollar los recursos tanto internos como externos de manera más eficiente. En el presente trabajo se aborda el papel de los sistemas de calidad para la gestión del conocimiento como un recurso para que las firmas alcancen una mejor posición en los mercados. Se mostrará cómo se crea el conocimiento a través de las ideas y el conocimiento que generan los trabajadores y los sistemas de gestión de la calidad en dos empresas de Michoacán y cómo se generan los saberes en una firma que no posee ese tipo de sistemas. Para llevar a cabo este trabajo se realizaron entrevistas semiestructuradas a las tres firmas. Los hallazgos revelan que las compañías que poseen sistemas de calidad tienen mejores oportunidades en el mercado y obtienen mejores beneficios pues son innovadoras; por el contrario, la que no dominan los sistemas de calidad son deficientes y no pueden enfrentar la competencia a largo plazo.
D89|On the issue of RoÅŸia MontanÄƒ gold exploitation An application and extension of the Arrow-Fisher uncertainty model on local issues|The aim of this article is to analyse the prospects of gold mine development at RoÅŸia MontanÄƒ, with a focus on the uncertainty regarding this process. We are specifically interested in the issues associated with cyanide spill accidents and how these uncertain events can alter the cost/benefit analysis. Making use of an established methodology, we conclude that the projected gold exploitation can pose considerable risks to the environment, and that an efficient operation would imply either reducing these risks, their effect on the environment, or both. Finally, we also draw from historical knowledge regarding the ancient mine Alburnus Maior, in order to assess the viability of the modern exploitation. We conclude that the modern project could be improved by technological progress, which would seek to maximize the scale of operations, while minimizing both the risk of accidents and their impact on the environment.
D89|A Real Options Model for the Disinvestment in Conventional Power Plants|The liberalization of the energy markets and the merit order effect lead to difficulties in the operation even of modern, highly energy-effcient conventional power plants ('missing money problem'). Their operation often becomes unprofitable, so that sometimes the only remaining option is to liquidate the plant altogether. Decisions about further operation or shut-down can be supported by applying real options analysis. This approach has been used successfully for assessing investment projects in different sectors of the economy including the energy supply industry. In this paper, we develop a real options model for the disinvestment in conventional, fossil-fuelled power plants. Applying the proposed real options approach, we aim to determine the optimal timing for the shut-down of unprofitable gas-fired power plants as well as the probability level for all possible decisions. The results show that the decision and its probability value regarding continued operation, or the optimal timing for shutdown of the power plant, depend strongly on the volatility level of the capacity factor.
D89|Real Options Analysis of the Flexible Operation of an Enhanced Gas-Fired Power Plant|The promotion of electricity from renewable energies in Germany causes difficulties in the profitable operation of many modern conventional power plants. Nevertheless, fluctuating availability of power from renewable energy sources requires flexible conventional plants, i.e. power plants which are able to react fast to these fluctuations and whose start-up and shut-down optimization will help to reduce their running costs. In this paper, we describe various possibilities of enhancing the flexibility of conventional combined cycle gas-fired turbine (CCGT) power plants, which can be achieved by investing in additional technical components or by the upgrading of existing components. The irreversible character of these investments justifies the use of a real options approach. To this end, we present a real options model for the flexible operation of existing gas-fired power plants, taking into account both technical and economic aspects. The proposed model adopts and extends the approach of Deng and Oren (Prob Eng Info Sci, 2003, pp.155-181) to the gas-fired power plant regarding its different operation stages. Moreover, both the electricity price and the spark spread are used as a profitability indicator and source of uncertainty. The simplified definition of the power plant's operation strategy complements the presented model. In a case study, we consider several technical options to improve the minimum load and part-load efficiency by retrofitting a gas-fired power plant. The proposed procedure can help to assess the future role of conventional power plants and supports the decision-making process regarding both reinvestments and optimal operation of power plants. The introduced model can also be easily adapted to other power generation technologies, not only gas-fired power plants.
D89|Experimental evidence on the effects of innovation contests|Economic research on innovation has long discussed which policy instruments best foster innovativeness in individuals and organizations. One of the instruments easily accessible to policy-makers is innovation contests; however, there is ambiguous empirical evidence concerning how such contests should be designed. Our experimental study provides evidence by analyzing the effects of two different innovation contests on subjects´ innovativeness: a prize for the aggregate innovativeness and a prize for the best innovation. We implement a creative real effort task simulating a sequential innovation process, whereby subjects determine royalty fees for their created products, which also serve as a measure of cooperation. We find that both contest conditions reduce the willingness to cooperate between subjects compared to a benchmark condition without an innovation contest. However, the total innovation activity is not influenced by introducing innovation contest schemes. From a policy perspective, the implementation of state-subsidized innovation contests in addition to the existing intellectual property rights system should be questioned.
D89|Eliciting risk preferences: Text vs. graphical multiple price lists|We introduce new graphical displays that present binary choice lotteries via three dimensional rotating pie charts whose heights represent the prize amounts. We compare four graphical versions to the original text-only Holt & Laury (2002) multiple price list. Parametric and non-parametric measures of risk preferences are found to shift towards risk neutrality for the graphical displays.
D89| Opening up the strategy-making process: Comparing open strategy to open innovation| In this paper we compare the emerging field of open strategy to the established field of open innovation in order to facilitate their cross-fertilisation both in research and practice. Taking a communication-centred perspective, we argue that in both fields ‘openness’ concerns opening-up the communication process towards previously excluded individuals. On the basis of our review of the literature, we introduce a general framework that distinguishes between two dimensions of openness in terms of the direction that communication takes: sharing communication content with external participants and audiences and receiving communication content from external participants and audiences. Using the two dimensions of sharing and receiving, we map documented cases of empirical research in both fields and identify different forms of openness in processes of open innovation and open strategy. As we will show, in the material that we examined, in most of the cases of open strategy sharing and receiving are combined, while in many cases of open innovation we identified only one dimension. We suggest that this difference arises because, unlike innovation, open strategy typically involves joint sensemaking and thus a bidirectional communication process. Drawing on our findings, we put forward three propositions to provide a foundation for future empirical research on phenomena of open innovation and open strategy
D89|A ranking method based on handicaps|Ranking methods are fundamental tools in many areas. Popular methods aggregate the statements of `experts' in different ways. As such, there are various reasonable ranking methods, each one of them more or less adapted to the environment under consideration.This paper introduces a new method, called the handicap-based method, and characterizes it through appealing properties. This method assigns not only scores to the items but also weights to the experts. Scores and weights form an equilibrium for a relationship based on the notion of handicaps. The method is, in a sense made precise in the paper, the counterpart to the counting method in environments that require intensity-invariance. Intensity-invariance is a desirable property when the intensity of the experts' statements has to be controlled. Otherwise, both the counting and handicap-based methods satisfy a property called homogeneity, which is a desirable property when cardinal statements matter, as is the case in many applications.
D89|Teams and Tournaments in Relational Contracts|This paper analyses and compares optimal relational contracts between a principal/firm and a set of agents when (a) only aggregate output can be observed, and (b) individual outputs can be observed. We show that the optimal contract under (a) is a team incentive scheme where each agent is paid a maximal bonus for aggregate output above a threshold and a minimal (no) bonus otherwise. The team’s efficiency decreases with its size (number of agents) when outputs are non-negatively correlated, but may increase considerably with size if outputs are negatively correlated. In the case where individual output can be observed, we show that the optimal contract is a tournament scheme where the conditions for an agent to obtain the (single) bonus are stricter for negatively compared to positively correlated outputs. We finally show that if agents have bargaining power, firms may deliberately choose to organize production as a team where only aggregate output is observable. The team alternative is more likely to be superior under negatively correlated outputs.
D89|Does the Home Advantage Depend on Crowd Support? Evidence From Same-Stadium Derbies|We investigate to what extent crowd support contributes to the home advantage in soccer, disentangling this effect from other mechanisms such as playersâ€™ familiarity with the stadium and travel fatigue. To evaluate the relevance of crowd support in determining home advantage, we analyze same-stadium derbies (matches among teams that share the same stadium), in which teams enjoy different levels of support from the crowdâ€”the home team has many more supporters mainly because of season ticket holdersâ€”while teams do not differ in terms of travel fatigue or familiarity with the stadium. Our estimation results suggest the existence of a sizable crowd supportâ€™s effect on the home advantage generated through the encouragement of playersâ€™ performance. Furthermore, we find consistent evidence that the support of the crowd tends to bias refereeâ€™s decisions (in terms of penalties, red cards, and yellow cards) in favor of the home team.
D89|The Effects of Uncertainties on Inventory Management of Petroleum Products: A Case Study of Thailand|This paper employed a Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity in Mean framework to examine (i) the relationship between uncertainty and inventory management,defined as an inventory to sale (IS) ratio; and (ii) the impacts of uncertainties in ex-refinery price, oil funds, and futures price on uncertainty in inventory management, measured as a conditional variance of the IS ratio. Using monthly data for five petroleum products from January 2008 to June 2013, the results indicate that uncertainty induces businesses to hold more of the IS ratio than required. The sensitivity analysis reports that uncertainty in ex-refinery price contributes mostly to the uncertainty in inventory management, while the impact of uncertainty in the oil fund on uncertainty in inventory management is relatively small. Interestingly, the result indicates that uncertainty in futures price can help mitigate uncertainty in inventory management and gives support to the existence of the futures market.
D89|Axiomatic measures of intellectual influence|Measuring influence allows the study of such issues as the impact and reputation of scientists and scientific publications, the dynamics of innovation, and the construction of ranking algorithms for search engines in the world wide web. Ranking methods that measure influence are typically based on the information contained in the network of communications between different entities (scholarly publications, patents, web pages). This paper presents within the same framework recent developments that use the axiomatic approach to derive ranking methods. Two related but essentially different ranking problems are studied: journal ranking problems and scholar ranking problems. The paper concludes with open theoretical and empirical questions for future research.
D89|Guarantees, transparency and the interdependency between sovereign and bank default risk|Bank debt guarantees have traditionally been viewed as costless measures to prevent bank runs. However, as recent experiences in some European countries have demonstrated, guarantees may link the coordination problems of bank and sovereign creditors and induce a functional interdependence between the likelihoods of a government default and bank illiquidity. Employing a global-game approach, we model this link, showing the existence and uniqueness of the joint equilibrium and derive its comparative statics properties. In equilibrium, the guarantee reduces the probability of a bank run, while it increases the probability of a sovereign default. The latter erodes the guarantee’s credibility and thus its effectiveness ex ante. By setting the guarantee optimally, the government balances these two effects in order to minimize expected costs of crises. Our results show that the optimal guarantee has clear-cut welfare gains which are enhanced through policies that promote greater balance sheet transparency.
D89|Rhetoric and analogies|The art of rhetoric may be defined as changing other people's minds (opinions, beliefs) without providing them new information. One technique heavily used by rhetoric employs analogies. Using analogies, one may draw the listener's attention to similarities between cases and to re-organize existing information in a way that highlights certain regularities. In this paper we offer two models of analogies, discuss their theoretical equivalence, and show that finding good analogies is a computationally hard problem.
D89|Opaque financial reports and R2: Revisited|In this study, we revisit the link between R2 (synchronicity) and earnings management (opacity) because of the importance of the ongoing debate on the relation between idiosyncratic risk and earnings management in the finance and accounting literatures. Hutton et al. (J. Financial Economics, 2009) provide evidence of a positive link between opacity and R2. They interpret their finding to imply that firms with high R2 (high synchronicity) have less firm-specific information impounded in their stock price. Our results for this relationship fail to unequivocally support the results reported in Hutton et al. (2009). We show that their results are not only time variant but also not robust to the alternative empirical technique recommended for panel data by Petersen (2009) and alternative estimation of discretionary accruals adjusted for firm performance prescribed by Kothari et al. (2005). We also find no support for a convex relation between idiosyncratic risk and opacity. The findings documented in this study substantially revise some of Hutton et al.'s findings in this important and growing area of research.
D89|Vulnerabili e appassionati. Sui fondamenti antropologici della scienza economica|Without the passions there would be little reason to act at all. Nevertheless, in standard economic models human action is driven solely by self-interest: the passions are supposed to interfere with our ability to form rational beliefs and to make rational choices. In fact, any action originated and nurtured by passions places its own raison d’être in itself. The acts motivated by passions can either improve or (even) worsen one’s wellbeing: there might not be any payoff in both the present and the future, and monetary incentives do not influence or mitigate their nature. Above all, under the influence of the passions, the actor does not calculate but instead “loses control”. This paper argues against the separation of passion-infused intimate relations and economic theory through a reconsideration of the anthropological conception of the economics.
D89|An experiment on protecting intellectual property|We conduct a laboratory experiment to explore whether the protection of intellectual property (IP) incentivizes people to create non-rivalrous knowledge goods, foregoing the production of other rivalrous goods. In the contrasting treatment with no IP protection, participants are free to resell and remake non-rivalrous knowledge goods originally created by others. We find that creators reap substantial profits when IP is protected and that rampant pirating is common when there is no IP protection, but IP protection in and of itself is neither necessary nor sufficient for generating wealth from the discovery of knowledge goods. Rather, individual entrepreneurship is the key. Copyright Economic Science Association 2014
D89|Patents Assessed through Sectoral Operational Programs|"According to the International Accounting Standards – IAS 38 „Intangible assets”; these assets are identifiable non-monetary assets under construction were considered without physical substance. Lack actual physical form must not be understood that an intangible asset would have no material support, because the presence of any intangible asset can be demonstrated only by a support material form. Exmple: frequently encounter compact-disc (in case a software), legal documentation (in the case of licences, trade marks and patents of invention), contracts, permits and licences, technical documentation or films. Nowadays we are constantly subjected to the changing flow of information that is found in a perpetual technological change which started the emergence of a new stage in the society development that which carries the name of knowledge. The object of my research is the patent for the structural funds reimbursable project submitted in the ""Operational Program, Economic Competitiveness"" Operation 2.3.1. ""Support for start-ups and innovative spin-offs. Patent is an official document certifying the inventor, the exclusive right to produce a certain good or product or use a particular process.

D89|Valuation of Intangible Assets the Main Pawn for New Challenges Related to the Knowledge Era|Intangible assets are considered a resource controlled by an economic entity arising from past events that is expected to generate future earnings. Through them we can debate the technical-material and financial developments over time and due to permanent development capacity. Today we are witnessing a constantly changing flow of information found in a perpetual technological change that began the emergence of a new stage in the evolution of society was called knowledge. In this context we talk about the new economy which tries to present more complex reality in which we find ourselves. Evaluation of intangible assets constitute a comprehensive and very complex process that should be treated with great caution, especially since it appears that can lead to new challenges, both because of globalization and the development of technological innovation. It involves understanding the peculiarities of the competence assessment and an independent professional appraiser.
D89|Liability Rule Failures? Evidence from German Court Decisions|Since 2007, all insurance intermediaries face negligence liability that is supposed to reallocate risks and set economic incentives. Nonetheless, further measures are taken to improve consumer protection. So, the question arises does the liability rule influence the agents behavior, or not, and does it influence in the intended way, or not? Do court cases provide evidence for failure of the current liability rule? Based upon an economic analysis of liability rules, aspects concerning potential failures can be derived. An analysis of twelve verdicts suggests that understatement of intermediary responsibility as well as a potential overstatement of the consumer responsibility yields suboptimal results. Often, missing documentation reinforces that tendency.
D89|Voter Behavior, Term Limits, and Seniority Advantage in Pork-Barrel Politics|This paper explores electoral accountability in a legislative system favoring seniority, using laboratory experiments. Voters face a trade-off between pork-barrel transfers and policy representation. The experiment tests term limits as a mechanism to reduce the cost of searching for a candidate who better represents voters on policy. I use subjects´ preferences on abortion to capture incumbents´ policy choices where subjects vote to determine whether a donation is allocated to a pro-choice or to a pro-life nonprofit to create tension between visceral and monetary incentives. I find term limits to be effective, but not infallible, for avoiding the seniority trap.
D89|The Evolution Of Collective Labor Conflict In Romania|Collective labor conflicts always constituted a subject of great interest from the perspective of social, economic and legislative implications. The complex and inherent nature of conflicts within working relations justify a multidisciplinary approach of the issue, sustained by statistic tools meant to enable a pertinent analysis of the situation of collective labor conflicts in Romania. The present paper, without pretending to exhaust the subject, is aiming to present the legal framework and the statistic data concerning the regulation of this type of conflicts.
D89|Networks information in the civil wars|The aim of this paper is to interpret the relationships between information networks and the civil wars (Colombia). Over a period of paramilitary violence networks of informants were used with a strategic purpose. In fact, the paramilitaries were preparing each slaughter counting information previously learned between the inhabitants of the town. For these reasons, it is shown that information is a key phenomenon to understand civil wars. Moreover, as demonstrated in this work is the evolution of the slaughter in the civil wars as a result of rumor and information.
D89|Trust in banks: a tentative conceptual framework|Since the 2007-08 crisis, banks in many countries have been facing what seems to be a serious “trust crisis”. This sharp decline in trust in banks and banking, the likely outcome of the near-collapse of banking systems during the crisis, is partly captured by a growing empirical literature. However, this literature presents serious shortcomings, which reflect a more general lack of theorization of trust in banks. This lack of theorization certainly has much to do with the distance between the economic literature on banks and banking and the sociological and economic literature on trust. This paper aims at bridging this gap by proposing a new conceptual framework. In particular, the paper identifies three related dimensions of trust that seem to have relevance for the banking industry: “relational”, “systemic” and “vertical” trust. While mainstream financial intermediation theory and agency theory provide a good understanding of relational trust, they are less well equipped to deal with the other dimensions of trust. The paper, therefore, builds on heterodox theories of money and debt to build a more comprehensive understanding of trust in banks. This tentative conceptual framework, in turn, has implications for current theories of banking and of trust.
D89|Horizontal and Vertical Linkages between Formal and Informal Credit Markets in Backward Agriculture: A Theoretical Analysis|The paper shows that the policy of forging a vertical linkage between the formal and informal credit markets is distinctly superior to the existing credit policy of horizontally substituting the informal sector by the formal one. An inflow of subsidized formal credit to the informal lenders not only ensures better terms of borrowing to the small borrowers but also leads to higher agricultural productivity vis-à-vis the horizontal linkage case. Even if the informal sector lenders are allowed to collude, the informal interest rate is still lower in the vertical linkage case.
D89|From degrees of belief to beliefs: Lessons from judgment-aggregation theory|What is the relationship between degrees of belief and (all-or-nothing) beliefs? Can the latter be expressed as a function of the former, without running into paradoxes? We reassess this “belief-binarization” problem from the perspective of judgmentaggregation theory. Although some similarities between belief binarization and judgment aggregation have been noted before, the literature contains no general study of the implications of aggregation-theoretic impossibility and possibility results for belief binarization. We seek to fill this gap. At the centre of this paper is an impossibility theorem showing that, except in simple cases, there exists no belief-binarization rule satisfying four baseline desiderata (“universal domain”, “belief consistency and completeness”, “propositionwise independence”, “certainty preservation”). We show that this result is a corollary of the judgment-aggregation variant of Arrow’s impossibility theorem and explore several escape routes from it.

D89|Why Stare Decisis?|All Courts rule ex-post, after most economic decisions are sunk. This can generate a time-inconsistency problem. From an ex-ante perspective, Courts will have the ex-post temptation to be excessively lenient. This observation is at the root of the rule of precedent, known as stare decisis. Stare decisis forces Courts to weigh the benefits of leniency towards the current parties against the beneficial effects that tougher decisions have on future ones. We study these dynamics and find that stare decisis guarantees that precedents evolve towards ex-ante efficient decisions, thus alleviating the Courts' time-inconsistency problem. However, the dynamics do not converge to full efficiency. (Copyright: Elsevier)
D89|The Role of Information in Stock Market|With relying on game theory, this paper investigates the role of information played in decisions of economic agents in Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE). The behavior of economic agents in a company in the Cement, Lime & Gypsum industry named Tehran Cement listed on the TSE has been investigated through GARCH class models for the period of July 1999 to June 2006. The results suggest that general information through GARCH (1, 1) model affects the company stock price, while private information through GARCH (2, 1) model affects the trading volume. Having explored general and private information, we studied the role of this information in determining stock price and trading volume, according to which the results demonstrate that general information has more influence than private information in determining stock price and trading volume. Therefore, we accept information cascades theory in TSE which means economic agents mostly rely on general information in their trading decisions.
D89|Common-value auction versus posted-price selling: an agent-based model approach|Previous theoretical work has compared a private-value auction and posted-price market, and an affiliated-value auction and a posted-price market to determine the selling method preferred by sellers. Much less, however, is known about the seller’s preferred selling method when the buyers have a common value of the item. Our objective is to determine if a first-price auction or a posted-price market provides a seller with the larger expected revenue when buyers have a common value of the item being sold. An agent-based posted-price market and an agent-based first-price common-value auction with a reserve price are developed to compare these selling methods. Holding the buyers’ uncertainty about the value of the item constant, the seller prefers the posted-price market when the seller has no uncertainty about the item’s value. When the seller has an equal level of uncertainty as the buyers, the seller’s expected revenue for each market is similar. As the seller’s uncertainty increases beyond the level of the buyers’ uncertainty, the auction with a reserve price eventually becomes the preferred choice.

D89|Intentionality and the emergence of complexity: an analytical approach|Emergence is a generic property that makes economies become complex. The simultaneous carrying out of agents’ intentional action plans within an economic system generates processes that are at the base of structural change and the emergence of adaptive complex systems. This paper argues that goals and intentionality are key elements of the structure of rational human action and are the origin of emergent properties such as innovation within economic complex systems. To deal with the locus and role of goals and intentionality in relation to the emergence of complexity we propose an analytical approach based on agents’ action plans. Action plans are open representations of the action projected by agents (as individuals or organizations), where the means (actions) and objectives (or goals) are not necessarily given, but produced by agents themselves.

D89|A Point Of View On The Logic Modelling Of The Financial Network|The identification and solving of the different problems that confront us presently, particularly due to the process of globalization, requires a more complex approach of the financial domain. We hereby undertake to bring clarifications and proposals for a more profound approach of the analytical aspects of the network-type models. We thus identify the elements of a financial network which bestow upon it its character if specificity, such as knots, instruments, operations, interconnections, interactions, determinants and flows. We also identify some defining characteristics of the financial network, such as its credibility, representativeness, complexity, efficacy, extensiveness, intensiveness, connectivity, integrability and establishment. Finally, we describe a mechanism of transformation of the financial flows within a network knot, using the concept of interface. We mention that, to a significant extent, the present paper was expounded at the International Conference Financial and Monetary Economics FME 2013 for Financial and Monetary Research, 25 October 2013.
D89|Is response time predictive of choice? An experimental study of threshold strategies|This paper investigates the usefulness of non-choice data, namely response times, as a predictor of threshold behavior in a simple global game experiment. Our results indicate that the signal associated to the highest or second highest response time at the beginning of the experiment are both unbiased estimates of the threshold employed by subjects at the end of the experiment. This predictive ability is lost when we move to the third or higher response times. Moreover, the response time predictions are better predictors of observed behavior than the equilibrium predictions of the game. They are also robust, in the sense that they characterize behavior in an out-of-treatment exercise where we use the strategy method to elicit thresholds. This paper is the first to point out the predictive power of response times in a strategic situation.
D89|Why Credences Cannot be Imprecise|Beliefs formed under uncertainty come in different grades, which are called credences or degrees of belief. The most common way of measuring the strength of credences is by ascribing probabilities to them. What kind of probabilities may be used remains an open question and divides the researchers in two camps: the sharpers who claim that credences can be measured by the standard single-valued precise probabilities. The non-sharpers, on the other hand, claim that credences are imprecise and can only be measured by imprecise probabilities. The latter view has recently gained in popularity. According to non-sharpers, credences must be imprecise when the evidence is essentially imprecise (ambiguous, vague, conflicting or scarce). This view is, however, misleading. Imprecise credences can lead to irrational behaviour and do not make much sense after a closer examination. I provide a coherence-based principle which enables me to demonstrate that there is no need for imprecise credences. This principle is then applied to three special cases, which are prima facie best explained by use of imprecise credences: the jellyfish guy case, Ellsberg paradox and the Sleeping Beauty problem. The jellyfish guy case deals with a strange situation, where the evidence is very ambiguous. Ellsberg Paradox demonstrates a problem that occurs when comparing precise and imprecise credences. The Sleeping Beauty problem demonstrates that imprecise credences are not useless, but rather misguided. They should be understood as sets of possible precise credences, of which only one can be selected at a given time.
D89|The ‘Celtic Crisis’: Guarantees, transparency, and systemic liquidity risk|Bank liability guarantee schemes have traditionally been viewed as costless measures to shore up investor confidence and stave off bank runs. However, as the experience of some European countries, most notably Ireland, has demonstrated, the credibility and effectiveness of these guarantees is crucially intertwined with the sovereign's funding risks. Employing methods from the literature on global games, we develop a simple model to explore the functional co-dependence between the rollover risks of a bank and a government, which are connected through the government's guarantee of bank liabilities. We show the existence and uniqueness of the joint equilibrium and derive its comparative static properties. In solving for the optimal guarantee, we further show that its credibility may be improved through policies that promote balance sheet transparency.
D89|Impact of alternative information requirements on the coexistence of genetically modified (GM) and non-GM oilseed rape in the EU|We use spatial simulation techniques to estimate both cross pollination damages and net producer benefit from genetically modified (GM) oilseed rape under alternative information requirements about individual farmers' cropping plans. Simulations were carried out for two study regions in Germany. The results suggest that, especially in landscapes with small plots, information requirements implemented in most EU Member States may result in inefficient coexistence to the extent that GM farmers lack important information to adjust their cropping plans to non-GM rape farmers' crop choices. We conclude that, in such fragmented landscapes, more comprehensive information requirements which oblige both GM and non-GM farmers to announce their cropping plans can: (1) substantially increase producer benefits, (2) reduce cross pollination damages and dispute and thus (3) contribute to the local diffusion of GM varieties.
D89|Financial derivatives, opacity, and crash risk: Evidence from large US banks|We test how the use of financial derivatives affects banks’ informational structure and future stock performance based on a sample of large bank holding companies in the US. Using banks’ use of financial derivatives as a proxy for opacity, we find that high level use of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives are associated with an increase in the synchronicity (R2) of stock price movements with the market index, which indicates less revelation of bank-specific information to the market. This finding is consistent with the prediction of the model developed by Wagner (2007). We document that superior corporate governance tempers these effects. Finally, we find that an increase in the opacity is significantly and positively related to an increase in banks’ future stock price crash risk.
D89|Optimal allocation without transfer payments|Often an organization or government must allocate goods without collecting payment in return. This may pose a difficult problem either when agents receiving those goods have private information in regards to their values or needs. In this paper, we find an optimal mechanism to allocate goods when the designer is benevolent. While the designer cannot charge agents, he can receive a costly but wasteful signal from them. We find conditions for cases in which ignoring these costly signals by giving agents equal share (or using lotteries if the goods are indivisible) is optimal. In other cases, those that send the highest signal should receive the goods; however, we then show that there exist cases where more complicated mechanisms are superior. Also, we show that the optimal mechanism is independent of the scarcity of the goods being allocated.

D89|Lump-Sum Quota Bonuses And Other Vertical Restraints With Cournot Retailers|Lump-sum quota bonuses are a specific type of quota bonus that provides a lump-sum transfer from a manufacturer to a retailer when the retailerâ€™s sales exceed a pre- determined quota. This paper explores whether lump-sum quota bonuses and two other vertical restraints, two-part tariffs and resale price maintenance, can resolve the double marginalization problem when the market size is uncertain. It emerges that only lump-sum quota bonuses can always resolve the double marginalization problem in our two-state case.
D89|Heterogeneity in life-duration preferences: Are risky recreationists really more risk loving?|We conduct multiple price list experiments that elicit life duration risk preferences from amateur auto racers, technical rock climbers, SCUBA divers, and a student control group. We posit a preference function that allows for risk aversion and probability weighting. We are particularly interested in whether the behavior of risk takers, such as risky recreationists or smokers, is best explained by a risk-tolerant utility function or if immunity to possibility bias arising from overweighting of low probabilities is a more important motivator of the choice to engage in risky activities. We find that amateur auto racers are more rational than either students or other risky recreationists because they are less likely to overemphasize low-probability events. Women, older subjects, and rock climbers are more susceptible to possibility bias than others, making them likely to overinvest in disease treatments that have a low probability of success.

D89|High performance work practices in small firms: a resource-poverty and strategic decision-making perspective|High performance work practices (HPWPs) are human resource management practices aimed at stimulating employee and organisational performance. The application of HPWPs is not widespread in small organisations. We examine whether the implementation of coherent bundles of HPWPs (aimed at employee ability, employee motivation or at the opportunity to perform) depends on the scarcity of resources, as reflected in the size of the company, and on strategic decision-making in small firms related to the owner’s expertise and attitudes. In our research, a total of 211 employees from 45 small organisations were asked to rate the presence of HPWPs in their organisation. These averaged perceptions were linked to information provided by the owner–managers on the size of their firm and their own expertise and attitudes. The findings support that smaller but coherent bundles of HPWPs can be found in small organisations and that the implementation of these bundles depends on available resources, strategic decision-making and the combination of the two. These findings highlight the need to integrate the notions of resource poverty and strategic decision-making to understand the uptake of bundles of HPWPs within small firms.

D89|Law versus Economics? How should insurance intermediaries influence the insurance demand decision|How should intermediaries influence the insurance demand decision? The answer must refer to the interdependence of economic determinants and legal duties. Intermediaries potentially guide demand decisions by delivering objective information and by considering individuals’ situation and economic circumstances. The economic theory provides determinants that are essential for the insurance demand decision. Undoubtedly, consumers lack information about certain variables, and therefore misjudge their demand for insurances. In response to the consumer, an intermediaries’ task is to discover possible misjudgments and to provide the correct information. Since the information in the insurance market is asymmetrically distributed, an insurance agent has an incentive to behave opportunistically, a tendency that is reinforced by the remuneration scheme in Germany. In 2007/2008, insurance intermediaries became regulated by law. That law states, among other things, the four basic obligations of insurance intermediaries and a liability rule to sanction violations. In order to interpret and substantiate the legal terms, those have to match the relevant economic determinants to state the ideal behavior of an intermediary.
D89|Privacy and Data-Based Research|What can we, as users of microdata, formally guarantee to the individuals (or firms) in our dataset, regarding their privacy? We retell a few stories, well-known in data-privacy circles, of failed anonymization attempts in publicly released datasets. We then provide a mostly informal introduction to several ideas from the literature on differential privacy, an active literature in computer science that studies formal approaches to preserving the privacy of individuals in statistical databases. We apply some of its insights to situations routinely faced by applied economists, emphasizing big-data contexts.
D89|On application of multi-criteria decision making with ordinal information in elementary education|In the Czech Republic each elementary or secondary school decides which textbook will be used for a given class and a given subject of education. As a supply of textbooks is wide, a selection of the most suitable textbook by a teacher is a typical case of multi-criteria decision making situation where an evaluation of different textbooks on selected criteria is rather ordinal in nature than cardinal: it is not possible to assign textbooks some numerical value with regard to criteria such as content, comprehensibility, adequacy to children’s age and knowledge, etc. (with the exception of textbook’s price), but textbooks can be ranked from the best to the worst by such criteria, and the best textbook can be found by a new and simple mathematical method developed for this purpose in this paper. The aim of the paper is to show how this multi-criteria decision making method with ordinal information can be used for the selection of the most appropriate textbook for elementary science education, because a right choice of a textbook plays an important role in children’s education. And we shall not forget that decisions made today influence the world tomorrow, and the World of Tomorrow is also a World of Our (well-educated) Children.
D89|Seniority, Information and Electoral Accountability|This paper addresses the impact information has on electoral accountability in a legislative system based on seniority using laboratory experiments. A purely rational choice perspective of a simple voting environment implies that information is inconsequential when seniority is exceptionally valuable. Seniority advantage presents the opportunity to shirk at the expense of voters. I contrast the rational choice perspective to behavioral considerations of trust, betrayal and expectations. Voter information about incumbent behavior is varied across experimental treatments, and I find that information leads to accountability when voters can compare their own incumbent’s behavior to the behavior of others. Moreover, information deters incumbent shirking.
D89|Decision theory for agents with incomplete preferences|Orthodox decision theory gives no advice to agents who hold two goods to be incommensurate in value because such agents will have incomplete preferences. According to standard treatments, rationality requires complete preferences, so such agents are irrational. Experience shows, however, that incomplete preferences are ubiquitous in ordinary life. In this paper, we aim to do two things: (1) show that there is a good case for revising decision theory so as to allow it to apply non-vacuously to agents with incomplete preferences, and (2) to identify one substantive criterion that any such non-standard decision theory must obey. Our criterion, Competitiveness, is a weaker version of a dominance principle. Despite its modesty, Competitiveness is incompatible with prospectism, a recently developed decision theory for agents with incomplete preferences. We spend the final part of the paper showing why Competitiveness should be retained, and prospectism rejected.
D89|Rational choice and the transitivity of betterness|If A is better than B and B is better than C, then A is better than C, right? Larry Temkin and Stuart Rachels say: No! Betterness is nontransitive, they claim. In this paper, I discuss the central type of argument advanced by Temkin and Rachels for this radical idea, and argue that, given this view very likely has sceptical implications for practical reason, we would do well to identify alternative responses. I propose one such response, which employs the idea that rational agents might regard some options as incommensurate in value, and will reasonably employ a heuristic of status quo maintenance to avoid suboptimal choices from incommensurate goods.

D89|On the comparative advantage of tradable emission permits in a setting of uncertain abatement costs and market power: A case against the invariably pessimistic view|Recent work has shown that Weitzman's policy rule for choosing price- versus quantity-based pollution control instruments under uncertainty is biased when the polluting firms possess market power (Heuson 2010). However, this study is restricted to emission standards and taxes, while tradable emission permits are ruled out since market power gives rise to strategic permit trading, which requires some separate effort in investigation. This paper aims at closing this gap and, in doing so, makes three main contributions. First, it provides the first-time full comparative analysis of the three most common pollution control instruments stated above which takes into account two features that are frequently given in actual regulation settings, namely market power of polluting firms and uncertain abatement costs from the regulator's perspective. Second, the paper reveals a new form of strategic permit trading that may arise even though the permit market is perfectly competitive. Finally, the rather pessimistic view concerning the impact of market power on the comparative advantage of tradable emission permits, which dominates in the literature so far, is put into context.

D89|The News Media and the Expectation Formation of Firms|Forming expectations about the future path of the economy and the own business prospects is not costless for a fi rm. Instead, acquiring and processing the relevant macroeconomic information requires valuable resources. One important source of information that provides a coding service is the mass media. This paper investigates empirically whether the news media have an independent influence on the expectation formation process of fi rms that goes beyond the actual economic developments. Using the Ifo survey data that explicitly measure business expectations, and data that cover the intensity and the tone of media coverage, we come to three conclusions. First, a fi rm is more likely to update its business expectations when the volume of macroeconomic news rises. Second, the news media act as an amplifi er of actual economic developments. Third, business expectations react stronger to negative than to positive news.
D89|Limited Attention and the Demand for Health Insurance|We analyze how customers with limited attention value and choose among health plans. We show how the model can accommodate three observations regarding plan choice. First, people tend to overweight the premium and thus underappreciate the value of health insurance. Second, insurance companies may have a strong incentive to reduce quality and to hide these shortcomings in the fine print while attracting customers with insufficiently lower premiums. Finally, the willingness-to-pay for insurance is subadditive creating an incentive for providers to unbundle comprehensive plans. We discuss how these three effects may result in a fundamental dilemma for policy makers.
D89|Demystifying Consciousness With Mysticism? Cognitive Science and Mystical Traditions|"The article considers whether, and how, current scientific studies of consciousness might benefit from insights of mystical traditions. Although considerable effort has been expanded towards introducing mysticism into mainstream cognitive science, the topic is still controversial, not least because of the multifariousness of meaning associated with the term (from ""illogical thinking"" through ""visions"" and ""raptures"" to ""paranormal"" and ""psychopathological phenomena""). In the context of the present article, mysticism is defined as a set of practices, beliefs, values etc. developed within a given religious tradition to help the practitioner realize the experiential and existential transformations associated with mystical experiences, i.e. experiences characterized by the breakdown of the subject-object dichotomy. It is then examined in which areas mysticism so defined might provide beneficial for consciousness studies; broadly, three such areas are identified: phenomenological research (mysticism as a repository of unique experiential material and practical know-how for rigorous phenomenological analyses), the problem of the self (mysticism as a repository of experiential-existential insights into one's fundamental selflessness), and the so-called hard problem of consciousness (mysticism as a unique experiential-existential answer to the mind-body problem). It is contended that, contrary to popular belief, cognitive science could benefit from insights and practices found in mystical traditions, especially by way of grounding its findings in the lived experience and thereby (potentially) demystifying some of its self-imposed abstract conundrums."

D89|Proposition d'un cadre conceptuel pour la gestion du risque sanitaire des aliments dans les industries agroalimentaires|La maîtrise du risque sanitaire des aliments fait partie intégrante de la stratégie des firmes agro-alimentaires. Ces entreprises mettent en place des dispositifs organisationnels aptes à générer une maîtrise efficiente des risques, à travers la conformation à des référentiels assez stricts, répondant à des normes publiques ou à des standards privés. Ces dispositifs sont validés par des audits externes eux-mêmes préparés par des audits internes. Nous montrons, à travers l'analyse de l'état de l'art, les limites de ces double-dispositifs de contrôle. Nous nous proposons d'élaborer un cadre conceptuel original pour le déploiement d'une stratégie d'excellence en matière de sécurité alimentaire qui permettrait de renouveler l'audit interne. L'objectif est de sortir de la logique bureaucratique pour instaurer une relation auditeur/ audité favorisant l'apprentissage et le progrès continu. Ce cadre conceptuel est construit en mobilisant le formalisme de la méthode 5steps® qui s'intéresse particulièrement au pilotage des plans de progrès. - Abstract - Managing food safety risk is one of the main issues of food processing firms. The conformation to different specific standards (private or public) is one of the main levers used by these enterprises to respond to this strategic objective. Then, the use of internal and external audits is becoming pervasive in these organizations. We propose to use the 5Steps® method as a conceptual framework for the deployment of food safety strategy. We try to identify how to use this method to enhance internal audit practices by helping to change the auditing style from a conformance tool to a continuous improvement enabler.

La littérature confirme une présence marquée de ce biais cognitif chez les entrepreneurs. En outre, parmi les entreprises créées, il ressort des rares études sur le sujet une liaison négative entre leur performance et l’excès de confiance du créateur. De nombreuses questions restent à explorer, notamment les effets d’une surconfiance modérée versus extrême, son lien avec l’innovation, et le rôle éventuellement modérateur des apporteurs de capitaux.(VA)This article reviews the literature on entrepreneurs’ overconfidence and its impact on venture creation, mixing several approaches (entrepreneurship, behavioral and entrepreneurial finance, decision psychology). The literature documents the existence of a strong overconfidence bias among the population of entrepreneurs. Few articles attempt to study its impact on subsequent performance. They suggest a negative relationship between an entrepreneur’s overconfidence and venture performance. Many questions are still unaddressed, related to the effect of a moderate vs. strong overconfidence, its link with innovation and the influence of VCs as a potential moderator.

D89|Reasoning-based introspection|We show that if an agent reasons according to standard inference rules, the truth and introspection axioms extend from the set of non-epistemic propositions to the whole set of propositions.

D89|Comparison Friction: Experimental Evidence from Medicare Drug Plans| Consumers need information to compare alternatives for markets to function efficiently. Recognizing this, public policies often pair competition with easy access to comparative information. The implicit assumption is that comparison friction--the wedge between the availability of comparative information and consumers' use of it--is inconsequential because when information is readily available, consumers will access this information and make effective choices. We examine the extent of comparison friction in the market for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans in the United States. In a randomized field experiment, an intervention group received a letter with personalized cost information. That information was readily available for free and widely advertised. However, this additional step--providing the information rather than having consumers actively access it--had an impact. Plan switching was 28% in the intervention group, versus 17% in the comparison group, and the intervention caused an average decline in predicted consumer cost of about $100 a year among letter recipients--roughly 5% of the cost in the comparison group. Our results suggest that comparison friction can be large even when the cost of acquiring information is small and may be relevant for a wide range of public policies that incorporate consumer choice.

Nowadays, the advent of creative industries seems to be synonymous to a revenge of the “right brain”. The main conclusion of this article is that these new dynamics would involve mainly the Northern Hemisphere, capitalizing on age-long creative cultural genes and receptive grounds. Through the iPad stylized fact and the Sperry's model of hemispheric specialization, this article discusses the degree of appropriation of the intangible-based economic dynamics in both developed, emerging and peripheral countries, and outlines the contours of the global architectures of knowledge and creativity.
D89|The Economic Intelligence Practices and Their Impact on the Organization’s Strategic Behavior|The economic intelligence represents a practice, which has always been informally present in organizations. The active monitoring of the external environment in order to surprise the opportunities or the threats that aim the organization’s life, as well as the reaching in legal and ethical limits to influence practices in the economic competition, are manifested at the level of the strategic management, nowadays strongly reshaped under the impact of the new economy. The present paper intends to emphasize the importance of using such a strategic instrument for the information’s management coming from the competitive environment, starting from economic intelligence’s particularities. For this purpose, there are presented the specific practices for the economic intelligence measure at organizational level and the measure in which their structuring on different categories (individual, relational, synergetic) determines a certain type of the organization’s strategic behavior. This analysis’ results are shaped by at least two perspectives: firstly, there is promoted a new strategic management instrument that regroups in a formal framework disparate monitoring practices of the environment, informational security or lobbying. Secondly, the premises for deciding on the orienting towards a certain strategic behavior type, depending on the organization’s potential in using the economic intelligence practices are being shaped.
D89|Static vs Dynamic Auctions with Ambiguity Averse Bidders|Abstract: This paper presents the outcome of a dynamic price-descending auction when the distribution of the private values is uncertain and bidders exhibit ambiguity aversion. In contrast to sealed-bid auctions, in open auctions the bidders get information about the other bidders' private values and may therefore update their beliefs on the distribution of the values. The bidders have smooth ambiguity preferences and update their priors using consequentialist Bayesian updating. It is shown that ambiguity aversion usually affects bidding behavior the same way risk aversion does, but the main result is that this is not the case for continuous price descending auctions. This is new among a few theoretical cases where ambiguity aversion does not reinforce the risk aversion implications.

D89|Preferences, trust and willingness to pay for food information: An analysis of the Italian Market| Lack of consumer trust and communication strategies are probably the main determinants of information failure in modern food markets. This study attempts to tackle these aspects affecting the quality of food information by investigating questions related to what topics are more relevant to consumers, who should disseminate trustful food information, and how communication should be conveyed. Primary data were collected both through qualitative (in depth interviews and focus groups) and quantitative research. Quantitative research was conducted by means of a questionnaire administered in 2006-2007 to a sample of Italian respondents using both a web and a traditional mail survey. Reading preferences, willingness to pay and trust towards public and private sources conveying information through a hypothetical food magazine were assessed combining factor analysis, choice modelling and a criterion-based market segmentation. The study shows that reading preferences of Italian consumers can be summarized along three dimensions: agro-food system, enjoyment and wellness. Furthermore, willingness to pay for receiving food-related information is influenced by trust towards the type of publisher, which plays also a key role in market segmentation together with socio-demographic and economic variables such as gender, age, presence of children and income. Policy implications of these findings are discussed.

The approach is a critical one and involves references to global coverage in business intelligence, real-world business intelligence, global and real-time decision- making.
D89|Prizes and lemons: procurement of innovation under imperfect commitment|The literature on R&D contests implicitly assumes that contestants submit their innovation regardless of its value. This ignores a potential adverse selection problem. The present paper analyzes the procurement of innovations when the procurer cannot commit to never bargain with innovators who bypass the contest. We compare ?xed-prize tournaments with and without entry fees, and optimal scoring auctions with and without minimum score requirement. Our main result is that the optimal ?xed-prize tournament is more pro?table than the optimal auction since preventing bypass is more costly in the optimal auction.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D89|The struggle for Palestinian hearts and minds: Violence and public opinion in the Second Intifada|This paper examines how violence influences the political preferences of an aggrieved constituency that is purportedly represented by militant factions. Using longitudinal public opinion poll micro data of the Palestinian population linked to data on fatalities from the Second Intifada, we find that although local Israeli violence discourages Palestinians from supporting moderate political positions, this “radicalization” is fleeting, and vanishes completely within 90days. We do, however, find evidence suggesting that collateral violence affecting Palestinian civilians has a stronger effect on the populations' political preferences relative to individuals directly targeted by the Israeli military. In addition, we observe that major political events in the Palestinian–Israeli conflict have had a longer-term impact on political preferences. Individuals who were teenagers during the period of the Oslo negotiations tend to have relatively moderate preferences, while those who were teenagers during the First Intifada tend to be relatively radical.
D89|Does the seller of a house facing a large number of buyers always decrease its price when its first offer is rejected?|This paper investigates the optimal price sequence of a two period tentative to sell an indivisible good, with take-it-or-leave-it offers, in which the seller faces ambiguity about the buyers' willingness to pay. If the first round fails, the seller updates its beliefs on the state of the market in accordance with Bayes rule and quotes a second and final price. We show that the optimal sequence of prices can be increasing. Furthermore, we describe the optimal sequence of prices with a myopic seller who does not update his beliefs in the second period. In this case, the optimal price sequence is always decreasing.
D89|I don't want to hear about it: Rational ignorance among duty-oriented consumers|Individuals with a preference for keeping moral obligations may dislike learning that voluntary contributions are socially valuable: such information can trigger unpleasant feelings of cognitive dissonance. I show that if the initial belief about the social value of contributions is too low to merit a moral responsibility to contribute, duty-oriented consumers are willing to pay to avoid information. Information campaigns can make such consumers contribute by providing them with unwanted information.
D89|On the Number of alpha-Pivotal Players|We show that bounds like those of Al-Najjar and Smorodinsky (J. Econ. Theory, 2000) as well as of Gradwohl et al. (Math. Oper. Res., 2009) on the number of alpha-pivotal agents can be obtained by decomposition of variance. All these bounds have a similar asymptotic behaviour, up to constant factors. Our bound is weaker than that of Al-Najjar and Smorodinsky, but we require only pairwise independent—rather than independent—types. Our result strengthens the bound of Gradwohl et al.
D89|Identification Problems in Personality Psychology|This paper discusses and illustrates identification problems in personality psychology. The measures used by psychologists to infer traits are based on behaviors, broadly defined. These behaviors are produced from multiple traits interacting with incentives in situations. In general, measures are determined by these multiple traits and do not identify any particular trait unless incentives and other traits are controlled for. Using two data sets, we show, as an example, that substantial portions of the variance in achievement test scores and grades, which are often used as measures of cognition, are explained by personality variables.
D89|Power Asymmetry and Escalation in Bargaining|Bargaining is prevalent in economic interactions. Under complete information, game theory predicts efficient bargaining outcomes (immediate acceptance of first offer) (see Rubinstein, 1982). However, continuous rejections of offers leading to inefficient delays (escalation) have regularly been found in previous bargaining experiments even under complete information (see Roth, 1995). I test experimentally (1) whether power asymmetry leads to more escalation in bargaining and (2) whether perspective-taking reduces escalation. I find that power asymmetry increases escalation, but that perspective-taking does not reduce escalation.

D89|Place of OLAP Technology in Data Warehouse|Basically, the smooth running of any organization is provided by decisions that are taken in time, decisions that are correct as long as based on data and information on which to base those decisions. Data warehouses are the product of advanced technology and economic environment. On the one hand, the economic environment is increasingly competitive, global and complex and requires information developed for supporting The strategic decisions and on the other hand, developments in information technology provides solutions for efficient management of large volumes of data integrated. Most industry specialists believe that the data warehouse (data marts) and OLAP tools provide the necessary support to transform large volumes of data that companies working in information useful to decision makers.
D89|Agreeing to disagree with generalised decision functions|"We develop a framework that allows us to emulate standard results from the “agreeing to disagree"" literature with generalised decision functions (e.g. Bacharach (1985)) in a manner the avoids known incoherences pointed out by Moses and Nachum (1990). We analyse the implications of the Sure-Thing Principle, a central assumption. The upshot is that the way in which states are described matters, and that the results fail if decisions are allowed to depend on interactive information. Furthermore, using very weak additional assumptions, we extend all previous results to models with a non-partitional information structure in a coherent manner. Finally, we provide agreement theorems in which the decision functions are not required to satisfy the Sure-Thing Principle."
D89|Generalisation of Samet's (2010) agreement theorem|We develop a framework that allows us to reproduce the generalised agreement theorem of Samet (2010), and extend it to models with a non-partitional information structure, while highlighting the features that distinguish the result from the classic theorems found in the literature. Furthermore, we produce results that are similar to Samet’s with some modified assumptions.
D89|The Carnapian Aufbau model: epistemology of the sense-data|This paper proposes an interpretation theoretical model of the Aufbau of Rudolf Carnap, this interpretation contributes to upgrade the project original carnapian, in the sense of conferring to the constitutional program of construction logical, less committed analytic equipment with an ontology or clearly defined epistemology. The setting in phenomenal logical reconstruction practice is elaborated for the visual field as a model whose potential user is a fellow ideal percipient, and, a subject epistemic that operates in the same way that a scheduled computer when he has been given basic phenomenal information and some algorithms logical.
D89|Agreement theorems with interactive information: possibilities and impossibilities|Following from Tarbush (2011a), we explore the implications of using two different definitions of informativeness over kens; one that ranks objective, and the other subjective information. With the first, we create a new semantic operation that allows us to derive agreement theorems even when decision functions are based on interactive information (for any r ≥ 0). Effectively, this operation, unlike information cell union captures the notion of an agent becoming “more ignorant” for all modal depths. Using the definition that ranks subjective information however, we show an impossibility result: In generic models, agreement theorems using the standard Sure-Thing Principle do not hold when decision functions depend on interactive information (when r > 0).
D89|Voter Behavior and Seniority Advantage in Pork Barrel Politics|This paper uses experiments to explore electoral accountability in a legislative system that favors seniority. Voters face a trade-off between pork barrel transfers and policy representation. Term limits are tested as a mechanism to reduce the cost of searching for a legislator who better represents voters on policy, as well as reducing the resulting asymmetric distribution of income. Subjects’ preferences on abortion are used in an innovative means of capturing incumbents’ policy choices where subject legislators vote to determine whether a donation is allocated to either a pro-choice or pro-life foundation.
D89|Fact Finding Trips to Italy: An experimental investigation of voter incentives|This paper addresses the interaction of voter information and seniority on electoral accountability. We test whether information leads voters to be less tolerant of moral hazard in a legislative system favoring seniority. A simple game theoretic model is used to predict outcomes in a pork-barrel experiment where subjects act as legislators and voters. Senior legislators have an advantage in providing transfers which presents the opportunity to shirk where legislators can enrich themselves at the expense of voters. Voter information about incumbent behavior is varied across experimental treatments. We find that accountability increases when voters can compare their own legislator’s behavior to the behavior of others. Despite the fact that voters succumb to the incentives of seniority, information is effective in deterring legislator shirking.
D89|Monotone equimeasurable rearrangements with non-additive probabilities|In the classical theory of monotone equimeasurable rearrangements of functions, “equimeasurability” (i.e. the fact the two functions have the same distribution) is defined relative to a given additive probability measure. These rearrangement tools have been successfully used in many problems in economic theory dealing with uncertainty where the monotonicity of a solution is desired. However, in all of these problems, uncertainty refers to the classical Bayesian understanding of the term, where the idea of ambiguity is absent. Arguably, Knighitan uncertainty, or ambiguity is one of the cornerstones of modern decision theory. It is hence natural to seek an extension of these classical tools of equimeasurable rearrangements to situations of ambiguity. This paper introduces the idea of a monotone equimeasurable rearrangement in the context of non-additive probabilities, or capacities that satisfy a property that I call strong nonatomicity. The latter is a strengthening of the notion of nonatomicity, and these two properties coincide for additive measures and for submodular (i.e. concave) capacities. To illustrate the usefulness of these tools in economic theory, I consider an application to a problem arising in the theory of production under uncertainty.
D89|Identification Problems in Personality Psychology|This paper discusses and illustrates identification problems in personality psychology. The measures used by psychologists to infer traits are based on behaviors, broadly defined. These behaviors are produced from multiple traits interacting with incentives in situations. In general, measures are determined by these multiple traits and do not identify any particular trait unless incentives and other traits are controlled for. Using two data sets, we show, as an example, that substantial portions of the variance in achievement test scores and grades, which are often used as measures of cognition, are explained by personality variables.
D89|Parker, Wine Spectator and Retail Prices of Bordeaux Wines in Switzerland: Results from Panel Data 1995 - 2000|This paper considers the effect of Parker and Wine Spectator ratings on Swiss retail prices of the grand cru classé of Médoc , Graves and St Emilion as well as the most renowned wines of Pomerol in a panel data setting. The application of a two-way fixed effects regression model to data of the vintages 1995 to 2000 of 121 wines leads to the following conclusions: There is clear evidence that WS ratings do not provide additional information for retail prices when we take into account the fixed effects and the Parker ratings. The evidence of a marginal effect of Parker ratings on Bordeaux prices is mixed. We find it for five of the nine appellations, in particular for Paulliac and Pomerol where a one Parker point increase is estimated to lead to a 6-7% price increase. This “only” partial price influence of Parker is confirmed by comparing the estimated “chateau” fixed effects for the Médoc estates with their standing in the “old” 1855 classification and the most recent Parker classification of 2008.
D89|Information, Uncertainty, and Subjective Entitlements in Bargaining|More often than not production processes are the joint endeavor of people having different abilities and productivities. Such production processes and the associated surplus production are often not fully transparent in the sense that the relative contributions of involved agents are blurred; either by lack of information about the actual performance of collaborators or because of random noise in the production process or both. These variables likely influence the surplus sharing negotiations following the production. By means of a laboratory experiment, we systematically investigate their role for the whole bargaining process from opening offers to (dis)agreements and find that uncertainties in surplus production and (even) a very coarse performance information lead to bargaining asymmetries. In addition, we find that bargainersâ€™ subjective entitlements are also influenced by performance information and the randomness inherent in the production process. These differences in subjective entitlements together with the differences in entitlements between better and worse performers influence the whole bargaining process and significantly contribute to the differences in bargaining outcomes. Keywords: bargaining; performance information; randomness in production process; entitlements; experiments.
D89|The Impact of Gurus: Parker Grades and en primeur Wine Prices|The purpose of this paper is to measure the impact of Robert Parker's oenological grades on Bordeaux wine prices. We study their impact on the so-called en primeur wine prices, i.e., the prices determined by the château owners when the wines are still extremely young. The Parker grades are usually published in the spring of each year, before the wine prices are established. However, the wine grades attributed in 2003 have been published much later, in the autumn, after the determination of the prices. This unusual reversal is exploited to estimate a Parker effect. We find that, on average, the effect is equal to 2.80 euros per bottle of wine. We also estimate grade-specific effects, and use these estimates to predict what the prices would have been had Parker attended the spring tasting in 2003. (JEL Classification: C21, D89, L15).

D89|Uncertain induced generalized aggregation operators and its application in the theory of expertons|We present a new approach that unifies the induced generalized ordered weighted averaging (IGOWA) operator with the weighted average (WA) when the available information is uncertain and can be assessed with interval numbers. We call it the uncertain induced generalized ordered weighted averaging – weighted averaging (UIGOWAWA) operator. The main advantage of this approach is that it unifies the IOWA and the WA taking into account the degree of importance of each case in the formulation and considering that the information is given with interval numbers. We also study different properties of the UIGOWAWA operator and different particular cases. We also analyze the applicability of the new approach and we see that it is possible to develop a wide range of applications because all the previous studies that use the WA can be revised and extended with this new approach. We focus on an application in decision making with the theory of expertons. Thus, we are able to assess group decision making problems in a more complete way.

We study both the answer to a hypothetical lottery question and stated risky behavior and find that middle-borns are consistently less risk averse than others irrespective of the type of risk. Moreover, the answer to the lottery question is strongly correlated with economic and sport/lifestyle related risky behavior.

D89|The Generalized Hybrid Averaging Operator and its Application in Decision Making = La media generalizada híbrida y su aplicación en la toma de decisiones|We present the generalized hybrid averaging (GHA) operator. It is a new aggregation operator that generalizes the hybrid averaging (HA) operator by using the generalized mean. Thus, we are able to generalize a wide range of mean operators such as the HA, the hybrid geometric averaging (HGA), the hybrid quadratic averaging (HQA), the generalized ordered weighted averaging (GOWA) operator and the weighted generalized mean (WGM). A key feature in this aggregation operator is that it is able to deal with the weighted average and the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator in the same formulation. We further generalize the GHA by using quasi-arithmetic means obtaining the quasi-arithmetic hybrid averaging (Quasi-HA) operator. We conclude the paper with an example of the new approach in a financial decision making problem. En este artículo se presenta el operador de medias generalizadas híbridas. Es un nuevo operador de agregación que generaliza la media híbrida utilizando la media generalizada. Debido a esto, se puede generalizar una amplia gama de operadores de medias, como la media híbrida, la media geométrica híbrida, la media cuadrática híbrida, la media ponderada ordenada generalizada y la media ponderada generalizada. Un aspecto fundamental en este operador de agregación es la posibilidad de utilizar medias ponderadas y medias ponderadas ordenadas en la misma formulación. A continuación, se presenta una generalización mayor mediante la utilización de medias cuasi-aritméticas, obteniendo así la media cuasi-aritmética híbrida. El trabajo termina con un ejemplo de aplicación del nuevo modelo en un problema de toma de decisiones financieras.
D89|Rebordering the borders created by multidisciplinary sciences: A study|Emergence of “Glass ceiling” like phenomena in the minds of professionals doing research in a multidisciplinary subject needs to be studied. For an example, computational neurosciences(CNS) comprises of neurology, cognitive science, psychology, computer science, physics, mathematics, information technology, radiology, anthropology, sociology, and biology. When a specialist doing research in a multidisciplinary science like computational neuroscience, know less about other disciplines. This at times leads to tension among the members of the multidisciplinary group. This may create an environment where some members feel excluded. This may also lead to a power structure among different professionals. In case of CNS, the biological scientists feel the computational and engineering sciences may use their mathematical power to control them. On the other hand the engineering scientists feel they need to learn more about biology to understand CNS. The highly technical medical specialist such as Electro physiologists were also feeling like the biologists. As computational neurosciences gaining more importance, it is important to understand the interaction among the scientists from different disciplines and its effect on the development of discipline. The present paper is an attempt to study the dynamics of the members of the multidisciplinary group, who have done their short course on CNS.
D89|Social Memory, Evidence, and Conflict|"This paper examines an equilibrium model of social memory -- a society's vicarious beliefs about its past. We show that incorrect social memory is a key ingredient in creating and perpetuating destructive conflicts. We analyze an infinite-horizon model in which two countries face off each period in a game of conflict characterized by the possibility of mutually destructive ""all out war"" that yields catastrophic consequences for both sides. Each country is inhabited by a dynastic sequence of individuals. Each individual cares about future individuals in the same country, and can communicate with the next generation of their countrymen using private messages. Social memory is based on these messages, and on physical evidence -- a sequence of imperfectly informative public signals of past behavior. We find that if the future is sufficiently important for all individuals, then regardless of the precision of physical evidence from the past there is an equilibrium in which the two countries engage in all out war with arbitrarily high frequency, an outcome that cannot arise in the standard repeated game. In our construction, each new generation ""repeats the mistakes"" of its predecessors, leading to an endless cycle of destructive behavior. Surprisingly, we find that degrading the quality of information that individuals have about current decisions may ""improve"" social memory. This in turn ensures that arbitrarily frequent all out wars cannot occur. (Copyright: Elsevier)"
D89|Multiple sclerosis patients' preferences: a preliminary study on disease awareness and perception|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, disabling, and progressive illness, representing one of the most common causes of neurological disability in young and middle-aged adults. There is not a definitive treatment for MS yet. However, disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) for MS, which include interferon-beta and copolymer-1 have shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of relapses and the progression of disability. The clinical efficacy of such therapies has been well documented in the medical literature. Instead, the factors underlying the decision to start the pharmacological treatment, to continue it or to drop out, have not been studied so far. Adverse drug effects, as well as patients’ emotional states, therapeutic expectations, the need to assume the medicines very often, and lack of communication with medical staff, are some of the elements affecting patients’ adherence to the therapy. Data from medical records of 567 MS patients referred to the MS Centre of the IRCCS Centro Studi Neurolesi (Messina) between the years 2001-2008 have been retrospectively analyzed in a first phase. Factors influencing patient decision to start a pharmacological treatment with DMDs, in agreement with the neurologist suggestion, have been evaluated by applying a multinomial logit model. The second phase of the study was cross-sectional and analyzed the data obtained through a questionnaire administered to consecutive outpatients referred to Centro Studi Neurolesi within March and May 2009 (n = 143). The probability to proceed in the treatment or to drop out was estimated through a probit model. The present research constitutes a novelty among the existing economic and medical literature: in fact, there are no, so far, studies evaluating factors underlying MS patients’ decision to undergo a pharmacological treatment and to proceed it according to medical protocols. Moreover, a significant expenditure for health care systems is associated to MS treatment, both for patients who undergo the treatment (cost of medicines, productivity losses for patients who experience severe side effects, etc.) and for those who do not take the medicine or take it discontinuously. Given the documented evidence of augmenting costs (direct and indirect) with increasing disease severity, the ability of the DMDs to reduce relapse rates and slow the progression of MS may help to offset the cost of these therapies. Conversely, delayed treatment or poor compliance can dramatically increase costs and reduce benefits.
D89|The harmonic sequence paradox reconsidered|According to the harmonic sequence paradox (Blavatskyy 2006), an expected utility decision maker's willingness to pay for a gamble whose expected payoffs evolve according to the harmonic series is finite if and only if his marginal utility of additional income becomes eventually zero. Since the assumption of zero marginal utility is implausible, expected utility theory (as well as cumulative prospect theory) does apparently do a bad job in describing this decision behaviour. The present note demonstrates that the harmonic sequence paradox only applies to time-patient but not to time-impatient (risk-neutral) expected utility decision makers.

D89|Lying in Business : Insights from Hannah Arendt’s ‘Lying in Politics’|The famous political philosopher Hannah Arendt develops several arguments why truthfulness cannot be counted among the political virtues. This article shows that similar arguments apply to lying in business. Based on Hannah Arendt’s theory, we distinguish five reasons why lying is a structural temptation in business: business is about action to change the world and therefore businessmen need the capacity to deny current reality; commerce requires successful image-making and liars have the advantage to come up with plausible stories; business communication is more often about opinions than about facts, giving leeway to ignore uncomfortable signals; business increasingly makes use of plans and models, but these techniques foster inflexibility in acknowledging the real facts; businessmen fall easily prey to self-deception, because one needs to act as if the vision already materializes. The theory is illustrated by a case study of Landis that grew from a relative insignificant into a large organization within a short period of time, but ended with outright lies and bankruptcy.

D89|Creative Economy-Feasible Option for România|The paper’s objective is the scientific foundation of the necessity to implement the topic of creative economy in Romania. The term of creative economy is widely used in the context of the knowledge-based society. Its importance to sustainable development, wealth and prosperity is commonly recognised mostly due to the amplified crisis effects. The creative communities and industries have moved from the fringes to the mainstream. The special needs of creative industries are reflected more in policy development at national, regional and microeconomic levels. The paper presents part of the results obtained within the research project “IDEI 1224”: “The creative economy and knowledge-based society. Challenges and opportunities for Romania” The general perspective of this paper is aimed at presenting our vision regarding the most important challenges and opportunities for Romania on its road towards a knowledge-based society and creative economy. Creative economy is crucial for Romania while it is facing the global crisis. In order to manage the current crisis (its complex nature derives from the fact that it is much more than just an economic crisis) in a competent way we have to seriously take into account the opportunities creative economy can provide. According to the authors’ vision, creative economy is a feasible option for Romania. The creative economy has to foster a holistic vision of development including socio-cultural, economic and environmental dimensions, offering new opportunities for Romania on its road towards a knowledge-based society.
D89|The generalized index of maximum and minimum level and its application in decision making|The index of maximum and minimum level is a very useful technique, especially for decision making, which uses the Hamming distance and the adequacy coefficient in the same problem. In this paper, we suggest a generalization by using generalized and quasi-arithmetic means. As a result, we will get the generalized ordered weighted averaging index of maximum and minimum level (GOWAIMAM) and the Quasi-OWAIMAAM operator. These new aggregation operators generalize a wide range of particular cases such as the generalized index of maximum and minimum level (GIMAM), the OWAIMAM, the ordered weighted quadratic averaging IMAM (OWQAIMAM), and others. We also develop an application of the new approach in a decision making problem about selection of products.
D89|The induced 2-tuple linguistic generalized OWA operator and its application in linguistic decision making|We present the induced 2-tuple linguistic generalized ordered weighted averaging (2-TILGOWA) operator. This new aggregation operator extends previous approaches by using generalized means, order-inducing variables in the reordering of the arguments and linguistic information represented with the 2-tuple linguistic approach. Its main advantage is that it includes a wide range of linguistic aggregation operators. Thus, its analyses can be seen from different perspectives and we obtain a much more complete picture of the situation considered and are able to select the alternative that best fits with with our interests or beliefs. We further generalize the operator by using quasi-arithmetic means, and obtain the Quasi-2-TILOWA operator. We conclude this paper by analysing the applicability of this new approach in a decision-making problem concerning product management.
D89|Pessimism Or Optimism: A Justification To Voluntary Contributions Toward Environmental Quality|This article analyses the determinants of voluntary contribution to environmental quality by introducing the perception of environmental risk. We consider individuals who are aware both of the impact of their voluntary contributions and of the quality of the current environment on the future quality of environment. Their preferences are represented by the RDU model. We distinguish three kinds of effect: environmental quality, wealth and risk perception. The first effects are not always sufficient to explain agents' implication in the improvement of environmental quality.

Une contribution à l'analyse évolutionniste du changement économique|This article aims to illustrate how artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences may complement economic approaches to learning and coordination. This article proposes a model of individual rationality which microeconomic assumptions are based on the principles of induction, classification and generalisation of knowledge. Building on the “El Farol” model first introduced by Arthur [1994], we use a particular class of classifier systems to study how a population of artificial learning agents develop adapted decision rules in a variety of contexts. These rules allow agent to coordinate their actions by using only minimal information about their environment. Classification JEL : B40, B52, C72, D64, D83, D89
D89|Existence of equilibrium in common agency games with adverse selection|We establish the existence of subgame perfect equilibria in general menu games, known to be sufficient to analyze common agency problems. Our main result states that every menu game satisfying enough continuity properties has a subgame perfect equilibrium. Despite the continuity assumptions that we make, discontinuities naturally arise due to the absence, in general, of continuous optimal choices for the agent. Our approach, then, is based on (and generalizes) the existence theorem of [Simon, L., Zame, W., 1990. Discontinuous games and endogenous sharing rules. Econometrica 58 (4), 861-872] designed for discontinuous games.
D89|Indirect reciprocity and strategic reputation building in an experimental helping game|We study indirect reciprocity and strategic reputation building in an experimental helping game. At any time only half of the subjects can build a reputation. This allows us to study both pure indirect reciprocity that is not contaminated by strategic reputation building and the impact of incentives for strategic reputation building on the helping rate. We find that pure indirect reciprocity exists, but also that the helping decisions are substantially affected by strategic considerations. Finally, we find that strategic do better than non-strategic players and non-reciprocal do better than reciprocal players, casting doubt on previously proposed evolutionary explanations for indirect reciprocity.
D89|Do fiscal variables affect fiscal expectations? Experiments with real world and lab data|We generate observable expectations about fiscal variables through laboratory experiments using real world data from several European countries as stimuli. We compare a VAR model of expectations for data that is presented in a fiscal frame with one for neutrally presented data. We test the validity of the setup and find that participants understand the meaning of the fiscal variables, but also that their ability to perceive the correct characteristics of fiscal policy is limited. Expectations are consistent neither with rational nor with purely adaptive expectations, but instead follow an augmented-adaptive scheme.
D89|Sequential contracting with multiple principals|This paper considers dynamic games in which multiple principals contract sequentially and non-cooperatively with the same agent. We first show that when contracting is private, i.e. when downstream principals do not observe the mechanisms offered upstream and the decisions taken in these mechanisms, all PBE outcomes can be characterized through pure-strategy profiles in which the principals offer menus of contracts and delegate to the agent the choice of the contractual terms. We then show that, in most cases of interest for applications, the characterization of the equilibrium outcomes is further facilitated by the fact that the principals can be restricted to offer incentive-compatible extended direct mechanisms in which the agent reports the endogenous payoff-relevant decisions contracted upstream in addition to his exogenous private information. Finally we show how the aforementioned results must be adjusted to accommodate alternative assumptions about the observability of upstream histories and/or the timing of contracting examined in the literature.
D89|Factores cognitivos del diseño arquitectónico. Validación de un modelo|The cognitive factors that determine --in lesser or smaller measure-- the process of the conceptualization of design and the relationship with the result of the project carried out by the students are: the attitude of searching and exploring (V1), the knowledge of the problem (V2), the reflection-verbalization (V3), the schematic-abstraction (V4), the development of alternatives (V5) and the evaluation of the alternatives (V6) --components of the pattern MCDA. This appears as a didactical and methodological contribution and in the application of the cognitive focus in the teaching and learning of design, and with the focus of the education that is centered in the learning processes and the construction of knowledge. The main characteristic of this design process model is that it favors and stimulates a reflexive and creative phase as part of the same didactics of the design and offers possibility of making thoughts --logical and creative-- operational through the components that were validated in this study, as cognitive factors that determine the process of the conceptualization of design. Finally, since the design concept --product of the conceptualization of the design-- is the one that guides, organizes, and directs the architectural project until their final realization, it can be inferred --from the results obtained in this study-- that the development of a design concept by means of inclusion of the conceptualization phase --phase of the design process in which more creativity and creative thought is applied in different modalities-- can be part of the methodology of the design and therefore of the project and, this way, to respond to the deficiencies that the methods in the operational of the creative phase have shown.
D89|Cómo freír un huevo. La innovación didáctica al servicio de la docencia universitaria|In order to a perfect elaboration of the typical fried eggs and chips, it is necessary, firstly, to select a quality raw material; secondly, to wait until the oil is hot enough; thirdly, to let it drop conveniently, once fried. The presence of a border lace and the slight solidness of the yolk, together with the absence of liquid egg white, show the moment when the frying has finished. In a methodological scope, the application of new teaching methodologies to any kind of subject in higher education shows, itself, the suitableness of such innovative methods and the need of their universal and systematic utilization. A t the same time, while giving useful cooking solutions, didactic axioms are demonstrated in order to provide useful solutions for universities, within a crisis environment and a context of legal reformation and discontent. University should survive to this new situation, although transformed into another different thing.

Using a difference-in-difference strategy which flexibly accounts for macroeconomic conditions and also addresses potential problems of serial correlation, we isolate significant effects of the 9/11 (2001) terrorist attacks, as well as for the attacks in Egypt (1997), Tunisia (2002), Morocco (2003) and Indonesia (2003). These terror attacks impacted especially on Islamic countries all over the world, indicating a transmission mechanism driven by ethnic and religious proximity. At the same time, tourism into Islamic countries was temporarily substituted by tourism to (south) European countries.

D89|Science And Its Transactions Cost: The Emergence Of Institutionalized Science|Cognitive obstacles to perception of novelty on the scientific frontier created obstacles to evaluating scientific work and recruiting scientific workers had to be overcome for the scientific enterprise to expand to the point where it could significantly affect factor productivity. The principal problems arise from the idiosyncracy of observations on the research frontier and the exceptional specificity of the human capital employed in identifying and validating scientific novelty. Resolution of these problems was by no means inevitable or predictable, as the scientific institutions which had emerged as the principal institutional support of ‘Open Science’ in the seventeenth and eighteenth century could not be efficiently scaled up to accommodate the requirements of a greatly expanded scientific enterprise. This paper recounts how in the second quarter of the nineteenth century the emergence of decentralized university-based research networks in Germany resolved the problem of scale, laying the foundations for the discoveries that powered the ‘Second Industrial Revolution’ of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.

D89|A Decision Making Method for Educational Management Based on Distance Measures = Toma de decisiones en procesos de gestión de la educación basados en las medidas de distancia|We develop a new approach for decision making in educational management based on the use of distance measures. We focus on the selection of a studies plan from the perspective of an academic institution. We try to develop this approach showing the benefits of establishing an ideal plan that we compare with the available alternatives. We use the Minkowski distance, the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator and the interval numbers. The use of the Minkowski distance allows to make comparisons between the ideal plan and the available ones in the market. The OWA operator is an aggregation operator that provides a parameterized family of aggregation operators that includes the maximum, the minimum and the average criteria, among others. And the interval numbers is a very useful technique to represent the information when the environment is very complex, because it gives all the possible results from the minimum to the maximum. We introduce a new aggregation operator called the uncertain generalized ordered weighted averaging distance (UGOWAD) operator. It is a distance aggregation operator that uses the main characteristics of the Minkowski distance, the OWA operator and the interval numbers. We develop an illustrative example where we can see the usefulness of the UGOWAD operator to select a studies plan in education management. The main advantage of using the UGOWAD is that we can consider a wide range of distance aggregation methods in the decision problem. Then, the decision maker gets a more complete view of the decision problem, being able to select the alternative that better fits the interests. Se desarrolla un nuevo modelo para la toma de decisiones en procesos de gestión de la educación basados en las medidas de distancia. El análisis se enfoca en analizar un proceso de selección de plan de estudios desde la perspectiva de una institución académica. Se intenta mostrar la practicidad de utilizar un plan de estudios imaginario que sería el ideal a partir del cual se compararían las diferentes alternativas disponibles. Para realizar esto, se utilizarán diferentes técnicas disponibles en Teoría de la Decisión, como son la distancia de Minkowski, el operador de medias ponderadas (OWA) y los intervalos de confianza. La utilización de la distancia de Minkowski nos permite hacer comparaciones entre un plan de estudios ideal y los disponibles en la realidad. El operador OWA es un operador de agregación que proporciona una familia parametrizada de operadores de agregación entre los cuales se destaca el máximo, el mínimo y la media aritmética. Los intervalos de confianza son de gran utilidad para representar la información cuando el entorno es muy complejo, porque proporciona todos los resultados que se podrían producir desde un mínimo hasta un máximo. Por eso, incluye todos los posibles resultados que se pueden producir. Para realizar esto, se introduce un nuevo operador de agregación denominado como el operador de distancia media ponderada ordenada generalizada incierta (UGOWAD o UMOWAD). Es un operador de agregación de distancias que utiliza las principales características de la distancia de Minkowski, del operador OWA y de los intervalos de confianza. Se desarrolla un ejemplo ilustrativo en donde se puede ver la utilidad del operador UGOWAD para la selección de un plan de estudios en la gestión de la educación. La principal ventaja de utilizar el operador UGOWAD está en poder considerar una amplia gama de operadores de agregación de distancias en el problema decisional. Entonces, el decisor obtiene una visión mucho más completa del problema y está capacitado para seleccionar la alternativa que se acerca más a sus intereses.
D89|Should Courts Always Enforce What Contracting Parties Write?|We find an economic rationale for the common sense answer to the question in our title – courts (that maximize parties’ welfare under a veil of ignorance) should not always enforce what the contracting parties write. Courts can improve on the outcome that the parties would achieve without their intervention. We study a buyer-seller model with risk-neutral agents and asymmetric information. The court must decide when to uphold a contract and when to void it. The parties know their private information at the time of contracting, and this drives a wedge between ex-ante and interim-efficient contracts. In particular, if the court enforces all contracts, inefficient pooling obtains in equilibrium. By voiding some contracts the court is able to induce them to separate, and hence improve ex-ante welfare. Our results can also be interpreted as supporting the normative case for mandatory rules in contract law.
D89|The Benefits of Utilisation Computer System for Monitoring the Movements of Excise (EMCS)|Since 2009 - a new system will work fully computerized tracking of shipments to Romania for intra under suspension of excise goods: EMCS, the new system will record all economic validate who are entitled to send and receive excise goods within the EU. If the EU wants a company to deliver products to one of any other Member State, it may check the database if the recipient is a valid one and can work with him. The database will be updated daily and through the new system will simplify existing rules for commercial movements. EMCS is useful in reducing fraud by creating a system of rapid information exchange between customs authorities in the administration of excise duties.
D89|Either, Or. Exploration of an Emerging Decision Theory|A novel decision theory is emerging out of sparse findings in economics, mathematics and, most importantly, psychology and computational cognitive science. It rejects a fundamental assumption of the theory of rational decision-making, namely, that uncertain belief rests on independent assessment of utility and probability, and includes envisioning possibilities within its scope. Several researchers working with these premises, independently of one another, arrived at the conclusion that decision is made by highlighting the positive features of the alternative that will be chosen while opposing it to a loosing alternative, whose unpleasant aspects have been stressed. This article frames together contributions from different disciplines, often unknown to one another, with the hope of improving the coordination of research efforts. Furthermore, it discusses the status of the novel theory with respect to our current idea of rationality.
D89|Passing the buck in the garbage can model of organizational choice|We reconstruct Cohen, March and Olsen's Garbage Can model of organizational choice as an agent-based model. In the original model, the members of an organization can postpone decision-making. We add another means for avoiding making decisions, that of buck-passing difficult problems to colleagues. We find that selfish individual behavior, such as postponing decision-making and buck-passing, does not necessarily imply dysfunctional consequences for the organizational level. The simulation experiments confirm and extend some of the most interesting conclusions of the Garbage Can model: Most decisions are made without solving any problem, organization members face the same old problems again and again, and the few problems that are solved are generally handled at low hierarchical levels. These findings have an implication that was overseen in the original model, namely, that top executives need not be good problem-solvers.
D89|Standard-Setting and Knowledge Dynamics in Innovation Clusters|Extensive research has been conducted on how firms and regions take advantage of spatially concentrated assets, and also why history matters to regional specialisation patterns. In brief, it seems that innovation clusters as a distinctive regional entity in international business and the geography of innovation are of increasing importance in STI policy, innovation systems and competitiveness studies. Recently, more and more research has contributed to an evolutionary perspective on collaboration in clusters. Nonetheless, the field of cluster or regional innovation systems remains a multidisciplinary field where the state of the art is determined by the individual perspective (key concepts could, for example, be industrial districts, innovative clusters with reference to OECD, regional knowledge production, milieus & sticky knowledge, regional lock-ins & path dependencies, learning regions or sectoral innovation systems). According to our analysis, the research gap lies in both quantitative, comparative surveys and in-depth concepts of knowledge dynamics and cluster evolution. Therefore this paper emphasises the unchallenged in-depth characteristics of knowledge utilisation within a cluster's collaborative innovation activities. More precisely, it deals with knowledge dynamics in terms of matching different agents´ knowledge stocks via knowledge flows, common technology specification (standard-setting), and knowledge spillovers. The means of open innovation and system boundaries for spatially concentrated agents in terms of knowledge opportunities and the capabilities of each agent await clarification. Therefore, our study conceptualises the interplay between firm- and cluster-level activities and externalities for knowledge accumulation but also for the specification of technology. It remains particularly unclear how, why and by whom knowledge is aligned and ascribed to a specific sectoral innovation system. Empirically, this study contributes with several descriptive calculations of indices, e.g. knowledge stocks, GINI coefficients, Herfindahl indices, and Revealed Patent Advantage (RPA), which clearly underline a high spatial concentration of both mechanical engineering and biotechnology within a European NUTS2 sample for the last two decades. Conceptually, our paper matches the geography of innovation literature, innovation system theory, and new ideas related to the economics of standards. Therefore, it sheds light on the interplay between knowledge flows and externalities of cluster-specific populations and the agents' use of such knowledge, which is concentrated in space. We find that knowledge creation and standard-setting are cross-fertilising each other: although the spatial concentration of assets and high-skilled labour provides new opportunities to the firm, each firm's knowledge stocks need to be contextualised. The context in terms of 'use case' and 'knowledge biography' makes technologies (as represented in knowledge stocks) available for collaboration, but also clarifies relevance and ownership, in particular intellectual property concerns. Owing to this approach we propose a conceptualisation which contains both areas with inter- and intra-cluster focus. This proposal additionally concludes that spatial and technological proximity benefits standard-setting in high-tech and low-tech industries in very different ways. More precisely, the versatile tension between knowledge stocks, their evolution, and technical specification & implementation requires the conceptualisation and analysis of a non-linear process of standard-setting. Particularly, the use case of technologies is essential. Related to this approach, clusters strongly support the establishment of technology use cases in embryonic high-tech industries. Low-tech industries in contrast rather depend on approved knowledge stocks, whose dynamics provide better and fast accessible knowledge inputs within low-tech clusters.
D89|Knowledge diffusion and knowledge transfer: two sides of the medal|Understanding the way in which knowledge is technically produced and transferred, and how its diffusion path can be characterized is of fundamental importance for the performance of an economy. Although this fact seems to be plausible ex ante, the relevant literature so far has paid less attention investigating the microeconomic link between knowledge transfer and knowledge diffusion in a comprehensive approach. The aim of this paper is to highlight the link between knowledge transfer, knowledge diffusion and network effects in a stochastic environment, because the adoption decision of new knowledge should be treated as a stochastic event. For this reason, a new knowledge diffusion model in the line of Bass (1969) has been put forward, which integrates knowledge diffusion and knowledge transfer. The advantage of the proposed model is twofold. From a theoretical point of view, not only the so-called unimodal diffusion phenomena can be modelled, but also bimodal diffusion phenomena can be obtained. From an empirical point of view, the model which incorporates heteroscedastic errors and mean reverting behaviour can be theoretically estimated directly within a standard SUR context.
D89|Weitzman revisited: Emission standards vs. taxes with uncertain control costs and market power of polluting firms|It is well known that uncertainty concerning firms’ costs as well as market power of the latter have to be taken into account in order to design and choose environmental policy instruments in an optimal way. As a matter of fact, in most actual regulation settings the policy maker has to face both of these complications simultaneously. However, hitherto environmental economic theory has restricted to either of them when submitting conventional policy instruments to a comparative analysis. The article at hand takes a first step in closing this gap. It investigates the welfare effects of emission standards and taxes against the background of uncertain emission control costs and various degrees of the polluting firms’ market power.

D89|Truthful Revelation Mechanisms for Simultaneous Common Agency Games|We introduce new revelation mechanisms for simultaneous common agency games which, although they do not always permit a complete equilibrium characterization, do facilitate the characterization of the equilibrium outcomes that are typically of interest in applications. We then show how these mechanisms can be used in applications such as menu auctions, competition in nonlinear tariffs, and moral hazard settings. Lastly, we show how one can enrich the revelation mechanisms, albeit at a cost of an increase in complexity, to characterize all possible equilibrium outcomes, including those sustained by non-Markov strategies and/or mixed-strategy profiles. (JEL C72, D82, D86)
D89|Complementarities and macroeconomics: Poisson games|In many situations in macroeconomics strategic complementarities arise, and agents face a coordination problem. An important issue, from both a theoretical and a policy perspective, is equilibrium uniqueness. We contribute to this literature by focusing on the macroeconomic aspect of the problem: the number of potential innovators, speculators e.t.c. is large. In particular, we follow Myerson (1998, 2000) that in large games “a more realistic model should admit some uncertainty about the number of players in the game”. In more detail, we model the coordination problem as a Poisson game, and investigate the conditions under which unique equilibrium selection is obtained.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D89|On the use of menus in sequential common agency|We illustrate, by means of two examples, why assuming the principals offer simple menus (i.e. collections of payoff-relevant alternatives) as opposed to more general mechanisms may preclude a complete characterization of the set of equilibrium outcomes in certain sequential contracting environments. We then discuss how refinements of the solution concept, or enrichments of the menus that allow for recommendations, may restore the possibility of using menus to obtain a complete equilibrium characterization.
D89|Can incentives for research harm research? A business schools' tale|This paper develops a simple model of the market for academic publications in business and economics. The supply of papers is presented as the outcome of a game between researchers and schools' deans under imperfect information about the quality of a given paper. The demand for papers brings into the picture the editorial selection process. After defining the equilibrium of this market, the model allows us to study the consequences of more powerful incentives for publication in major journals. It turns out that too large bonuses, as implemented by business schools in the recent years, might bring about several unpleasant consequences, such as a drop in the quality of major journals, a decline in the number of top-tier publications realized by leading research institutions and a fall in the expected compensation of top researchers.
D89|Real Option Applications to Information Security|Real options present advantages over the standard discounting methods. In this paper we analyze them briefly and examine their potential applications on information security. The applications of real options on valuation of information assets, information security investment and capital budgeting provide considerable benefits. Finally portfolios of real options and other financial products can reduce information security risk.
D89|Trends nelle media relations in Italia|After looking at the relationship between journalism and public relations (PR) we analyze the impact of Internet on this interplay. A content analysis was conducted in order to investigate the utilization of the Internet for communicating corporate information -especially media relations - by the top Italian companies in the Mediobanca ranking lists. Analyses revealed that only 66% of Web sites have a dedicated press rooms where media content is centralized. The study shows that web-based corporate reporting in Italy is still in its infancy: lack of advanced technology such as RSS and corporate web blogs. News releases are the most frequently available materials, .
D89|Could a Resource be Simultaneously a Schedule according to the REA Ontology|This paper describes using of the Resource-Event-Agent (REA) framework to model enterprise planning at operational level. The aim is to further utilize the possibilities and potential of the framework in the areas with prevailing conversion rather than exchange processes. During the modeling we came across the situation when an entity may be viewed as two different REA concepts, which breaks the REA ontology. In the next of the paper we suggest some rational possibility how to solve the problem. The paper also partly mentions the mechanism of inner or nested classes that can be used for implementation of the two different views on the entity in the given context.
D89|Výuka webových technologií v souvislosti s potřebami podnikatelského prostředí a státní správy<BR>[Education of Web Technologies in Connection with Needs of Corporate Environment and Public Administration]|Internet with all services is integral part of profession and private life of the all community. Web technologies develop very quickly and its usage has an increasing trend. Web technologies are used for various purposes in private business and public administration companies. In both cases web technologies are very important and have a big sense to support of presentation, communication and generally control processes. Today there are quite a number of standards and methods of web interface development. One of main goal of web technologies is communication of external environment and information systems, because information systems are one of fundamental part of all types of companies because of support operational and control processes. With web technologies expansion is growing need to educate new specialists and users. It is target of technical and economic universities. In this respect we have to observe uses of external environment and offer fields of study whose school-leavers find good jobs. Web technologies area is very extensive and always we have to do thorough evaluation what to teach in terms of fields of study in singles types of schools.
D89|Endogenous competences and linkages development|In this paper we analyze empirically the influence of firms’ endogenous competences in the existence, quality and results of the linkages between firms and different types of agents. Using survey data from 170 firms belonging to the steel making and automotive production networks in Argentina, we show that the level of endogenous competences influences the linkages’ quality, objectives and results. Higher level of competences generates more virtuous linkages and influences the objectives that firms are after when interacting. Without certain minimum competences, firms only relate commercially and do not form links aimed to exchange knowledge or innovate. Better standing in terms of competences positively affects the probability of being involved in technological transfer agreements and cooperation agreements aimed at innovation. Being involved in useful interations requires previous competences, defining a vicious circle that calls for public intervention and policy implementation.
D89|Collaborative Research in India: Academic Institution v/s Industry|The term ‘collaboration’ is used to depict the all forms of agreement between academic institutions, corporate, universities, and any combination of such two or more parties who share the commitment to reach a common goal by using their resources available. Collaboration in Research and development (R&D) sector has been broadly used phenomenon for many years in India. In the collaborative research, the significant factors like time & cost being reduced to large extent because of sharing of the resources by the parties. Collaborative research contributes to the technological and economical development of the country. Collaboration avoids duplication in research. But there are lots of questions, may be arising in your mind like: what is actual meaning of collaborative research? Why do industries collaborate with the academic institutions? What goes on in the collaborative research? What are the effects of collaborative research? Which type of policy do they have? and simultaneously there are lots of issues - involved in collaborative research like intellectual property rights, technology licensing, confidential agreement etc. how can all these issues be resolved before or during collaboration, so that a healthy relationship may be established for the future benefits of all the parties involved? The purpose of writing this paper is to shed the light on the solutions available of all these questions and the issues arise between the parties involved in the collaborative research program.
D89|Credit Rationing with Symmetric Information|Without denying the importance of asymmetric information, this article purports the view that credit rationing may also originate from a lender's inability to classify loan applicants in proper risk categories. This effect is particularly strong when novel technologies are involved. Furthermore, its relevance may increase with the importance assigned to internal rating systems by the Basel accord. This article presents a measure of the inadequacy of a lender's classification criteria to the qualitative features of prospective borrowers. Even without information asymmetries, credit rationing may occur if this quantity reaches too high a value. Furthermore, some general principles are outlined, that may be used by lenders in order to change their classification criteria.

D89|Induced aggregation operators in decision making with the Dempster-Shafer belief structure|We study the induced aggregation operators. The analysis begins with a revision of some basic concepts such as the induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator and the induced ordered weighted geometric (IOWG) operator. We then analyze the problem of decision making with Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. We suggest the use of induced aggregation operators in decision making with Dempster-Shafer theory. We focus on the aggregation step and examine some of its main properties, including the distinction between descending and ascending orders and different families of induced operators. Finally, we present an illustrative example in which the results obtained using different types of aggregation operators can be seen.
