Q02|Global Commodity Markets and Rebalancing in China: The Case of Copper|Given that China accounts for about half of global copper consumption, it is reasonable to expect that any significant change in Chinese copper consumption will have an impact on the global market. This paper examines the likely impact of the rebalancing of the Chinese economy on its copper consumption over the next decade, focusing on the relationship between the copper intensity of GDP and the share of investment in GDP. We use a panel smooth transition regression model to account for potential non-linearities in this relationship at different levels of urbanization and income. Our findings suggest that there is indeed a significant relationship between a country’s copper intensity of GDP and its investment share. Our baseline rebalancing scenario for China implies that copper intensity in China has already peaked and is expected to decline steadily through the next decade. This anticipated reduction in Chinese copper intensity is the result of the dampening impact of rebalancing and higher per capita income on copper intensity, which more than offsets the upward pressure stemming from the ongoing process of urbanization. An exploration of alternative rebalancing scenarios suggests that China’s rebalancing path could have a significant impact on global copper consumption.
Q02|The Risk of Policy Tipping and Stranded Carbon Assets|If global warming is to stay below 2°C, there are four risks of assets stranding. First, substantial fossil fuel reserves will be stranded at the end of the fossil era. Second, this will be true for exploration capital too. Third, unanticipated changes in present or expected future climate policy cause instantaneous discrete jumps in today’s valuation of physical and natural capital. Fourth, if timing and intensity of climate policy are uncertain, revaluation of assets occurs as uncertainty about future climate policy is resolved. E.g. abandoning climate policy plans immediately boosts scarcity rent, market capitalization, exploration investment and discoveries. To explain and quantify these four effects, we use an analytical model of investment in exploration capital with intertemporal adjustment costs, depletion of reserves and market capitalization, and calibrate it to the global oil and gas industry. Climate policy implements a carbon budget commensurate with 2°C peak warming and we allow for different instruments: immediate or delayed carbon taxes and renewable subsidies. The social welfare ranking of these instruments is inverse to that of the oil and gas industry which prefers renewable subsidy and delaying taxes for as long as possible. We also pay attention to how the legislative “risk” of tipping into policy action affects the timing of the end of the fossil era, the profitability of existing capital, and green paradox effects.
Q02|Monetary policy for commodity booms and busts|Macroeconomic volatility in commodity-exporting economies is closely tied to fluctuations in international commodity prices. Commodity booms improve exporters' terms of trade and loosen their borrowing conditions, while busts lead to the reverse. This paper studies optimal monetary policy for commodity exporters in a small open economy framework that includes a key role for financial conditions. We incorporate the interaction between the commodity and financial cycles via a working capital constraint for commodity producers, which loosens as commodity prices increase. A rise in global commodity prices causes an inefficient reallocation towards the commodity sector, which expands and increases its demand for inputs. The real exchange-rate appreciates, but because domestic fims do not internalize that the appreciation reduces the scale of the reallocation, they do not raise prices enough. An inefficient boom takes place, with inflation rising and output increasing relative to its welfare-maximizing level. Returning inflation to target is not sufficient to close the output gap, leaving the policymaker facing a stabilization tradeoff. The optimal policy lets the exchange rate appreciate and raises interest rates, with a larger rate rise required the greater the loosening in borrowing conditions. The paper compares alternative policy rules and discusses a key practical challenge for emerging and developing economies: how to transition to a stable path from initial conditions of high and persistent inflation.
Q02|Measurement Errors in Index Trader Positions Data: Is the Price Pressure Hypothesis Still Invalid?|In this paper, we examine whether the repeated rejection of Masters' price pressure hypothesis is robust with respect to measurement errors in index trader position data. We allow for autocorrelated errors and a potential impact of index trader positions on the level and volatility of commodity returns. The resulting state-space model is estimated via particle MCMC. The empirical investigation relies on weekly data for eleven commodities contained in the SCoT reports. Our empirical findings show that the rejection of the price pressure hypothesis is robust concerning the inclusion of measurement errors in index trader positions data.
Q02|Currency Collapses and Output Dynamics in Commodity Dependent Countries|This paper provides new empirical evidence on the relationship between currency collapses (i.e. large nominal depreciations or devaluations) and real output by paying a specific attention to commodity exporting countries. Using a dataset including 108 emerging and developing economies for the period 1970-2016, we document and estimate what happens to output growth during episodes of currency collapses for commodity-dependent and non commodity-dependent countries. One particular feature of our analysis is to control for war events. We find that currency crises occur more frequently in commodity-dependent countries (one crisis every 17 years versus 30 years for non commodity-dependent countries) and with a larger magnitude (median depreciation about 12 percent points larger for commodity-dependent countries). In both groups of countries, output growth declines in response to the currency collapse. It appears however that output growth starts to slowdown earlier in commodity-dependent countries while the impact is more persistent in non commodity-dependent countries. The magnitude of the output growth slowdown is very close between the two groups of countries. Finally, we find that the output growth-currency collapse relationship differs among commodity-dependent countries according to the category of their main exported commodity.
Q02|Price Discovery in Agricultural Commodity Markets: Do Speculators Contribute?|Previous literature on price discovery in commodity markets is mainly focused on the question whether the spot or the futures market dominates the price discovery process. Little attention, however, has been paid to the question how the price discovery process is affected by futures speculation. Using different measures for speculation and hedging and a new price discovery metric, the present study analyzes this relationship for various agricultural commodities. The results indicate that speculative activity generally reduces the level of noise in the futures market, while increasing the relative contribution of the futures market to the price discovery process.
Q02|The Impact of jumps and leverage in forecasting the co-volatility of oil and gold futures|The paper investigates the impact of jumps in forecasting co-volatility in the presence of leverage effects. We modify the jump-robust covariance estimator of Koike (2016), such that the estimated matrix is positive definite. Using this approach, we can disentangle the estimates of the integrated co-volatility matrix and jump variations from the quadratic covariation matrix. Empirical results for daily crude oil and gold futures show that the co-jumps of the two futures have significant impacts on future co-volatility, but that the impact is negligible in forecasting weekly and monthly horizons.
Q02|Welfare Effect and Elite Capture in Agricultural Cooperatives Intervention: Evidence from Ethiopian Villages|This paper evaluates the impact of the Purchase 4 Progress (P4P) intervention implemented by World Food Program in Ethiopia on per capita income as well as across sub-social groups. The intervention is intended to improve the market power of smallholder farmers through cooperatives that has the potential to increase the relative farm gate price of agricultural produce, particularly staple crops. Using a semi-parametric difference-in-difference (DID) model, which relaxes the parallel trend assumption, we show that the P4P intervention has raised per capita consumption of smallholders. Estimates of the treatment effect from alternative specifications of our preferred models ranged between Ethiopian Birr (ETB) 188.3 and ETB 248.6 (15.10% and 19.93%). Moreover, our analysis suggests heterogeneous treatment effects related to elite capture within Farmer Organizations. Policy implications are discussed.
Q02|Measuring Global Economic Activity|A number of economic studies have used a proxy for world real economic activity derived from shipping costs. This measure turns out to depend on a normalization that has substantive consequences of which users of the index had been unaware prior to this paper. This paper further evaluates this and alternative measures in terms of treatment of trends, coherence with world output, and ability to predict commodity prices. I conclude that measures derived from world industrial production offer a better indicator of global real economic activity.
Q02|Can Financial Participants Improve Price Discovery and Efficiency in Multi-Settlement Markets with Trading Costs?|The introduction of purely financial participants into commodity markets is thought to yield forward prices that better reflect future spot prices, and ultimately, more efficient future production and consumption decisions. However, there are sizable transaction costs associated with trading in most commodity markets. This paper develops a statistical test of the null hypothesis that expected forward/spot price spreads cannot be arbitraged even after accounting for these transactions costs. We apply this test to hourly, location-specific day-ahead and real-time prices from California's wholesale electricity market. The implied trading cost required to reject the null hypothesis of no profitable arbitrage opportunities falls significantly after California allowed purely financial participation. Moreover, variable input costs per MWh of electricity produced fell by 3.6% in high demand hours after the introduction of purely financial participants. Combined, our evidence supports the hypothesis that the introduction of purely financial participants into the California wholesale electricity market decreased the average difference and the volatility of the difference between day-ahead and real-time prices, which ultimately lowered the total variable cost of serving demand
Q02|Fluctuations de prix des matières premières et économie congolaise : manne d’espoir ou de malédiction ?<BR>[Fluctuations in commodity price and the congolese economy: hope or curse manna?]|With the recent fall in commodity prices, the super-dependent economies of commodities, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have been shaken, especially as these countries consider commodity as manna falling from the sky. Movements in commodity prices have led to significant fluctuations. This article analyzes the short and long-term sensitivity of the Congolese economy to fluctuations in commodity prices and verifies the resource curse hypothesis in the DRC. Using the fully modified least squares method (FM-OLS), we estimated the error correction model. Our conclusions suggest that the Congolese economy suffers adverse effects on short and long-term commodity price shocks. The readjustment of the economy is slow and long. The national economy does not enjoy the benefits of commodity prices, but is only suffering the devastating effects. Hence the commodity do not seem like a manna of hope and the economy remains in an eternal whirlwind of curse. As the DRC does not have a solid fiscal space, the challenge is to find pragmatic, cost-effective solutions. Economic procyclicality weighs on political strategies, and ambitious processes of structural reforms are beneficial.
Q02|Forecasting Realized Oil-Price Volatility: The Role of Financial Stress and Asymmetric Loss|We analyze the role of global and regional measures of financial stress in forecasting realized volatility of the oil market based on 5-minute intraday data covering the period of 4th January, 2000 until 26th May, 2017. In this regard, we use various variants of the Heterogenous Autoregressive (HAR) model of realized volatility (HAR-RV). Our main finding is that indexes of financial stress help to improve forecasting performance, with it being important to differentiate between regional sources of financial stress (United States, other advanced economies, emerging markets). Another key finding is that the shape of the forecaster loss function that one uses to evaluate forecasting performance plays an important role. More specifically, forecasters who attach a higher cost to an overprediction of realized volatility as compared to an underprediction of the same absolute size should pay particular attention to financial stress originating in the U.S. But, in case an underprediction is more costly than a comparable overprediction, then forecasters should closely monitor financial stress caused by developments in emerging-market economies. In sum, financial stress does have predictive value for realized oil-price volatility, with alternative types of investors benefitting from monitoring different regional sources of financial stress.
Q02|Gold-Oil Dependence Dynamics and the Role of Geopolitical Risks: Evidence from a Markov-Switching Time-Varying Copula Model|This paper examined the dependence structure and dynamics between gold and oil prices. Specifically, we examined the hedge and safe haven ability of gold for oil prices using the time-varying Markov switching copula models and daily gold prices and West Texas Intermediate Institute (WTI) crude oil spot prices from 2 January 1985 to 30 November 2017. The heterogeneity of market agents is captured by decomposing the raw original series into different multi-resolution analysis (MRA) investment horizons (D1-S9). Further, we examined the effect of geopolitical risks on the dynamic dependence between gold and oil. We provide evidence of time-varying Markov tail dependence structure and dynamics between gold and oil. While our results showed that gold is a good hedge for oil returns and for short- and medium-term investors, it cannot protect long-term investors against losses arising from increasing oil prices. We also provide evidence in support of the safe haven ability of gold for oil. Further, we show that the inclusion of geopolitical risks in a pure gold and oil asset portfolio provides diversification benefits since the former has mostly negative effect on the dependence structure between gold and oil.
Q02|Oil Price Uncertainty and Movements in the US Government Bond Risk Premia|In this paper, we analyze the predictability of the movements of bond premia of US Treasury due to oil price uncertainty over the monthly period 1953:06 to 2016:12. For our purpose, we use a higher order nonparametric causality-in-quantiles framework, which in turn, allows us to test for predictability over the entire conditional distribution of not only bond returns, but also its volatility, by controlling for misspecification due to uncaptured nonlinearity and structural breaks, which we show to exist in our data. We find that oil uncertainty not only predicts (increases) US bond returns, but also its volatility, with the effect on the latter being stronger. In addition, oil uncertainty tends to have a stronger impact on the shortest and longest maturities (2- and 5-year), and relatively weaker impact on bonds with medium-term (3- and 4-year) maturities. Our results are robust to alternative measures of oil market uncertainty and bond market volatility.
Q02|Movements in International Bond Markets: The Role of Oil Prices|In this paper, we analyze daily data-based price transmission and volatility spillovers between crude oil and bond markets of major oil exporters and importers, by accounting for structural shifts as a smooth process in causality and volatility spillover estimations. In general, we find that, oil prices tend to predict bond prices in majority of oil exporting countries, and for the two major oil importers of India and China. But, the feedback from bond to oil prices is weak, and is detected for China and USA. Regarding volatility spillovers, oil volatility affects the bond market volatility of some major oil exporters (Kuwait, Norway and Russia), and an importer (France). However, the most prominent volatility spillovers are from bond to oil, except for Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. We also reveal that taking into account for smooth structural shifts - accounting for structural breaks - strengthens our findings and particularly is important for volatility spillover analysis. Our results have important implications for academics, investors, and policy makers.
Q02|Global Crises and Gold as a Safe Haven: Evidence from Over Seven and a Half Centuries of Data|Using annual data spanning the period of 1258-2018, we test the safe haven characteristic of gold in the wake of global crises. We find that, when we allow for regime-switching to capture nonlinearity and structural breaks, gold serves as a strong hedge against crises, especially during the bullish regime of the market, and in particular from the post-World War I period, as suggested by a time-varying model. In comparison, silver, however, does not seem to possess the safe haven property over the historical period of 1688-2018. Finally, we also find that global crises can accurately predict real gold returns over a long-span (1302-2018) out-of-sample period.
Q02|Forecasting Volatility and Co-volatility of Crude Oil and Gold Futures: Effects of Leverage, Jumps, Spillovers, and Geopolitical Risks|For purposes of forecasting the covariance matrix for the returns of crude oil and gold futures, this paper examines the effects of leverage, jumps, spillovers, and geopolitical risks, using their respective realized covariance matrices. In order to guarantee the positive definiteness of the forecasts, we consider the full BEKK structure on the conditional Wishart model. By the specification, we can divide flexibly the direct and spillover effects of volatility feedback, negative returns, and jumps. The empirical analysis indicates the benefits in accommodating the spillover effects of negative returns and the geopolitical risks indicator for modelling and forecasting the future covariance matrix.
Q02|Price and Volatility Linkages between International REITs and Oil Markets|In this paper, we use a Quantile Structural Vector Autoregressive (QSVAR) model, estimated over the quarterly period of 1975:Q3 to 2017:Q3, to analyze whether the impact of monetary policy shocks on real housing returns in the United States is contingent on the initial state of housing market sentiment. We find that contractionary monetary policy reduces real housing returns more strongly when the market is characterized by optimism rather than pessimism, with this effect being more pronounced under unconventional monetary policy decisions. Further robustness checks confirm our results. Our findings highlight the role in sentiments in driving the policy effectiveness and thus, have important implications for policy decisions.
Q02|Moments-Based Spillovers across Gold and Oil Markets|In this paper, we use intraday futures market data on gold and oil to compute returns, realized volatility, volatility jumps, realized skewness and realized kurtosis. Using these daily metrics associated with two markets over the period of December 2, 1997 to May 26, 2017, we conduct linear, nonparametric, and time-varying (rolling) tests of causality, with the latter two approaches motivated due to the existence of nonlinearity and structural breaks. While, there is hardly any evidence of spillovers between the returns of these two markets, strong evidence of bidirectional causality is detected for realized volatility, which seems to be resulting from volatility jumps. Evidence of spillovers are also detected for the crash risk variables, i.e., realized skewness, and for realized kurtosis as well, with the effect on the latter being relatively stronger. Moreover, based on a moments-based test of causality, evidence of co-volatility is deduced, whereby we find that extreme positive and negative returns of gold and oil tend to drive the volatilities in these markets. Our results have important implications for not only investors, but also policymakers.
Q02|Gold, Platinum and the Predictability of Bond Risk Premia|We show that the ratio of gold to platinum prices (GP) contains significant predictive information for excess U.S. government bond returns, even after controlling for a large number of financial and macro factors. Including GP in the model improves the predictive accuracy, over and above the standard macroeconomic and financial predictors, at all forecasting horizons for the shortest maturity bonds and at longer forecasting horizons for bonds with longer maturities beyond 2 years. The findings highlight the predictive information captured by commodity prices on bond market excess returns with significant investment and policy making implications.
Q02|Risk Aversion and the Predictability of Crude Oil Market Volatility: A Forecasting Experiment with Random Forests|We analyze the predictive power of time-varying risk aversion for the realized volatility of crude oil returns based on high-frequency data. While the popular linear heterogeneous autoregressive realized volatility (HAR-RV) model fails to recognize the predictive power of risk aversion over crude oil volatility, we find that risk aversion indeed improves forecast accuracy at all forecast horizons when we compute forecasts by means of random forests. The predictive power of risk aversion is robust to various covariates including realized skewness and realized kurtosis, various measures of jump intensity and leverage. The findings highlight the importance of accounting for nonlinearity in the data-generating process for forecast accuracy as well as the predictive power of non-cashflow factors over commodity-market uncertainty with significant implications for the pricing and forecasting in these markets.
Q02|Commodity Price Uncertainty as a Leading Indicator of Economic Activity|In this paper we examine the impact of commodity price uncertainty on US economic activity. Our empirical analysis indicates that uncertainty in agricultural, metals and energy markets depresses US economic activity and acts as an early warning signal for US recessions with a forecasting horizon ranging from one to twelve months. The results reveal that uncertainty shocks in agricultural and metals markets are more significant for the US macroeconomy when compared to oil price uncertainty shocks. Finally, we show that when accounting for the effects of macroeconomic and monetary factors, the negative dynamic response of economic activity to agricultural and metals price uncertainty shocks remains unaltered, while the response to energy uncertainty shocks is significantly reduced due to either systematic policy reactions or random shocks in monetary policy.
Q02|Approaches to Price Formation in Financialised Commodity Markets|A recent debate over the financialisation of commodity markets has stimulated the development of approaches to price formation which incorporate index traders as a new trader category in commodity futures markets. I survey these new approaches by retracing their emergence to traditional price formation models and show that these new models arise from a synthesis between commodity arbitrage pricing and asset pricing theories in the tradition of Keynesian inspired hedging pressure models. Based on these insights, I derive testable hypotheses to provide guidance for a growing literature that seeks to empirically evaluate the effects of index traders on price discovery and risk management in commodity futures markets.
Q02|Analyzing the structural transformation of commodity markets: financialization revisited|The first decade of the 21st century saw wide fluctuations in commodity prices and a massively increased participation of financial investors in the commodity derivatives markets. The investigation of whether the presence of financial investors was responsible for these fluctuations - and, more in general, whether large trades affected futures and spot prices - has yielded mixed results in the literature. We take up this question by linking financialization to the ongoing structural transformation of the commodity markets. First, we discuss issues related to the identification of the price effects of financialization; then, we present models of commodity markets with heterogeneous agents and informational frictions and discuss the role of financial investors as the counterparts of commercial hedgers. Lastly, we suggest some avenues for future research, including the possible implications of the shale revolution and of commodity trading in the financialization process.
Q02|Oil price collapse and firm leverage in resource-dependent countries|This study examines the financial channel between oil price volatility and the resource curse using firm-level data. A collapse in oil prices adversely affects firm borrowing in resource-dependent countries. However, unlike in non-resource-dependent countries where just the resource sector is harmed, both resource and non-resource firms are affected in resource-dependent countries in an oil price collapse. We also find evidence of a flight to quality in lending, implying that the decline in leverage can partly be attributed to a reduction in the credit supply. Our results suggest that oil price volatility operates via the financial channel to impede economic diversification in resource-dependent countries.
Q02|How to Measure Financial Market Efficiency? A Multifractality-Based Quantitative Approach with an Application to the European Carbon Market|This paper proposes a new measure for the evaluation of financial market efficiency, the so-called intermittency coefficient. This is a multifractality measure that can quantify the deviation from a random walk within the framework of the multifractal random walk model by Bacry et al. (2001b). While the random walk corresponds to the most genuine form of market efficiency, the larger the value of the intermittency coefficient is, the more inefficient a market would be. In contrast to commonly used methods based on Hurst exponents, the intermittency coefficient is a more powerful tool due to its well-established inference apparatus based on the generalised method of moments estimation technique. In an empirical application using data from the largest currently existing market for tradable pollution permits, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, we show that this market becomes more efficient over time. In addition, the degree of market efficiency is overall similar to that for the US stock market; for one sub-period, the market efficiency is found to be higher. While the first finding is anticipated, the second finding is noteworthy, as various observers expressed concerns with regard to the information efficiency of this newly established artificial market.
Q02|Common factors of commodity prices|There is a strong co-movement in the prices of international commodities. This is explained by a single common factor that is closely related to fluctuations in global economic activity. The common factor, which is indicative of global demand pressures, explains a large share of commodity price fluctuations, and its importance has increased since the early 2000s, especially for oil and metal prices. JEL Classification: C51, C53, Q02
Q02|Predicting exchange rate with commodity prices: The role of structural breaks and asymmetries|In this paper, we offer new evidence on the predictability of exchange rate with commodity prices by accounting for the role of asymmetries and structural breaks. In particular, we evaluate whether such considerations matter for the forecast performance of the predictive model for exchange rate. We further account for any possible bias in estimation due to the presence of persistence, endogeneity and conditional heteroscedasticity effects in our predictors. Monthly data of five major tradable currency pairs in the world and disaggregated commodity price indices over the period of 1960 to 2017 are utilized. We find significant improvements in both the in-sample and out-of-sample forecast performance of the predictive model for exchange rate when asymmetries and structural breaks are accommodated. In addition, all the economic models considered with and without asymmetries and structural breaks offer superior forecast performance over the ARFIMA model. Our results are robust to alternative exchange rates and commodity price indices and different breaks, data samples and forecast horizons.
Q02|Nonlinear Intermediary Pricing in the Oil Futures Market|We study the state-dependent trading behavior of financial intermediaries in the oil futures market, using structural vector autoregressions with Markov switching in heteroskedasticity. We decompose changes in futures price volatility into changes in the slopes of traders' demand curves and in the variability of their demand shocks. We find that the downward-sloping demand curve of intermediaries steepens significantly during turbulent times. Moreover, the variance of intermediaries' own demand shocks doubles during these episodes. These findings suggest that the futures pricing of intermediaries is nonlinear and increases the hedging costs of producers and processors of oil when volatility is high.
Q02|On the time‐varying links between oil and gold: New insights from the rolling and recursive rolling approaches|This study analyses the dynamic linkages between oil and gold prices for the spot and 1‐ to 12‐month futures markets using monthly data over the period 1983–2016. To do this, we use the rolling and recursive rolling Granger causality approaches. The distinguishing feature of this study from the previous studies is that this is the first study investigating the causal links between oil and gold using time‐varying causality tests. The findings show that the causality links between oil and gold display strong time variation. Although causal links are not detected for most of the study period, strong bidirectional or unidirectional causality is found in several subsamples. The duration of the periods with causality links varies from a few months to 3 years, whereas the duration for the noncausality periods might be 15 years long. By date stamping the causality links between oil and gold, our paper discovers that causality from oil to gold is related to large oil price changes, whereas causality from gold to oil is related to large financial crises. The evidence obtained in the paper points out the dangers of assuming a constant causality link between oil and gold markets because these links might break down unexpectedly. Our findings point out to the dangers of assuming noncausality between oil and gold particularly in hedging oil price risk using gold.
Q02|Spillover Dynamics Across Price Inflation and Selected Agricultural Commodity Prices|This article contributes to the existing empirical literature by examining the spillovers across price inflation and agricultural commodity prices in the case of Nigeria. To achieve this objective, we employ the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) spillover index. Subsequently, we examine the directional spillover, total spillover, and net spillover indexes. Further analysis to capture cyclical and secular movements were addressed with 40 months of subsamples via the rolling window analysis. Our empirical results, based on the monthly frequency data from January 2006 to July 2016 show that the total spillover effect was about 75%. This suggests a high interconnectedness of the selected agricultural commodity prices and inflation. Our study further reveal that inflation, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat were net receivers while cocoa, barley, groundnut, maize, rice were net givers. We find a negative net spillover for price inflation, implying a net positive spillover from commodity prices to price inflation These outcomes have inherent policy implications for the government administrators, farmers, investors and all stakeholders.
Q02|A General Equilibrium Model of Optimal Alcohol Taxation in the Czech Republic|This paper provides a general equilibrium theoretical model of alcohol taxation and empirically estimates the model. For this purpose, we use a model determined by both externality corrections and fiscal considerations as the tax increase is assumed to immediately change other governmental policies such as labour taxation or medical expenditures. The results of our analysis show that under most parametric scenarios, the current Czech tax rate on beer and wine is below its optimal level and that the fiscal component has a significant impact on the optimal level of tax.
Q02|Measurement of Volatility Spillovers and Asymmetric Connectedness on Commodity and Equity Markets|We study volatility spillovers among commodity and equity markets by employing a recently developed approach based on realized measures and forecast error variance decomposition invariant to the variable ordering from vector-autoregressions. This enables us to measure total, directional and net volatility spillovers as well as the asymmetry of responses to positive and negative shocks. We exploit high-frequency data on the prices of Crude oil, Corn, Cotton and Gold futures, and the S&P 500 Index and use a sample which spans from January 2002 to December 2015 to cover the entire period around the global financial crisis of 2008. Our empirical analysis reveals that on average, the volatility shocks related to other markets account for around one fifth of the volatility forecast error variance. We find that shocks to the stock markets play the most important role as the S&P 500 Index dominates all commodities in terms of general volatility spillover transmission. Our results further suggest that volatility spillovers across the analyzed assets were rather limited before the global financial crisis, which then boosted the connectedness between commodity and stock markets. Furthermore, the volatility due to positive and negative shocks is transmitted between markets at different magnitudes and the prevailing effect has varied. In the pre-crisis period, the positive spillovers dominated the negative ones, however, in several years following the crisis, the negative shocks have had a significantly higher impact on the volatility spillovers across the markets, pointing to an overall increase in uncertainty in the commodity and equity markets following a major crisis. In recent years, the asymmetric measures seem to have returned to their pre-crises directions and magnitudes.
Q02|On the link between oil and agricultural commodity prices: Do biofuels matter?|The aim of this paper is to investigate the long-term effect of the price of oil on agricultural commodity prices by accounting for the influence of biofuel production. Relying on the estimation of nonlinear, cointegrating regime-switching processes, we show that biofuel development has led to an increase in the oil-price effect on agricultural commodity prices: the growing production of biofuels is contributing to the price rise of agricultural commodities. This result underlines the importance of considering alternative biofuels which are not produced from agricultural commodities, and of analyzing the potential effects of the second-generation biofuels derived from agricultural plant residuals or non-food plants.

Q02|Multivariate dependence and spillover effects across energy commodities and diversification potentials of carbon assets|In a first step, we model the multivariate tail dependence structure and spillover effects across energy commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, ethanol, heating oil, coal and gasoline using canonical vine (C-vine) copula and c-vine conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR). In the second step, we formulate portfolio strategies based on different performance measures to analyze the risk reduction and diversification potential of carbon assets for energy commodities. We identify greater exposure to losses arising from investments in heating oil and ethanol markets. We also find evidence of carbon asset providing diversification benefits to energy commodity investments. These findings motivate for regulatory adjustments in the trading and emission permits for the energy markets most strongly diversified by carbon assets.
Q02|Can Smart Policies Reconcile Singapore's Green Economy with Sand Imports from Southeast Asia?|This article tries to increase public awareness of a crucial but rarely discussed global challenge by introducing a novel economic analysis: drawing on insights from various disciplines, it studies policies regulating sand extraction and trade. While sand is essential for construction and land reclamation worldwide, its extraction causes severe ecological damage in oceans, in rivers and on beaches and thus has high social costs. To derive solutions to this paramount global challenge, this article focuses on sand exports from developing countries in Southeast Asian to Singapore as a prominent example. It evaluates output, export and import taxes as the means to reduce sand extraction and trade. To this end, it utilizes an Eaton and Kortum type trade model within a general equilibrium framework. Overall, an output tax can reduce sand extraction to a large extent, while the economic costs are small for Singapore and slightly positive for the Southeast Asian sand exporters. As a novel policy, the sand tax can be implemented as a Sand Extraction Allowances Trading Scheme (SEATS). This policy can help sustainably balance Singapore's economic growth with Southeast Asia's economic development.
Q02|The Eﬀect of Income Shocks on the Oil Price|This paper identiﬁes the eﬀect of income shocks on the real price of oil. We ﬁnd that for the period 1973-2016 shocks to world GDP created a response of a permanent rise in the oil price. In contrast, oil production does not correct the disequilibrium from a stable long-run equilibrium. Whereas shocks to GDP are persistent, shocks to the oil price are mostly transitory once we control for changes in world GDP and oil production. We ﬁnd evidence of a structural change in the response of the oil price after 1973. We conjecture that the response of oil production is key to the diﬀerences.
Q02|Who Influences the Fundamental Value of Commodity Futures in Japan?|We present evidence on asymmetric information content in the trades of six investor groups transacting in the gold, platinum, gasoline and rubber futures markets on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Microstructure theory suggests that traders with greater information on the efficient price should be more profitable in the long run. Foreign investors have the greatest influence over the efficient price in the gold market, investment funds in the platinum market and retail investors in the gasoline market. Both trade and non-trade related innovations have an equal influence on the efficient price of rubber, with trades by investment funds having the largest information content in this market. We relate differences in the relative influence of investor groups to differences in market interconnectedness, the nature of the commodity and associated fundamental information.
Q02|Convergence of European natural gas prices|Over the period 2015-2050 the consumption of natural gas of European OECD countries is expected to grow more than the consumption of any other energy source. Although these countries are interconnected and in most cases share a common currency, their wholesale national gas markets are highly heterogeneous. We study the determinants of cross-country convergence of natural gas prices for industrial consumers in fourteen European countries. Our empirical analysis is based on the notions of pairwise, relative and convergence. We show that there is evidence of pairwise price convergence and that some key characteristics of gas markets, such as the maturity of trading hubs and the degree of interconnection, are positively associated with the existence of a convergence process. This result carries over to the notion of sigma-convergence and is robust to a number of changes in the implementation of the statistical tests. The analysis of relative convergence points to the existence of price-growth convergence, while price-level convergence is not supported by the data. Lastly, we assess the the short-run implications of price convergence focusing on the speed of reversion to equilibrium after a system-wide shocks hits the cointegrating relation.
Q02|The Evidence from California on the Economic Impact of Inefficient Distribution Network Pricing|Charging full requirements customers for distribution network services using the traditional cents per kilowatt-hour (KWh) price creates economic incentives for consumers to invest in distributed generation technologies, such as rooftop solar photovoltaics, despite the fact that marginal cost of grid-supplied electricity is lower. This paper first assesses the economic efficiency properties of this approach to transmission and distribution network pricing and whether current approach to distribution network pricing implies that full-requirement customers cross-subsidize distributed solar customers. Using data on quarterly residential distribution network prices and distributed solar installations from California’s three largest investor-owned utilities I find that larger amounts of distributed solar capacity and more geographically concentrated solar capacity predict higher distribution network prices and average distribution network costs. This result continues to hold even after controlling for average distribution network costs for the utility, Using these econometric model estimates, I find that 2/3 of the increase in residential distribution network prices for each of the three utilities between 2003 and 2016 can attributed to the growth distributed solar capacity. The paper then investigates the extent of the legal obligation that distributed solar generation customers have to pay for sunk costs of investments in the transmission and distribution networks. The paper closes with a description of an alternative approach to distribution network pricing that is likely to increase the economic signals for efficient electricity consumption and the incentive for cost effective installation of distributed solar generation capacity.
Q02|The impact of uncertainty shocks on the volatility of commodity prices|In this paper, we empirically examine the impact of uncertainty shocks on the volatility of commodity prices. Using several alternative measures of economic uncertainty for the U.S., we estimate their effects on commodity price volatility through VAR analysis. We find that the latent uncertainty shocks have the most significant impact on commodity price volatility when compared to observable measures of economic uncertainty. In specific, our results show that the unobservable economic uncertainty measures of Jurado et al. (2015) have a significant and long-lasting positive effect on the volatility of commodity prices. Our findings indicate that a positive shock in unobservable macroeconomic and financial uncertainty leads to a persistent increase in the volatility of the broad commodity market index and of individual commodity prices, with the macroeconomic effect being more significant. Finally, we show that the impact is stronger in energy commodities compared to agricultural and metals markets.
Q02|Climate Policy and Stranded Carbon Assets: a Financial Perspective|Unanticipated climate policy curbs the value of physical capital that is costly to adjust. We illustrate this by showing that climate policy to keep peak global warming below 2°C depresses the share prices of oil and gas majors and their market capitalisation, curbs exploration investment and oil and gas discoveries, boosts proven reserves left abandoned in the crust of the earth, cuts exploitation investment, and induces an earlier onset of the carbon-free era. For a given carbon budget, an immediate carbon tax is the first-best response but delaying the carbon tax or a renewable energy subsidy to meet the same temperature target are preferred by shareholders because they introduce Green Paradox effects and protect the profitability of existing capital.
Q02|The Superiority of Biased Reviewers in a Model of Simultaneous Sales|This paper considers the impact of reviewers on sales of products of quality unknown to consumers. Sales occur simultaneously after consideration by a reviewer with a known level of bias. Consumers observe the reviewer`s decision and a private signal. We find that: (a) with flexible prices and signals that are not too revealing the reviewer most biased against the product is best for profits; (b) with flexible prices and very revealing private signals the reviewer most biased in favour is optimal; (c) with fixed prices then a reviewer biased against, but close to unibased, is optimal.
Q02|On the Drivers of Global Grain Price Volatility : an empirical investigation|A vast number of studies examined the determinants of price volatility in agricultural markets. It is clear that the joint influence of several causes may generate market instability, but the partial contribution of different factors is still debated. We investigate how market-based drivers influence the global price volatility of three major grains: wheat, corn, barley. We adopt a Seemingly Unrelated Regression Equations model, in order to investigate potential common patterns and to control for the influence of external drivers. We compare inter-annual, intra-annual, and global volatility, to conclude on short-run and long-run dynamics of markets instability. We quantify the negative relationship linking (temporal) arbitrage and grain price volatility and conclude on the effects of supply movements on price volatility.
Q02|Investigating Properties of Commodity Price Responses to Real and Nominal Shocks|This paper studies dynamic adjustments of 49 world commodity prices in response to innovations in the nominal exchange rate and the world real GDP. After we estimate the dynamic elasticity of the prices with respect to these shocks, we obtain the kernel density of our estimates to establish stylized facts on the adjustment process of the commodity price toward a new equilibrium path. Our empirical findings imply, on average, that the law of one price holds in the long-run, whereas the substantial degree of short-run price rigidity was observed in response to the nominal exchange rate shock. The real GDP shock tends to generate substantial price fluctuations in the short-run because adjustments of the supply can be limited, but have much weaker effects in the long-run as the supply eventually counterbalances the increase in the demand. Overall, we report persistent long-lasting effects of the nominal exchange rate shock on commodity prices relative to those of the real GDP shock.
Q02|Economic impacts of El Niño southern oscillation: evidence from the Colombian coffee market|El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a naturally occurring phenomenon that affects weather around the world. Past ENSO episodes have had severe impacts on the economy of Colombia. We study the influence of ENSO on Colombian coffee production, exports, and price. Our structural econometric specification is consistent with an economic model of the market for Colombian coffee which, in the short run, is characterized by a downward‐sloping demand curve and by a vertical supply curve. We show that El Niño (i.e., positive shocks to ENSO) is beneficial for Colombian production and exports and decreases the real price of Colombian coffee. On the contrary, La Niña (i.e., negative shocks to ENSO) depresses Colombian coffee production and exports and increases price. However, the overall impact of ENSO shocks is small. Both in the short run and in the long run, shocks to international demand for Colombian coffee are more relevant than supply‐side shocks in Colombia in explaining the dynamics of the price of Colombian coffee. Our results suggest that a given coffee price shock can have beneficial, detrimental, or negligible effects on the Colombian economy, depending on its underlying cause. As a consequence, policy responses to coffee price shocks should be designed by looking at the causes of the shocks.
Q02|Les effets macroéconomiques de la chute des cours des produits de base: Evaluation sur la République démocratique du Congo<BR>[The Macroeconomic Effects of commodity bust: Assessment on Democratic Republic of the Congo]|This paper assesses the shock impact of commodity prices on the macroeconomic framework in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Using a Vector autoregressive (VAR) model, we determine the impulses of each macroeconomic sector to lower prices. The results indicate that this shock leads to complex effects that can lead to systemic risks and crises. We suggest that it would be important for governments, given such shocks, to learn from and take immediate action to strengthen the resilience of the economy and the financial system to future shocks in based.
Q02|Investor Sentiment and Crash Risk in Safe Havens|This study examines the relationship between investor sentiment and intraday return dynamics for safe haven assets, with a particular focus on crash risk in these assets. Examining intraday returns for a wide range of safe havens proposed in the literature, we find that shocks to investor sentiment have a significant effect on safest havens, while the sentiment is heterogeneous both in terms of its size and direction. While the strongest effects of sentiment shocks are observed in the case of Gold, Swiss Francs and Japanese Yen, interestingly, we find that oil stands out from the rest of the pack, responding negatively to sentiment shocks, suggesting that positive shocks to sentiment (i.e. high fear) increase crash risk for this asset. Our findings also point to intra-safe haven spillover effects, with oil exhibiting a markedly different pattern. Investment and hedging implications are discussed next.
Q02|Persistence in trends and cycles of gold and silver prices: Evidence from historical data|This study examines the persistence in gold and silver prices covering the historical periods of 1257 to 2016 and 1687 to 2016 respectively, by means of simultaneously estimating two differencing parameters for the long run trend and the cyclical behavior in a fractional integration framework. As opposed to many previous papers in the literature, once the cyclical differencing parameter is taken into account, mean reversion is detected in the long run trend of both gold and silver prices. The same result is obtained when structural breaks are taken into account. As far as the cyclical behavior of gold and silver prices is concerned, we find that cycles have a higher periodicity for gold (around 7 years) than for silver (4–5 years).
Q02|Oil Shocks and Volatility Jumps|In this paper, we analyse the role of oil price shocks, derived from expectations of consumers, economists, financial market, and policymakers, in predicting volatility jumps in the S&P500 over the monthly period of 1988:01 to 2015:02, with the jumps having been computed based on daily data over the same period. Standard linear Granger causality test fail to detect any evidence of oil shocks causing volatility jumps. But given strong evidence of nonlinearity and structural breaks between jumps and oil shocks, we next used a nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test, since the linear model is misspecified. Using this data-driven robust approach, we were able to detect overwhelming evidence of oil shocks predicting volatility jumps of the S&P500 over its entire conditional distribution, with the strongest effect observed at the lowest considered conditional quantile. Interestingly, the predictive ability of the four oil shocks on volatility jumps are found to be both qualitatively and quantitatively similar.
Q02|The Transmission of Exogenous Commodity and Oil Prices shocks to Latin America - A Panel VAR approach|During the last sixteen years, we have experienced an episode of commodity price boom and bust. Despite being exogenous to Latin America, commodity and oil price shocks are extremely relevant for explaining macroeconomic fluctuations. Thus, in this paper we assess the dynamic impact of these price fluctuations for relevant macroeconomic and financial variables for commodity exporting countries in the region (Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru) using a Bayesian Hierarchical Panel VAR with an exogenous block. This model is more flexible and less restrictive than a stylized DSGE model. We quantify the strong expansionary effect of these price shocks, and we discuss the connection with i) monetary and macro-prudential policy, ii) the financial sector and iii) the real economy. Furthermore, we observe some degree of heterogeneity across countries both in amplification and propagation patterns.
Q02|International Commodity Prices and Domestic Bank Lending in Developing Countries|We study the role of the bank-lending channel in propagating fluctuations in commodity prices to credit aggregates and economic activity in developing countries. We use data on more than 1,600 banks from 78 developing countries to analyze the transmission of changes in international commodity prices to domestic bank lending. Identification relies on a bankspecific time-varying measure of bank sensitivity to changes in commodity prices, based on daily data on bank stock prices. We find that a fall in commodity prices reduces bank lending, although this effect is confined to low-income countries and driven by commodity price busts. Banks with relatively lower deposits and poor asset quality transmit commodity price changes to lending more aggressively, supporting the hypothesis that the overall credit response to commodity prices works also through the credit supply channel. Our results also show that there is no significant difference in the behavior of foreign and domestic banks in the transmission process, reflecting the regional footprint of foreign banks in developing countries.
Q02|Too Much of a Good Thing? Speculative Effects on Commodity Futures Curves|The increasing inflow of institutional investors replicating broad based indices into commodity futures markets has been linked to excessive calendar spreads and anomalies in futures curves. At the same time, these investors have been welcomed as liquidity providers. This paper hypothesises that this apparent dissent can be reconciled by considering the relative size of index positions to hedging positions, rather than the presence of index traders alone. The hypothesis is tested empirically for three soft commodity markets: cocoa, coffee, and cotton. By use of factor decomposition, the paper shows empirically that (a) index and hedging positions have inverse and offsetting effects on futures curves, and (b) index positions, net of hedging positions, are associated with upward sloping and peaked futures curves and occasionally wave-like shapes linked to roll-effects. The paper concludes that index traders are welcomed liquidity providers but can become Ã«too much of a good thingÃ­ if exceeding hedgers' demand for counterparty.
Q02|Price discovery in commodity futures and cash markets with heterogeneous agents|Since 2004, commodity futures markets have seen an unprecedented liquidity inflow linked to noise traders that follow global liquidity cycles rather than market fundamentals. This paper develops a price discovery model for commodity futures markets that incorporates noise trader effects by assuming two forms of limits to arbitrage: transaction costs and noise trader risk. It is shown that under these assumptions, commodity prices are driven by both market fundamentals and noise trader positions. Further, noise trader effects spill over to the cash market if limits to arbitrage due to transaction costs are imperfect but are confined to the futures market otherwise. The model is empirically tested using data from six grain and soft commodity markets.
Q02|Modeling and forecasting commodity market volatility with long-term economic and financial variables|This paper investigates the time-varying volatility patterns of some major commodities as well as the potential factors that drive their long-term volatility component. For this purpose, we make use of a recently proposed GARCH-MIDAS approach which typically allows us to examine the role of economic and financial variables of different frequencies. Using commodity futures for crude oil (WTI and Brent), gold, silver and platinum, our results show the necessity of disentangling the short- and long-term components in modeling and forecasting commodity volatility. They also indicate that the long-term volatility of most commodity futures is significantly driven by the level of the general real economic activity as well as the changes in consumer sentiment, industrial production, and economic policy uncertainty. However, the forecasting results are not alike across commodity futures as no single model fits all commodities.
Q02|Risk premia and seasonality in commodity futures|We develop and estimate a multifactor affine model of commodity futures that allows for stochastic seasonality. We document the existence of stochastic seasonal fluctuations in commodity futures and that properly accounting for the cost‐of‐carry curve requires at least three factors. We estimate the model using data on heating oil futures and analyze the contribution of the factors to risk premia. Correctly specifying seasonality as stochastic is important to avoid erroneously assigning those fluctuations to other risk factors. We also estimate a nonlinear version of the model that imposes the zero lower bound on interest rates and find similar results.
Q02|Opportunities and Barriers to Growing Michigan’s Local Food System: The Case of Meat Processing| This paper details some of the challenges that occur within and between the three tiers of the Michigan meat value chain; at the producer, processor and regulatory level and how they impact meat offerings in local food channels. Considerations for all three tiers include price points and volume, labor issues and reported inconsistencies by those that enforce regulation within the state system of regulations and federal regulations.
Q02|A Dynamic Factor Model for Commodity Prices|In this note, we present the Commodities Factor Model (CFM), a dynamic factor model for a large cross-section of energy and non-energy commodity prices. The model decomposes price changes in commodities into a common “global” component, a “block” component confined to subgroups of economically related commodities and an idiosyncratic price shock component. Unlike with ordinary factor models, these components have meaningful economic interpretations: the global component mostly relates to global commodity demand shocks, while the idiosyncratic component mostly relates to commodity-specific supply shocks. We give several examples to show that the CFM provides plausible historical decompositions.
Q02|Volatility risk premia and future commodity returns|This paper extends the empirical literature on volatility risk premium (VRP) and future returns by analyzing the predictive ability of commodity currency VRP and commodity VRP. The empirical evidence throughout this paper provides support for a positive relationship of commodity currencies VRP and future commodity returns, but only for the period after the 2008 global financial crisis. This predictability survives the inclusion of control variables like equity VRP and past currency returns. Furthermore, gold VRP also has the ability to predict future commodity returns. However, this predictability is restricted to precious metals when control variables are considered.
Q02|TFP Growth and Commodity Prices in Emerging Economies| In this article we aim at empirically testing cross-country impacts of commodity prices shocks to aggregate Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth for a sample of emerging economies. Under a growth accounting framework, we estimate country-specific TFP growth (1992–2014) and select their robust determinants by means of a Bayesian Model Averaging approach. To identify the effects of structural shocks, we propose a panel Bayesian VAR and compute cyclically-adjusted TFP growth net of demand shocks (i.e., output gap) and commodity prices. Our results suggest that: (i) the relationship of commodity prices and TFP growth has been very high in small commodity-exporting economies (i.e., an increase of 10% commodity prices is associated with a sizable expansion of TFP growth in a year for an average commodity exporter); (ii) albeit our evidence is not sufficient to empirically distinguish among theoretical explanations, our results favor an interpretation that weights short-term effects of commodity prices on productivity, either through transitional dynamics to the manufacturing sector or through mismeasurement of TFP; and (iii) cyclically adjusted TFP growth highlights the importance of negative supply shocks in commodity-exporting countries. All in all, much of the increase in TFP growth in the last decade was related to a favorable cyclical environment, a result that may raise significant policy implications for commodity-dependent economies.
Q02|Price Discovery in Some Primary Commodity Markets in India|With the onset of wide-ranging economic reforms in India in 1991, agents have been exposed to increased price risk in commodity markets. Futures markets are one important instrument for reducing price risk, and in this study we focus on the price discovery role of futures markets. Employing daily price data for nine crops for the period 2009-2014, we find strong causation running from futures to spot prices. Since spot prices impinge on the storage and cropping pattern decisions of farmers, our results imply that providing information on futures price to farmers on a daily basis would enable them to take more efficient decisions in the present.
Q02|Local Food Prices and International Price Transmission|World food prices spiked in the periods 2007–8 and 2010–11. The impact of these spikes in world food prices on local food prices and thus on local consumers is determined by the food price pass through. Pass through is defined as the extent to which changes in world food prices lead to changes in local food prices. We examine the determinants of variation in food price pass through from global to local consumer prices in a global sample of 147 countries, using FAO data on world food prices and ILO data on food prices for consumers. While market integration matters, our study finds that income per capita is the dominant factor explaining cross-country variation in pass through of food prices. We estimate an elasticity of about −0.3 of pass through with respect to income per capita. This means far greater price transmission of food price shocks at the commodity level to final consumers in low-income countries than in high-income countries. The implication is that future swings in world food prices will in particular jeopardize food security in poor countries. Trade policy measures of market integration also affect the pass through significantly, whereas infrastructure and geography measures play no significant role.
Q02|¿Es el mercado de metales eficiente?|The prediction of raw material prices is important due to its macroeconomic impact in the nations that depend on their international trade, it is as well financially important to those who negotiate futures in the stock market. This work proposes to evaluate the efficiency hypothesis in the weak sense of the metals market, which argues that an efficient market is not susceptible to price prediction. To carry out this purpose, methods of random walks were put into effect. Persistently inefficient raw materials during the evaluation period from 1992 to 2015 were found, as well as that some raw materials fluctuate between periods of efficiency and inefficiency.
Q02|Identifying Speculative Demand Shocks in Commodity Futures Markets through Changes in Volatility|This paper studies the effects of financial speculation on commodity futures returns, using publicly available data from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, aggregated by trader groups. We exploit the heteroskedasticity in the weekly data to identify exogenous variation in speculators’ positions. The results suggest that idiosyncratic net long demand shocks of both index investors and hedge funds increase futures returns. They further indicate that these shocks are a relevant driver of returns, especially during periods of high speculative demand volatility. These findings confirm significant price effects of financial investments, complementing existing evidence based on disaggregated and proprietary daily data.
Q02|Lâ€™impact des biocarburants sur les prix des matiÃ¨res premiÃ¨res agricoles|La rÃ©cente expansion des biocarburants soulÃ¨ve des interrogations quant Ã lâ€™Ã©mergence dâ€™une nouvelle relation entre les marchÃ©s agricoles et Ã©nergÃ©tiques. Dans ce contexte, nous analysons lâ€™influence du dÃ©veloppement des biocarburants sur les prix des matiÃ¨res premiÃ¨res agricoles (maÃ¯s, soja et blÃ©) en recourant aux techniques de cointÃ©gration afin dâ€™Ã©valuer, dans un premier temps, les liens de long terme entre les prix des biens agricoles, du pÃ©trole et de lâ€™Ã©thanol. Dans un second temps, nous analysons les dynamiques de court terme, en tenant compte de lâ€™existence potentielle de ruptures sur la pÃ©riode Ã©tudiÃ©e (1997-2017). Nos rÃ©sultats montrent que les effets liÃ©s au dÃ©veloppement des biocarburants divergent en fonction de la matiÃ¨re agricole Ã©tudiÃ©e. Pour le maÃ¯s (composant principal de lâ€™Ã©thanol), lâ€™expansion de lâ€™Ã©thanol amÃ©ricain nâ€™a pas contribuÃ© Ã la hausse de son prix. Pour le soja, les liens entre son marchÃ© et les marchÃ©s Ã©nergÃ©tiques (prix du pÃ©trole et de lâ€™Ã©thanol) sont plus importants. Lâ€™essor de la production du biodiÃ©sel a, en effet, contribuÃ© Ã la hausse de son prix. Enfin, pour le blÃ©, Ã long terme, son prix dÃ©pend du prix du pÃ©trole et de lâ€™Ã©thanol. Le dÃ©veloppement des biocarburants impacte le prix du blÃ© via un effet de substitution et via un impact sur les coÃ»ts des facteurs de production agricole. Cependant, Ã court terme, seules les variations du prix du pÃ©trole tendent Ã impacter celles du prix du blÃ©, via les effets sur les coÃ»ts de production
Q02|Political Uncertainty and Commodity Prices|Using a comprehensive sample of 87 commodities, we examine the effect of political uncertainty on commodity prices. We show that political uncertainty surrounding U.S. presidential elections has a significant negative impact on commodity prices worldwide, likely due to shrinking demand before the elections. On average, commodity prices decline by 6.4% in the quarter leading up to U.S. elections. This effect holds true for gold, and is stronger for close elections and elections during recessions. On the other hand, political uncertainty in commodity producing countries with little demand pushes commodity prices up by 5.4% in the quarter before their national elections.
Q02|Can Gold Investments Provide a Good Hedge Against Inflation? An Empirical Analysis|It is widely accepted that inflation erodes purchasing power of retirement savings, redistributes wealth from lenders to borrowers, and threatens private investors’ long-term objectives. Thus, there is a high demand on diversifying investors portfolio for both individuals and institutions in order to hedge against inflation. This paper aims to examine the effectiveness of gold investments to hedge against consumer inflation risks in the United States (US). Using monthly data from April, 1986 to June, 2016, that covers more than 30 years, unit root testing approach robust for finite samples, the Johansen multivariate cointegration test procedure and vector error correction model have been employed to examine the long-run relationship between gold return and consumer inflation in the US. The key finding suggests that gold investments in the US provide an effective hedge against inflation for investors who are willing to keep their investments for long-run. However, it does not provide any hedge if investors hold it for only short-term.
Q02|On the behavior of commodity prices when speculative storage is bounded|This paper investigates the implications of bounded speculative storage, storage bounded from below at zero and above at a capacity, on commodity prices. Binding capacity mirrors the non-negativity constraint on storage and leads to negative price spiking and higher volatility when the market is in deep contango, i.e. low current prices at high stock levels. With bounded storage there is no need to restrict storage to be costly to ensure a rational expectations equilibrium. This allows the model to cover a wide range of storage technologies, including free and productive storage. We also provide an alternative expression for speculative prices that highlights the key role of the storage boundaries. The competitive equilibrium price is the sum of discounted future probability weighted boundary prices. The boundary prices can be viewed as dividends on commodities in storage reflecting the realization of economic profits from storage.
Q02|A panel stationarity test with gradual structural shifts: Re-investigate the international commodity price shocks|This paper proposes a simple panel stationarity test which takes into account structural shifts and cross-section dependency. Structural shifts are modelled as gradual/smooth process with a Fourier approximation. The so-called Fourier panel stationarity test has a standard normal distribution. The Monte Carlo simulations indicate that (i) if the error terms are i.i.d, the test shows good size and power properties even in small samples; and (ii) if the error terms are serially correlated, the test has reasonable size and high power. We re-examine the behavior of the international commodity prices and find out an evidence on the persistence of shocks.
Q02|On the hedge and safe haven properties of Bitcoin: Is it really more than a diversifier?|This paper uses a dynamic conditional correlation model to examine whether Bitcoin can act as a hedge and safe haven for major world stock indices, bonds, oil, gold, the general commodity index and the US dollar index. Daily and weekly data span from July 2011 to December 2015. Overall, the empirical results indicate that Bitcoin is a poor hedge and is suitable for diversification purposes only. However, Bitcoin can only serve as a strong safe haven against weekly extreme down movements in Asian stocks. We also show that Bitcoin hedging and safe haven properties vary between horizons.
Q02|Range-based and GARCH volatility estimation: Evidence from the French asset market|This paper aims to measure and compare French stock and bond market volatilities using various range-based volatility estimators and conditional heteroskedasticity models. Particularly, we measure volatility for stock returns related to five major companies operating in different sectors and four French bonds with different maturity dates and different reference indices.
Q02|A historical perspective of the informational content of commodity futures|This article extends Chinn and Coibion (2014)'s work--Journal of Futures Markets 34-- on predictive content of commodity futures by considering a more comprehensive database and a longer time span, ranging from 25 to 65 years, and by presenting two extensions: multi-equation estimation of risk premiums and testing for the theory of storage.
Q02|The effect of investor sentiment on gold market return dynamics: Evidence from a nonparametric causality-in-quantiles approach|This paper explores the effect of investor sentiment on the intraday return dynamics in the gold market. We build on the recent evidence by Da et al. (2015) that the Financial and Economic Attitudes Revealed by Search (FEARS) index, as a proxy for investor sentiment, has predictive power over stock market returns and extend the analysis to gold intraday returns using a novel methodology developed by Balcilar et al. (2016) to examine nonlinear casual effects of sentiment on gold return and volatility. We find that the effect of investor sentiment is more prevalent on intraday volatility in the gold market, rather than daily returns. The sentiment effect, however, is channeled via the discontinuous (jump) component of intraday volatility, particularly at extreme quantiles, implying that extreme fear (confidence) contributes to positive (negative) volatility jumps in gold returns. The results suggest that measures of sentiment could be utilized to model volatility jumps in safe haven assets that are often hard to predict and have significant implications for risk management as well as the pricing of options.
Q02|Investigating the leverage effect in commodity markets with a recursive estimation approach|This paper investigates the presence of the leverage effect in commodities, in comparison with financial markets. The EGARCH model with a Mixture of Normals distribution (EGARCH-MN) is used to capture (i) heavy tails and skewness in the conditional returns, and (ii) leverage effects and time-varying long-term component in the volatility specification. Besides, the estimation strategy relies on an innovative recursive (REC) method, which allows disentangling the leverage effect from the unconditional skewness as an empirical result. When applied to a broadly diversified dataset of assets during 1995–2012, the EGARCH-MN models offers state-of-the-art specifications with leverage and fat-tailed skewed densities, that allow to contrast the specific characteristics of commodities with traditional assets (equities, bonds, FX).
Q02|Does Inflation Cause Gold Prices? Evidence from G7 Countries|This paper utilises the newly proposed nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test to examine the predictability of returns and the volatility of gold based on inflation for G7 countries. The causality-in-quantiles approach permits us to test for not only causality in mean but also causality in variance. We start our investigation by utilising tests for nonlinearity. These tests identify nonlinearity, as the linear Granger causality tests are subject to misspecification error. Unlike tests of misspecified linear models, our nonparametric causality-in-quantiles tests find causality in mean and variance from inflation to gold returns via quantiles 0.20 to 0.70, implying that very low- and high-return movements in gold markets are not related to inflation. These changes in low- and high-level gold returns should be related to other sources, such as financial shocks and exchange market shocks. We find support that gold serves as a hedge against inflation, but only in the mid-quantile ranges, i.e., quantiles 0.20 to 0.70. Our results show that gold does not serve as a hedge against inflation during periods when gold returns are very low or very high, which are respectively quiet and highly volatile periods.
Q02|The Long road to transformation of agricultural markets in India: Lessons from Karnataka|This paper examines Karnataka's pioneering agricultural output marketing reforms with the twin goals of assessing the state and challenges of implementation and to glean lessons from Karnataka's experience for India's e-National Agricultural Market (e-NAM). Through a field study of ten mandis across the state, we find that while Karnataka has been consistently pushing through with reforms, in the context of deeply entrenched relationships between farmers, traders and com- mission agents, the challenges of deeper reforms are significant. We argue that Karnataka's experience suggests that agricultural market reform in India rests on three pillars - institutions that establish the rules of the game, incentives for agents to participate actively in the market and infrastructure to support the modernised trading platform. Unless reforms address all these three issues simultaneously, they are unlikely to succeed.
Q02|Impact of India's demonetization on domestic agricultural markets|In this paper we estimate the impact on domestic trade in agricultural commodities of India's demonetization exercise that invalidated 86 of the currency in circulation. Using data on arrivals and prices from close to 3000 regulated markets in India for 35 major agricultural commodities for the period 2011-2017, we focus on short term effects up to 3 months after demonetization, tracking both the impact and recovery. These 35 commodities account for an overwhelming share of land under cultivation and value of production and hence are representative of Indian agriculture in more than one sense. Using earlier years as comparison years, we use a combination of difference in differences techniques and synthetic control methods to identify the causal impact of demonetization. We find that demonetization has displaced domestic agricultural trade in regulated markets by over 15 in the short run settling at 7 after recovery at the end of the 90 day period after demonetization. Trade in perishables was displaced to the extent of 23 in the week following demonetization. It recovered slightly by the end of 90 days, but was still 18 lower than the usual. Most of this decline is on account of the significant decline in prices rather than of arrivals, which appear to have recovered over a period of three months. There are significant differences across commodities but almost all of these are in expected ways. The impacts are sharpest for kharif crops where government intervention is minimal or absent and for perishables and least for crops where farmers are well organized or commodities which governments actively procure. Robustness checks and falsification tests support our findings to a large extent. Overall, it seems to be the case that the monetary contraction embodied in demonetization significantly impacted arrivals and prices, though the price impacts are perhaps more lasting. The findings from this analysis and anecdotal evidence from field visits suggest that the impacts of demonetization potentially have effects that could last beyond the immediate impact.
Q02|Intraday seasonality in efficiency, liquidity, volatility and volume: Platinum and gold futures in Tokyo and New York|We investigate intraday seasonality in, and relationships between, informational efficiency, volatility, volume and liquidity. Platinum and gold, both traded in overlapping sessions in Tokyo and New York, provide an interesting comparison because Tokyo is an internationally important trading venue for platinum but not for gold. Our analysis indicates that both platinum and gold markets in Tokyo are dominated by uninformed trading, while there is evidence supporting both uninformed and informed trading in New York. Separating global trading hours into Tokyo, London and New York day sessions, we also find that uninformed trading is more prevalent during the Tokyo day session while informed trading dominates the New York day session for both metals in both locations. This evidence suggests that futures markets for the same underlying commodity on different exchanges have different microstructure characteristics, while both informed and uninformed traders choose when to trade depending on market characteristics in different time zones.
Q02|Does the volatility of commodity prices reflect macroeconomic uncertainty?|While there exists numerous studies on the macroeconomic effects of oil and commodity shocks, the literature is quite silent on the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty on oil and commodity prices and, especially, on their volatility. This paper tackles this issue through the estimation of a structural threshold vector autoregressive (TVAR) model on a sample of 19 commodity markets. We aim at (i) assessing whether the effect of macroeconomic uncertainty shocks on commodity price returns depends on the degree of uncertainty, and (ii) investigating the transfer from macroeconomic uncertainty to price uncertainty using a newly developed measure of commodity price uncertainty. Our findings show that both agricultural and industrial markets are highly sensitive to the variability and the level of macroeconomic uncertainty, while the impact on precious metals is more parsimonious given their well-identified safe-haven role in time of economic turmoil. In addition, we find evidence that the recent 2007–09 recession has generated an unprecedented episode of high uncertainty in numerous commodity prices. Interestingly, our analysis further reveals that volatility and uncertainty in prices can be disconnected. This is especially true for the oil market as most important shocks in the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s that lead to price volatility do not generate price uncertainty, highlighting the relevance of our uncertainty measure in linking uncertainty to predictability rather than to volatility.
Q02|Jumps in Commodity Markets|This paper investigates price jumps in commodity markets. We find that jumps are rare and extreme events but occur less frequently than in stock markets. Nonetheless, jump correlations across commodities can be high depending on the commodity sectors. Energy, metal and grains commodities show high jump correlations while jumps of meats and softs commodities are barely correlated. Looking at crossmarket correlations, we find that returns of commodities co-move with the stock market, while jumps can be diversified. Most commodities are strong hedges for U.S. Dollar returns but weak hedges for U.S. Dollar jumps. Most commodities act as both return and jump hedges for Treasury notes.
Q02|The Risk Premium of Gold|This paper examines the properties of the gold risk premium. We estimate a parsimonious model for the gold risk premium and uncover important time variations in the dynamics of the risk premium. We also estimate risk premia of the stock and bond markets, and investigate the role of gold as a hedge and safe haven asset from an ex-ante point of view. The results show that gold is not expected to serve as hedge and safe haven for the bond and stock markets, but it is so realized ex-post. Further, we find that gold is neither expected to be an inflation hedge nor is it realized.
Q02|Kicking a Crude Habit: Diversifying Away from Oil and Gas in the 21st Century|This paper investigates the correlates of diversification away from oil and natural gas dependence in the context of the 21st century resource boom (and bust). In a sample of 40 oil- and gas-dependent economies, the majority showed significant sectoral diversification of GDP, but exports remained highly concentrated in fuel exports. Regression analysis indicates that countries that began the boom with higher levels of oil and gas dependence, poorer countries, and those with significantly larger- or smaller-than-average populations were more successful in diversifying their GDP during the commodities boom. Governance clearly matters--more effective, capable bureaucratic structures are associated with greater GDP diversification away from oil and gas--though the effects are not uniformly positive. For any given level of government effectiveness, stronger rule of law is associated with less GDP diversification. Education appears to affect GDP and export diversification differentially. Consistent with endogenous growth theory, countries with more educated populations saw greater growth in their nonresource sectors than countries with less educated populations, though education is associated with greater export concentration. Market proximity does not affect diversification. Internal economic diversification in the 21st century has been less a matter of correct policy formation and implementation and more a matter of factors that shape the policymaking environment, with the findings suggesting a difficult road to economic diversification for the Gulf Cooperation Council economies.
Q02|Impact of India's Demonetization on Domestic Agricultural Markets|This paper estimates the impact on domestic trade in agricultural commodities of India's demonetization exercise that invalidated 86% of the currency in circulation. Using data on arrivals and prices from close to 3000 regulated markets in India for 35 major agricultural commodities for the period 2011-2017, the focus is on short term effects up to 3 months after demonetization, tracking both the impact and recovery. These 35 commodities account for an overwhelming share of land under cultivation and value of production and hence are representative of Indian agriculture in more than one sense. Using earlier years as comparison years, the paper uses a combination of difference in differences techniques and synthetic control methods to identify the causal impact of demonetization.
Q02|Food vs. Fuel? Impacts of Petroleum Shipments on Agricultural Prices|Grain shippers and political figures in North Dakota and nearby states have voiced concern that the dramatic increases in shipments of crude oil by rail have caused service delays and higher costs. We investigate the potential impact of crude shipments on grain markets accounting for harvest effects and other potential sources of rail congestion. Increased crude oil shipments are associated with substantially larger spreads between wheat prices at regional elevators and in Minneapolis, the market hub. The effect on corn and soybean spreads are an order of magnitude smaller. Increased oil traffic is associated with small increases in rail rates but large increases in rail car auction prices. We document increases in wheat carry (storage) costs and decreases in shipment quantities. Surprisingly, little of the spread increase is due to lower prices paid to farmers, suggesting consumers rather than producers paid the cost of increased rail congestion.
Q02|Do announcements of WTO dispute resolution cases matter? Evidence from the rare earth elements market|Rare earth elements (REEs) have gained increasing attention recently for several key reasons: 1) they are vital to many strategic industries, 2) they are relatively scarce, 3) they frequently exhibit high price fluctuations, 4) China holds a quasi-monopoly on their mining, and 5) China's REE policy, which was overly restrictive and led to a formal complaint from the U.S., Japan, and the EU at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2012. This paper investigates whether the announcement of a WTO dispute resolution case has the power to fundamentally change market dynamics. We find empirical support for this notion because REE prices exhibit a structural break around the announcement of the WTO dispute, and show lower variance ratios for all tested REEs afterward. This indicates a tendency toward efficiency, although REE prices still do not follow a random walk. Similarly, we find that stock price informativeness of companies in the REE industry increases after the announcement, reflecting more firm-specific than marketwide information and less governmental influence. Finally, we show that model uncertainty for option pricing models decreases, which we measure by the lower pricing differences among them.
Q02|Quantifying the impact of Ramadan on global raw sugar prices|Each year during the month of Ramadan (Muslim fasting month) consumption of sugar increased dramatically across the globe as Muslims traditionally break their fast with some sweet drinks or products. Since Muslims use lunar calendar, the months are not fully aligned with the Gregorian calendar or with the seasonal calendar for agricultural crops. In this paper, we quantify the impact of Ramadan on both the price and its growth of global raw sugar price. To set the stage for the empirical work that follows, we employ a dummy and a fractional variable to capture Ramadan in order to overcome the asynchronicity of time between Ramadan fasting (which is based on Islamic lunar calendar) and movement in prices (which follows the Gregorian solar calendar). In order to capture seasonality of production in sugar production, data on sugar price spans over thirty-four years so that the Islamic calendar makes a complete cycle of the Gregorian calendar. Using ARIMA and UCM models, we find strong evidence that monthly raw sugar prices in the global market increases by roughly 6.06% (or $17.78 per metric ton) every year ahead of Ramadan.
Q02|Trends of Pulses Production, Consumption and Import in India: Current Scenario and Strategies|Though India is the largest producer (around 25% of global production), it however, consumes 27% and imports around 14% of its pulses requirements. The yield of pulses in India is quite low at 781 kg/ha which might be due to policy neglect. The post green revolution era saw a sharp decline in per capita production and availability of pulses with record 4.0 million tones imports of pulses in 2012-13. Bihar is one of the important pulse growing state of India with productivity of 839.3 Kg/ha in 2010-11 which is projected to attain 1461.3 kg/ha by 2050-51, highest in eastern India. With nearly 2.2 million ha of rice fallows, a small technological intervention can transform the rice- fallow to rice-gram or rice-lentil system bringing about pulse revolution. Need is to diversify from cereal–based cropping systems to pulses-based cropping system with certain policy decision like identification of additional rice fallow lands largely in Eastern India, crop diversification, improving seed replacement rate, improved crop production techniques etc. Provisions should be made for easy credit, insurance, attractive Minimum Support Price (MSP) with procurement and appropriate incentives for pulse producers as well as creating necessary infrastructure for processing, marketing and value-addition. This paper analyses status of pulse crop in India as whole and Bihar in particular along with paradigm shift required in policy decision, pulse research, technology generation and dissemination, commercialization along with capacity building of farmers and frontier areas of research and extension.
Q02|Identifying price bubble periods in the energy sector|In this paper we test for the existence of single and multiple episodes of explosive behavior in three energy sector indices (crude oil, heating oil, and natural gas) and five energy sector spot prices (West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent, heating oil, natural gas, and jet fuel). The results from the Supremum Augmented Dickey-Fuller (SADF) and the Generalized SADF tests provide strong statistical evidence of explosive behavior in all of our energy series. A simple theoretical framework of commodity pricing allows us to understand the assumptions to interpret explosive behavior as bubbles. By constructing implied convenience yields using futures prices we test the key assumption and we are able to identify the beginning and the end of bubble periods for the WTI, Brent, heating oil, and natural gas spot prices.
Q02|Hedging under square loss|The framework of minimum-variance hedging rests on a highly restrictive foundation. The objective of variance minimization is only justifiable when variance coincides with expected squared forecast error. Nevertheless, the classical framework is routinely applied when the condition fails, giving rise to inaccurate risk assessments and suboptimal hedging decisions. This study proposes a new, improved framework of hedging which relaxes the above condition at no tangible cost. It derives a new objective function, an optimal hedge ratio, and a measure of hedging effectiveness under square loss. Their superior performance is demonstrated from a theoretical standpoint and by applying them to hedging the price risk of oil and natural gas. Simple yet general, the new framework is well suited to replace the classical one and facilitates adequate risk measurement and improved hedging decisions. It also provides fundamental insight into dealing with uncertainty under square loss and beyond.
Q02|The Evolution of Inefficiency in USDA’s Forecasts of U.S. and World Soybean Markets|We derive a set of stylized facts about USDA’s soybean supply and demand forecasts and draw implications from these results for efforts to improve the accuracy of these forecasts. USDA’s short run soybean supply and demand forecasts are inefficient, with several key variables significantly biased throughout much of the annual forecast cycle. Bias and other characteristics have varied significantly over recent decades, and evaluation efforts intended to guide forecast improvement need to focus on very recent sample years and seasonally disaggregated data. USDA should expand the information set used in its forecasting of U.S. soybean yields, take note of its mid-season downward bias in its Brazilian production forecasts, and shift the weight of its early-season focus for China’s soybean consumption estimates towards forecasts of growth rates and reduce the weight it applies to forecasting consumption and trade by China in terms of levels. During 2004-2015, downward-biased U.S. production forecasts and upward-biased foreign excess supply forecasts resulted in downward-biased U.S. export forecasts throughout much of USDA’s annual forecasting cycle. Twenty years earlier, this downward bias was confined to the end of the forecasting cycle, whereas U.S. soybean ending stock forecasts have been upward biased for decades across much of the forecasting cycle. The forecasts for U.S. soybean exports are also characterized by smoothing, with strong correlation between month-to-month forecast revisions towards the later months of USDA’s annual forecasting cycle.
Q02|Is Wine a Safe-Haven? Evidence from a Nonparametric Causality-in-Quantiles Test|Unlike the extant literature on safe-havens, where one aims to relate the movements in an asset considered with extreme episodes in equity markets, we test this property for fine wine by relating it to global uncertainty. Using a nonparametric k-th order causality-in-quantiles test, we show that, while uncertainty does affect returns and/or variance of the alternative wine indices considered, this effect is restricted to only certain parts of the conditional distribution. In particular, wine seems to be unaffected by global uncertainty, and hence, acts as a safe-haven at extreme ends of the market, i.e., during bear or bullish times; but not during normal times (around the median of the conditional distribution of returns and/or volatility).
Q02|The role of economic and financial uncertainties in predicting commodity futures returns and volatility: Evidence from a nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test|We analyze the ability of economic and financial uncertainties in predicting movements in commodity futures markets. Using daily data over the period of 8th May, 1992 to 31st August, 2016 on 21 commodity futures covering agriculture, energy, metals and livestock, we find that: (a) Linear predictive tests provide virtually no evidence of predictability; (b) Linear models are misspecified due to nonlinearity and hence, results from the framework cannot be relied upon, and; (c) Using a k-th order nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test, which is robust to misspecification in the presence of nonlinearities, we find evidence that measures of uncertainty can predict returns and/or volatility of as many as 20 of the commodities considered at least at one point of their respective conditional distributions for returns and variance. In general, we highlight the importance of modeling nonlinearity, higher order moments, and quantiles of returns and volatility when carrying out predictability analysis involving commodity futures and uncertainty.
Q02|Does gold act as a hedge against inflation in the UK? Evidence from a fractional cointegration approach over 1257 to 2016|This paper examines the inflation hedging ability of gold in the UK based on a fractional integration and cointegration framework. This gives more flexibility as it does not restrict the order of integration between zero and 1. Annual time series data covering 1257–2016 were used. We conducted both full sample and sub-sample analysis. Using the full sample, the findings shows that gold and retail price index (RPI) are both I(1). However, based on the sub-sample analyses, gold is I(1) for most sub-periods while RPI is mean reverting (d < 1) for most periods. However, both series exhibit the same degree of integration, I(1), during the last sub-sample, specifically between 1903 and 2016. We also find the existence of cointegration between gold and RPI but this is exclusively due to the data from the last century. It is therefore concluded that gold provides protection against inflation since its value would be maintained in the presence of inflation.
Q02|Testing for asymmetric nonlinear short- and long-run relationships between bitcoin, aggregate commodity and gold prices|Unlike prior studies, this study examines the nonlinear, asymmetric and quantile effects of aggregate commodity index and gold prices on the price of Bitcoin. Using daily data from July 17, 2010 to February 2, 2017, we employed several advanced autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models. The nonlinear ARDL approach was applied to uncover short- and long-run asymmetries, whereas the quantile ARDL was applied to account for a second type of asymmetry, known as the distributional asymmetry according to the position of a dependent variable within its own distribution. Moreover, we extended the nonlinear ARDL to a quantile framework, leading to a richer new model, which allows testing for distributional asymmetry while accounting for short- and long-run asymmetries. Overall, our results indicate the possibility to predict Bitcoin price movements based on price information from the aggregate commodity index and gold prices. Importantly, we report the nuanced result that most often the relations between bitcoin and aggregate commodity, on the one hand, and between bitcoin and gold, on the other, are asymmetric, nonlinear, and quantiles-dependent, suggesting the need to apply non-standard cointegration models to uncover the complexity and hidden relations between Bitcoin and asset classes.
Q02|Financialisation and the Term Structure of Commodity Risk Premiums|Commodities, such as oil and wheat, are important inputs into the real economy. They have a significant influence on the welfare of individuals through their role as consumption goods and as inputs into other goods. As such, it is important to understand how commodity prices are set and whether there are any distortions to these prices. One component of commodity futures prices is the risk premium, which reflects the return investors demand to take on producers' and consumers' natural exposures to commodity prices. Therefore, to better understand the determination of commodity futures prices this paper examines commodity risk premiums and their determinants. We find evidence that commodity risk premiums vary across futures contract maturities, and that the shape of the commodity risk premium 'curve' differs across commodities and over time. This suggests information could be contained in the shape of the risk premium curve. We also find strong evidence of a relationship between the net of producers' (short) and consumers' (long) hedging positions – the net hedging position – and risk premiums, as would be suggested by the net hedging pressure theory. The evidence is generally more significant for longer-dated futures contracts. In addition, we consider whether the large increase in the size of commodity-related financial markets over the 2000s – commodity market financialisation – has affected commodity risk premiums. We find little statistical evidence that financialisation has had a significant effect on the 'residual' or idiosyncratic portion of commodity risk premiums for a broad basket of commodities. But we do find some evidence of smaller residual risk premiums for wheat, particularly for short-maturity contracts. This could reflect either decreased market segmentation or a secular increase in demand for long positions. We also find evidence that financialisation increased the systematic portion of commodity risk premiums by increasing the correlation between returns on commodity futures and returns on the 'market' portfolio. This was more evident for longer-maturity contracts of 6–18 months.
Q02|“Chaos” In Energy And Commodity Markets: A Controversial Matter|We test whether the futures prices of some commodity and en- ergy markets are determined by stochastic rules or exhibit nonlinear deterministic endogenous uctuations. As for the methodologies, we use the maximal Lyapunov exponents (MLE) and a determinism test, both based on the reconstruction of the phase space of a dynamical sys- tem underlying a scalar time series. In particular, employing a recent methodology, we estimate a coecient that describes the determin- ism rate of the analyzed time series. The empirical evidence suggests that commodity and energy futures prices are the measured footprint of a nonlinear deterministic, rather than a stochastic, system.
Q02|Impact of China on World Commodity Prices and Commodity Exporters|We study the effect of a domestic shock in China on the real economy and financial markets of a commodity exporting country. We estimate a dynamic factor model using Bayesian methods to identify a China factor and a global factor using monthly macroeconomic data from China and rest of the world. We, then, assess implications of the China factor on global commodity prices and macroeconomy of a commodity exporting nation in a reduced form Bayesian VAR. A negative China shock causes fall in global commodity prices leading to output loss and stock market fall in these countries. China shock affects output of only a subset of countries in our sample compared to US shock, which affects all countries. Stock markets of commodity dependent countries respond strongly and more quickly to China shock than to US shock. China shock also has more persistent effect on commodity prices than US shock.
Q02|In the Nick of Time: A Heteroskedastic SVAR Model and Its Application to the Crude Oil Futures Market|Many economic analyses revolve around the identification of shocks. However, this becomes difficult if we do not have enough information, for example because we do not observe the underlying process at a high enough frequency. As a result, if the response of one variable to a shock to another takes place `in the nick of time' this shock remains unidentified. We introduce a structural vector-autoregression model with Markov-switching heteroskedasticity in the data generating process that allows us to study instantaneous impulse-response relationships with the proper selection of a supporting `catalyst', which can be easier to find than an instrumental variable.
Q02|Real Options in Energy and Commodity Markets|The field of real options is concerned with the management and financial valuation of operational flexibility in business endeavors. From the very outset, energy and commodity markets — which play fundamental roles in the worldwide economy — have provided a relevant context for real option analysis, both in theory and practice.
Q02|Commodity Prices and the Option Value of Storage|Commodities are physical, not financial assets. We investigate the effects on equilibrium spot-price behavior of frictions in the storage process, which introduce an element of irreversibility to storage decisions and lead to periods when storage operators do not trade in the spot market. We value the real option to delay selling a stored commodity, which comes bundled with the stored commodity itself and generates a convenience yield. The latter arises if the spot price is incorrectly used to measure the market value of the stored commodity, ignoring the embedded real option. It can be interpreted as the expected excess return on the real option to delay selling the stored commodity. Rather than equaling a flow of benefits received during the period over which the return from storage is being calculated, it actually represents changes in the present value of benefits that will be received only some time after the measurement period, when the commodity is released from storage. Storage frictions also generate heteroskedastic spot prices, with volatility being much higher when storage operators decide not to trade in the spot market.
Q02|A Capacitated Commodity Trading Model with Market Power|In commodity markets, physical traders can take advantage of geographical price spreads by buying a commodity at the location where the price is low and reselling it where it is high. These trading decisions may have an impact on future prices, which we refer to as market power. They are also subject to operational capacity constraints. Our objective in this chapter is to understand how to best utilize this capacitated locational spread option in the presence of market power. We model the trader’s market power by altering the drifts of the underlying price stochastic processes. We find that the optimal policy is similar to the classical case without market power: there are two thresholds that determine three regions where it is optimal to: (1) move as much as possible from one market to the other; (2) do the the same in the opposite direction; or (3) do nothing. The values of the thresholds depend on operational costs, as usual, but also on market power and price uncertainty. We characterize these thresholds both in isolation and in a competitive equilibrium.
Q02|Stochastic Volatility Modeling of Emission Allowances Futures Prices in the European Union Emission Trading System Market|We conduct an empirical investigation of the logreturns of the futures prices of the European Union Emission Trading System emission certificates traded in the Nord Pool market between 2005 and 2013. We observe heaviness, skewness, and high kurtosis of these logreturns. We thus propose modeling the futures logprices using the Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (BNS) or the Heston stochastic volatility models.We carry out an empirical comparison between the performances of these models and investigate their stationary autocorrelation structure. In particular, as a consequence of allowing for skewness in the Heston model, we find analytical expressions for the autocorrelation function of the logreturns and their squares. Our analysis indicates the presence of short-range dependence in the observed futures logprice returns. We conclude that the BNS model better describes the empirical features of the observed futures prices than the Heston model. Our findings have relevance for the real option modeling of fossil-fueled power plants when considering emission costs.
Q02|Optimal Exploitation of a Mineral Resource under Stochastic Market Prices|In this chapter, we study the operation and optimal exploitation of a mining project. We model the project as a collection of minimal extraction units or blocks, each with its own mineral composition and extraction costs. The decision maker’s problem is to maximize the economic value of the project by controlling the sequence and time of extraction, as well as investing in costly capacity expansions. We use a real options approach based on contingent claim analysis and risk-neutral valuation to solve the problem for a fixed extraction sequence, taking as an input the stochastic process that regulates the time dynamics of futures prices. Our solution method works in two steps. First, we consider a fixed production capacity and use approximate dynamic programming to compute upper and lower bounds on the value function in terms of the spot price and mineralogical characteristics of the blocks. We use these bounds to obtain an operating policy that is asymptotically optimal as the spot price grows large. In the second step, we extend this asymptotic approximation to handle capacity expansion decisions. Our numerical computations suggest that the proposed policy is near optimal. Finally, we test our methodology in a setting based on data from a real project at Codelco (the world’s largest copper producer).
Q02|Real Option Management of Hydrocarbon Cracking Operations|Commodity conversion assets play important economic roles. It is well known that the market value of these assets can be maximized by managing them as real options on the prices of their inputs and/or outputs. In particular, when futures on these inputs and outputs are traded, managing such real options, that is, valuing, hedging, and exercising them, is analogous to managing options on such futures, using risk neutral valuation and delta hedging methods. This statement holds because dynamically trading portfolios of these futures and a risk less bond can replicate the cash flows of these assets. This basic principle, which forms the basis of commodity merchant operations, is not always appreciated by managers of commodity conversion assets. Moreover, determining the optimal operational cash flows of such an asset requires optimizing the asset operating policy. This issue complicates the real option management of commodity conversion assets. This chapter illustrates the application of this approach to manage a hydrocarbon cracker, a specific commodity conversion asset, using linear programming and Monte Carlo simulation. The discussion is based on a simplified representation of the operations of this asset. However, the material presented here has potential applicability to the real option management of more realistic models of hydrocarbon cracking assets, as well as other energy and commodity conversion assets.
Q02|Contract Portfolio Optimization for a Gasoline Supply Chain|Major oil companies sell gasoline through three channels of trade: Branded (associated with long-term contracts), unbranded (associated with short-term contracts), and the spot market. The branded channel provides them with a long-term secured and sustainable demand source, but requires an inflexible long-term commitment with demand and price risks. The unbranded channel provides a medium level of allocation flexibility. The spot market provides them with the greatest allocation flexibility to the changing market conditions, but the spot market’s illiquidity mitigates this benefit. In order to sell the product in a profitable and sustainable way, they need a dynamic contract portfolio strategy that would enable them to adjust the supply contract portfolio over time in anticipation of the future market conditions in each individual channel while satisfying the contractual obligations. We propose a multi-period model to dynamically rebalance the contract portfolio according to changing market dynamics with the objective of maximizing total expected discounted profit. We represent the evolution of product prices using a common real option model. We characterize the structure of an optimal state-dependent base-share contract portfolio policy for both finite and infinite planning horizons. Our computational results provide managerial insights into the structure of optimal policies and the benefit of using dynamic rather than static policies, and illustrate the sensitivity of the optimal contract portfolio and corresponding profit value in terms of the different parameters of our model.
Q02|Price Adjustment to the Exchange Rate Shock in World Commodity Markets|We empirically investigate dynamic responses of 49 IMF primary commodity prices to the US dollar exchange rate shock using recursively identified vector autoregressive models. Our major empirical findings are as follows. First, price adjustments toward the new equilibrium tend to be gradual with a few exceptions. We propose and estimate two measures of price-stickiness, which provide strong evidence of short-run price rigidity in most commodities. Second, our dynamic elasticity analysis implies that price responses are quite heterogeneous even in the long-run. Some commodity prices over-adjust to the exchange rate shock, which implies higher volatility of those prices than that of the exchange rate. Third, for those commodities that over-adjust, prices in the rest of the world would rise significantly when the US dollar depreciates unexpectedly, suggesting a role for price stabilization policies.
Q02|Global Cycles: Capital Flows, Commodities, and Sovereign Defaults, 1815-2015|Capital flow and commodity cycles have long been connected with economic crises. Sparse historical data, however, has made it difficult to connect their timing. We date turning points in global capital flows and commodity prices across two centuries and provide estimates from alternative data sources. We then document a strong overlap between the ebb and flow of financial capital, the commodity price super-cycle, and sovereign defaults since 1815. The results have implications for today, as many emerging markets are facing a double bust in capital inflows and commodity prices, making them vulnerable to crises.
Q02|Analysis of Price Shock Transmission: Case of the Wheat-Bread Market Value Chain in Ethiopia|This study assesses the degree of vertical price transmission along the wheat-bread value chain in Ethiopia. This is pursued by applying a vector error correction model (VECM) and an impulse response analysis using monthly price data for the period 2000-2015. The analysis considers different market levels starting from international wheat market and domestic wheat producers at the upstream to domestic bread market at the downstream of the value chain. The empirical findings indicate that significant cointegration exists across prices of the different stages along the value chain. There is a transmission from international prices to domestic prices at downstream markets, in particular flour and bread prices. Prices at upstream markets are largely influenced by the domestic wholesale market. In general, the speed of adjustment is quite slow with a half-life of about one year for restoring the equilibrium price. As price margins between the different market stages in the value chain have substantially decreased in the last 15 years, higher transmission, and thus, exposure to international market shocks can be expected in future. Last but not least, the results also reveal that causal relationships exist between prices at different market stages-with the wholesale market identified as the key market level where prices and price expectations are formed.
Q02|Comovements and Volatility Spillover in Commodity Markets| This paper analyzes comovements and connectedness of commodity futures in the past two decades. We apply dynamic conditional correlation model (DCC) to capture time-varying dependence structure of a variety of commodities across different sectors. We propose to estimate network connectedness of commodity markets by the modeling framework of Diebold and Yilmaz (2014) that studies direction and magnitude of volatility spillover using reduced-form vector autoregression (VAR) models and generalized forecast error variance decomposition. We find that both DCC and VAR models present consistent results: while comovements and connectedness of commodity markets have dramatically increased during 2007-2009 financial distress, they have returned to the pre-crisis levels after. We also find that recent downward movement of commodity prices does not necessarily indicate stronger connection between commodity markets, which poses challenges on recent studies in commodity financialization.
Q02|The effect of Brazilian corn and soybean crop expansion on price and volatility transmission| This study aims to examine if the most recent changes in the Brazilian corn and soybean production have caused significant changes in prices and volatility transmission between Brazilian and U.S. markets. In addition to using econometric time-series methods tests to analyze price transmission among grain and oilseeds markets, we investigated the volatility spillover across U.S. and Brazil markets using causality in variance tests. Since structural break tests indicated the presence of one breakpoint, the sample was split in two periods: 1996-2006 and 2007-2014. Results suggest that the level of market integration has increased during the second period (2007-2014) with higher sensibility to price changes compared to the first period (1996-2006).
Q02|Anticipatory Signals of Changes in Corn Demand| Contemporaneous observations on expected supply and on prices of post-harvest futures contracts for corn are used to estimate expected demand relationships. These equations are used to forecast the prices of the post-harvest contracts based on new supply estimates. Each forecast can be compared with a corresponding futures price, i.e., the market’s forecast. The differences help discern the market’s expectations about the expected demand for the new crop relative to historical experience, which can help support outlook analyses. The discussion also deepens understanding of the term “anticipatory prices,” as used by H. Working (1958).
Q02|How is volatility in commodity markets linked to oil price shocks?|This study investigates the effects of oil price shocks on volatility of agricultural and metal commodities. We decompose an oil price shock to its underlying components, including macroeconomics and oil specific shocks. The applied method is the structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model and the time span is from April 1983 to May 2014. The investigation is divided into two subsamples, before and after May 2006 for agriculture taking into account the 2006–2008 food crisis and change in U.S. ethanol production policy, and before and after January 2008 for metals considering the recent global financial crisis. We find that, based on impulse response functions, the response of volatility of each commodity to an oil price shock differs significantly depending on the underlying cause of the shock for the both periods. Moreover, according to variance decomposition the explanatory power of oil shocks becomes stronger after the crisis. The different responses of commodities are described in detail by investigating market characteristics in each period.
Q02|Agricultural Commodity Prices and Exchange Rates under Structural Change| That exchange rates strongly influence agricultural commodity prices is a widely held belief. Observed divergences in price and exchange rate correspondence over time, however, have occasionally brought this conventional wisdom into doubt. We empirically test and find evidence to support hypotheses that key supply-use factors, such as low stocks and policy shifts, intermittently cause greater responsiveness of agricultural commodity prices to exchange rate changes because they give rise to more inelastic market demand. After accounting for these longrun effects, we also find that short-run price responsiveness to exchange rate changes is sometimes greater due to overshooting factors.
Q02|Coordenação do Comércio Atacadista de Pescado no Mercado do Ver-o-Peso, em Belém-Pará| The Ver-o-Peso Market, freely translated as “check-the-weight” market, is one of the main fish unloading and marketing sites in Brazil. Thirty five thousand tons of fish are unloaded yearly at the market, involving several groups of individuals, such as balanceiros, local conditioned agents who trade the local production. The present research intends to demonstrate, through Economical Sociology assumptions, the importance of balanceiros in the fish commercialization model installed at Ver-o-Peso Market. The adopted methodology included bibliographic and documental research, semi-structured interviews, direct observation, audio and video registration. The analysis of the collected information was carried out through tabulation and ranking according to the assumptions of the Economical Sociology. The results demonstrate the importance of balanceiro as the logistical commerce coordinator of the transactions that are performed in the wholesale market of fresh fish on Pedra, the commercialization at the Ver-o-Peso Market. This study offers to the sector researchers and managers a perspective based on individual and collective motivations of the individuals involved in the establishment and development of local markets, in a context that goes beyond the economical assumptions of supply and demand, in a perspective that the keyword is social embeddedness.
Q02|An Economic Analysis Of The Potential Returns From A Future National Wheat Checkoff Program| Concerned about growing negative pressure on the U.S. wheat market, from low relative productivity growth and production returns to wheat quality concerns, gluten and other wheat consumption issues and growing wheat export competition, industry leaders have begun a dialogue on the possibility of establishing a national wheat checkoff program similar to those currently in place for other agricultural commodities to enhance wheat industry profits. This study provides an economic assessment of the potential returns from the establishment of a future national wheat checkoff program. In general, the study concludes that a national wheat checkoff program would likely return more to wheat producers in revenues than the cost of the program to them in checkoff assessments.
Q02|Organoleptic quality of coffee (Coffea arabica L.) in the central and southern zones of Manabí province, Ecuador| The coffee has economic, social and environmental importance, especially in Manabí representing 35 % of the national coffee area, cultivated <800 meters above sea level. The study was carried out in 2012, sampling 22 farms of coffee plantations. The objectives were: to assess the sensory quality of coffee produced in the central and southern Manabí zones to determine the potential of producing specialty coffees, and contrasting the organoleptic quality of pure arabic varieties (Bourbon, Caturra and Typica) and hybrid Sarchimor. The results indicate that of 22 samples, 73 % scored ≥80 points SCAA (p<0.05), therefore, in Manabí, there is no effect of altitude on the organoleptic quality. The Sarchimor has larger grain size (p<0.05) and no significant differences between cultivars were found on the organoleptic characteristics (p>0.05). The natural flavored in 45 % of samples of washed coffee, benefiting from the enzyme wet method , strengthens the potential to produce specialty coffees in Manabí.
Q02|Zmiany na rynkach towarowych a regulacje nadzorcze w Unii Europejskiej / Changes on Commodity Markets and Regulation in the European Union|Commodity markets are important for the shape of the world economy and have experienced numerous structural changes over the span of the last few decades. Prices became more volatile as more and more financial investors began to speculate on commodity markets. Such a process combined with other crucial factors led to market abuses, decreasing the transparency of trade, and excessive speculation. These issues intensifiedand were mostly observed during the subprime mortgage crisis and in the period straight after it. The policymakers around the globe made an effort to diminish those effects and introduced new a policy framework regarding commodity markets. The aim of this paper is to define, present and review the current works and actions taken by the European Union policymakers. This has been done based on an analysis of the new legislation and its possible results.
Q02|Commodity dynamics: A sparse multi-class approach|The correct understanding of commodity price dynamics can bring relevant improvements in terms of policy formulation both for developing and developed countries. Agricultural, metal and energy commodity prices might depend on each other: although we expect few important effects among the total number of possible ones, some price effects among different commodities might still be substantial. Moreover, the increasing integration of the world economy suggests that these effects should be comparable for different markets. This paper introduces a sparse estimator of the Multi-class Vector AutoRegressive model to detect common price effects between a large number of commodities, for different markets or investment portfolios. In a first application, we consider agricultural, metal and energy commodities for three different markets. We show a large prevalence of effects involving metal commodities in the Chinese and Indian markets, and the existence of asymmetric price effects. In a second application, we analyze commodity prices for five different investment portfolios, and highlight the existence of important effects from energy to agricultural commodities. The relevance of biofuels is hereby confirmed. Overall, we find stronger similarities in commodity price effects among portfolios than among markets.
Q02|Are Commodity Price Booms an Opportunity to Diversify? Evidence from Resource-dependent Countries|The recent commodity price drop has renewed attention on the importance to diversify resource-dependent economies in particular to limit their exposure to commodity price volatility. While commodity price booms can be an opportunity to diversify the economy if managed properly, it remains an empirical question whether this has effectively been the case. Using a panel of 78 resource-dependent countries over 1970-2012 we tackle this question thanks to cointegration analysis, dynamic macro-panel estimators, as well as analyses of diversification outcomes during selected commodity price boom and bust episodes. While our econometric results evidence a stable and significant impact of commodity price booms on export concentration through a more concentrated mix of already exported products, this relationship includes both an increase in export concentration during commodity price booms and an increase in export diversification during commodity price drops. We also evidence a higher increase in export concentration during the 2000s commodity price booms than the 1970s, which explains the urging current need of most resource-dependent countries to diversify.
Q02|Explaining the EUA-CER Spread|Because of a link between the EU ETS and the Kyoto Flexible Mechanisms, the emission certificates traded on these markets are in principle interchangeable assets; despite of this, a persistent price difference exists. We explain this price spread using a theoretical model that combines three features: A binding limit for the use of Kyoto offsets within the EU ETS; a disconnect between the price of offsets and their marginal cost of production due to institutional reasons; and uncertainty about future supply and demand of offsets. Our model expresses the offset price as an average of the EUA price and an offset’s outside value, weighted by the probability of a binding import limit. Using a detailed dataset on expected offset supply and demand, we provide empirical support for our theory of offset price formation. In addition, we find evidence for informational frictions governing the use of offsets within the EU ETS.
Q02|The role of emerging economies in the global price formation process of commodities: Evidence from Brazilian and U.S. coffee markets|This paper examines the role of the Brazilian futures exchange, BM&F Bovespa, in the global price formation process of Arabica coffee. Using a multivariate GARCH model we find bi-directional information transmission in terms of spillover effects between the BM&F Bovespa futures contract for Arabica coffee and the ‘Coffee C’ futures contract traded at the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in New York. Moreover, our empirical results indicate that the influence of the BM&F Bovespa futures market on the ICE futures market increased during the 2010–2012 boom in coffee prices, suggesting a greater role of local market information for price and volatility dynamics during this period. We also show that local Brazilian spot markets incorporate information from the domestic and foreign futures market. Taken together, our findings highlight the great relevance of the BM&F Bovespa futures market in the global price formation process of Arabica coffee.
Q02|Phasing out the U.S. Federal Helium Reserve: Policy insights from a world helium model|This paper develops a detailed partial equilibrium model of the global helium market to study the effects of the recently decided rapid phase out of the U.S. Federal Helium Reserve (FHR), a vast strategic stockpile accumulated during the 1960s. The model incorporates a detailed representation of that industry and treats both helium producers and the FHR as players in a dynamic non-cooperative game. The goal of each player is assumed to be the maximization of discounted profit, subject to technical and resource constraints. We consider two alternative policies aimed at organizing the phase out of the FHR: the currently implemented one and a less stringent one whereby the FHR would be allowed to operate as a profit-maximizing agent during an extended period of time. Evidences gained from a series of market simulations indicate that, compared to the current policy, a less stringent policy mandate systematically increases the financial return to the U.S. federal budget, always enhances environmental outcomes as it lowers helium venting into the atmosphere, and also augments global welfare in three out of the four scenarios considered in the paper.
Q02|The Effect of Biofuels on the Link between Oil and Agricultural Commodity Prices: A Smooth Transition Cointegration Approach|Given the few studies highlighting the existence of an oil-price effect on agricultural commodity prices in the last decade, we sought to demonstrate the role of first-generation biofuel production in such a relationship. Relying on a smooth transition cointegration approach, we show that biofuel development has led to an increase in the long-term price effect of oil on agricultural commodity prices. Thus, the increasing production of biofuels contributes to the price rise of agricultural commodities. This result underlines the importance of accelerating second-generation biofuel production to replace first-generation biofuels.
Q02|Oil Price and Exchange Rates: A Wavelet Analysis for Organisation of Oil Exporting Countries Members|This paper studies the relationship between oil price and the exchange rates of Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) members from February 1999 to March 2016. The wavelet method is applied to combine information from both time and frequency domains, which does not require stationary and decomposition of original time series data. The study found that the strength of the relationship between oil price and exchange rate divides into three main categories, namely oil price leads exchange rate, exchange rate leads oil prices, and the relationship keeps changing. Countries which currencies pegged to US Dollar are lagging against oil price changes, countries with floating exchange rates and countries with an undisclosed weighted basket of international currencies leads the changes in oil price, and countries which their currencies pegged to special drawing right experience changing relationships. This finding suggests that the central banks of OPEC member countries should give importance to shocks on oil prices, while formulating their own exchange rate policy.
Q02|Global food prices and monetary policy in an emerging market economy: The case of India|This paper investigates a perception in the political debates as to what extent poor countries are affected by price movements in the global commodity markets. To test this perception, we use the case of India to establish in a standard SVAR model that global food prices influence aggregate prices and food prices in India. To further analyze these empirical results, we specify a small open economy New-Keynesian model including oil and food prices and estimate it using observed data over the period 1996Q2 to 2013Q2 by applying Bayesian estimation techniques. The results suggest that a big part of the variation in inflation in India is due to cost-push shocks and, mainly during the years 2008 and 2010, also to global food price shocks, after having controlled for exogenous rainfall shocks. We conclude that the inflationary supply shocks (cost-push, oil price, domestic food price and global food price shocks) are important contributors to inflation in India. Since the monetary authority responds to these supply shocks with a higher interest rate which tends to slow growth, this raises concerns about how such output losses can be prevented by reducing exposure to commodity price shocks.
Q02|Co-movements between crude oil and food prices: A post-commodity boom perspective|Using the correlations of VAR forecast errors at different horizons, this paper analyzes the dynamics of co-movements between crude oil and food prices. For each food price considered, a bivariate VAR model is estimated on two subsample periods: a pre-commodity-boom (1990M1–2006M12) and a post-boom period (2007M1–2015M5). Our results reveal strong positive co-movements between crude oil and food prices in the aftermath of the commodity boom, while no statistically significant co-movements are observed over the pre-boom period. Hence, our findings provide further empirical evidence on the actual linkages between the crude oil and agricultural markets.
Q02|Recent hikes in oil-equity market correlations: Transitory or permanent?|This paper empirically examines the long-run behavior of eight oil-equity correlations based on the ADCC (asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation) model and a novel decomposing approach. We select equity price indexes from three developed countries (the US, the UK and Germany) and five BRICS member countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and consider ten economic/financial events for investigation. Seven correlations exhibit a positively sloped trend, and one exhibits a horizontal trend. All of these trends have undergone one or two structural breaks, which moved the corresponding correlations to their highest-ever evolutionary paths. These structural breaks are associated with one or more of the ten episodes considered, and a common event impacting all eight of the correlation trends is detected to be the 2008 adverse oil shock. The broken trends explain why the correlations were low in the early years and high in the recent years. Our findings indicate that recent hikes in the oil-equity correlations are a long-run phenomenon.
Q02|Volatility linkages between energy and agricultural commodity prices|We investigate price and volatility risk originating in linkages between energy and agricultural commodity prices in Germany and study their dynamics over time. We propose an econometric approach to quantify the volatility and correlation risk structure, which has a large impact for investment and hedging strategies of market participants as well as for policy makers. Volatilities and their short and long run linkages are analyzed using an asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation GARCH model as well as a multivariate multiplicative volatility model. Our approach provides a flexible and accurate fitting procedure for volatility and correlation risk. We find that in the long run prices move together and preserve an equilibrium, while correlations are mostly positive with persistent market shocks. Our results reveal that concerns about biodiesel being the cause of high and volatile agricultural commodity prices are rather unjustified.
Q02|Co-movement of major energy, agricultural, and food commodity price returns: A time-series assessment|Using monthly data between 1970 and 2013, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the extent of co-movement (measured by correlation coefficients) among the nominal price returns of 11 major energy, agricultural, and food commodities. We study the degree and the time evolution of unconditional and conditional correlations using a uniform-spacings estimation and testing approach, multivariate dynamic conditional correlation models, and a rolling regression procedure. We find that (1) the price returns of energy and agricultural commodities are highly correlated; (2) the overall level of co-movement among commodities increased in recent years, especially between energy and agricultural commodities, and in particular in the cases of maize and soybean oil, which are important inputs in the production of biofuels; and (3) the stock market volatility is positively associated with the co-movement of price returns across markets, especially after 2007.
Q02|On the dynamic links between commodities and Islamic equity|This paper investigates whether commodities offer potential diversification benefits for Islamic equity index investors in light of possible financialization of commodity markets. Using MGARCH-DCC and Wavelet Coherence analyses, our findings reveal that correlations between commodity markets and the Dow Jones Islamic Market World Index are time-varying and highly volatile throughout the January 1999–April 2015 period. A substantial and persistent increase was observed in the return correlations between commodities and Islamic equity at the onset of the 2008 financial crisis. However, trends in the recent two years suggest that this association is heading towards its pre-crisis levels, offering again diversification benefits for Islamic equity holders. These benefits vary across different commodities in various time scales. Overall, gold, natural gas, soft commodities, grains and livestock are better portfolio diversifiers than oil and other metals. Relative to medium-to-long term investors, short-term investors (less than 32days horizon) gained better diversification benefits in most commodities during bullish, bearish and market recovery periods. These findings have implications for investors who are heterogeneous in risk tolerance and time preference as well as for policymakers who are concerned with market stability.
Q02|Futures markets and fundamentals of base metals|According to the theory of storage, the interest-adjusted basis equals the warehousing cost minus the convenience yield (i.e., benefit of holding a physical commodity) per time unit. By assuming that warehousing costs relatively constant at alternative stock levels, the interest-adjusted basis will be inversely associated with the convenience yield.
Q02|Food prices and the multiplier effect of trade policy|This work studies the relationship between trade policy and food prices. We show that when individuals are loss averse, governments may use trade policy to shield the domestic economy from large food price shocks. This creates a complementarity between the price of food in international markets and trade policy. Specifically, unilateral actions give rise to a “multiplier effect”: when a shock drives up the price of food, exporters respond by imposing restrictions, while importers wind down protection, thus exacerbating the initial shock and soliciting further trade policy activism. We test the key prediction of the theory with a new dataset that comprises monthly information on trade measures across 77 countries and 32 food products for the period 2008–11, finding evidence of a multiplier effect in food trade policy. These findings contribute to inform the broader debate on the proper regulation of food trade policy within the multilateral trading system.
Q02|Commodity markets volatility transmission: Roles of risk perceptions and uncertainty in financial markets|This paper uses GJR–GARCH estimations to analyze the price volatility transmissions among the crude oil, corn, soybeans, sugar, and wheat markets. Special role is also given to two driving mechanisms of the relationship: (i) the volatility index (VIX) as a measure of risk perceptions, and (ii) the equity market uncertainty (EMU) index as a measure of uncertainty in financial markets. The analysis covers the daily futures markets data from January 1, 1990 to July 31, 2015, and several sub-periods in the empirical strategy are also considered. The empirical results show that (i) crude oil return is positively related to four agricultural commodity returns; (ii) a higher risk perception in financial markets suppresses both the corn and soybeans returns over the period August 1, 2008–July 31, 2015; (iii) a higher uncertainty in financial markets is negatively related to the corn and soybeans returns for the period from June 1, 2010 to July 31, 2015; (iv) the results for the effects of risk perceptions and uncertainty on wheat market returns are not statistically robust; i.e., these results are time-specific in the different sub-period analyses.
Q02|The predictive performance of commodity futures risk factors|This paper investigates the time-series predictability of commodity futures excess returns from factor models that exploit two risk factors – the equally weighted average excess return on long positions in a universe of futures contracts and the return difference between the high- and low-basis portfolios. Adopting a standard set of statistical evaluation metrics, we find weak evidence that the factor models provide out-of-sample forecasts of monthly excess returns significantly better than the benchmark of random walk with drift model. We also show, in a dynamic asset allocation environment, that the information contained in the commodity-based risk factors does not generate systematic economic value to risk-averse investors pursuing a commodity stand-alone strategy or a diversification strategy.
Q02|Piecewise linear trends and cycles in primary commodity prices|We extend the methodology put forward in Yamada and Yoon (2014, Journal of International Money and Finance, 42(C), 193–207) to analyze the trend and cyclical behavior of relative primary commodity prices. These authors propose the use of the so-called ℓ1-filter that renders piecewise linear trends of the underlying data. Our focus on the calibration of such filter and its implications for the empirical analysis of primary commodity prices, especially the interpretation given to the resulting trend. We also illustrate how suitably calibrated filters may be used to compute piecewise linear (super) cycles, whose turning points are easy to identify.
Q02|The impact of speculation on commodity futures markets – A review of the findings of 100 empirical studies|There are numerous empirical studies on the impact of speculation on commodity futures markets. The papers strongly differ in terms of the focus variable (e.g. price, volatility, spill-over effects) of speculative effects, the speculation measure used, and broad quality. We review and evaluate the methodology and results of 100 papers which have been published (or are at least frequently cited) on this subject over the past decade. While the overall picture indicates that the number of studies which support and contradict the criticized effects of speculation is about the same, the results shift against the criticized effects if the studies use direct measures of speculation, except for price. Applying different paper quality standards does not fundamentally change our findings.
Q02|Is gold an inflation-hedge? Evidence from an interrupted Markov-switching cointegration model|This paper investigates the inflation hedging role of gold price after controlling for the prices of other investment assets. We use annual data on the U.S. economy spanning from 1833 to 2013. We employ a recently developed flexible nonlinear approach that allows for potential ‘interruption’ in the long run equilibrium relationship in which the equilibrium term dynamics is modelled as an AR(1) depending upon an unobserved state process that is a stationary first-order Markov chain in two states, stationarity and non-stationarity. While, a battery of standard cointegration tests without and with breaks could not find evidence to support the inflation hedging role of gold, results from the flexible nonlinear approach indicate the existence of temporary cointegration between gold price and inflation during 1864, 1919, 1932, 1934, 1976, 1980 and 1982. The interruptions in the long-run relationship at different time periods seem to be associated with the different structural changes that affected the gold market.
Q02|Further evidence on the relationship between spot and futures prices|Based on a theoretical model, Tiltonet al. (2011) concluded that spot and futures prices should be highly correlated during periods of strong contango and much less correlated during periods of weak contango and backwardation. More recently, Gulley and Tilton (2014) found empirical support of this hypothesis for copper data during the period of 1994–2011.
Q02|Does uncertainty move the gold price? New evidence from a nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test|Much significant research has been done to study the links between gold returns and the returns of other asset classes in times of economic crisis and high uncertainty. We contribute to this research by using a novel nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test to study how measures of policy and equity-market uncertainty affect gold-price returns and volatility. For daily and monthly data, we find evidence of causality running from various uncertainty measures to both gold returns and volatility. For quarterly data, evidence of causality weakens and is significant only for some uncertainty measures and only for gold volatility.
Q02|Googling gold and mining bad news|This paper studies investor's attention to gold price movements by analyzing the relationship between gold price changes and internet search queries for gold. We find a positive relationship of gold price volatility and search queries and a strong asymmetric effect of negative gold price changes on search queries indicating a preference to mine (google) bad news rather than good news. The analysis of silver, palladium and platinum demonstrates that the findings for gold are unique.
Q02|A time-varying copula approach for modelling dependency: New evidence from commodity and stock markets|This paper examines the time-varying conditional dependency between commodity markets and stock markets by applying the rolling-sample technique on the dependence parameter of copula. The dataset consists of the closing prices of twelve commodities and the SP500, CAC40, DAX30 and FTSE100 indices during the period from July 7, 1992 to February 17, 2015. To date precisely the breakpoints in the dynamics of the copula parameter of dependence, we employ Bai and Perron’s (BP, 1998, 2003) structural break-testing procedure.
Q02|International monetary policy with commodity buffer stocks|This proposal argues in favor of commodity price stabilization via international commodity buffer stocks and the tying of these stocks to the creation of a new international reserve currency. Financing commodity buffer stocks through the issuance of an international reserve makes commodity price stabilization financially viable and offers a countercyclical issuance of international reserves to fight global deflation. Both measures address the volatility of commodity prices due to a lack of private sector storage and macroeconomic demand factors. This proposal urges the reader to look back to the global Keynesian policies of the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s for inspiration in solving today's commodity price instability and secular stagnation.
Q02|A cointegration analysis of agricultural, energy and bio-fuel spot, and futures prices| This article features an analysis of the cointegration relationships among agricultural commodity, ethanol and Cushing crude oil spot, and future prices. The use of grains for the creation of bio-fuels has sparked fears that these demands are inflating food prices. We analyse approximately 10 years of daily spot and futures prices for corn, wheat, sugar ethanol, and oil prices from Datastream for the period 19 July 2006 to 2 July 2015. The analysis features Engle-Granger pairwise cointegration and partial cointegration. Pairs of series, that are cointegrated, are analysed using Markov-switching VECM and Impulse Response Analysis, which confirms that these markets have significant linkages that vary according to whether they are in low or high volatility regimes.
Q02|Food Grain Policies in India and Their Implications for Stocks and Fiscal Costs: A Partial Equilibrium Analysis|The food market in India is characterised by a high degree of government involvement, especially in two staple food grain markets – rice and wheat. As a result, the private sector is crowded out and the market is shaped by the interplay of the two forces – private and public. The government intervention starts before the planting, when the Minimum Support Price (MSP) is announced. Grains are procured from the farmers (open end procurement) with the guaranteed MSP, which should cover the production costs and a ‘reasonable’ margin for the farmers. The procured grains are stored as buffer stocks (consisting of operational and strategic stocks) which are run by the state. Grains are further distributed to the poor with heavily subsidised prices through the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS). The excessive stocks can be released to the market through Open Market Sales Scheme (OMSS) or exported. The open end procurement, high MSP and strong trade limitations result in high public procurement rates . Most of the time, the actual stocks manifold exceed the buffers stock norms and even the country’s storing capacity This in turn results in massive damages of grains. Additionally, the TPDS suffers from huge targeting errors, subsidies are very costly and incompatible with WTO standards. In the light of the rising fiscal costs of the system, its inefficiency and high food inflation, there is a need for finding cost-effective alternatives. Assessment of their costs and benefits is especially important in the wake of all India implementation of the National Food Security Act, 2013, which brings an extension to the current system by the guaranteed provision of heavily subsidised grains to almost 70% of the population. There is also an international pressure on India to reform its food sector due to its impacts on world market prices. Also the recent prorogation of implementation of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), which limits support for farmers to 10% of the value of production, is only a temporary solution. Domestically, there are rising voices advocating for introduction of cash transfers instead of TPDS. The current study provides a model for the quantitative assessment of the major food policies on the food sector in India. It is based on a model of the Indian food sector, which encompasses the duality of the system - the coexistence of private and public forces. The model is a two-market (rice and wheat) yearly partial equilibrium model. Functional forms and most of the parameters used in the model are derived from the ex post econometric analysis of the data from 1982 to 2012 . As a result, the model is based on the careful data analysis and in depth study of the system, which makes it a reliable and comprehensible tool for simulations of the implications of different policies. In the model, the two markets interact with each other through their substitution in demand and storage. Computation of the equilibrium prices is formulated as a mixed complementarity problem (MCP) and executed in the generalized algebraic modelling systems (GAMS) software. Quantities procured by the government (with the MSP), closing private stocks, exports, production, demand and fiscal costs are determined endogenously through equations or the complementarity conditions. Interaction between the MSP and the market price determines the amounts procured by the government. Private stocks are driven by total market supply, trade policy and partially crowded out by public stocks. Production strongly and significantly responds to MSP (short-term price elasticity for wheat equal to 0.47 and 0.39 for rice). Rice consumption is influenced by TPDS and wheat demand responds to market prices. Public exports are exogenous and OMSS off-takes are a constant share (10%) of excessive public stocks (stock above norm). World rice prices are endogenous (large country case) and for wheat exogenous. As to our best knowledge this is the first study which captures all the major food policies in India and quantifies their impact on the stocks, prices and fiscal costs. In this study the alternative exogenous policy scenarios are compared with respect to their impact on the domestic prices, public stock levels and related fiscal costs. The particular considered policy options are: • Liberal system: shifting from the MSP to deficiency payments and TPDS towards direct cash transfers, including a liberalization of international trade (relying more on the imports in case of crop failure) • Expanding the TPDS under the NFSA (as mentioned above, increasing the scope of the distribution and lowering the distribution price) within the current system (with open end procurement and holding public stocks) under different trade regimes The simulation model based on the econometric estimation reproduces the basic dual market dynamics well.
Q02|Analysis of Price Shock Transmission: Case of the Wheat-Bread Market Value Chain in Ethiopia| This study assesses the degree of vertical price transmission along the wheat-bread value chain in Ethiopia. This is pursued by applying a vector error correction model (VECM) and an impulse response analysis using monthly price data for the period 2000 –2015. The empirical findings indicate that significant cointegration exists across prices of the different stages along the value chain. In particular, there is a strong price shock transmission for the price pair international–local wholesale wheat prices. This suggests that international wheat price shocks could have significant consequences for the Ethiopian economy, given that the country is not only a net importer of wheat but it also imports a sizable amount vis-à-vis the domestic production. Although price shocks are transmitted along the value chain to a different extent, the speed of adjustment is quite slow. For instance, less than 6% of the disequilibrium in bread prices is eliminated in one month, implying that it takes longer that one year for bread price to virtually restore to its long-run equilibrium value after a shock. The results also reveal that causal relationships exist between prices at different market stages. To this end, the impulse response analysis shows diverse responses to shocks, with some shocks producing weak and temporary adjustments while others producing stronger and persistent changes. We found that producer and wholesale market levels play a dominant role in the wheat value chain, implying that policies may give particular attention to these markets.
Q02|The Effect of Biofuels on the Link between Oil and Agricultural Commodity Prices: A Smooth Transition Cointegration Approach|The aim of this paper is to investigate the long-term effect of the price of oil on agricultural commodity prices by accounting for the influence of biofuel production. Relying on the estimation of nonlinear, cointegrating regime-switching processes, we show that biofuel development has led to an increase in the oil-price effect on agricultural commodity prices: the growing production of biofuels is contributing to the price rise of agricultural commodities. This result underlines the importance of considering alternative biofuels which are not produced from agricultural commodities, and of analyzing the potential effects of the second-generation biofuels derived from agricultural plant residuals or non-food plants.
Q02|Common and Fundamental Risk Factors in Shareholder Returns of Norwegian Salmon Producing Companies|Salmon farming companies are increasingly gaining attention from investors and portfolio managers. The last decade has seen a substantial growth in the securitization of salmon farming assets and prices. A growing literature demonstrates that industry-specific fundamental, as well as market-wide risk factors help explain stock returns. However, very little is known about the pricing of salmon stocks and especially the contribution of industry-specific fundamental risk factors. Using a multifactor model, we find that stock returns for salmon farming firms are significantly associated with both common market-wide risks and industry-specific risk factors.
Q02|An economic assessment of GHG mitigation policy options for EU agriculture (EcAMPA 2)|The project 'Economic Assessment of GHG mitigation policy options for EU agriculture (EcAMPA)' is designed to assess some aspects of a potential inclusion of the agricultural sector into the EU 2030 climate policy framework. In the context of possible reductions of non-CO2 emissions from EU agriculture, the scenario results of the EcAMPA 2 study highlight issues related to production effects, the importance of technological mitigation options and the need to consider emission leakage for an effective reduction of global agricultural GHG emissions.
Q02|Economic Impacts of El Niño Southern Oscillation: Evidence from the Colombian Coffee Market|We develop a structural econometric model to study the impacts of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on Colombian coffee production, exports and price. Our empirical specification is consistent with an economic model of the coffee market that, in the short-run, is characterized by a downward-sloping demand curve and by a vertical supply curve. This allows to study the effects of unpredictable innovations to ENSO on the Colombian coffee price, while controlling for shocks arising from both the supply and the demand-side of the market. We show that El Niño events (i.e. positive shocks to ENSO) might be beneficial for production and exports and tend to decrease the price of coffee. On the contrary, La Niña conditions (i.e. negative shocks to ENSO) depress coffee production and exports and increase price. However, the overall impact of ENSO shocks is small. In the short-run, ENSO shocks explain 2% of the fluctuations of coffee production and 0.2% of the variability of the price of coffee. In the long-run, these percentages rise to 8% and 6%, respectively. Both in the short-run and in the long-run, demand-side shocks are more relevant than supply-side shocks in explaining the dynamics of the price of coffee.
Q02|On the definition of externality as a missing market|Despite its increasing role in economic theory, the concept of externality seems to elude any attempt at rigorous and consensual definition. While problems of definition have emerged with the concept itself in the 1950s, the paper focuses on the definition of externality within the general equilibrium theory. In the Arrow-Debreu framevork, externality is a kind of “missing market” (Arrow 1969) – an unpriced effect that upsets the assumption of the complete system of markets – and its formalization is achieved by introducing a direct interdependence between utility or production functions. The paper shows that this Arrovian definition allows some ambiguities to persist. As witnessed by some authors' positions in the 1970s (Mishan 1971, Baumol and Oates 1975, Heller and Starrett 1976, Laffont 1988), it does not highlight two features associated with the traditional meaning of externalities: whether or not it is an exogenous effect and an unintended effect. This raises, although differently, the issue of the dilution of externality within the larger notion of individual interdependences. Beyond the conceptual importance of clarifying the definition of externality, this issue has also a strong normative content: giving a strict definition of externality amounts, implicitly, to drawing the frontier of legitimate internalisation and economic policy
Q02|The impact of the embargo and sanctions on the agri-food markets in Russia: Analysis of consequences|The paper examines the impact of the embargo and sanctions on the agri-food markets in Russia. The analysis has shown that markets of milk and beef are experiencing serious problems. One of the main reasons for market volatility is a relatively low share of large enterprises with better adaptability in conditions of the embargo and sanctions and underdeveloped market infrastructure. The method that allows to quantify the consequences of the embargo and sanctions impact for the commodity markets is developed on the basis of a partial equilibrium model. The method has been tested on the meat markets (beef, pork, poultry). The estimates of changes in foreign trade, prices of producers and consumers, the dynamics of production, losses of budget, producers and consumers are provided. The results show that the budget suffers losses in all cases, and the markets with higher dependence on imports under the impact of the embargo and sanctions lose more in the welfare than those with less dependence. Poultry market has shown good stability and welfare under the embargo and sanctions due to high competition, mainly among large enterprises.
Q02|Trends and cycles in historical gold and silver prices|The study proposes an alternative modelling specification for the real prices of gold and silver that allows the long run trend and cyclical behaviour to be modelled simultaneously by incorporating two differencing parameters in a fractional integration framework. However, we also consider the separate cases of a standard I(d) process, with a pole or singularity at the zero frequency and a cyclical I(d) model that incorporates a single pole in the spectrum at a non-zero frequency. We use annual data spanning from 1833 to 2013 for gold and 1792 to 2013 for silver. Based on the more flexible model that permits a pole at both zero (trend) and non-zero (cycle) frequencies, we find that in general the estimates associated to the long run or zero frequency appear to be above 1 in case of gold and below 1 for silver, while the order of integration associated with the cyclical frequency is slightly above 0 in the majority of the cases in the two series. Further, higher orders of integration are associated to the long run component compared with the cyclical one. The implications of these findings are highlighted.

Q02|Forecasting oil price realized volatility: A new approach|This paper adds to the extremely limited strand of the literature focusing on the oil price realized volatility forecasting. More specifically, we evaluate the information content of four different asset classes’ volatilities when forecasting the oil price realized volatility for 1-day until 66-day ahead. To do so, we concentrate on the Brent crude oil and fourteen other assets, which are grouped into four different asset classes, based on Heterogeneous AutoRegressive (HAR) framework. Our out-of-sample forecasting results can be summarised as follows. (i) The use of exogenous volatilities statistically significant improves the forecasting accuracy at all forecasting horizons. (ii) The HAR model that combines volatilities from multiple asset classes is the best performing model. (iii) The Direction of Change suggests that all HAR models are highly accurate in predicting future movements of oil price volatility. (iv) The forecasting accuracy of the models is better gauged using the Median Absolute Error and the Median Squared Error. (v) The findings are robust even during turbulent economic periods. Hence, different asset classes’ volatilities contain important information which can be used to improve the forecasting accuracy of oil price volatility.
Q02|The Effects of Market Participation on Farm Households’ Food Security in Cambodia: An endogenous switching approach|This paper evaluates the effects of market participation on farm households’ food security in rural Cambodia in terms of household dietary diversity score. The evaluation is carried out with an endogenous switching model built on data from the Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey conducted in 2009. This model accounts for selection bias arising from unobserved factors that potentially affect both the participation and food security. The model also controls for structural differences between participants and nonparticipants in markets in terms of food security functions. The results reveal that by participating in markets, farm households enjoy higher household dietary diversity score, thus confirming the hypothesis that participation in markets exerts positive effects on farm households’ food security.
Q02|Oil, Gold, US dollar and Stock market interdependencies: A global analytical insight|This paper takes a global perspective in examining relationships among oil, gold, US dollar and stock prices, using simultaneous equations system to identify direct and indirect linkages for the period spanning from January 1995 to October 2015. Results show significant interactions between the all parties. Indeed, we found negative relation between oil and stock prices but oil price is significantly and positively affected by stock markets, gold and USD. Oil price is also affected by oil future prices and by Chinese oil gross imports. Gold price is concerned by changes in oil, USD and stock market prices but slightly depend on US oil imports and corporate default premium. The US dollar is negatively affected by stock market and significantly by oil and gold prices and also by US consumer price index. Indirect effects always exist which confirm the presence of global interdependencies and involve the financialization process of commodity markets.
Q02|Un análisis exploratorio de los exchangeable trade funds y su influencia en el proceso de financiarización de commodities<BR>[An exploratory analisys of the exchangeable trade funds and their influence in the commodities financilization process]|The aim of this paper is to provide comprehensive insights into the architecture and impact of a recent financial innovation known as commodity index. The motivation of this study is based on the impact that these instruments may have in the functioning of commodity markets, leading to what the literature has called “financialization of commodities”. Therefore, we first present the concept of financialization. Then, we describe the architecture of commodites index and the corresponding trading vehicle called Exchangeable Trade Funds. In the third section we introduce an exploratory analysis of recent trends and stylized facts of the evolution of the market. We conclude with possible impacts of those instruments on the market, opening the hypothesis that they can generate a major source of risk in the markets that already describe a high level of volatility.
Q02|Impact of Global Financial Crisis and Implied Volatility in the Equity Market on Gold Futures Traded on Multi Commodity Exchange, India|Gold is one of the most highly traded commodities in the Indian Commodity Market. It can be traded either in the spot market or the futures market, options contracts are not permitted in the Indian commodity market. In this study, the price behaviour of Gold futures traded on Multi Commodity Exchange are analysed from the year 2007 to year 2013. The issue of the introduction of option contracts on Gold in the Indian commodity market has been addressed through: (a) Presence of short term persistence in return volatility (b) Impact of recent Global Financial Crisis on daily return volatility (c) Impact of implied volatility of equity market on return and weekly return volatility. The study indicates the presence of short term persistence in return volatility of gold as well as the influence of the recent Global financial crisis on return volatility of the metal. It is also observed that that the implied volatility of equity market affects the weekly returns as well as weekly return volatility of a futures contract of Gold.
Q02|Linkages between Gold Futures Traded in Indian Commodity Futures Market and International Commodity Futures Market|Given that gold futures contracts are one of the most actively traded commodity futures in the Indian Commodity market, it is of crucial importance to study the price, return and volatility spillover behaviour of gold traded in the Indian commodity market with respect to the International commodity market. The current study tries to study the linkages in Gold futures which are traded on Indian commodity exchange – Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) and International commodity exchange – New York Mercantile Exchange are analysed. The study attempts to demonstrate the linkages in price, return and volatility across the two markets for the precious metal through three models: (a) Price – Co-integration methodology and Error Correction Mechanism Model (ECM); (b) Return and Volatility – Modified GARCH model; (c) Return and Volatility – ARMA-GARCH in Mean model – Innovations Model. Empirical analysis indicates that there is a presence of a long run relationship between prices of Gold futures contracts traded in MCX and NYMEX. Apart from cointegration in prices, return and volatility spillovers between MCX and NYMEX are found to be significant and bi-directional.
Q02|Citrus Fruit Industry of Azerbaijan after Manat’s Devaluation|Azerbaijan implemented two significant devaluations in 2015 decreasing AZN’s rate against USD from 0.78 to 1.55. Considering the favorable situation after AZN’s devaluation, it is now cheaper to increase local production, especially agricultural products. Additionally, as a result of tensions between Russia and Turkey, there is a huge vacant market for agricultural goods in Russia which is a good opportunity for Azerbaijan to export. Citrus fruits are one of them. Considering possible options we recommend government to take policy decisions offered in paper.
Q02|The relationship between commodity markets and commodity mutual funds: A wavelet-based analysis|This paper examines the causal relationship between commodities funds and returns using monthly data for the period May 1997–August 2015. Given the strong evidence of nonlinearity and structural breaks, we use wavelets to analyse causality between the two variables at both time and frequency domains. Wavelet coherency reveals that these two variables are primarily positively related in the short-run and over the period of 2008–2015. When we investigate the phase differences over this period, we observe that returns have predicted flows over the period of 2008–2012, with causality running in the other direction thereafter.
Q02|Do terror attacks predict gold returns? Evidence from a quantile-predictive-regression approach|Much significant research has been done to study how terror attacks affect financial markets. We contribute to this research by studying whether terror attacks, in addition to standard predictors considered in earlier research, help to predict gold returns. To this end, we use a quantile-predictive-regression (QPR) approach that accounts for model uncertainty and model instability. We find that terror attacks have predictive value for the lower and especially for the upper quantiles of the conditional distribution of gold returns.
Q02|The Effect of Investor Sentiment on Gold Market Dynamics|This paper explores the effect of investor sentiment on the intraday dynamics in the gold market. Using a novel methodology to detect nonlinear causalities, we examine the effect of fear and excitement in the stock market on gold return and intraday volatility at alternative quantiles. While no significant sentiment effect is observed on daily gold returns, we find that sentiment drives intraday volatility in the gold market. Interestingly however, the sentiment effect is channeled via the discontinuous component of intraday volatility and more significantly at extreme quantiles, suggesting that extreme fear (excitement) contributes to positive (negative) volatility jumps in gold returns. The results suggest that measures of sentiment could be utilized to model volatility jumps in safe haven assets that are often hard to predict and have significant implications for risk management as well as the pricing of options.
Q02|Gold futures returns and realized moments: A forecasting experiment using a quantile-boosting approach|This paper proposes an iterative model-building approach known as quantile boosting to trace out the predictive value of realized volatility and skewness for gold futures returns. Controlling for several widely studied market- and sentiment-based variables, we examine the predictive value of realized moments across alternative forecast horizons and across the quantiles of the conditional distribution of gold futures returns. We find that the realized moments often significantly improve the predictive value of the estimated forecasting models at intermediate forecast horizons and across quantiles representing distressed market conditions. We argue that realized moments carry information that reflects investors’ tradeoff between diversification and skewed payoffs, particularly during periods of market stress, which may be especially relevant for gold as the traditional accepted safe haven.
Q02|Entgrenzte Organisationen – begrenzte Beschaeftigtengesundheit? Arbeitspolitische Aushandlungen um Grenzverschiebungen und Grenzziehungen im Arbeits- und Gesundheitsschutz (Boundaryless organisations and their implications for employee health. Labour policy negotiations about boundaries in occupational health and safety)|Der Beitrag diskutiert die Reichweite und Bezugnahme der durch Normen und Vorgaben gesetzten Grenzen im Arbeits- und Gesundheitsschutz. Dafuer werden zum einen Grenzverschiebungen um den Standard des Arbeitsschutzes im Rahmen arbeitspolitischer Aushandlungen in seiner historischen Entwicklung aufgezeigt. Zum anderen werden Grenzziehungen zwischen verschiedenen Beschaeftigtengruppen identifiziert. Wie am Beispiel der stationaeren und haeuslichen Pflege gezeigt wird, kommen diese durch den Ausschluss von Leiharbeitskraeften und Werkvertragsnehmern von etablierten Arbeitsschutzstandards zustande. Ein Kennzeichen der Entgrenzung von Organisationen und Arbeit besteht demnach darin, dass prekaer Beschaeftigten mit geringen Sekundaermachtpotentialen vielerorts nur ein begrenztes Arbeits- und Gesundheitsschutzniveau zuteil wird. (The article discusses the scope and reference of occupational health and safety as set by legal standards and specifications. Firstly, we discuss the shifting boundaries of occupational health standards with special regard to the historical development of labour related negotiations. Secondly, we identify the boundaries separating different groups of employees. Through the examples of in-patient and home care, we show that these boundaries are established through the exclusion of temporary staff and contract workers from established safety standards. As a consequence, the article argues that many precarious workers with individual diminished power resources are subject to limited levels of occupational health and safety.)
Q02|Entgrenzung von Organisation und Arbeit? Interorganisationale Fragmentierung als Herausforderung für Arbeitsrecht, Management und Mitbestimmung. Einleitung zum Schwerpunktheft|Die Artikel des Schwerpunktheftes setzen an verschiedenen inhaltlichen Dimensionen und Ebenen dieser Fragmentierung an: Auf der Arbeitsebene ist der Beitrag von Gabriele Fassauer und Silke Geithner angesiedelt, der die inner-organisatorische Bewaeltigung von Co-Konfiguration durch Auftragsmanager behandelt. Auf Basis der Taetigkeitstheorie beleuchten die Autorinnen die Co-Konfiguration zwischen Kunden und Produzenten, indem sie die Grenzarbeit von Auftragsmanagern im Zentrum interorganisationaler Leistungserstellung sichtbar machen, um den Anforderungen von Kunden, Zulieferern und den unternehmensinternen Arbeitsgruppen gerecht zu werden. Die Mitbestimmungspraxis von Betriebsraeten im Umgang mit quasi-externalisierter Arbeit ist Gegenstand von gleich zwei Aufsaetzen mit je unterschiedlicher Blickrichtung. Der Artikel von Markus Hertwig, Johannes Kirsch und Carsten Wirth zielt auf die Erkundung des Umgangs des Betriebsrats mit Onsite-Werkvertraegen in strukturationstheoretischer Perspektive. Fuer die Ernaehrungs- und Getraenkeindustrie zeigen sie verschiedene Praktiken auf, die in verschiedenen Typen des Umgangs von Betriebsraeten mit Onsite-Werkvertraegen verdichtet werden, die zwischen Kooperation und Konfrontation, zwischen Ablehnung und Akzeptanz angesiedelt sind. Karina Becker thematisiert aus einer sozialkritischen Perspektive den Gesundheits- und Arbeitsschutz fuer Werkvertragsbeschaeftigte in der Pflege. Dabei interessiert sie sich insbesondere fuer die rechtlichen Sekundaermachtpotenziale der Betriebsraete sowie deren etwaige Verschiebungen innerhalb des Feldes des Arbeits- und Gesundheitsschutzes. Auf diese Weise wird die Reichweite staatlicher Mindestschutzvorschriften im Betrieb bzw. im Haushalt als Verhandlungsgegenstand der Mitbestimmung thematisiert. Auf der Mesoebene zwischen Organisationen und (arbeits-)rechtlichem Rahmen setzen Isabell Hensel, Jochen Koch, Eva Kocher und Anna Schwarz mit einer interdisziplinaeren Einordnung online vermittelter Arbeitsauftraege und Werke an. Sie deuten neue Formen der Arbeitserbringung („Crowdworking“) in ihrer Vielgestaltigkeit, d.h. auch und gerade hinsichtlich von Potenzialen, die jenseits einer allfaelligen Prekarisierung angesiedelt sein koennen. Hierbei greifen sie zum einen auf die Organisations- und Managementtheorie zurueck, zum anderen benutzen sie das Arbeitsrecht, um das Spektrum von Crowdworking in einem Regelkreis aus Autonomie und Kontrolle, Flexibilitaet und Stabilitaet zu ordnen. Auf der Makroebene diskutiert Andreas Buecker die Regulierung der multipolaren Arbeitsbeziehungen und insbesondere des sog. drittbezogenen Personaleinsatzes, indem er bestehende Quellen des Arbeitsrechts (AEntG, MiloG, ArbSchG, BetrVG) auf Anwendbarkeit prueft, um regulative Luecken zu praezisieren. Zugleich thematisiert er die Rolle von Leitbildern im Diskurs der Rechtsfortbildung. Im Ergebnis argumentiert er fuer eine Fortentwicklung des Arbeitsrechts, um ueber den klassischen bipolaren Arbeitnehmerbegriff hinaus auch mehrpolige Rechtsbeziehungen erfassen zu koennen und die Betroffenen nicht schutzlos zu stellen. Hieran knuepfen zwei Debattenbeitraege an, um die derzeitige Konstruktion des Arbeitsrechts auf den Pruefstand zu stellen. Ebenso wie Buecker setzen sowohl Christiane Brors als auch Wolfgang Daeubler am grundsaetzlich bestehenden sozialen Schutzbedarf in mehrpoligen Arbeitsbeziehungen an, blicken aber gleichsam etwas optimistischer in die Zukunft. Brors haelt das zweipolige Arbeitsverhaeltnis nach wie vor fuer den richtigen Anker, um den Schutz abhaengig Beschaeftigter zu gewaehrleisten und zeigt auf, dass bestehende Ansaetze, insbesondere im Rahmen des Rechts der Leiharbeit, ausbaufaehig sind. AEhnlich sieht es Daeubler, der gleichermassen im Arbeitsrecht wie im Recht der Selbststaendigen ausbaufaehige Konstruktionen sieht. Deutlich wird dabei aber, dass gerade im letzteren Bereich der Gesetzgeber gefragt sein koennte, ueber den Typus der arbeitnehmeraehnlichen Person den Schutz von Selbststaendigen zu verbessern. Darueber hinaus macht Daeubler deutlich, dass gerade beim Crowdsourcing ein Problem in der Internationalitaet der Rechtsbeziehung liegen koennte.
Q02|Strategies Based on Momentum and Term Structure in Financialized Commodity Markets|The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of the financialization of commodity markets on the profitability of strategies based on momentum and term structure. The performance of an array of portfolios from double-sorts on non-commercial traders’ participation, historical returns and term spreads are tested against a risk model. The analysis covers the listing of 26 commodities in the period 1986 – 2013. First and foremost, the paper provides a fresh evidence for the validity of strategies based on momentum and term structure investing in commodity markets. Secondly, it proves that term structure strategies generate significantly higher performance results in non-financialized markets. Moreover, it supports the thesis that market financialization adversely affects momentum profits. The results are important in terms of tactical and strategic asset allocation in commodity markets. They imply that investors who implement momentum or term structure based strategies should also consider the composition of market participants.
Q02|FDI in Central and Eastern Europeâ€™s (CEE) Agribusiness|Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) had adopted restricted industrialization policy until 1990. The economic and social transition started after 1990, providing free atmosphere for foreign investments in CEE. Due to such interference, the early eminent countries were replaced by new eminent ones. This article examines the affirmative as well as unimpressed role of foreign direct investment (FDI) in agribusiness in CEE during 1990sâ€“2000s. Like CEE, India was also a restricted economy until 1991. As a part of continuing reforms, India has recently allowed a bulk of FDI in agribusiness sectors which have prompted farmers and local industrialists to raise their voice against such decision. Agriculture, being a livelihood of major population, needs a better farmâ€“firm link through investment. Evidence from the CEE has proved many positive outcome of FDI. However, India cannot ignore some eccentric lessons from CEE.
Q02|Revisiting super-cycles in commodity prices|It is argued that business cycles have been moderating. However, there are a limited number of studies in the literature analyzing the cyclical behaviour of commodity prices in the last decades. This paper attempts to fill this gap by investigating the super-cycles in oil prices. In addition, interdependence between cycles in GDP and oil prices and co-movements between cycles in oil and other commodity prices are investigated. Results show that super-cycles in oil prices still exist and are not moderating. The last peak in long-term oil price was observed in 2012 and since then it has been on a downward trend.
Q02|Did the Fertilizer Cartel Cause the Food Crisis?|Food commodity prices escalated during the 2007/2008 food crisis, and have scarcely fallen since. We show that high fertilizer prices, driven by the formation of an international export cartel as well as high energy prices, explains the majority of the recent price spikes. In particular, we estimate the pure fertilizer cartel effect explains up to 50% of crisis food price increases. While population growth, biofuels, high energy prices and financial speculation doubtlessly put stress on food markets, our results help to understand the severity and sudden emergence of the crisis and suggest avenues to prevent its repetition.
Q02|The Heterogeneous Responses of the World Commodity Prices to Exchange Rate Shocks|We empirically investigate dynamic responses of 49 world commodity prices to exchange rate shocks using recursively identified vector autoregressive models. Our major empirical findings are as follows. First, price adjustments toward the new equilibrium tend to be gradual with a few exceptions. We propose two measures of price-stickiness that exhibit a high degree of short-run price rigidity in most commodities. Second, our dynamic elasticity analysis implies that commodity price responses are quite heterogeneous even in the long-run. Some commodity prices over-correct for the exchange rate shock, which implies higher volatility for those prices than the exchange rate. Third, for those commodities that over-react, domestic prices would rise significantly when the US dollar depreciates unexpectedly, perhaps suggesting a role for price stabilization policies.
Q02|Agricultural Supply Control: Lessons from the U.S. Dairy and Potato Industries|No abstract is available for this item.
Q02|Competitiveness Improvement Strategy of Soybean Commodity: Study of Food Security in East Java - Indonesia| The increase in soybean prices is caused by an imbalance between the ability to produce soybeans in the country and the increase in demand, so that scarcity of soybean is an issue in an agricultural country like Indonesia. The purpose of this study was to determine the mapping and competitiveness of soybean in East Java, as well as to find out alternative government policies to increase the fair competitiveness of soybean in East Java. Based on the results of the analysis, the recommendation on the most effective policy is the development of competitiveness of local soybean and maintaining the performance of the existing farmer groups, as well as the stabilization of local soybean prices.
Q02|What Drives Local Food Prices? Evidence from the Tanzanian Maize Market|We examine the drivers of monthly changes in maize prices across 18 Tanzanian markets. Local prices respond three to four times faster to the main regional market (Nairobi) than to the international benchmark (US Gulf). More importantly, shocks from Nairobi account for only one third of the explained variation in domestic prices; the remaining two-thirds is accounted for by domestic influences (including harvest cycles, weather shocks, and trade policies). Further, we show that remoteness and the local agroecology systematically influence the behavior of food prices.
Q02|A model-based economic assessment of future climate variability impacts on global agricultural markets| Climate change not only entails gradual changes, but also climate variability is predicted to increase. Extreme weather events are expected to affect food security, among other things because yield losses lead to rising food price volatility. We project the potential effect of heat-stress induced yield losses on food price volatility and global economic welfare. For this purpose we use a non-linear partial equilibrium trade model with which we assess global maize, rice, soy and wheat markets. Maize and rice are affected the most, with partially dramatic price volatility increases. In the case of soy, the increase is lower, but still considerable. For wheat, results are mixed. Depending on the scenario, price volatility slightly decreases or significantly increases. Consequences for global economic welfare also strongly depend on the scenario. Losses either increase moderately or they about double.
Q02|Food for the Stomach or Fuel for the Tank: What do Prices Tell Us?| The “food vs. fuel” debate has been difficult to resolve without letting the data speak. In this paper we investigate the short run interactions and the long-run equilibrium relationship between food and fuel prices. Results from cointegration analysis indicate a long-run equilibrium relationships between these prices. A closer examination of the price dynamics between ethanol and three food prices revealed that the corn-soybean linkage plays a key role in the fuel-food long-run relationship. Our results indicate that ethanol prices Granger cause corn prices, while no individual agricultural commodity appears to Granger cause ethanol prices. However, corn and soybean as a single group had a significant impact on the ethanol market.
Q02|Common Shocks, Uncommon Effects: Food Price Inflation across the EU| Against the backdrop of recent price spikes on world commodity markets, retail food inflation has varied considerably across EU Member States despite the existence of a range of common policies and, for some Member States, a common currency. In this paper, we investigate the extent and potential causes of the differences in the experience of food inflation through the lens of a single welldefined product chain in 11 EU Member States. Using a structural VAR framework, we find that the contribution of world prices to the behaviour of retail bread prices shows significant differences across the EU Member States we cover. Differences in the functioning of the food sector (particularly barriers to competition and vertical control) appear to be correlated with the role played world prices, highlighting the importance of such structural features in commodity price transmission.
Q02|Cliamte Variability and Agricultural Price volatility: the case of corn and soybeans| Many studies have analysed agricultural market instability under different perspectives, but little attention has been given to the effect of climate oscillations on agricultural price volatility. Climate variability, and in particular the extreme events, can alter agricultural yields and stocks, causing relevant effects on prices. In this paper we used a Volatility Impulse Response Function (VIRF) from a multivariate GARCH model (Hafner and Herwartz, 2006) to investigate the effects of climate shocks variability (El Niño/Southern Oscillation - ENSO) on corn and soybeans prices volatility from 1960 to 2014. Results highlighted how extreme ENSO events influence price volatility with different dynamic between corn and soybeans.
Q02|Volatility Spillover between Water, Food and Energy| Water, food and energy are strongly interconnected. In this study we address this issue taking the lens of financial concerns to investigate the WFE relationship. Specifically, the aim of our paper is to analyze the volatility spillovres between indexes representing the financial component of WFE nexus. We use a multivariate GARCH model with daily data from November 2001 to May 2013. Water is proxy by equity index that represents the performance of the industry involved in water business both at global and local level. For the food and energy sectors we use two sub-indexes of S&P GF-Commodity Index. Our results highlight the existences of a financial nexus between WFE that is particular exacerbated during 2008 crisis. Evidence therefore suggests the need to better investigate the policy options that can be used to reduce price volatility in a framework of a rising relevance of water issues within the nexus.
Q02|Explaining the German hog price cycle: A nonlinear dynamics approach| We investigated German hog-price dynamics with an innovative ‘diagnostic’ modeling approach. Hog-price cycles are conventionally modeled stochastically—most recently as randomly-shifting sinusoidal oscillations. Alternatively, we applied nonlinear time series analysis to empirically reconstruct a deterministic, low-dimensional, and nonlinear attractor from observed hog prices. We next formulated a structural (explanatory) model of the pork industry to synthesize the empirical hog-price attractor. Model simulations demonstrate that low price-elasticity of demand contributes to aperiodic price cycling – a well know result – and further reveal two other important driving factors: investment irreversibility (caused by high specificity of technology), and liquidity-driven investment behavior of German farmers.
Q02|An Analysis Of The Relation Between Wine Consumption And Cultural Models| The paper describes the correlation among grape-bearing areas, grape production, wine production, wine consumption and population figure for various countries. Secondly, it explains the correlation among wine consumption, wine consumer expenditure and a country’s cultural model with reference to the population’s religion in some countries. The statistical method used in testing these connections was the Bravais-Pearson correlation coefficient. An additional analysis of the distribution of grape production, wine production, and wine consumption for the world’s top ten countries was made. Although wine consumption is banned by Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism, there are some Muslim, Buddhist and Hindu majority countries with a high level of wine consumption per capita. This high level is determined neither by the other religion population nor by foreign tourists, but rather by the way in which religion is understood and practiced by individuals.
Q02|Brazil’s Broiler Industry: Increasing Efficiency and Trade| Brazil’s broiler industry growth over the past fifteen years has led the country to become one of the world’s leaders in the industry. Between 1999 and 2014 Brazil’s broiler production increased from 5.5 million tons to 12.7 million tons, or 130 percent, propelling the country to become the world’s third largest producer after the United States and China. Exports have increased fivefold since 1999 with Brazil, in recent years, overtaking the United States as the world's largest chicken meat exporter. The very rapid and successful vertical integration in the poultry industry in Brazil has led to productivity growth, efficiency gains from vertical coordination, and lower production costs. We examine the costs, returns, and profitability of commercial broiler production in Brazil taking into account the country’s regional diversity in production, the size of operations, and the type of technology used.
Q02|Sustainability Certification and Palm Oil Smallholders’ Livelihood: A Comparison between Scheme Smallholders and Independent Smallholders in Indonesia| Most sustainability certifications in Indonesia are developed by Northern-based businesses and NGOs to regulate the production of agricultural commodities in the South. However, research still shows a lot of uncertainty about what sustainability certifications imply for the livelihood of smallholder farmers. Given these uncertainties, this paper explores the potential of certifications to improve the livelihood of smallholder farmers. To achieve this objective we developed an amended livelihood framework applied to an exploratory study of Indonesian smallholders who participate in the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Although access to markets and vulnerability are not improved through certification, indirect effects through organizational changes increase productivity. If certification schemes are weakly institutionalized, farmers will easily shift to a more profitable way of production. Further analysis is needed to discover the balance between the ethical aspects of certification while improving economic profitability for participating smallholders.
Q02|Modelo de Análise da Oferta de Exportação de Milho Brasileira: 2001 a 2012| This study aims to estimate the corn export supply function for Brazil from 2001 to 2012. For this analysis we developed a theoretical model estimated using the cointegration and vector error correction model (VEC). The variables used were: corn exports, international corn price, poultry slaughters, soybean prices and world GDP. The results obtained showed the existence of long-term relationship between the variables. The international corn price, poultry slaughters, soybean prices and world GDP had a significant impact on corn exports, showing signs as expected by the theoretical model. There was a positive impact on corn exports after an unanticipated shock in the soybean price and negative impact after a not anticipated shock the slaughter of poultry. In relation to the international price, it was found that a shock in this variable has a negative impact on corn exports. In order to assess the relationships between the domestic price and the international price of corn, there was the weak exogeneity test between the variables and it was found that, despite this market still does not have the Law of One Price, changes in the international corn price affect the domestic price.
Q02|Trends and Drivers of Crop Biomass Demand: Sub-Saharan Africa vs the Rest of the World| The global demand for crop biomass for both food and non-food use has markedly increased during the last decade. This recent trend was driven by population growth, income growth by consumers, industrial demand for non-food raw materials, and demand for energy in the form of crop biofuels. Consequently, relative price levels for plant biomass have intermittedly doubled since 2006. The aim of this study is identify and compare global drivers, trends and projections of this process, looking at biomass production, consumption and related resource use in Sub-Saharan Africa as opposed to the Rest of the World. Model-based quantitative projections of global crop biomass markets are reviewed and compared, and supplemented by own projections.
Q02|Modeling Indian Wheat and Rice Sector Policies| This paper serves to disentangle the complex system of Indian food policies, related to wheat and rice procurement, storage, distribution and trade. Using time series for national aggregate data, these policies are econometrically analyzed, next their implications for the markets are assessed and finally their fiscal costs are estimated. The study revealed strong impact of the policy measures on the production, procurement, stocks and trade. We detected several market distortions and mounting fiscal costs. Wheat and rice supply strongly and significantly responds to the minimum support price (MSP). Wholesale prices at planting or lagged harvest time prices are largely irrelevant for the production. The Food Cooperation of India’s (FCI) procurement volume is driven by the production level and the difference between the MSP and the market price. The signs of the estimated price elasticities of demand are consistent with the theory, however for rice they turned out to be insignificant. The negative income elasticity of rice consumption as well as the downward trend in rice consumption suggest changing habits and the inferior character of rice as a consumption good. The public stock analysis suggests higher storage losses for rice (10%) than for wheat (2%). Strong crowding out effects of the public stocks on private stocks and negative impact of export restrictions on private ending stocks was found. Total exports are highly distorted by the trade regulations, which whipped out the trade response to the price incentives. Starting from 2006/07, there is a clear upward trend in inflation adjusted costs of operating the public food procurement and distribution system, coming mostly from the rising procurement volume and the MSP. On the other hand, the revenues have declined in real terms, due to lower real central issue prices and only marginal revenues from the domestic sales and exports. As a result, the food subsidy has shown a permanent growth in real terms. The seasonal analysis of the intra-year data revealed strong seasonality of prices and procurement and stock levels, in particular for wheat (less for rice).
Q02|The Interdependence between Commodity-Price and GDP Cycles: A Frequency-Domain Approach|We study the interdependence between aggregate commodity prices and world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by performing two empirical exercises with long-run data that starts in the 19th Century. First, we compute long-term and medium-term cycles and measure their degree of synchronization for different leads and lags. Second, we perform causality tests on the frequency domain to understand better the nature of their interdependence. Our results show first, evidence of cycle synchronization only in the case of super cycles. Second, there is causality evidence from GDP to aggregate commodity prices mostly on long-run frequencies; therefore, commodity-price trends and super-cycles are demand driven. Third, there is some causality evidence between oil-prices and GDP on both causation directions. However, oil price fluctuations cause GDP on business-cycle frequencies only. Finally, in the case of metal prices, the evidence is unclear for both causality directions implying that they are not demand driven. Overall, our results show that the interdependence between commodity prices and GDP varies significantly across types of goods and fluctuation frequencies.
Q02|Towards recoupling? Assessing the global impact of a Chinese hard landing through trade and commodity price channels|China's rapid growth over the past decade has been one of the main drivers of the rise in mineral commodity demand and prices. While concerns about the sustainability of China's growth model are rising, we assess to what extent rebalancing through a hard landing in China would impact other countries. After reviewing the main arguments pointing to a hard landing scenario—historical rebalancing precedents, overinvestment, unsustainable debt trends and real estate bubble—we use a global VAR methodology adapted to conditional forecasting to simulate the impact of a Chinese hard landing. We model metal and oil markets separately to account for their different end‐use patterns and consumption intensity in China. According to our estimates, emerging economies would be hardest hit—with a 7.5% cumulated growth loss after 5 years—in particular in Emerging Asia and in commodity‐exporting regions such as Latin America. The “growth gap” between emerging and advanced economies would be considerably reduced, leading to partial recoupling. In the light of these results, both the “commodity supercycle” and sustained convergence observed in emerging economies over the past decade could be to a large extent attributed to the high and unbalanced growth pattern in China.
Q02|Oil and debt|The total debt of the oil and gas sector globally stands at roughly $2.5 trillion, two and a half times what it was at the end of 2006. The recent fall in the oil price represents a significant decline in the value of assets backing this debt, introducing a new element to price developments. In common with other episodes of retrenchment induced by rapid declines in asset values, greater leverage may have amplified the dynamics of the oil price decline. The high debt burden of the oil sector also complicates the assessment of the macroeconomic effects of the oil price decline because of its impact on capital expenditure and government budgets, and due to the interaction with a stronger dollar.
Q02|Institutional Framework Of The Seurop Classification System In Romania|The aim of this paper is to present the institutional framework developed by Romania in the process to implement the European Union legislation in the field of animal classification. It describes the organizations involved in the system, outlining their responsibilities related to various aspects of the sector. The results of the research are useful for other European Union candidate countries in their integration effort.
Q02|A joint affine model of commodity futures and US Treasury yields|We derive a general joint affine term structure model of US government bond yields and the convenience yields on physical commodities. We apply this framework separately to oil and gold. Our results show clear links between bond and commodity markets, since bond factors play a significant role in the pricing of the convenience yield term structure. Our framework allows us to decompose the term structure of futures prices into expectations of future spot prices and risk premia components. We estimate that the risk premium in oil futures has been negative over the 1980s and 1990s, and turned positive in the mid-2000s, consistent with a declining role for supply shocks in the oil market over this period. In contrast, we estimate that the gold risk premium is mostly positive throughout the sample period.
