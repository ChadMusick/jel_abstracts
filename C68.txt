C68|The Extended Perturbation Method: New Insights on the New Keynesian Model|This paper introduces the extended perturbation method, which improves upon standard perturbation by removing approximation errors under perfect foresight. For the New Keynesian model, we show that standard perturbation generates explosive sample paths because it does not account for the upper bound on inflation as implied by Calvo pricing. In contrast, extended perturbation generates stable dynamics as it enforces this bound. Extended perturbation also adds to existing evidence on downward nominal wage rigidities in the New Keynesian model, as we only find support for this friction when using standard perturbation but not when using the more accurate extended perturbation approximation.
C68|Modelling the Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Wales|This paper employs a computable general equilibrium (CGE) dynamic simulation model to analyse how Brexit is likely to impact the Welsh economy. The model simulates two potential future trade relationship scenarios between the United Kingdom (UK) and European Union (EU) for 29 March 2019: (a) No-deal Brexit, i.e. trading partners revert to World Trade Organization (WTO)rules; (b) Limited transition period and/or extension of Article 50. The model demonstrates how Welsh exports and imports, output, prices and employment are likely to be impacted from Brexit in the long-term. The scenarios modelled present a negative forecast for the Welsh (and UK) economy and industry, and show that the macroeconomic variables are sensitive to the policy disruption caused by Brexit. Projections show gross domestic product (GDP), GDP per capita, trade, investment and employment losses for the Welsh economy. A no-deal Brexit, which sees the UK reverting to trading with the EU on WTO terms, generates maximum losses for Wales (and the UK) in the long-term. In light of the results, it is important to avoid a no-deal Brexit that sees high losses and tariff barriers returning. A transition period arrangement or an extension to Article 50 also projects long-term losses for Wales. However, losses depend on the length of transition period and results show that a longer transition minimises losses for Wales (and the UK). From a policy perspective, a deal with an extended transition period should be agreed between the UK and EU as soon as possible to enable the continuation of existing EU-Wales trading arrangement.
C68|Search Complementarities, Aggregate Fluctuations, and Fiscal Policy|We develop a quantitative business cycle model with search complementarities in the inter-firm matching process that entails a multiplicity of equilibria. An active static equilibrium with strong joint venture formation, large output, and low unemployment can coexist with a passive static equilibrium with low joint venture formation, low output, and high unemployment. Changes in fundamentals move the system between the two static equilibria, generating large and persistent business cycle fluctuations. The volatility of shocks is important for the selection and duration of each static equilibrium. Sufficiently adverse shocks in periods of low macroeconomic volatility trigger severe and protracted downturns. The magnitude of government intervention is critical to foster economic recovery in the passive static equilibrium, while it plays a limited role in the active static equilibrium.
C68|Um modelo de equilíbrio computável incorporando o investimento inovativo|This study aimed to estimate the impact of R&D expenditures or subsidies, such as those revealed by the Survey of Innovation, on the Brazilian economy. The analysis based on general equilibrium approach (input-output and computable general equilibrium model) has the advantage of taking into account the sectoral interdependencies, in order to allow a systemic view of innovation and R & D expenditures on the Brazilian economy. The results show that R & D services are an important element of the economy's investment: 94% of the production of R & D services is used as investment, and only 6% as an intermediary input. Therefore, the impact of R & D occurs more intensely through investment and productivity channels than through multiplier effects on production.
C68|Trade Protectionism and US Manufacturing Employment|This paper uses a numerical global general equilibrium model to simulate the possible effects of US initiated trade protection measures on US manufacturing employment. The simulation results show that US trade protection measures do not increase but will instead reduce manufacturing employment, and US losses will further increase if trade partners take retaliatory measures. The mechanism is that although the substitution effects between domestic and foreign goods have positive impacts, the substitution effects between manufacturing and service sectors and the retaliatory effects both have negative influences, therefore the whole effect is that the US will lose manufacturing employment.
C68|The economic impact and efficiency of state and federal taxes in Australia|The Henry Review of Australia's Future Tax System (2009), made several recommendations to promote resilience, fairness, and prosperity via tax reform. Some of the key reforms suggested include a reduction in Australia's federally-imposed corporate income tax rate from 30 to 25 per cent; and the removal of property transfer duties levied by state governments. The review by Henry et al. (2009) utilised a long-run, comparative static computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Australian economy to study the tax system. Implicit within this framework is a single layer of government. In reality, Australia's state government levied tax rates differ across the eight states and territories; some, such as state land tax, health insurance and life insurance levies, are applied in a subset of states and territories only. A general lack of interstate coordination is evident in setting, developing and reforming Australian tax policy. In this paper, we present a meticulous and detailed analysis of Australia's state and federal tax system, using a bottom-up multi-regional CGE model of Australia's states and territories, called VURMTAX. The general framework underlying VURMTAX is similar to the Monash multi-regional forecasting (MMRF) model and its successor VURM; see Adams et al. (2015). A state/local government agent therefore operates within each region, with an overarching federal government agent operating across all state and territories. VURMTAX differs from MMRF/VURM in several ways. For example, we include new theory to model the interaction between Australia's corporate and personal tax system via full dividend imputation. This involves the introduction of two types of investment agents: foreign and local investors. In VURMTAX, the tax rate levied on corporate profits accruing to these two classes of investor differ, because only the domestic investor can claim franking credits. We also give careful consideration to industry-specific foreign capital ownership shares. This means the mining sector, for example, has a larger foreign capital ownership share than the economy-wide average in VURMTAX. We also modify the standard Klein-Rubin utility function that governs the consumption choices facing region-specific representative households in MMRF/VURM, to take account of important distortions in consumer choice caused by Australia's tax system. More specifically, we model the impact of housing tenure choice distortions introduced by owner-occupied housing exemptions in state land taxes and personal income tax, using a nested CES framework. The elasticity of substitution between rented and owner-occupied housing is then calibrated based on findings from an appropriately specified discrete choice model of housing tenure choice. We also alter the standard household decision theory to properly account for the impact of property transfer duties on the demand for the bundle of goods typically consumed by households or businesses when moving house or factory/office. We call this bundle of goods moving services. These services include real estate services contracted to sell a house/buy a property, legal services contracted to prepare necessary transfer forms, and public administration services that are demanded to formally update title office documents. We also account for the impact of motor vehicle taxes on transport modal choice by households. As such, when the motor vehicle registration duty is increased in VURMTAX, we allow for direct modal substitution between, e.g, road passenger transport (taxis), and private transport. Among other theoretical developments, we account for the impact of jurisdiction-specific payroll tax thresholds in Australia on the output levels of monopolistically competitive firms, which yields insights into whether a reduction in payroll tax rates or a rise in payroll tax thresholds are more effective means of stimulating a regional economy. We also embed within VURMTAX a detailed equation system to account for Australia's goods and services tax (GST). We apply this new theory to quantify: (i) the relative economic efficiency of unilateral state tax policy reforms in a single Australian state, New South Wales (NSW); (ii) the excess burden of Australia's three main federally-imposed taxes; and (iii) the broader macroeconomic, state and industry impacts of federal tax policy, and unilateral state tax policy, reforms. Our assessment of the relative efficiency of NSW state and Australian federal taxes yields a set of marginal and average excess burdens, which are summarised and discussed. In total, we calculate excess burdens for nineteen major Australian taxes, of which sixteen are levied at the state/local government level. In addition to our study of the allocative efficiency impacts of the various state and federal taxes, detailed long-run (21 years postreform) results are provided and described, to quantify the economic and industry effects of Australian tax policy reforms. With regard to state taxes, we find residential property transfer duties to be the most damaging of the state government levied taxes. More specifically, we derive a marginal excess burden for residential property transfer duties that exceeds 100 cents per dollar of revenue raised. Contrary to many past studies of Australia's tax system, we also derive a negative marginal excess burden for company tax in Australia. We compare and contrast this result to past studies, and elucidate some key differences in parameter assumptions and modelling methodology that drive this result.
C68|GTAP-MVH, A Model for Analysing the Worldwide Effects of Trade Policies in the Motor Vehicle Sector: Theory and Data|The Office of the Chief Economist in Global Affairs Canada (hereafter, the Office) is seeking to add to its tools for looking at the effects on Canada and other countries of higher U.S. protection. The Office is particularly interested in the motor vehicle sector. To meet the Office's requirements, we created a version of the GTAP model in which the motor vehicle sector is disaggregated. We call this version GTAP-MVH. This paper describes the process and data inputs though which we constructed a disaggregated motor vehicle sector for GTAP-MVH. The theory in standard GTAP assumes that capital is completely mobile between industries and that labor markets are characterized by either fixed real wages or completely flexible real wages that adjust to eliminate effects on aggregate employment from policy changes. These capital and labor assumptions limit the usefulness of standard GTAP as a tool for analyzing the short-run impacts of policy changes. We describe theoretical innovations to standard GTAP to enhance its depiction of both capital and labor markets. We also describe innovations in other areas, particularly in the treatments of: the accumulation by each region of foreign assets and liabilities; and the determination of savings, investment and rates of return.
C68|Creating a Disaggregated CGE Model for Trade Policy Analysis: GTAP-MVH|Thousands of economists spread across almost every country use the GTAP model to analyze trade policies including trade wars and trade agreements. GTAP has an impressive regional coverage (140 countries) but the standard commodity coverage (57 commodities/industries) can cause frustration when tariffs on narrowly defined products are being negotiated. This paper sets out a method for disaggregating commodities/industries in computable general equilibrium models such as GTAP and applies it to GTAP's motor vehicle sector. The method makes use of readily available highly disaggregated trade data supplemented by detailed input-output data where available and data from a variety of other sources such as commercial market reports.
C68|Integrating a Global Supply Chain Model With a Computable General Equilibrium Model|Global supply chain (GSC) trade results from decisions by firms producing final goods to allocate underlying tasks to dedicated facilities in different countries. These decisions create cross-border flows of products at various stages of completion. We demonstrate a divide-and-conquer approach to integrating GSC and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models: the models are solved separately and information is passed between them. A stylized integrated model suggests that by providing low-skilled jobs in developing countries, GSC trade accelerates the transfer of labour out of low-marginal-productivity agriculture in these countries into higher-marginal-productivity manufacturing. At the same time, GSC trade can leave high-income countries having to transfer considerable fractions of their workforce out of manufacturing and into services. After potentially expensive structural adjustment, high-income countries may be left in the long run with no more than a small equilibrium welfare gain or even a loss.
C68|The Economy-Wide Impact of Subsidy Reform: A CGE Analysis|Oil prices fell from around $US110 per barrel in 2014 to less than $US50 per barrel at the start of 2017. This put enormous pressure on government budgets within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. The focus of GCC economic policies quickly shifted to fiscal reform, including the removal of domestic subsidies on energy products. In this paper we use a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to investigate the economic impact of the gradual removal of subsidies on refined petroleum and electricity, with specific reference to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Our study shows that removing subsidies eliminates a large distortion in the economy. This improves the efficiency of resource use, so that even though employment and capital in most years fall relative to baseline levels, real GDP rises. In addition, we show that fully-funded compensation payments offset the increases in energy prices, leaving economic welfare of the Saudi-national population little affected. Removing the energy subsidies leads to an improvement in the net volume of trade, while leading to a mixed outcome for industries.

C68|When the U.S. catches a cold, Canada sneezes: a lower-bound tale told by deep learning|"The Canadian economy was not initially hit by the 2007-2009 Great Recession but ended up having a prolonged episode of the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal interest rates. To investigate the Canadian ELB experience, we build a ""baby"" ToTEM model -- a scaled-down version of the Terms of Trade Economic Model (ToTEM) of the Bank of Canada. Our model includes 49 nonlinear equations and 21 state variables. To solve such a high-dimensional model, we develop a projection deep learning algorithm -- a combination of unsupervised and supervised (deep) machine learning techniques. Our findings are as follows: The Canadian ELB episode was contaminated from abroad via large foreign demand shocks. Prolonged ELB episodes are easy to generate in open-economy models, unlike in closed-economy models. Nonlinearities associated with the ELB constraint have virtually no impact on the Canadian economy but other nonlinearities do, in particular, the degree of uncertainty and specific closing condition used to induce the model's stationarity."
C68|The effect of observables, functional specifications, model features and shocks on identification in linearized DSGE models|Both the investment adjustment costs parameters in Kim (2003) and the monetary policy rule parameters in An & Schorfheide (2007) are locally not identifiable. We show means to dissolve this theoretical lack of identification by looking at (1) the set of observed variables, (2) functional specifications (level vs. growth costs, output-gap definition), (3) model features (capital utilization, partial inflation indexation), and (4) additional shocks (investment-specific technology, preference). Moreover, we discuss the effect of these changes on the strength of parameter identification from a Bayesian point of view. Our results indicate that researchers should treat parameter identification as a model property, i.e. from a model building perspective.

C68|Stagnation vs singularity: The global implications of alternative productivity growth scenarios|Productivity growth has flat-lined in most economies despite rapid advances in technology. Economists suggest competing explanations for this paradox. Some argue the current stagnation will persist given deep structural challenges, arguing that recent technological advances are no match for those of the past. Others argue that the historical time-lag between technological advances and increased productivity means a productivity surge is just around the corner. The paper explores the implications of alternative productivity growth scenarios for the global economy, particularly for growth, labor markets and the flows of trade and capital. The paper explores the appropriate policy response under these alternative scenarios. It highlights the importance of productivity-enhancing reforms and the first-mover benefits that can flow to economies which move closer to the productivity frontier. It explores the factors that constrain an economy’s ability to reap the full benefits of any future productivity boom. It highlights the consequences of asymmetric increases in productivity across countries for both booming and non-booming economies and the role of monetary and fiscal policies, with particular warnings for the stability of the euro zone. Finally, it highlights the implications of asymmetric productivity changes across sectors and the importance of flexibility in labor, capital and product markets.
C68|The propagation of uncertainty shocks : Rotemberg vs. Calvo|This paper studies the effects of uncertainty shocks on economic activity, focusing on inflation. Using a VAR, I show that increased uncertainty has negative demand effects, reducing GDP and prices. I then consider standard New Keynesian models with Rotemberg-type and Calvo-type price rigidities. Despite the belief that the two schemes are equivalent, I show that they generate different dynamics in response to uncertainty shocks. In the Rotemberg model, uncertainty shocks decrease output and inflation, in line with the empirical results. By contrast, in the Calvo model, uncertainty shocks decrease output but raise inflation because of firms' precautionary pricing motive.
C68|Pension Reforms and Adverse Demographics: Options for the Czech Republic|This paper estimates changes in pensions and long-term financial sustainability of the Czech pension system in the light of population ageing, market imperfections or a potential economic downturn, and assesses feasibility of various parametric and structural reforms. To do so, it develops a bespoke OLG model with heterogeneous agents, bequests, productivity shocks, market imperfections, and realistic representation of three distinct types of pension systems calibrated using real-world data. Numerical results are obtained through computer simulations. The estimates show that a well-designed multi-pillar pension scheme provides good results in a number of performance indicators without leading to excessive costs of transition, whereas maintaining the current PAY-GO scheme would lead to a gradual decrease in real pensions, lower pension-to-wage ratios, higher budget deficits, or any combination thereof, unless the statutory retirement age increases beyond 67 years by 2050.

C68|An Analysis of Adaption Policies to Climate Change: Gdyn-W Model|This paper develops a dynamic CGE-Water (Gdyn-W) model to analyse the effectiveness of adaptation policies to climate change. In the model, water is introduced as an explicit primary factor of production used for irrigation purposes. For empirical analysis, we employ the latest GTAP database version 9 focusing on the South Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Our simulation results revel that the domestic production in all the countries under analysis decreases after the temperature rises by 1 °C until 2040. However, such production losses can be reduced greatly by the adaptation policy to climate change. The costs associated with such a policy are marginal compared to the overall benefits from such a policy.
C68|An attitude of complexity: thirteen essays on the nature and construction of reality under the challenge of Zeno's Paradox|This book is about the construction of reality.

C68|Real level of public investment: how to manage the inflation?|When the government collects a supplementary indirect tax on an output, the price of that output increases by consequence. Then, using the resulting revenue for public investments will lead to an underconsumption of the total revenue invested. This is due to an inflation that has been created by this mechanism. This paper investigates the determination of the net amount of investment projects taking into account the effect of inflation. We use the computable general equilibrium model to test our hypothesis. As result, we show that, some simulations are needed in order to reach the equilibrium.
C68|Search Complementarities, Aggregate Fluctuations and Fiscal Policy|This paper develops a model with search complementarities in the inter-firm matching process that entails two steady-state equilibria. An active equilibrium with strong partnership formation, large production, and low unemployment and a passive equilibrium with low partnership formation, low production, and high unemployment. Changes in fundamentals move the system between the two equilibria, generating large and persistent business cycle fluctuations. Suciently adverse shocks in periods of low macroeconomic volatility trigger severe and protracted downturns. The magnitude of government intervention is critical to foster economic recovery in the passive equilibrium while it plays a limited role in the active equilibrium. Fiscal policy has a non-monotonic effect on output in the passive equilibrium and the scal multiplier depends on the interplay between macroeconomic volatility and the magnitude of government spending.
C68|Agricultural Drought Impacts on Crops Sector and Adaptation Options in Mali: a Macroeconomic Computable General Equilibrium Analysis|In Mali’s current context where the crops sector is particularly exposed and vulnerable to agricultural drought, this study assesses the economy-wide impacts of such events and the potential effectiveness of some adaptation strategies. Using a dynamic computable general equilibrium model, we conduct counterfactual simulations of various scenarios accounting for different levels of intensity and frequency of droughts over a 15-year period. We first show how mild, moderate, and intense droughts currently experienced by the country affect its economic performances and considerably degrade its households’ welfare. We also show how these negative impacts could be aggravated in the future by the likely increased number of intense droughts threatened by global climate change. However, we finally show that there appears to be some room for Mali to manoeuvre in terms of drought-risk management policies, such as fostering the use of drought-tolerant crop varieties, improving drought early warning systems or extending irrigation capacities.
C68|SSP Long Run Scenarios for European NUTS2 Regions|In this paper we illustrate the development of a modeling framework aimed at producing detailed quantitative estimates for economic variables, consistent with Shared Socio-economic Pathways, and their assumptions about national income and population. Our model not only provides information on industrial production levels, employment, consumption patterns, trade flows and other macroeconomic variables, but disaggregates them further at the sub-national level, for European NUTS2 regions. Estimates are produced by an especially designed dynamic general equilibrium model (G-RDEM), augmented with a regional down-scaling module. The latter takes into account the different sectoral composition of the regional economies, their endowments of primary resources, as well as the possible existence of structural and agglomeration externalities. After describing the methodology, the paper presents an illustrative sample of results produced by the model, focusing on Italian regions and the Shared Socio-economic Pathway 1 in the period 2011-2051.
C68|Research for REGI Committee – Externalities of Cohesion Policy|The study investigates the effects of Cohesion Policy (CP) which occur in a country other than the one in which CP resources were actually spent. The study estimates that macroeconomic spillovers significantly contribute to the impact of CP. Spillovers directed to EU countries represent around 9% of the total annual CP expenditure. Other spillovers to Non-EU countries are around 8% of the CP expenditure. Macro and micro spillovers together arrive at 21% of the annual CP expenditure, 67% of which is distributed among EU countries. Around 20% of the CP expenditure can trigger sectoral spillover effects in the environment, transport and higher education sectors. The analysis demonstrates that externalities reinforce EU growth and competitiveness without CP deserting its convergence objective.
C68|Evaluating an old-age voluntary saving scheme under incomplete rationality|We provide ex ante welfare, fiscal and general macroeconomic evaluation of the voluntary old-age saving scheme recently introduced in Poland (Pracownicze Plany Kapita³owe, Employees’ Capital Plans). ECPs provide tax redemptions as well as lump-sum transfers with the objective to foster old-age savings. Reduction in capital income tax revenues and a rise in expenditure needs to be compensated through adjustment in other taxes. We employ an overlapping generations model (OLG) to gauge the plausible magnitude of the macroeconomic and welfare effects and provide insights in terms of microfoundations of these adjustments. Our OLG model features voluntary participation and innovates relative to the literature by introducing agents with hand-to-mouth preferences. We find relatively high crowding out of private savings. In our preferred specification roughly 0.08 to 0.09 PLN of each 1 PLN allocated to ECPs are actually new savings, the rest being displaced from unincentivized private voluntary savings. The plausible values of the effective capital growth range between 0.03 and 0.42 of 1 PLN in ECPs. ECPs reduce welfare of the fully rational agents, unless they offer a sufficiently large annuity. ECPs provide consumption smoothing and interest income to HTM agents.
C68|Beyond the business case for agricultural value chain development: An economywide approach applied to Egypt monitoring survey|This paper goes beyond the â€œbusinessâ€ case for agricultural value chain development and presents an economy-wide framework to make the â€œdevelopmentâ€ case. We show that there are several key transmission channels that determine the economy-wide impacts of promoting various value chains, including forward and backward economic linkages, price responses, and net employment effects. These impacts all matter for household incomes, poverty, and dietary diversity. Results for Egypt show that agricultural value chain development generates economy-wide growth as well as growth in the agri-food system, but the impacts on employment suggest that agricultural growth can create new (and better) jobs in and beyond the agri-food system, but not necessarily more jobs. The results also show that productivity-driven agricultural growth in all crops is pro-poor and improves nutrition. However, potential adverse effects of livestock-led growth show that growth acceleration in single sectors can be negative, highlighting the importance of a systems analysis or, in our case, an economy-wide analysis. It is clear that no single sub-sector is best at achieving all the development outcomes examined. Moreover, the ranking of value chains by their development outcomes differs across sub-national regions. As such, results from this paper may provide useful decision support for the government and its development partners to select value chains depending on their priority development outcomes.
C68|Tax Policies and Informality in South Africa|We use a micro-macro simulation model to evaluate the effects of labor income tax policies in South Africa. The country is characterized by a high unemployment rate while employment in the informal sector is relatively low. Our approach is based on the aggregation of the preferences of individuals who choose among (i) working in the formal sector,(ii) working in the informal sector, and (iii) not working. We quantify the effects of different tax policies on the individual's labor supply choices (formal/informal employment, work/leisure) and at the macro level (GDP, equilibrium wages, size of the informal sector, and unemployment rate). We further analyze the effects in terms of income distribution, poverty and inequality. We find that the introduction of a negative income tax system reduces inequality and poverty but, at the same time, discourages people from participating in the labor market and working in the formal sector and, consequently worsens the equitye efficiency trade-off. We find however that the equity-efficiency trade-off can be improved by introducing (i) a (revenue-neutral) tax system which combines a sufficiently high at rate (25%) and lump-sum transfer paid only to formal workers; (ii) an expansionary policy (a reduction in total taxes or an increase in public expenditures). Interestingly, even though they increase the informal sector, these reforms reduce inequality and poverty through a reduction in the level of unemployment.
C68|Geographic environmental Kuznets curves: The optimal growth linear-quadratic case|We solve a linear-quadratic model of a spatio-temporal economy using a polluting one-input technology. Space is continuous and heterogenous: locations di er in productivity, nature self-cleaning technology and environmental awareness. The unique link between locations is transboundary pollution which is modelled as a PDE di usion equation. The spatio-temporal functional is quadratic in local consumption and linear in pollution. Using a dynamic programming method adapted to our in nite dimensional setting, we solve the associated optimal pollution. We show that optimal emissions will decrease at given location if and only if local productivity is larger than a threshold which depends both on the local pollution absorption capacity and environmental awareness. Furthermore, we numerically explore the relationship between the spatial optimal distributions of production and (asymptotic) pollution in order to uncover possible (geographic) Environmental Kuznets Curve cases.
C68|Evaluating welfare and economic effects of raised fertility|In the context of the second demographic transition, many countries consider rising fertility through pro-family polices as a potentially viable solution to the fiscal pressure stemming from longevity. However, an increased number of births implies private and immediate costs, whereas the gains are not likely to surface until later and appear via internalizing the public benefits of younger and larger population. Hence, quantification of the net effects remains a challenge. We propose using an overlapping generations model with a rich family structure to quantify the effects of increased birth rates. We analyze the overall macroeconomic and welfare effects as well as the distribution of these effects across cohorts and study the sensitivity of the final effects to the assumed target value and path of increased fertility. We find that fiscal effects are positive but, even in the case of relatively large fertility increase, they are small. The sign and the size of both welfare and fiscal effects depend substantially on the patterns of increased fertility: if increased fertility occurs via lower childlessness, the fiscal effects are smaller and welfare effects are more likely to be negative than in the case of the intensive margin adjustments.

C68|FIDELIO 3 manual: Equations and data sources|"FIDELIO (Fully Interregional Dynamic Econometric Long-term Input-Output) is a multi-sectoral model developed by the unit B.5 of the Directorate General Joint Research Centre (JRC) â€” the circular economy and industrial leadership unit. Compared to neoclassical CGE models â€” which assume that the perfect flexibility of prices and quantities ensures the full use of the factors of production at all times â€” FIDELIO integrates some new-Keynesian features: consumption adjusts slowly to its optimal level according to an error correction model and wages do not clear the labour market. The assumptions that prices do not clear the markets and market ""imperfections"" exist generate the dynamics of the model that is solved sequentially (recursive dynamic). In addition, FIDELIO is an econometric model since the calibration of most of the behavioural parameters of the model (dynamic adjustment lags of prices and quantities, and elasticities) is based on econometric estimations.This technical report illustrates the third version of the FIDELIO model, FIDELIO 3. The changes introduced in the subsequent versions of the model have two main objectives. The first one is to increase the coverage of the model. The second one is to improve the efficiency and the capacity of the model to evaluate sustainable production and consumption policies. The aim of this report is twofold. First, it contains all the equations of the current version of the model; second, it illustrates the characteristics of the data used by FIDELIO 3."
C68|Horizon Europe: The RHOMOLO ex-ante assessment|In 2018 the European Commission has published its proposal for its future research and innovation (R&I) programme, Horizon Europe, a â‚¬100 billion programme that will succeed Horizon 2020.Horizon Europe is designed around three pillars: support researchers and projects (Open Science), pursue industrial leadership related to societal issues (Global challenges), and boost market-creating innovation (Open Innovation). The RHOMOLO dynamic CGE model has been used for policy simulations to estimate the economic impact of Horizon Europe. The analysis compares three alternative policy designs to a scenario without the policy: Continuation, in which Horizon Europe is implemented similarly to the previous Horizon 2020; Centralisation, in which the programme is reinforced by centralising at the EU level a third of the national competitive-based project funding; and Decentralisation, in which the programme is implemented at the national level. The RHOMOLO simulations suggest that Horizon Europe can contribute to higher aggregate GDP and employment, with considerable potential regional heterogeneity.

Out of the almost â‚¬650 million destined to Albania over the programming period 2014-2022, â‚¬44 are supporting competitiveness and innovation. Policy simulations using CGE modelling techniques show positive macro-economic effects of the IPA funds for competitiveness and innovation both in the short run and in the long run thanks to productivity improvements.
C68|Reducing tax compliance costs through corporate tax base harmonisation in the European Union|The reform proposal of the European Commission for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, the so-called CCCTB, is expected to significantly reduce the cost of doing business by lowering tax compliance costs for cross border operations within the European Union. However, to date the scarcity of comparable estimates on tax compliance costs has limited the assessment of such reduction. We exploit recently released and unique survey data designed to provide comparable information on corporate tax compliance costs in order to assess the impact of the CCCTB, using a general equilibrium modelling approach. Our results suggest that the reduction in tax compliance costs implied by the CCCTB would be associated with greater economic efficiency, including increases in both welfare and GDP. Member States resulting with the lowest compliance costs before the reform and having large inward foreign investment stock would benefit more from the CCCTB. Cross-border business operations would also benefit more from the CCCTB compared to domestic ones. The impact of the CCCTB on non-EU countries such as the US and Japan would be limited.
C68|The impact of the Grand Paris Express on the European regions: a RHOMOLO analysis|This technical report illustrates a simulation performed to assess the likely economic impact of the Grand Paris Express investments on the ÃŽle-de-France and the other European Union regions, under the working assumption of a combined 1% increase in labour productivity due to better matching between skill supply and demand and a 1% increase in accessibility due to the project. Our simulations suggest an overall medium-term positive GDP impact for the EU as a whole (0.18%), for France (0.79%) and for ÃŽle-de-France (2.61%).
C68|Mexican Migration to the United States: Selection, Assignment, and Welfare|This paper quanti fies the effects of Mexican migration to the United States on individual welfare along the continuous distribution of skills in both countries. We develop a model that focuses on the sorting of workers within and across national labor markets. Mexican workers self-select into migration, and then, within each country, all workers match with productivity-differentiated fi rms. Firms operate in monopolistically competitive international markets, which they can freely enter or exit. These features of the model ensure that workers with similar skills are substitutes and dissimilar workers are complements. Thus, migration redistributes welfare in the source and host country. In particular, the observed Mexican immigration to the United States depresses the wages of below-median local workers. However, the welfare losses in the United States are modest in scope: A $1.70 per day lump-sum tax on Mexican immigrants is sufficient to fi nance a compensating transfer for all U.S. citizens.
C68|Behavioral characteristics of applied general equilibrium models with variable elasticity of substitution between varieties from different sources|This study explores the behavioral characteristics of the Melitz-type heterogeneous and the Krugman-type homogeneous firm models that endogenize substitution elasticity as an increasing function of the total number of varieties that are available in each destination country/region. Using a case the United States (US) liberalizes imports of manufactured products from China as an example, simulation experiments with a three-region, three-sector applied general equilibrium model of global trade revealed that economic agents comply with more inefficient circumstances when the importer's preference for variety intensifies. Whereas, a more efficient environment enables countries, including those excluded from a free trade agreement, to receive welfare gains when the influence of the total number of varieties to the substitution elasticity becomes strong.
C68|Economic impacts of the US-China trade war on the asian economy : an applied analysis of IDE-GSM|In this paper, we try to estimate the economic impacts of the US–China trade war that began in 2018. We used IDE-GSM, a computational general equilibrium simulation model, to estimate the economic impacts of a “full-confrontation” scenario wherein both countries impose 25% additional tariffs on all goods imported from each other for three years 2019 onwards. In our calculation, the economic impact for the US is -0.4% and -0.6% for China. Some Asian countries actually benefit from the trade war. As far as it remains bilateral, the trade war is only an issue for the concerned parties. We also ran the US–world trade war scenario, wherein the US and all other countries impose a 25% additional tariff on all goods. The negative impact on the global economy is 1.7%, much greater than the 0.1% impact from the US–China trade war. Thus, it is clear that the world cannot afford to engage in a multilateral trade war.
C68|Welfare Gains from the Variety Growth|We estimate the variety gains of trade in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania following the fall of the iron curtain more than a quarter of a century ago. We apply the methodology of Feenstra (1994); Broda and Weinstein (2006); Ardelean and Lugovskyy (2010) and Soderbery (2015) to domestic and international trade data for the period 1988-1997. Although, there was a decline in the number of local varieties during this period, an increase in the number of import varieties from the EU more than outweighed this decline. The increasing variety of imported goods from EU countries substantially lowered the cost of living, resulting in welfare gains to consumers that range from 0.73% in Latvia to 1.28% of GDP per year in Estonia.
C68|The Impact of Fiscal Policy on Income Distribution in Tanzania: A Computable General Equilibrium Analysis|The Tanzanian government has established a goal to transform the country into a middle-income and semi-industrialized state by 2025. To promote this transformation, the government exempted the Value Added Tax on capital commodities in FY 2017-2018 as a way to promote utilization of these commodities by manufacturing industries and generate growth, employment, and increased incomes. This study analyzes the impact of a reduction in Value Added Tax on capital commodities (electricity, vehicles, machinery, and equipment) under two different closure rules: (1) fixed governmental expenditures and flexible governmental savings (2) flexible governmental expenditures and fixed governmental savings. Under the first regime, government savings declined and industries that depended heavily on government investments suffered. In the second, output increased for all industrial sectors, leading to a decrease in average unemployment. Real consumption increased for all but the richest household categories.
C68|Subvention du capital agricole des femmes et inÃ©galitÃ©s de genre au Burkina Faso|Sub-Saharan African countries have a strong presence of women in agriculture, but women have limited access to productive agricultural resources. This paper analyzes the potential impacts of a 30% subsidy on women's capital in agriculture in Burkina Faso. It makes use of a computable general equilibrium model. The results indicate that the modernization of agriculture frees the female labor force from agriculture to non-agricultural activities such as agribusiness, catering, and textiles. This leads to a fall in unemployment for women (-0.24%) than for men (-0.16%). In addition, the subsidy policy increases women's income (+ 0.33%) more than men's (+ 0.02%). Finally, the agricultural capital subsidy for women (men) is more effective in terms of reducing gender inequalities (GDP growth) respectively.
C68|Commodity Booms, Human Capital, and Economic Growth: An Application to Colombia|The idea that a trade-off exists between current levels of consumption and future levels of human capital is modeled. As shocks in international commodity prices affect income and modify the optimal consumption basket, household members adjust their time preferences between school and work. As a result, the dynamics of human-capital accumulation may be affected and, in cases in which commodity production and trade play a significant role in the economy, such dynamics may also have an impact on economic growth and the composition of economic sectors. Using a dynamic CGE model and Colombian macroeconomic data, we showed how shocks in commodity prices determined householdsâ€™ educational demands and, at the same time, the composition of the labor market.

This study evaluates the impact of large-scale water mobilization on macroenomic aggregates: agricultural production, employment, household income, and poverty. The dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model was used to set up a first scenario to examine the repercussions of an increase of groundwater production and another scenario on the effects of a growth of surface water supplies. The results, estimated over a period of 15 years, show transmission mechanisms according to the preferred types of investments. In both scenarios, we observe a significant improvement of agricultural production, economic growth, and agricultural household income. However, the effects are obviously more important with greater efforts to mobilize surface waters.

It contribution to GDP is estimated on average at 35%. In agricultural sector, 83% of women produce 75% of food production despite their limited access to land and productive resources. Faced to these constraints, the Government has adopted measures to improve the living conditions of rural women through their access to land and agricultural inputs in particular. Our study uses a static computable general equilibrium model to assess the macroeconomic and sectorial effects of these measures on women's employment and income. Results show that, increasing the supply of land, agricultural equipment, and reducing the cost of fertilizer contribute to food security, economic growth and improve living conditions of women through job creation and improved household income.
C68|Financing a Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff with a Tax on Carbon Dioxide Emissions: A Dynamic Multi-Sector General Equilibrium Analysis for Portugal|Renewable energy production subsidies alleviate the pressure on electricity prices associated with carbon and energy pricing policies in the process of decarbonization and electrification of the Portuguese economy. Our simulation results show that a feed in tariffs financed by a carbon tax leads to adverse macroeconomic as well as adverse and regressive distributional welfare effects. On the flip side, however, we show that use of the carbon tax revenues to finance a feed in tariff is an improvement over the simple carbon tax case along all the relevant policy dimensions. The feed in tariff mechanism when added to the carbon tax leads to better environmental outcomes at lower costs both in terms of the economic and social justice implications. The policy implications are clear. First, because of its adverse economic and distributional effects a carbon tax should not be used in isolation. The use of the revenues to finance a feed in tariff dominates the simple carbon tax case in all dimensions. Second, the search for the appropriate recycling mechanisms in addition to feed in tariffs is an issue as relevant as the carbon tax itself as it pertains to the potential reversal of the adverse effects of such a tax.
C68|Regulated Early Closures of Coal-Fired Power Plants and Tougher Energy Taxation on Electricity Production: Synergy or Rivalry?|This article examines the economic, budgetary, distributional and environmental impacts of the interaction between regulated early closure of coal-fired power plants and new energy taxation rules on fossil fuel-operated power plants using a multi-sector and multi-household dynamic general equilibrium model of the Portuguese economy. Simulation results show first that regulated early closures will lead to meaningful reductions in emissions. They will also induce significant detrimental macroeconomic and distributional effects. Second, when the new energy taxation rules are applied to the coal-operated power plants no significant environmental gains or macroeconomic or distributional losses are observed in addition to what already induced by the forced closures. Only the public sector seems to benefit in the form of additional tax revenues. A different situation occurs, however, if the operators of the coal-fired power plants react to the new energy taxes levied on them by unilaterally deciding to decommission their installations. In this case, although the environmental effects will improve, the adverse macroeconomic and distributional effects will substantially deteriorate. Noticeably, the adverse budgetary effects will also be substantially larger. Overall, we find no synergies between the two policies and, actually, the potential for the opposite to be true.
C68|Picking Our Environmental Battles: Removal of Harmful Subsidies or Carbon Taxation?|In this paper, we compare the effects of removing harmful fossil fuel subsidies with the replacement of the energy taxation by a carbon tax in Portugal. Since energy taxes focus on the energy content of the different energy products eliminating these provisions only brings their prices in line with their energy content. On the other hand, replacing the energy tax system with a tax on the emissions content of the energy products aligns the fossil fuel prices with their emissions content. We show that while replacing the energy with a carbon tax is a policy of a magnitude about eight times as large as the removal of the harmful subsidies, the effects of emissions are twenty times larger and the adverse economic and distributional effects only about twice as large. Accordingly, replacing the energy tax with a carbon tax is a much more cost-effective way of reducing emissions. This may suggest that focusing on the removal of harmful fossil fuel subsidies may be an environmental red herring.
C68|Financing Future Feed-in Tariffs from Currently Installed RES-E Generating Capacity|In this paper, we address the issue of how to finance the excess costs of electricity generation from currently installed renewable energy production capacity. We do so using a multi-sector and multi-household dynamic computable general equilibrium model of the Portuguese economy. We consider three issues: the effects of the existence of these excess-costs; the effects of annuitizing such costs; and, the effects of different financing mechanisms. Following the logic of the tariff deficit, we recommend the annuitizing of these excess costs. This strategy can be justified on distributional grounds. We also find that financing through carbon taxation is a better alternative than passing these excess costs through to electricity consumers in the form of higher future electricity prices. This is consistent with the idea that renewable electricity production is not an issue pertaining exclusively to the electricity market but rather a part of the national quest for decarbonization. Finally, we show that there is little reason from an environmental perspective to extend such preferential financing mechanisms to any future renewable capacity installation.
C68|Unemployment, Labor Mobility, and Climate Policy|We develop a computable general equilibrium model of the United States economy to study the unemployment effects of climate policy and the importance of cross-sectoral labor mobility. We consider two alternate extreme assumptions about labor mobility: either perfect mobility, as is assumed in much previous work, or perfect immobility. The effect of a $35 per ton carbon tax on aggregate unemployment is small and similar across the two labor mobility assumptions (0.2–0.3 percentage points). The effect on unemployment in fossil fuel sectors is much larger under the immobility assumption – a 30 percentage-point increase in the coal sector – suggesting that models omitting labor mobility frictions may greatly under-predict sectoral unemployment effects. Returning carbon tax revenue through labor tax cuts can dampen or even reverse negative impacts on unemployment, while command-and-control policies yield larger unemployment effects.
C68|Trade Protectionism and US Manufacturing Employment|This paper uses a numerical global general equilibrium model to simulate the possible effects of US initiated trade protection measures on US manufacturing employment. The simulation results show that US trade protection measures do not increase but will instead reduce manufacturing employment, and US losses will further increase if trade partners take retaliatory measures. The mechanism is that although the substitution effects between domestic and foreign goods have positive impacts, the substitution effects between manufacturing and service sectors and the retaliatory effects both have negative influences, therefore the whole effect is that the US will lose manufacturing employment.
C68|The Importance of Source-Side Effects for the Incidence of Single Sector Technology Mandates and Vintage Differentiated Regulation|Understanding the distribution of regulatory costs is key to evaluating whether a rulemaking exacerbates or ameliorates preexisting economic disparities and is of stated interest to many stakeholders and policy makers. Previous studies on the incidence of command-and-control environmental regulations have predominantly focused on the distribution of costs through final goods prices (the use side). However, the impact of regulations on household income (the source side) can be of first-order importance in determining the overall incidence. Using a detailed computable general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy we study the incidence of single-sector technology mandates across a broad set of industrial sectors. We find the use-side incidence is notably regressive but the source-side effects are progressive on average and tend to dominate the overall incidence of costs. This occurs as a significant share of regulatory costs is passed on through lower returns to capital and natural resources, which predominantly affects upper-income households, while indexed transfer payments partially shields the purchasing power of low-income households from increases in output prices. However, when the regulated sector predominantly produces final goods with inelastic demand and low trade exposure (e.g., utility services) we find that the use-side incidence can dominate leading to regressive distribution of regulatory costs. Finally, we find that the common practice of vintage differentiation, whereby only new sources of pollution are covered, can cause a significantly more regressive distribution of costs, all else equal.
C68|The potential economic impact of Brexit on Denmark|This paper provides estimates of the potential trade effects on exports and production at the sectoral level as well as GDP in Denmark of the exit of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU). Owing to the high uncertainty regarding the final Brexit deal between the EU and the UK, this paper assumes a worst case outcome where trade relations are governed by World Trade Organization (WTO) most favoured nation (MFN) rules. In doing so, it provides something close to an upper bound estimate of the potential negative economic impact. Any trade agreement that would result in a closer relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU than WTO rules reduces the negative impact.Under the worst case illustrative scenario assumed in this paper, Danish exports to the UK fall by 17%, total exports and GDP decline by 1.3% in the medium term. This effect is from the trade channel absent any change in foreign direct investment (FDI) or productivity. The fall in exports is concentrated in the Danish agri-food and machinery and equipment sectors, which account for half of the export reduction. Exports to the UK of agri-food and machinery and equipment fall by 24% and 17% respectively. Smaller manufacturing sectors such as wood and leather products, metals and textiles see falls of over 20% in their exports to the UK. The chemicals sector, which includes pharmaceuticals, comprises 9.5% of Danish exports to the UK and would experience an 18% reduction in its exports to the UK.Seven Danish sectors experience production declines of over 2.5% in the scenario. The largest decline is in the meat products sectors (7%), metals (3%), material manufacturing (2.3%) and other agri-food sectors (2.2%). These sectors would also see the largest declines in labour demand.
C68|Economic interactions between climate change and outdoor air pollution|Climate change and outdoor air pollution are two of the most challenging environmental issues that modern society faces. These challenges are strongly linked through their emission sources, the sectors they affect and the policies that can be implemented to reduce emissions. They also interact in the way they affect economic growth in the coming decades, although this aspect has been neglected in the literature. This paper presents the first global analysis of the joint economic consequences of climate change and outdoor air pollution to 2060, in the absence of new policies to address these challenges. A common methodology and a consistent modelling framework is used to specify the main economic interaction effects. While this paper provides a useful framework to analyse the interactions between two environmental issues in the economic system, the results need to be interpreted carefully, because of limited data availability.
C68|A cautionary note on the reliability of the online survey data – the case of Wage Indicator|We investigate the reliability of data from the Wage Indicator (WI), the largest online survey on earnings and working conditions. Comparing WI to nationally representative data sources for 17 countries reveals that participants of WI are not likely to have been representatively drawn from the respective populations. Previous literature has proposed to utilize weights based on inverse propensity scores, but this procedure was shown to leave reweighted WI samples different from the benchmark nationally representative data. We propose a novel procedure, building on covariate balancing propensity score, which achieves complete reweighting of the WI data, making it able to replicate the structure of nationally representative samples on observable characteristics. While rebalancing assures the match between WI and representative benchmark data sources, we show that the wage schedules remain different for a large group of countries. Using the example of a Mincerian wage regression, we find that in more than a third of the cases, our proposed novel reweighting assures that estimates obtained on WI data are not biased relative to nationally representative data. However, in the remaining 60% of the analyzed 95 datasets systematic differences in the estimated coefficients of the Mincerian wage regression between WI and nationally representative data persists even after reweighting. We provide some intuition about the reasons behind these biases. Notably, objective factors such as access to the Internet or richness appear to matter, but self-selection (on unobservable characteristics) among WI participants appears to constitute an important source of bias
C68|Geographic Environmental Kuznets Curves: The Optimal Growth Linear-Quadratic Case|We solve a linear-quadratic model of a spatio-temporal economy using a polluting one-input technology. Space is continuous and heterogenous: locations differ in productivity, nature self-cleaning technology and environmental awareness. The unique link between locations is transboundary pollution which is modelled as a PDE diffusion equation. The spatio-temporal functional is quadratic in local consumption and linear in pollution. Using a dynamic programming method adapted to our infinite dimensional setting, we solve the associated optimal control problem in closed-form and identify the asymptotic (optimal) spatial distribution of pollution. We show that optimal emissions will decrease at given location if and only if local productivity is larger than a threshold which depends both on the local pollution absorption capacity and environmental awareness. Furthermore, we numerically explore the relationship between the spatial optimal distributions of production and (asymptotic) pollution in order to uncover possible (geographic) Environmental Kuznets Curve cases.
C68|Recursive Equilibrium in Krusell and Smith (1998)|This paper combines the tools developed in two important and independent literatures - one on large economies started with Aumann (1964) and the other on dynamically incomplete markets, notably Duffie et al (1994)- to study Krusell and Smith’s incomplete markets economy with both idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks. It establishes the existence of sequential competitive equilibrium, generalized recursive equilibrium, recursive equilibrium with an extended-state space, and characterizes several important properties of the equilibrium variables. The equilibrium process admits an ergodic measure, which enables the application of the ergodic theorem for the simulation and calibration of the model. Without aggregate shocks, the existence and some characterization results carry over to economies with only idiosyncratic shocks such as Huggett (1997)’s economy. However, the existence of recursive equilibrium with the natural minimal state space in Krusell and Smith's economy remains elusive, as in finite-agent incomplete markets economies.
C68|The Fiscal and Welfare Consequences of the Price Indexation of Spanish Pensions|The 2013 Spanish Pension Reform, aimed at guaranteeing the nancial sustainability of the system, introduced, among other measures, the Pension Revaluation Index (PRI), which uncouples annual pension updates from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increases and makes the annual rise in all pensions conditional upon the system's revenue and expenditure being balanced, with ceilings and oors set in place. This automatic adjustment mechanism, however, has posed serious concerns about future pension adequacy, this being the degree of poverty alleviation and consumption smoothing that the pensions system provides to retirees, due to the expected large future reductions in the real value of the average pension. In this paper, we use a general equilibrium life cycle model, calibrated to micro and macro data in Spain, to study the scal and welfare consequences of three options for increasing pension generosity in Spain; (i) disability and minimum pensions are again fully indexed with the CPI; (ii) minimum and lower value pensions are fully indexed with the CPI; and (iii) returning to full price indexation of all Spanish pensions. While these three reforms increase, on average, pension adequacy, the tax increases needed to nance the higher future pension expenditure di er signi cantly. Moreover, most current cohorts prefer returning to the full price indexation of all Spanish pensions, but future cohorts prefer that only disability and minimum pensions be fully indexed with the CPI.
C68|National Policies for Global Emission Reductions: Effectiveness of Carbon Emission Reductions in International Supply Chains|In a world with diverging emission reduction targets, national climate policies might be ineffective in reducing consumption-based CO2 emissions (carbon footprints), i.e. emissions of final demand that are embodied across the whole supply chain, including international fractions. We analyse a set of different policies in three areas with particularly high consumption-based emissions in Austria: building construction, public health, and transport. To capture the substitution possibilities triggered by these policies and the induced emission reductions along the full global supply chain, our analysis combines a Computable General Equilibrium with a Multi-Regional Input-Output model. For construction of buildings we find that a carbon added tax is highly effective in reducing consumption-based emissions whereas an information obligation on vacant dwellings combined with a penalty payment when vacant buildings are not made available is ineffective because of reallocated investment capital. Mandatory energy efficiency improvements in public health and mobility are found equally effective in reducing consumption- and production-based emissions while a decarbonization of freight transport logistics stronger reduces production-based emissions. Overall, the effectiveness of policies, to mitigate consumption-based emissions, is therefore determined by the backward and forward linkages of the sector addressed by the policy as well as the substitution effects within final demand.
C68|How public adaptation to climate change affects the government budget: A model-based analysis for Austria in 2050| Public adaptation to climate change affects government budgets directly on the expenditure side, but budgets are also indirectly affected via a change in the tax base and a diversion of government consumption. While these indirect effects have been analyzed intensively for mitigation policies, a similarly detailed model-based analysis for adaptation policy is still missing. The present paper addresses this gap for the case of Austria in 2050 by (i) developing an adaptation expenditure pathway starting from current adaptation-relevant expenditures on programs and measures; (ii) analyzing the macroeconomic consequences thereof in a computable general equilibrium model; and (iii) assessing both direct and indirect effects on government revenues and expenditures. We find that public adaptation can lead to substantial positive macroeconomic effects on gross domestic product, welfare, and employment and that this effect is robust with respect to different assumptions on the effectiveness of adaptation measures. Despite the additional direct public expenses for adaptation, the overall government revenues, and therefore the budget balance, increase (relative to a climate change impact scenario without adaptation). These higher revenues trace back to reduced tax losses from less severe climate change impacts as well as higher labor tax revenues since soft and green adaptation measures stimulate employment. On the expenditure side, less expenditures on disaster relief and unemployment benefits enable increasing government consumption in other areas like health and education.
C68|The implications of climate change on Germany’s foreign trade: A global analysis of heat-related labour productivity losses| We investigate climate change impacts transferred via foreign trade to Germany, a country which is heavily engaged in international trade. Specifically, we look at temperature changes and the associated labour productivity losses at a global scale until 2050. We assess the effects on Germany’s imports and exports by means of a global Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. To address uncertainty, we account for two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2 and SSP3) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) using projections from five global climate models. We find that average annual labour productivity for high intensity work declines by up to 31% (38% with the higher emission scenario) in South-East Asia and the Middle East by 2050 (relative to a 2050 baseline without climate change). As a consequence, Germany’s imports from regions outside Europe are lower by up to 2.4%, while imports from within Europe partly compensate this reduction. Also Germany’s exports to regions outside Europe are lower but total exports increase slightly due to higher exports to EU regions. Germany’s GDP and welfare, however, are negatively affected with a loss of up to -0.41% and -0.46%, respectively. The results highlight that overall positive trade effects for Germany constitute a comparative improvement rather than an absolute gain with climate change.
C68|A Comparison of the Economics Impacts of Conditional and Unconditional Cash Transfers in Egypt|This paper uses a computable general equilibrium model to distinguish between the economy-wide impact of targeting conditional and unconditional cash transfer to Egyptian households following the full removal of subsidies. Analyzing the impact on the middle class whose vulnerability increased during the reform is another addition of this paper that makes an empirical contribution to the literature discussing the effectiveness of cash transfer compared to price subsidies. The STAGE model is calibrated on the Egyptian Social Accounting Matrix 2012/13. The results show that the removal of subsidies will have the largest negative impact on the consumption of middle class. Moreover, Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) maintains the best policy for mitigating the harmful effect of removing subsidies. It has a positive impact on the demand for labor in education and health sectors where the majority of labor is skilled males and semi-skilled females. Similarly, introducing CCT will boost production in health and education sectors.
C68|Income-generating Effects of Biofuel Policies: A Meta-analysis of the CGE Literature|While the production of biofuels has expanded in recent years, findings in the literature on its impact on economic growth and development remain contradictory. This paper presents a meta-analysis of computable general equilibrium (CGE) studies published between 2006 and 2017 on the effect of biofuel production on economic development worldwide. Using 30 CGE studies, we found that biofuel-supportive policies generated significant impacts on GDP and household incomes. CGE studies included in our database reported an average 0.25 percentage point increase in GDP and a 0.49 percentage point increase in household incomes. We also found that results were driven by several key features of the CGE studies included in our database. We investigated features such as biofuel type, geographic area, and characteristics of the CGE models employed. We found that biofuel expansion has heterogeneous effects in developed versus emerging countries. Simulations on longer time periods and in multi-country studies led to results that indicate higher impacts of biofuel expansion on GDP growth and household incomes. Moreover, simulations with an increase in agricultural productivity indicate positive welfare impact gains, unlike simulations with land expansion. Lastly, we found that biodiesel development leads to higher welfare impact gains than that of bioethanol.
C68|How shifting investment towards low-carbon sectors impacts employment: Three determinants under scrutiny|The threat of climate change requires redirecting investment towards low-carbon sectors, and this shift generates heated debates about its impact on employment. Many studies exist, most of which use CGE or Input-Output (IO) models. However, the economic mechanisms at play remain unclear. This paper disentangles the channels of job creation and studies to what extent the results of simpler IO models diverge from CGE results.
C68|The Changing Structure of Immigration to the OECD: What Welfare Effects on Member Countries?|Abstract We investigate the welfare implications of two pre-crisis immigration waves (1991–2000 and 2001–2010) and of the post-crisis wave (2011–2015) for OECD native citizens. To do so, we develop a general equilibrium model that accounts for the main channels of transmission of immigration shocks – the employment and wage effects, the fiscal effect and the market size effect – and for the interactions between them. We parameterize our model for 20 selected OECD member states. We find that the three waves induce positive effects on the real income of natives; however, the size of these gains varies considerably across countries and across skill groups. In relative terms, the post-crisis wave induces smaller welfare gains compared to the previous ones. This is due to the changing origin mix of immigrants, which translates into lower levels of human capital and smaller fiscal gains. With a few exceptions, differences across cohorts explain a tiny fraction of the highly persistent, cross-country heterogeneity in the economic benefits from immigration.
C68|When social goals meet economic goals: the double dividend of extending free access to healthcare in Uganda|In recent years, the need for a better access to health services has become a social objective in many sub-Saharan African countries that seek to achieve the Millennium Goals for Development. Yet such pursuits raise questions about the appropriate balance between the social goals and economic objectives of poverty reduction policies, such that measures promoting agricultural growth might appear as a more effective strategies. This article explores how an improvement of health subsidies policy in Uganda experiment might meet both these social and economic goals. Focusing on the relationship between farmers’ health and agricultural productivity, we use a computable general equilibrium model and a non-parametric micro-simulation model to predict the effect of this policy. The results show that it is likely to increase both households’ access to health care and growth processes. They also show that in a context marked by scarce budgetary resources, it is possible to maximise the impact of this policy by reallocating subsidies toward the categories of health care with the greatest impacts on workers’ productivity or toward rural households.
C68|A Forward Calibration Method for New Quantitative Trade Models|This article introduces an innovative and exible dynamic forward calibration method for disaggregated new quantitative trade models, particularly the Eaton and Kortum model, within a computable general equilibrium framework. The model is parameterized based on distinct, consistent future development scenario assumptions about EU climate policy, economic growth, energy efficiency, the electricity mix and structural change (sectoral shifts) derived through a complex scenario-creation process. The model equations and the scenario assumptions are implemented as side constraints of an optimization problem minimizing the difference between historical and targeted technology levels (sectoral productivities). This method is combined with input-output data disaggregation methods to separate Northwest Germany from the rest of Germany and to represent different power generation technologies. This setup enables the comparison of alternative regional sustainability-oriented long-term policy pathways. Despite the importance of the policy pathways envisaged by Northwest Germany's governments to society, they have limited macroeconomic effects in the simulations. In contrast, the future development scenario assumptions significantly affect European economies, particularly via the EU climate policy costs that drastically increase towards 2050. If Northwest Germany's energy transition fails, then its climate policy costs will increase extraordinarily.
C68|所得階層別一般均衡型世代重複シミュレーションモデルの開発|本稿の目的は、財政健全化や社会保障制度改革等の政策変更により家計が被る影響が、世代間のみならず世代内でどのような点で異なり、どのような点で類似しているのかなどについて分析を行うために資するよう、家計を生年だけではなく所得階層に区分し、同一世代内における家計の異質性を明示的に考慮した一般均衡型世代重複シミュレーションモデルの開発を行うことにある。あわせて、現在の財政スタンスが持続可能か否かについてシミュレーションし、世代別・所得階層別生涯純税負担率の推計を行った。その結果、現在の財政スタンスを継続した場合、2040年に政府債務残高比率が457％に達したところで限界が訪れ、2041年には消費税率の抜本的な引上げが必要になること、また、政府債務残高比率を457％に維持するだけにしても、現在の歳出構造が続くならば、長期的に30％の消費税率が必要なこと、さらに、世代別では高齢層ほど、世代内では所得階層の低いほど、生涯純税負担率が小さいことが明らかになった。, This paper primarily aims at explaining the structure and properties of the newly developed overlapping generation model with four types of households grouped by income levels based on the latest Japanese data. Along with detailed account of the model structure and data, the sensitivity analysis on the key parameters, which are not fully supported by empirical studies, are conducted. Regarding policy simulations, we examine the fiscal sustainability of Japan under the current levels of debt and fiscal policy. Key findings are as follows. First, the financial collapse defined as a convergence limit, appears in 2040 when the debt-GDP ratio reaches 457%, implying that a significant tax hike is required to sustain the economy. Second, 30% of the consumption tax rate is necessary to restrain levels of the debt-GDP ratio from exceeding 457%, if the current structure of government spending lasts in the long run. Third, the lifetime net tax burden rate varies among households. The rate tends to be higher as they are born later (younger), and as they are richer.
C68|消費増税を望むのは誰か？|本稿では、世代内の異質性を組み込んだ一般均衡型世代重複シミュレーションモデルを用いて、我が国財政の持続可能性を維持するために必要な財政再建について、消費増税か累進労働所得増税かという二択問題を想定し、効用基準と現行の投票制度を前提とした投票によって決定する場合の分析を行った。その結果、消費税増税への賛成者は、中年より若い世代の高所得層だけであり、財政当局が目論む財政再建策は実現不可能である。そこで、ベンサム型政府を想定し、財政再建開始年に生存するすべての国民の効用変化の総和を考慮した場合には、消費税が選択されると確認された。しかし、この結果は、もっぱら高所得層の利益のため他の所得階層に犠牲を強いるに等しい選択であり、公平性に適う選択であるかは疑問の余地が大きい。最後に、将来世代のなかでも、消費増税による財政再建のメリットが帰属する生年・所得階層を特定化するシミュレーションによれば、より高い所得階層に属する者ほど、また、より後に生まれる者ほど消費税の増税から得られる恩恵が大きいことが分かった。投票によっては、2137年生まれまでの将来世代を投票対象者に考慮しなければ消費増税による財政再建を実現できず、実質的に不可能であることが示された。, We calculate welfare changes to reveal Japan’s preferred tax hike option to achieve fiscal sustainability by an overlapping generation model with four types of households grouped by income levels based on the latest Japanese data. Households vote on preferred taxation, i.e. the consumption tax or the progressive income tax, according to respective welfare changes under the current election system. Following implications are delivered. First, the consumption tax option is chosen when voters consider temporary welfare changes alone, i.e. myopic, while the progressive income tax is chosen when voters consider life-long welfare changes, i.e. rational. Second, the consumption tax option is chosen under the Utilitarian-type government setting even when life-long welfare changes are considered. However, this choice results in net benefits among higher income households at the cost of lower income households, giving rise to worsening income distribution and unfairness. Third, the fiscal consolidation by the consumption tax option tends to bring net benefits to those with higher income, and to those born later. Finally, the government intention to raise the consumption tax further for fiscal consolidation will not be achieved by the current voting system with rational voters. To realize it through voting, it is necessary to give the right of voting to those who will be born before 2137.
C68|Inheritance Taxation and Wealth Effects on the Labor Supply of Heirs|Taxing bequests not only generates direct tax revenue, but can have a positive impact on the labor supply of heirs through wealth effects. This leads to an increase in future labor income tax revenue. How large is this effect? We use a state of the art life-cycle model that we calibrate to the German economy to answer this question. Our model successfully matches quasi-experimental evidence regarding the size of wealth effects on labor supply. Using this evidence directly for a back of the envelope calculation fails because (i) heirs anticipate the reduction in bequests through taxation and adjust their labor supply already prior to the actual act of bequeathing, and (ii) when bequest receipt is stochastic, even those who ex post end up not inheriting anything respond ex ante to a change in the expected size of bequests. We find that for each Euro of bequest tax revenue the government mechanically generates, it obtains an additional 9 Cents of labor income tax revenue (in net present value) through a higher labor supply of (non-)heirs.
C68|On welfare effects of increasing retirement age|We develop an OLG model with realistic assumptions about longevity to analyze the welfare effects of raising the retirement age. We look at a scenario where an economy has a pay-as-you-go defined benefit scheme and compare it to a scenario with defined contribution schemes (funded or notional). We show that, initially, in both types of pension system schemes the majority of welfare effects comes from adjustments in taxes and/or prices. After the transition period, welfare effects are predominantly generated by the preference for smoothing inherent in many widely used models. We also show that although incentives differ between defined benefit and defined contribution systems, the welfare effects are of comparable magnitude under both schemes. We provide an explanation for this counter-intuitive result.
C68|Inequality in an OLG economy with heterogeneous cohorts and pension systems|Abstract We analyze the consumption and wealth inequality in an OLG model with mandatory pension systems. Our framework features within-cohort heterogeneity of endowments and heterogeneity of preferences. We allow for population aging and gradual decline in TFP growth. We show four main results. First, increasing longevity translates to substantial increases in aggregate consumption inequality and wealth inequality. Second, a pension system reform from a defined benefit to a defined contribution works to reinforce consumption inequality and reduce wealth inequality. Third, minimum pension benefits are able to partially counteract an increase in inequality introduced by the defined contribution system, at a fiscal cost. Fourth the minimum pension benefit guarantee mostly addresses the sources of inequality which stem from differentiated endowments rather than those which stem from heterogeneous preferences.

C68|The Economic Benefits of Investing in Cultural Tourism: Evidence from the Colonial City of Santo Domingo|This paper draws together quantitative methodologies from environmental and tourism economics to develop a framework for evaluating investments in cultural tourism. Indirect and induced benefits of investment in cultural tourism contribute to the overall returns on investment and not including these considerations can result in a nontrivial undervaluation of returns. To illustrate the approach, the framework is applied to a hypothetical US$90 million investment in cultural tourism in the Colonial City of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. While there is an opportunity cost of allocating resources to cultural tourism, this paper demonstrates the costs of not doing so by considering a disinvestment in cultural tourism. Results of the analysisshow greater economic growth and household well-being with increased investment, with disinvestment generating significant negative consequences for economic output, employmentand terms of trade.
C68|Population Aging and Cross-Country Redistribution in Integrated Capital Markets|Population aging challenges the financing of social security systems in developed economies, as the share of the working age population declines. The resulting pressure on capital-labor ratios tends to push up factor prices and production. While European countries all face this challenge, the speed at which their populations are aging differs. If capital markets are integrated, differences in population aging may lead to cross-country spillovers, as investors freely seek the best returns on their capital. Using a multi-country overlapping-generations model covering 14 European Union countries, this paper quantifies spillovers and finds that capital market integration leads to redistribution across countries over the long run. It also shows that pension reforms can change the cross-country redistribution patterns, some countries losing from capital market integration without the reform but winning with it.
C68|Policy options to support the Agriculture Sector Growth and Transformation Strategy in Kenya: A CGE analysis|This report provides scientific evidences supporting the new Agriculture Sector Growth and Transformation Strategy in Kenya. A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model specifically modified for the context of Kenya is used to address the impacts of six policy changes. For the purpose of the study, a desegregated version of a 2014 Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) has been developed for Kenya. Multi-sectoral analytical tools are used to describe the Kenyan economy and inform about which agri-food value chains have the greatest impact in terms of output, employment and value added. Then, results of simulated policy changes are presented in this report, considering that a more careful analysis at regional and household type levels is required in order to draw robust policy recommendations.
C68|The third pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe: The RHOMOLO assessment|The Investment Plan for Europe aims at removing obstacles to investment, providing visibility and technical assistance to investment projects, and at making smarter use of financial resources. The Investment Plan is made up of three pillars: the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI); the European Investment Advisory Hub and the European Investment Project Portal; and the removal of regulatory barriers to investment. Policy simulations using the RHOMOLO dynamic CGE model show positive aggregate macro-economic effects of the EFSI. This Policy Insight contains the result of an additional set of RHOMOLO simulations aimed at quantifying the macroeconomic impact of the legislative proposals contained in the third pillar of the Investment Plan. The EU GDP is expected to be 1.5% higher by 2030 thanks to the removal of barriers to investment in the areas of the Capital Markets Union, the Single Market Strategy, the Digital Single Market, and the Energy Union. This entails the creation of about one million of jobs across the entire EU.
C68|Cohesion Policy 2007-2015: The RHOMOLO assessment|The European Cohesion Policy 2007-2015 was implemented in challenging times due to the economic and financial crisis and widespread cuts to public investment. Cohesion Policy has been used to reach objectives related to employment, R&D, energy sustainability, education, and poverty and social exclusion. Policy simulations using the RHOMOLO dynamic CGE model show positive macro-economic effects of the policy at the EU level, with significant differences between less developed regions, transition regions, and more developed ones. Cohesion Policy funds mainly targeted the less developed regions which received 60% of the total investments, while transition regions and more developed ones received 24% and 16% of the total, respectively. RHOMOLO simulations estimate the long-run GDP impact of Cohesion Policy to be equal to +0.7% at the EU level, with peaks in some less developed regions above +5%. The cumulative multipliers associated with the Cohesion Policy funds are above one in most EU regions by 2030.
C68|R&I and Low-carbon investment in Apulia, Italy: The RHOMOLO assessment|The European Cohesion Policy supports eleven thematic objectives. Four of these are key priorities for the European Regional Development Fund: Research and Innovation (R&I), Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), SME competitiveness, and Low-carbon economy. The European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) is supporting Apulia, Italy, with the design and implementation of Regional Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3). Quantitative tools such as the RHOMOLO model could help evaluate the impact of funding programmes in different policy areas across European regions. R&I and Low-Carbon ERDF Investments aim at generating sustainable growth and supporting the capacity of regional economies to innovate in line with the Energy Union strategy and the EU's transition to a low-carbon economy. Policy simulations using the RHOMOLO dynamic CGE model show positive macro-economic effects of the ERDF investments related to the R&I and Low-carbon thematic objectives in Apulia both within the region and in its neighbouring regions.
C68|The third pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe: An impact assessment using the RHOMOLO model|We evaluate the macroeconomic impact of the legislative proposals contained in the third pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe using the RHOMOLO modelling framework. In particular, we study a number of proposals related to the Capital Markets Union, the Single Market Strategy, the Digital Single Market, and the Energy Union. The likely economic effects of the removal of cross-country barriers to investment related to these four initiatives are positive and quantified to be on average equal to an increase of 1.5% of EU GDP by 2030. Such an impact would also entail the creation of about 1 million jobs.
C68|The impact of Cohesion Policy 2007-2015 in EU regions: Simulations with the RHOMOLO Interregional Dynamic General Equilibrium Model|In this paper we assess the system-wide economic impact of the key financial instruments adopted by the European Union for the implementation of the regional policy: The Structural funds and The Cohesion Funds. We take a bottom-up approach by aggregating the 86 categories of expenditures defined in the Structural and Cohesion Funds into six main policy variables. The outcomes of the simulations are the results of a combination of demand-and-supply-side shocks that are implemented into the RHOMOLO spatial and dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated on a set of inter-regional Social Accounting Matrices for the year 2010. In our analysis we document the direct, indirect, and general equilibrium effects of the EU regional policy at the regional, national, and EU level. In the short-run, our simulation exercise suggests a pronounced variegate patters across EU regions. In the long-run, a more homogenous spatial distribution is detected. Moreover, we identify and quantify the interregional spillover effects arising from trade links and capital mobility.
C68|The RHOMOLO economic impact assessment of the R&I and Low-Carbon ERDF Investment programme in Apulia, Italy|"In this note we present the economic impact assessment of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for thematic objectives TO1 ""Research and innovation"" and TO4 ""Low-carbon economy"" in the region of Apulia, Italy. The results are based on the RHOMOLO-IO demand multiplier analysis and on computer simulations with the multi-regional dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model RHOMOLO. The former approach is used to calculate the sector-specific output multipliers following a demand-side shock, while the CGE simulations provide evidence of significant spillover effects spreading beyond the Apulian borders and stimulating economic growth in other regions with significant trade links with Apulia. Our results suggest that a â‚¬536 million increase in demand for the Manufacturing & Construction sector would entail an increase in total value added of â‚¬329 million, which is roughly 0.46% of the regional GDP. The RHOMOLO simulations show that the effects of policy interventions reach their peak in the last years of ERDF programming period (2020-2022), when the absorption of investment funding is at its full potential. In 2022, T01 and T04 investments of the ERDF increase Apulian by 0.2% above the baseline GDP projections. Given the high import intensity of the region, only one fourth of the overall effect is driven by the direct investments and three fourths depend on the productivity improvements achieved as a result of the specific policy design. This demonstrates that the implementation of policies that are effective in raising productivity ensures long term economic benefits even in the absence of continuous funding."
C68|Impacto económico del empredimiento en una economía regional: el caso de Andalucía| Although traditionally entrepreneurship has been considered as one of the engines of economic activity, it has not been until recent years that public authorities have made a planned and organized effort to support the entrepreneurial initiative. However, even though many millions of euros are invested annually in this support, the effectiveness of such investment is rarely measured in terms of the impact of entrepreneurial activity on the economy. For this reason, in this paper we analyze the effect of this activity (entrepreneurship) on a regional economy and its impact on it. To do so, we develop a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model for the Andalusian economy for 2015, within a top-down approach. The model is based in the Andalusian Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) updated for the year 2015. A SAM is a statistical-accounting instrument that collects all the information of an economic system and, in addition, closes the circular flow of incomes, considering direct, indirect and induced effects. This gives an overview of the implications of the economic flows on the different sectors of activity and at the same time details and completes them. The SAM for Andalusia 2015 has a disaggregation level of 35 economic activities (27 productive sectors plus 8 endogenous accounts that include items such as capital, consumption, labor, investment, taxes, public sector and sector Exterior). In order to obtain the impact vector for the entrepreneurial activity, necessary to make the estimates for each one of the activity sector, the statistical official information available about business creation in Andalusia has been used. The results will show the effects on Gross domestic product, Productive Output and employment creation and its distribution by sectors of Activity.
C68|Endogenous retirement behavior of heterogeneous households under pension reforms|We propose a unified framework to measure the effects of different reforms of the pension system on retirement ages and macroeconomic indicators in the face of demographic change. A rich overlapping generations (OLG) model is built and endogenous retirement decisions are explicitly modeled within a public pension system. Heterogeneity with respect to consumption preferences, wage profiles, and survival rates is embedded in the model. Besides the expected direct effects of these reforms on the behavior of households, we observe that feedback effects do occur. Results suggest that individual retirement decisions are strongly influenced by numerous incentives produced by the pension system and macroeconomic variables, such as the statutory eligibility age, adjustment rates, the presence of a replacement rate, and interest rates. Those decisions, in turn, have several impacts on the macro-economy which can create feedback cycles working through equilibrium effects on interest rates and wages. Taken together, these reform scenarios have strong implications for the sustainability of pension systems. Because of the rich nature of our unified model framework, we are able to rank the reform proposals according to several individual and macroeconomic measures, thereby providing important support for policy recommendations on pension systems.
C68|Comparing applied general equilibrium and econometric estimates of the effect of an environmental policy shock|We treat the implementation of the carbon tax in British Columbia as a natural experiment and compare the results of econometric estimates of its effects to counterfactual experiments conducted using an applied general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Canadian economy. The comparison allows us to test the theory-driven predictions of the CGE model. It also allows us to test the identifcation strategy of our econometric model, using the CGE model to indicate under what circumstances general equilibrium policy responses might undermine our attempts at statistical inference. Ex post, we find statistically and economically signifcant effects on sectoral employment levels from the carbon tax --- with levels falling in the most carbon-intensive sectors and rising in the least carbon-intensive. Ex ante, we predict employment responses of very similar sign and magnitude to our econometric measurements (Pearson correlation coefficient of approximately 0.9). We find no evidence to suggest that our difference-in-difference estimator is likely to be undermined by general equilibrium effects in this policy setting. Finally, we explore the use of the econometric estimates to deepen the empirical content of the CGE model.
C68|A Practical Guide to Parallelization in Economics|This guide provides a practical introduction to parallel computing in economics. After a brief introduction to the basic ideas of parallelization, we show how to parallelize a prototypical application in economics using, on CPUs, Julia, Matlab, R, Python, C++ - OpenMP, Rcpp - OpenMP, and C++ - MPI, and, on GPUs, CUDA and OpenACC. We provide code that the user can download and fork, present comparative results, and explain the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We conclude with some additional remarks about alternative approaches.
C68|Understanding and Confronting Uncertainty: Revisions to UK Government Expenditure Plans|We develop a simple model that motivates fiscal stabilisation policy, in the presence of economic and control uncertainty. An examination of a real-time database of economic variables and forecasts shows that our knowledge of the current and future state of the economy is subject to significant revisions over time. Multi-year government spending plans are also significantly revised over successive fiscal events. We show the risk for any given government expenditure plan by constructing measures of historical expenditure revisions. We also show that the most significant factor in explaining public expenditure revisions are changes to the expected path of GDP growth. We illustrate how to model the components of public expenditure and are thus able to remark on the extent to which expenditure is warranted. Finally we report on findings from interviews with key policymakers in the past 25 years on how fiscal expenditure was managed and uncertainty confronted.
C68|Miracle or Mirage: What role can trade policies play in tackling global trade imbalances?|Global trade imbalances narrowed in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. They have remained at a lower level but are still of concern to policy makers because of the risks they pose to individual economies, as well as globally. However, the ultimate causes of these imbalances are not fully clear. Current account positions reflect the gap between national saving and investment, which are in turn affected by policy distortions, including in trade policy. Simulations of the OECD’s METRO model show liberalisation of existing trade distortions would modestly narrow aggregate trade imbalances in the medium term for some countries. Reducing tariffs, non-tariff measures and the combined market access and productivity-enhancing effects of pro-competitive measures in services all have some rebalancing potential. Liberalisation would also offer economically significant income gains for all countries. By contrast, narrowing trade imbalances using trade restrictions would come at disproportionately high economic costs for all countries.
C68|The Potential Macroeconomic and Sectoral Consequences of Brexit on Ireland|This paper provides estimates of the potential effects on exports, imports, production, factor demand and GDP in Ireland of an exit of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU), focusing on trade and FDI channels. Owing to the high uncertainty regarding the final trade agreement between the negotiating parties, the choice has been made to assume a worst-case outcome where trade relations between the United Kingdom and EU are governed by World Trade Organization (WTO) most favoured nation (MFN) rules. In doing so, it provides something close to an upper bound estimate of the negative economic impact taking into account the potential for some firms to relocate to Ireland. Any final trade agreement that would result in closer relationships between the United Kingdom and the EU could reduce this negative impact. The simulations use two large-scale models: a global macroeconomic model (NiGEM) and a general equilibrium trade model (METRO). These models are used to quantify, both at the macroeconomic and the sectoral level, two key channels through which Ireland would be affected: trade and foreign direct investment. The simulation results highlight that the negative effect on trade could result in Ireland's GDP falling by 1½ per cent in the medium-term and around 2½ per cent in the long-term. The impacts are highly heterogeneous across sectors. Agriculture, food, and some smaller manufacturing sectors experience the largest declines in total gross exports at over 15%. By contrast, financial services exports increase slightly. The modelling suggests that any positive offsetting impact to the trade shock from increased inward FDI to Ireland is likely to be modest.
C68|The potential economic impact of Brexit on the Netherlands|This paper provides estimates of the potential trade effects of an exit of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU) on exports and production at the sectoral level as well as GDP in the Netherlands. Owing to the high uncertainty regarding the final trade agreement between the negotiating parties, the choice has been made to assume a worst case outcome where trade relations between the United Kingdom and EU are governed by World Trade Organization (WTO) most favoured nation (MFN) rules. In doing so, it provides an upper bound estimate of the potential negative economic impact stemming from disruptions in trade. Any final trade agreement that would result in closer relationships between the United Kingdom and the EU could reduce this negative impact. Simulations using the METRO model suggest that from an increase in tariff and non-tariff measures (NTM’s) Dutch exports to the UK would fall by 17% and GDP declines by 0.7% in the medium term compared to baseline. This effect is from the trade channel absent any change in foreign direct investment (FDI) or productivity. The Dutch agri-food sector would experience a 22% fall in its UK exports. There are some sectors that gain from the export opportunities provided by Brexit, notably financial services and transport.
C68|The Macroeconomics of the Circular Economy Transition: A Critical Review of Modelling Approaches|This paper reviews the existing literature on modelling the macroeconomic consequences of the transition to a circular economy. It provides insights into the current state of the art on modelling policies to improve resource efficiency and the transition to a circular economy by examining 24 modelling-based assessments of a circular economy transition.
C68|Market Opening, Growth and Employment|What can further market integration contribute to growth and employment? A series of hypothetical trade reform scenarios explores what countries at different levels of development can expect to gain from reforming tariffs, non-tariff barriers, trade facilitation and domestic support to agriculture. Simulations of multilateral and regional trade agreements with the OECD METRO model show that positive effects are higher when more countries participate in trade integration because it broadens market opportunities, widens the range of products at lower prices, and reduces trade diversion. Smaller economies especially benefit. Firms in these economies can better specialise in international production networks as they have access to larger and more differentiated markets and also benefit from enhanced market access on the products they already produce. While trade integration boosts demand and lifts wages and factor returns, the required production adjustments also leads to reallocation of workers between sectors. The analysis highlights some of the distributional implications and emphasises the need for labour force adjustment policies to accompany trade integration.
C68|The Energy Efficiency Rebound Effect in General Equilibrium|We develop a stylized general equilibrium model to decompose the rebound effect of energy efficiency improvements into its partial and general equilibrium components. In our theoretical analysis, we identify key drivers of the general equilibrium rebound effect, including a composition channel, an energy price channel, a labor supply channel, and a growth channel. Based on numerical simulations with both the stylized model as well as a large-scale computable general equilibrium model of the global economy, we show that both general and partial equilibrium components of the rebound effect can be substantial. Our benchmark parameterization suggests a total rebound effect due to an exogenous energy efficiency improvement in the US manufacturing sector of 67% with roughly two-thirds occurring through the partial equilibrium rebound channel and the remaining one-third occurring through the general equilibrium rebound channel.
C68|Quantifying Disruptive Trade Policies|Mainstream economic wisdom favoring cooperative free trade is challenged by a wave of disruptive trade policies. In this paper, we provide quantitative evidence concerning the economic impacts of tariffs implemented by the United States in 2018 and the subsequent retaliations by partner countries. Our analysis builds on a multi-region multi-sector general-equilibrium simulation model of the global economy that includes an innovative monopolistic-competition structure of bilateral representative firms.
C68|Foreign aid shocks and macroeconomic adjustment mechanisms in WAEMU countries : an approach based on a computable general equilibrium model|This paper assesses consequences of foreign aid reduction on WAEMU economies and the various adjustment mechanisms that must be implemented internally to support this situation. Indeed, using a computable dynamic recursive general equilibrium model of Décaluwé et al., (2013) calibrated on each countries SAMs, results indicate that 30% decrease in foreign aid will affect government's saving, income and expenditures, and consequently public and private investment as well as the GDP growth rate. Offsetting this foreign aid drop through an adjustment of direct and indirect taxation leads to a slight decline in income, consumption and a deterioration of household welfare. Thus, overall, the results show that a drastic reduction of foreign aid in WAEMU countries will have more perverse repercussions in countries which are the most dependent on foreign aid. However, some economies such as Ivory Coast, Senegal and Burkina Faso would adjust more rapidly than those of other countries. One of the main contributions of this study is to provide economic policy makers in WAEMU countries with evidence of the possibility of budgetary arbitrage and fiscal adjustments for the financing of WAEMU countries economies facing a situation of partial or complete abolishment of foreign aid.
C68|CGE Microsimulation Analysis of Electricity Tariff Increases: The Case of South Africa|This paper analyses the economy-wide and distributional impacts of the increase in electricity tariff in the South African economy. Use is made of CGE-microsimulation to this end. The paper simulates both an actual price increase experienced in the economy and an increase linked to inflation. While the macro results show a negative impact on the economy in terms of a decrease in GDP, an increase in prices and an increase in unemployment, the micro results indicate that poverty, as measured by the headcount rate and poverty incidence curves, declines. This finding is similar to the finding by Boccanfuso et al. (2009) that when a significant proportion of households is connected to the grid, electricity sector reforms in the form of increasing tariffs to expand power generation can lead to poverty reduction.
C68|Impacts of Public Infrastructure Investment in South Africa: A SAM and CGE-Based Analysis of the Public Economic Sector|This paper assesses the general equilibrium impacts of public infrastructure investment in the South African economy by making use of complementary general equilibrium models, such as the social accounting matrix (SAM) multiplier, the Structural Path Analyses (SPA) and the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models. Both the SAM and CGE analyses indicate that increasing public economic infrastructure can be an effective way of stimulating the economy in a way that has a positive impact on labour. SPA shows that the main and most important path of influence is a direct influence of the public economic sector on each of the formal labour categories. However, because the public economic sector does not employ informal labour, this labour account is only connected indirectly via intermediate consumption of the construction sector output. This is an important outcome for South Africa, as the results suggest that an increase in public economic infrastructure could help address the problem of unemployment as well as that of low income levels that exacerbate poverty
C68|Impacts of Direct and Indirect Tax Reforms in Vietnam: A CGE Analysis|The study applies a multi-sector multi-household static computable general equilibrium (CGE) tax model to assess the economy-wide impacts of taxes in Vietnam. It examines two tax reform scenarios based on the tax reform plan proposed by the Vietnam Ministry of Finance. The first scenario is increasing the value-added tax (VAT) rate to 12% from the current 10% rate. The second scenario relates to setting a competitive corporate income tax (CIT) rate to the lowest rate in ASEAN (Associations of South East Asian Nations) countries by reducing it from 20% to 17%. Correction of current tax distortions will have positive impacts on labour supply, utility, consumption, output, and welfare of households as they reallocate resources from more to less productive sectors of the economy. The CGE model allows for the finding of the macroeconomic and sectoral effects on prices and outputs, as well as on welfare of households. While this study contributes to the literature on the CGE model for the Vietnam economy, it is a small step for finding the optimal tax structure in Vietnam. It recommends that the Vietnam government should increase the standard VAT rate to 12% and reduce CIT rate to 17% to shift the tax burden from capitalists to consumers.
C68|Removing Fossil Fuel Subsidies to Help the Poor|Phasing out energy subsidies may increase the price of energy and adversely affect the poor. However, the households may benefit from the redistribution of the revenue from this policy in the economy. Here, we investigate the impacts of phasing out energy subsidies and direct transfer of the policy revenue to households. Employing a Computable General Equilibrium model, we measure the impacts on labor-leisure choice and on labor supply. Considering the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke index and the Food Ratio Method, we construct several poverty indices: the Gini index, the ratio of none-food expenditures to food expenditure, the ratio of income of the richest decile to the poorest decile, and the ratio of income of the two richest deciles to the two poorest deciles. We analyze the effects of an increase in energy prices and direct transfer of revenues to the households in the Iranian economy. The findings suggest a considerable improvement in income distribution and a significant improvement in food to non-food ratio. The results also show an improvement in rural-urban income distribution.
C68|Export Boom and Economic Performance: Bolivia 2004-2015|The supercycle of high commodity prices has had profound impacts on the Bolivian economy. We have investigated the relations of commodity prices with the main indicators of macroeconomic performance. We have found significant ties in our statistical analysis. An important question that we address concerns the consequences of the transitory export boom on the long term rate of growth of the economy. Also, given the importance of fiscal linkages with windfall income, we examined the procyclality of public expenditures based on an analysis of correlations of the cyclical components. We find positive but weak correlations. With export booms, consumption increases but also saving rates. Savings have been invested in foreign assets and, to a large extent, in construction. We find that commodity prices and per capita value added in the construction sector are co-integrated, suggesting a long term relationship. Also we looked into the real linkages of the hydrocarbons sector with other sectors of the economy through an Input-Output analysis. Finally, we have conducted a set of simulations, with a small Computable General Equilibrium Model adapted to the Bolivian conditions, to trace the domestic price and quantity effects of the commodity price increases.
C68|ECIO Model Operators Guide|The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL)/ West Virginia University (WVU) Econometric Input-Output (ECIO) model is a time-series enabled hybrid econometric input-output (IO) model that combines the capabilities of econometric modeling with the strengths of IO modeling. The model was developed and designed specifically for estimating the income and employment impacts of the development and deployment of new energy technologies over a given forecast period. The ECIO model consists of a macroeconomic econometric model of the United States (U.S.) national economy and an inter-industry model that reflects the interdependence of all the industries in the economy. These two components have three modules and several sub-modules of interrelated equations for the U.S. economy, with employment and income detail for 32 industrial sectors. This document is designed to escort a user with little computing or programing experience through the processes of setting up the ECIO model application to run on a personal computer (PC). The document will guide user through the various stages of the ECIO model with screenshots and instructions. Using this guide and standardized input data files (in .csv format) that are generated by the NETL NEMS-ECIO Translation Tool, users should be able run the model to generate estimates of deployment scenario impacts.
C68|A Real-Business-Cycle model with pollution and environmental taxation: the case of Bulgaria|"We introduce an environmental dimension into a real-business-cycle model augmented with a detailed government sector. We calibrate the model to Bulgarian data for the period following the introduction of the currency board arrangement (1999-2016). We investigate the quantitative importance of utility-enhancing environmental quality, and the mechanics of an ""environmental"" output tax levied on the polluting firm's output, as well as the effect of government spending on pollution abatement over the cycle. In particular, a positive shock to pollution emission in the model works like a positive technological shock, but its effect is quantitatively very small. Overall, the model performs relatively well when evaluated against data, but less so along the environmental dimension, so more research is needed to understand the aggregate effects of pollution."
C68|Mobility in Cities: Distributional Impact Analysis of Transportation Improvement in SÃ£o Paulo Metropolitan Region|This paper evaluates the impacts of transportation investments/policies using a spatial computable general equilibrium (SCGE) model integrated to a travel demand model. In order to enhance our understanding of the distributional impacts of transportation improvements in Brazilian cities, we simulate the impact of different types of mobility investments in the SÃ£o Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR). To explore further the income effects of infrastructure investments, we also conduct microsimulation exercises integrated to the SCGE results. We look at 10 different scenarios, ranging from a series of infrastructure-related interventions â€“ considering the expansion of the mass-transit public transportation network â€“ to policies that focus on monetary disincentives to the use of cars. The simulations results suggest trade-offs between efficiency and equity.
C68|The economic impacts of UK trade-enhancing industrial policies and their spillover effects on the energy system|The wider impacts of energy policy on the macro-economy are increasingly recognised in the academic and policy-oriented literatures. Additionally, the interdependence of energy and economy implies that a (policy) change in the non-energy system impacts on the energy system. However, such spillovers on the energy system have not been extensively researched. We begin by analysing the impacts of export promotion policies - a key element of the UKâ€™s Industrial Strategy - on the energy system and energy policy goals. As the impacts of such policies are, in large part, transmitted via their effects on the economy, we adopt a computable general equilibrium model - UK-ENVI - that fully captures such interdependence. Our results suggest that an across-the-board stimulus to exports increases total energy use significantly. This does not come directly through energy exports, but indirectly through the energy sectorsâ€™ linkages to other sectors. Export led growth therefore impacts on energy use - and significantly so. This in turn is likely to have an adverse impact on emission targets. Policy makers should be aware of the fact that a successful implementation of the Industrial Strategy may create significant tensions with the UKâ€™s Clean Growth Strategy, for example, and with the goals of energy policy more generally. The importance of this effect will in practice depend upon: the mix of goods and services that are exported (an issue that we shall address once the export strategy is published); the success of low-carbon policies. Ultimately, a knowledge of the nature and scale of these spillover effects of economic policies on the energy system creates the potential for more effective and efficient policy making.
C68|Can vehicle efficiency beat fuel efficiency in cutting fuel use|This paper demonstrates the importance of considering both energy and non-energy efficiency improvements in the provision of energy intensive household services. Using the example of private transport, we analyse whether vehicle efficiency can beat fuel efficiency in cutting fuel use. We find that this ultimately depend on the elasticity of demand for transport, the substitutability between vehicles and fuels and the initial share of fuel use in private transport. The framework also allows to identify Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmultiple benefitsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of technical progress in private transport by considering both the ability of such policy to reduce fuel demand and to increase the consumerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surplus. We extend the partial equilibrium framework by using computable general equilibrium (CGE) simulations to identify the system-wide impacts on total fuel use of the two alternative efficiency changes. Simulation results suggest that the substitution effects identified in the partial equilibrium analysis are an important element in determining the change in total fuel use resulting from these consumption efficiency changes. However, the identification of associated changes in intermediate fuel demand, plus the potential expansionary effects of the improvements in household efficiency transmitted through the labour market can generate general equilibrium effects that vary substantially from those derived using partial equilibrium analysis.
C68|The importance of energy price stickiness and real wage inflexibility for the time paths of rebound effects|There has been some controversy over the relative sizes of the short- and long-run rebound effects associated with energy efficiency improvements. Theoretical analysis by Wei (2007) and Saunders implied that the rebound effects would always be greater in the long-run than in the short-run. However, Allan et al (2007) and Turner (2009) found evidence from Computable General Equilibrium simulations that contradicted this result. In this paper we systematically explore the impact of energy price stickiness and real wage inflexibility for the evolution of rebound effects. We find that: the degree of energy price, but not wage, stickiness is an important determinant of the time path of rebound effects and of its relative size in the short- and long-runs; and that there is considerable variation in the scale of rebound effects through time, even where short-run rebound effects are lower than in the long-run. However, the most significant finding overall is that rebound reflects the system-wide interaction between energy producing and energy using sectors.
C68|Towards incorporating natural capital into a computable general equilibrium model for Scotland|Natural capital encompasses those assets which are provided by nature and which are valued by economic actors. As such, there is a clear analogy between natural and other assets, such as physical capital, which are routinely included in models of national economies. However, the valuation of natural assets, to the extent that they are included in such economic models, is typically wrapped up in physical capital along with land values or not valued at all. This could be simply a measurement problem - natural capital might be difficult to appropriately disaggregate from other capital - or because they provide non-market goods which are not included within traditional measures of economic output. The purpose of this paper is to set out - both conceptually and practically - how natural capital can be added to a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. We focus on: the conceptual differences that should be reflected in such an extension; the challenges of implementing the extension in practice; and identifying the value added generated by an appropriately augmented model. We explore the empirical implementation of our approach through the addition of carbon emissions and an agricultural biomass ecosystem service flow to our CGE model of the Scottish economy. This working paper specifies this CGE model development, but does not go as far as fully implementing it in the CGE model. When fully implemented in the context of a CGE with a disaggregated agriculture sector, this will allow us simultaneously to track the impact of disturbances, including policy changes, on the economy and the environment and therefore on sustainable development. In the longer-term comprehensive coverage of natural capital stocks and ecosystem services will allow us to track the impact of disturbances, including policy interventions, on Green GDP and Genuine Savings, as well as on aggregate and sectoral economic activity, energy use and emissions.

C68|The economic impacts of UK fiscal policies and their spillover effects on the energy system|The energy system and the economy are inextricably intertwined. While this interdependence is, of course, widely recognised, it has not featured prominently in assessing the likely impact of economic policies. In principle, broad fiscal policies are likely to have a significant influence on key elements of the energy system, the neglect of which may lead to inefficiencies in the design of appropriate energy and economic policies. The importance of this in practice depends on the strength of the spillover effects from fiscal policy instruments to energy policy goals. This is the focus of this paper. We employ a multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium (CGE) approach for the UK which allows us to track the impact of key fiscal policy interventions on key goals of economic and energy policies. Overall, our results suggest that a double dividend - a simultaneous stimulus to the economy and a reduction in emissions â€“ induced by an increase in current public spending or a hike in the income tax rate seem unlikely in the UK context. Nonetheless, there are undoubted differential spillover effects on key components of the energy system from tax and public spending interventions that may prove capable of being exploited through the coordination of fiscal and energy policies. Even if it seems doubtful that fiscal policies would be formulated with a view to improved coordination with energy policies, policymakers should at least be aware of likely direction and scale of fiscal spillover effects to the energy system.
C68|Equilibrium in the Assignment Market under Budget Constraints|We reexamine the well-known assignment market model in a more general and more practical environment where agents may be financially constrained. These constraints will be shown to have an important impact on the set of Walrasian equilibria. We prove that a price adjustment process will either find a unique minimal Walrasian equilibrium price vector, or exclusively validate the nonexistence of equilibrium
C68|Sustainable and Equitable Pensions with Means Testing in Aging Economies|A means-tested pension system has a distinct feature that tailors the level of pension benefits according to individual economic status. In the context of population aging with widening gaps in life expectancies, this feature generates an automatic adjustment mechanism that (i) mitigates the pressing fiscal cost of an old-age public pension program (fiscal stabilization device) and (ii) redistributes pension benefits to those in need with shorter life expectancies (redistributive device). To evaluate this automatic adjustment mechanism, we employ an overlapping generations model with population aging. Our results indicate that this novel mechanism plays an important role in containing the adverse effects of population aging on the fiscal costs and progressivity of a pension system. More pronounced aging scenarios further strengthen the role of this mechanism. A well-designed means test rule can create a sufficiently strong automatic mechanism to keep public pensions sustainable and equitable. Importantly, it is feasible to devise a pension reform that better adapts a means-tested pension system to more pronounced demographic trends, but does not lower the welfare of current and future individuals of all ages and income.
C68|A multi-country analysis of austerity policies in the European Union|In this paper, we analyse the global effects, i.e., the effects on the world economy, from the austerity policies implemented in the European Union (EU) over the last years. Specifically, we simulate the effects of three alternative policies aimed to get a fall of one percentage point in the EU’s government deficit to GDP ratio, through a decrease in the level of public spending, and increases in consumption and in labour taxes. We examine their effects on the main macroeconomic variables of seven regions of the world economy, i.e., the EU, the US, Japan, China, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Rest of the World. The empirical methodology makes use of a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, through an extension of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model. The three policy measures led to contractionary effects on the EU’s levels of activity, which were accompanied with changes in income distribution, always detrimental to labour. The effects on the rest of the world, however, were mostly negligible.
C68|The economy-wide implications of a tax policy to reduce water pollution: a case of the Olifants river basin, South Africa| The Olifants river basin, which is one of the nine river basins in South Africa ranks as the third most water-stressed basin as well as the most polluted due to pollution from mining activities, irrigation agriculture, and industrial waste disposal. As a result, the government has implemented a series of pollution control measures with the view to mitigating pollution and water shortage in the basin. In this paper, we analysed the regional economic and environmental impacts of a tax policy to reduce water pollution using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. Firstly, an extended Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) which includes water pollution related activities was constructed for the basin using the framework of environmentally extended SAM. Secondly, we simulate a reduction in current pollution load by increasing the pollution tax rate under alternative revenue recycling schemes. The analyses reveal that internalising the cost of pollution control will effectively reduce the pollution situation in the river basin with marginal negative impact on Real Regional Gross Domestic Product (RRGDP). However, revenue recycling through uniform lump-sum transfers may positively impact RRGDP. In addition, the policy will lead to a change in regional production structure from heavy polluting sectors to less pollution-intensive sectors with benefits to sustainable development and the aquatic ecosystem.

C68|Greening the South Africa's economy could benefit the food sector: evidence from a carbon tax policy assessment| South Africa has a competitive and viable food production sector which enables the country to be a consistent net exporter of agricultural products. Lately, the business and labour organisations have raised concerns that the government's intention to implement the carbon tax policy will affect the food supply, subsequently exacerbating the unemployment and food insecurity in the country. Carbon tax is one of the policy tools to be implemented in order to reduce the growing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions thus helping the government meets its Paris Agreement commitments. South Africa's National Treasury released a second draft of the carbon tax bill in 2017, which takes into account the concerns raised by different organisations. In this paper, we evaluate the potential impact of the carbon tax policy on the food sector using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The results show that the carbon tax is an effective policy tool to mitigate emissions, as they decline by 33 percent relative to the baseline by 2035. This also leads to a welfare loss of R98.326 billion as the country transform into a green economy. While sectors such as transport, steel and coal-generated electricity experiences significant output decline, the food sector shows improvements in terms of production and employment when the carbon tax is implemented. The positive effects on the food sector suggests that the policy makers have designed a plausible environmental protection policy that cushion the food supply against any expected negative effects.

C68|O ciclo das commodities e crescimento regional desigual no Brasil: uma aplicação de equilíbrio geral computável (EGC)|The principles of uneven development are important for understanding the Brazilian regional reality, which has peculiar contours by dependence on commodity exports. Given the locational rigidity and the volatility of prices characteristic of this market, the spatial distribution of the impacts of these activities assumes importance in the persistence of regional inequalities. This work proceeds from the use of IMAGEM-B model (Integrated Multi-Regional Applied General Equilibrium Model - Brazil) configured to capture the impact that the increase in foreign demand for commodities had on Brazil's economic performance, allowing to identify the main channels capable of stimulating economic growth. Preliminary results indicate that the Brazilian economy showed significant responses to effect price of exports (investment, regional employment, income and consumption), the quantum effect in exports to other exporting regions (export and domestic import) and the aggregate result of GDP. The observed trends reflect not only different levels of industrialization and regional production structures, but also an economic concentration (sectoral and spatially selective) held a regional division of production, which has not allowed apparently reduce regional inequalities
C68|G-RDEM: A GTAP-Based Recursive Dynamic CGE Model for Long-Term Baseline Generation and Analysis|We motivate and detail the new GTAP-based recursive dynamic economic model (G-RDEM), a computable general equilibrium tool for long-term counterfactual analysis and baseline generation from given gross domestic product (GDP) and population projections. It encompasses an implicitly directly additive demand system (AIDADS) demand system with non-linear Engel curves, debt accumulation from foreign saving and introduces sector specific productivity changes, endogenous aggregate saving rates, as well as time-varying cost shares for value added and individual intermediates. Parameters for these relationships are econometrically estimated or taken from published work. The core of the model is derived from the Global Trade Anaylsis Project (GTAP) standard model and seamlessly incorporated into the modular and flexible CGEBox modelling platform, allowing for combined applications with various other extensions, such as GTAP-agro-ecological zones (AEZ) or GTAP-Water. G-RDEM maintains the flexible aggregation from the GTAP Data Base. It is open source, encoded in General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) and can be steered by a Graphical User Interface, which also encompasses a tool to analyse results with tables, graphs and maps. Existing GDP and population projections from the Socio-Economic Pathways (SSP) 1-5 can be directly incorporated for baseline construction. A comparison of the generated long-term structural composition of the economy against a simple recursive-dynamic variant, derived from the standard GTAP model, shows that G-RDEM brings about much more plausible results, as well as a more realistic, internally consistent representation of the economic structure in a hypothetical future.
C68|Saddle Cycles: Solving Rational Expectations Models Featuring Limit Cycles (or Chaos) Using Perturbation Methods|Unlike their linear counterparts, non-linear models of the business cycle can generate sustained economic fluctuations even in the absence of shocks (e.g., via limit cycles or chaos). A popular approach to solving non-linear models is the use of perturbation methods. I show that, as typically implemented, these methods are generally incapable of finding solutions that feature limit cycles or chaos, a fact that does not appear to be recognized in the existing literature. Standard algorithms only seek solutions that feature converge to the steady state, which is stronger than the standard definitional requirement that a solution simply cannot explode. Because of this, in estimation exercises any parameterization that involves limit cycles would typically (and incorrectly) be discarded. I propose a modification to standard algorithms that does not impose the overly strong requirement that solutions involve convergence.
C68|Projeção dos impactos econômicos regionais do desastre de Mariana-MG|The large-scale economic damage and losses caused by disasters have attracted the attention of specialists who are studying ways of modeling that kind of impacts. In face of the deep losses and damages caused by the disaster in Mariana, on November 5th, 2015, this work aims to project the main regional economic impacts of the event. The main contribution is to provide methodology and results that will collaborate in the evaluation of the economic effects of the disaster. To do so, we have developed a dynamic model of Computable General Equilibrium, especially built for municipalities directly and indirectly affected by the disaster, in order to capture the regional economic impacts in the period from 2016 to 2020. The results indicate that, generally, the five-year post disaster were insufficient for the retake of production, family consumption, employment, investment and trade, even in the event of the resumption of the total Mariana production in 2018. In addition, the results suggest a great interdependence in the absorption of negative impacts by the regions along the Doce river
C68|How Large is the Corporate Tax Base Erosion and Profit Shifting? A General Equilibrium Approach|This paper estimates the size and macroeconomic effects of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) using a computable general equilibrium model designed for corporate taxation and multinationals. Our central estimate of the impact of BEPS on corporate tax losses for the EU amounts to €36 billion annually or 7.7% of total corporate tax revenues. The USA and Japan also appear to loose tax revenues respectively of €101 and €24 billion per year or 10.7% of corporate tax revenues in both cases. These estimates are consistent with gaps in bilateral multinationals' activities reported by creditor and debtor countries using official statistics for the EU. Our results suggest that by increasing the cost of capital, eliminating profit shifting would slightly reduce investment and GDP. It would however raise corporate tax revenues thanks to enhanced domestic production. This in turn could reduce other taxes and increase welfare.
C68|The energy efficiency rebound effect in general equilibrium|We develop a stylized general equilibrium model to decompose the rebound effect of energy efficiency improvements into its partial and general equilibrium components. In our theoretical analysis, we identify key drivers of the general equilibrium rebound effect, including a composition channel, an energy price channel, a labor supply channel, and a growth channel. Based on numerical simulations with both the stylized model as well as a large-scale computable general equilibrium model of the global economy, we show that both general and partial equilibrium components of the rebound effect can be substantial. Our benchmark parameterization suggests a total rebound effect due to an exogenous energy efficiency improvement in the US manufacturing sector of 67% with roughly two-thirds occurring through the partial equilibrium rebound channel and the remaining one-third occurring through the general equilibrium rebound channel
C68|Quantifying Disruptive Trade Policies|Mainstream economic wisdom favoring cooperative free trade is challenged by a wave of disruptive trade policies. In this paper, we provide quantitative evidence concerning the economic impacts of tariffs implemented by the United States in 2018 and the subsequent retaliations by partner countries. Our analysis builds on a multi-region multi-sector general-equilibrium simulation model of the global economy that includes an innovative monopolistic-competition structure of bilateral representative firms.
C68|Population aging and cross-country redistribution in integrated capital markets|Population aging challenges the financing of social security systems in developed economies, as the fraction of the population in working age declines. The resulting pressure on capital-labor ratios translates into a pressure on factor prices and production. While European countries all face this challenge, the speed at which their population ages differs, and thus the pressure on capital-labor ratios. If capital markets are integrated, differences in population aging may lead to cross-country spillovers, as investors freely seek the best returns on capital. Using a multi-country overlapping-generations model covering 14 European Union countries, I quantify spillovers and find that capital market integration leads to redistribution across countries over the long run. For instance, GDP per capita would on average be 2.9 %-points lower in Germany in each of the next 50 years if capital markets were perfectly integrated and public debts kept constants with increases in labor income taxes, compared to a closed economy case; by contrast, GDP per capita would on average be 2.1 %-points higher in France, whose population ages slower than in Germany. I also show that pension reforms can change the cross-country redistribution patterns, some countries losing from capital market integration without the reform but winning with it.
C68|MegBec - Un modèle d’équilibre général calculable multirégional du Québec|This document presents the MegBec multiregional model of Quebec, a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with 16 “analytic” regions. The model is based on a social accounting matrix (SAM) with 44 industries and 63 products. The first part of the document describes how the SAM was constructed. First, a SAM for Quebec as a whole was elaborated, using the 2011 Statistics Canada supply and use tables. Regional SAMs were built from that one by distributing values across regions following several key indicators, particularly the regional GDP estimates of the Institut de la statistique du Québec. The resulting discrepancy in each region between salaries received and paid is attributed to worker commuting; origin-destination flows were estimated using cross-entropy minimization from Statistics Canada’s 2011 Census commuting data. Discrepancies between regional absorption and production are attributed to interregional trade; bi-lateral flows are generated by simulation using a gravity model. Attraction factors – key parameters in the gravity model – are obtained by aggregating attraction factors constructed at the finer Municipalité Régionale de Comté (MRC) spatial scale, according to network distances, in minutes, between population-weighted centroids. The second part of the document persents the model itself, whose specification is more or less standard for dynamic multiregional CGE models. In particular, trade between regions follows the Armington imperfect substituability hypothesis: supply is apportioned according to constant-elasticity-of-transformation (CET) functions, and demand according to constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) functions. Regional labor markets are characterized by the presence of unemployment, the rate of which depends on the level of wages, following a wage curve. Interregional worker commuting flows are logistic functions of regional wage rates. The document includes several appendices, one of which describes the reference scenario and the closure rules that are applied by default in the model. Ce document présente le modèle multirégional du Québec MegBec, un modèle d’équilibre général calculable (MEGC) dynamique séquentiel où l’on distingue 16 régions dites « régions analytiques ». Il s’appuie sur une matrice de comptabilité sociale (MCS) avec 44 industries et 63 produits. La première partie du document décrit le processus d’élaboration de la MCS. D’abord on a élaboré une MCS du Québec dans son ensemble, à partir des tableaux de ressources-emplois de 2011 de Statistique Canada. À partir de cette MCS, les matrices régionales ont été construites en répartissant les valeurs entre régions selon plusieurs clés, en particulier les estimations du PIB des régions de l’Institut de la statistique du Québec. L’écart qui en résulte dans chaque région entre salaires reçus et salaires payés est attribué au navettage des travailleurs; les flux origine-destination ont été estimés par la méthode de minimisation de l’entropie croisée à partir de données de navettage du recensement de 2011 de Statistique Canada. Les écarts entre l’absorption et la production régionales par produit sont attribués aux échanges interrégionaux, qui sont générés par simulation au moyen d’un modèle gravitaire. Les facteurs d’attractivité, paramètres critiques du modèle gravitaire, sont obtenus par agrégation de facteurs d’attractivité construits à l’échelle plus fine des MRC, selon les distances réticulaires en minutes entre centroïdes pondérés par la population. La deuxième partie du document présente le modèle lui-même, dont la spécification est grosso modo conforme à la structure classique des MEGC multirégionaux dynamiques. En particulier, le commerce entre les régions suit l’hypothèse de substituabilité imparfaite d’Armington : l’offre se distribue suivant des fonctions de distribution de l’offre à élasticité de transformation constante (CET) et la demande suivant des fonctions de répartition de la demande à élasticité de substitution constante (CES). Les marchés régionaux du travail sont caractérisés par la présence de chômage, dont le taux dépend du niveau des salaires, selon une courbe salaire-chômage (wage curve). Le navettage interrégional des travailleurs suit un modèle de fonction logistique des salaires régionaux. Le document compte plusieurs annexes, dont l’une décrit le scénario de référence et expose les règles de fermeture appliquées par défaut dans le modèle.
C68|The Impact of Microcredit on Farms and Rural Household: A Literature Review of Experimental Studies|In this article, we review the literature on the best ways to identify the causal effects of microcredit, present, and discuss some empirical results of the impact of microcredit on the adoption of innovations, investments, farm incomes, and profits. The results of empirical studies converge toward a positive impact of access to microcredit on the adoption of agricultural technology and investment. In terms of the effect on the technical efficiency of farms, agricultural income and profit, and consumption, the results do not all point in the same direction. The effects of microcredit are likely to vary depending on the context of the study.
C68|Mitigación del cambio climático con un Sistema de Comercio de Emisiones en Colombia: primeros hallazgos económicos|Este artículo analiza las implicaciones económicas de un Sistema de Comercio de Emisiones (SCE) en Colombia para el cumplimiento de los acuerdos de reducción de emisiones. Para ello se diseñó un módulo de comercio de emisiones en el modelo de equilibrio general MEG4C. A partir de este análisis se logró identificar que un SCE puede tener dos efectos: i) los sectores regulados incorporan el costo marginal de las emisiones en la producción, lo que trae una reducción en la producción y ii) los sectores sustituyen los bienes intensivos en emisiones, buscando minimizar los costos asociados al valor de permiso de emisión, lo que conduce a una disminución de las emisiones por cambio en la intensidad. Finalmente, se observa que cuando el recaudo, logrado por la venta de los permisos, se usa para fomentar la demanda de capital (incentivar la inversión), los resultados son positivos ya que estos recursos contribuyen a la transformación económica, al desarrollo sostenible y a la generación de otros co-beneficios.

C68|The Effectiveness of Investment Stimulus Policies in Australia|We present the results of three economic modelling simulations of changes to tax policy intended to stimulate investment in Australia. We begin with a comparison of a company tax cut and an investment subsidy, both unfunded and calibrated to yield equivalent Federal Government budget impacts. Our key findings (summarised below) illustrate that an investment subsidy is a more effective policy instrument for stimulating investment and improving domestic welfare: 1. With both policies calibrated to the same budgetary cost, the investment subsidy is more effective in raising the volume of investment; 2. The investment response to a company tax cut is skewed towards foreign investors, while the investment response to an investment subsidy is equitably proportioned across foreign and local investors; 3. The company tax cut induces an increase in net foreign liabilities and associated servicing costs while the investment subsidy has little long-term effect on net foreign liabilities; 4. Both policies lead to increases in gross domestic product (GDP), employment and real pre-tax wages; and 5. The impact on gross national income (GNI), an indicator of domestic material welfare, is positive for the investment subsidy but not for the company tax rate cut. In a final simulation, we revisit the investment subsidy to assess the net impact when the policy is fully funded. While many potential funding models exist, herein we assume partial funding via the denial of cash refunds of franking credits, with the remainder of the funding sourced via a small increase in economy-wide average personal income tax. We find that the investment subsidy still leads to a long-term gain in domestic welfare. When fully funded in this manner: 6. The investment response remains positive but skewed toward foreign investors; 7. Net foreign liabilities fall as a proportion of GNI; 8. The investment subsidy still returns positive results for employment, GDP and the real pre-tax wage; 9. The long-term gain in real post-tax wages is lower than in the unfunded case, but it remains positive; and 10. Fully funded, the investment subsidy still leads to a long-term gain in GNI. Based on these results, we strongly recommend that policy-makers consider an investment subsidy instead of a cut to company tax as a better value-for-money policy initiative to increase both investment and domestic material welfare.
C68|Creating a labor-market module for USAGE-TERM: illustrative application, theory and data|"This paper documents a project carried out under contract with the U.S. Department of Commerce. As stated in the contract, the aim was to: ""provide the means to conduct analyses of the impacts of trade on employment by industry and occupation in regional labor markets via the creation of a labor market module add-on to the dynamic version of USAGE-TERM. The resultant labor-market enhanced dynamic USAGE-TERM model will give users the capability to identify structural adjustment problems arising from difficulties that workers displaced by trade may have in transferring their skills to alternative employment possibilities in other industries and/or regions."" In the paper we provide technical documentation on how the labor-market module was created and illustrate its application by simulating the effects on regional labor markets of a hypothetical reduction in U.S. exports of Machinery and equipment."
C68|Melitz in GTAP Made Easy: The A2M Conversion Method and Result Interpretation|Since the 1970s the Armington approach has been the workhorse specification of trade in CGE models. Under Armington, agents substitute between products from different countries. Conceptually, Melitz provides a more attractive approach in which substitution is between products from different firms, rather than countries. Other attractive features of Melitz are allowance for: monopolistic competition; and economies of scale from fixed establishment costs for firms and fixed set-up costs on trade links. In this paper we show how an Armington model can be converted to Melitz by adding a few equations and introducing closure swaps, with little change to existing code. We apply our Armington-to-Melitz method to the Armington-based GTAP model to derive GTAP-A2M. Then we show how results from a CGE model with Melitz industries can be interpreted and justified via back-of-the-envelope calculations. Finally, we review the strengths and weaknesses of GTAP-HET, an alternative Melitz-based version of GTAP.
C68|SinoTERM365, Bottom-up Representation of China at the Prefectural Level|The TERM methodology requires relatively modest data requirements to create a multi-regional, sub-national CGE database. SinoTERM365 is an extreme form of stretching available data, with the master database representing 162 sectors in 365 prefectural regions of the Chinese economy. A collaborative effort is envisaged among users to enable ongoing improvements to the database. The TERM approach facilitates rapid amendments to the database when improved data are available. The alternative, to wait until better data emerge before building a model, may result in less detail and a less versatile framework for analysis. In our example, we consider a downturn in use of coal and coal-generated electricity in China.
C68|The Economic Effects on Regional Australia of RUN-member Universities|The study analyses the impacts of selected regional universities on regional economies within Australia using a multi-regional CGE model, VU-TERM. Universities enhance a community's knowledge base through teaching and research, raising productivity within the region. To depict the regional economic contribution of universities, we simulate a hypothetical removal of regional campuses. We estimate demand-side shocks using expenditure patterns of university enrolees. Supply-side impacts use inputs from econometric studies estimating rates-of-return to levels of educational attainment. Armidale's local economy is hit hardest by a hypothetical removal of its university. Other regions suffering substantial losses include Ballarat, Toowoomba and Rockhampton.
C68|A Dynamic Economy-wide Analysis of Company Tax Cuts in Australia|We provide a comprehensive analysis of the economy-wide implications of company tax cuts in Australia. This is achieved using VURMTAX, a bottom-up, multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of Australia's states and territories with detailed fiscal accounts. We find that a five percentage point reduction in Australia's legislated rate of company tax stimulates growth in investment, real GDP, and real consumer wages. However, real national income and household consumption both fall when the company tax rate is cut, diminishing economic welfare. As we show, this finding is insensitive to: (i) changes in the timing of the tax cuts, i.e., an overnight cut drives similar long-run impacts to staged reductions, or (ii) whether investors form views on expected rates of return on capital via adaptive or forward-looking expectations. The marginal excess burden (MEB) for company tax is therefore negative. This finding contradicts previous studies, which derive a large, positive MEB for company tax. We identify six differences between modelling assumptions applied herein, and those used in a previous study for Australia (Cao et al. 2015). As we show, these six factors explain 84 per cent of the difference between MEB estimates derived from VURMTAX and Cao et al.
C68|How Large is the Corporate Tax Base Erosion and Profit Shifting? A General Equlibrium Approach|This paper estimates the size and macroeconomic effects of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) using a computable general equilibrium model designed for corporate taxation and multinationals. Our central estimate of the impact of BEPS on corporate tax losses for the EU amounts to €36 billion annually or 7.7% of total corporate tax revenues. The USA and Japan also appear to loose tax revenues respectively of €101 and €24 billion per year or 10.7% of corporate tax revenues in both cases. These estimates are consistent with gaps in bilateral multinationals´ activities reported by creditor and debtor countries using official statistics for the EU. Our results suggest that by increasing the cost of capital, eliminating profit shifting would slightly reduce investment and GDP. It would however raise corporate tax revenues thanks to enhanced domestic production. This in turn could reduce other taxes and increase welfare.
C68|A Practical Guide to Parallelization in Economics|This guide provides a practical introduction to parallel computing in economics. After a brief introduction to the basic ideas of parallelization, we show how to parallelize a prototypical application in economics using, on CPUs, Julia, Matlab, R, Python, C++-OpenMP, Rcpp–OpenMP, and C++-MPI, and, on GPUs, CUDA and OpenACC. We provide code that the user can download and fork, present comparative results, and explain the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We conclude with some additional remarks about alternative approaches.
C68|Matlab, Python, Julia: What to Choose in Economics?|We perform a comparison of Matlab, Python and Julia as programming languages to be used for implementing global nonlinear solution techniques. We consider two popular applications: a neoclassical growth model and a new Keynesian model. The goal of our analysis is twofold: First, it is aimed at helping researchers in economics to choose the programming language that is best suited to their applications and, if needed, help them transit from one programming language to another. Second, our collections of routines can be viewed as a toolbox with a special emphasis on techniques for dealing with high dimensional economic problems. We provide the routines in the three languages for constructing random and quasi-random grids, low-cost monomial integration, various global solution methods, routines for checking the accuracy of the solutions, etc. Our global solution methods are not only accurate but also fast. Solving a new Keynesian model with eight state variables only takes a few seconds, even in the presence of active zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. This speed is important because it then allows the model to be solved repeatedly as one would require in order to do estimation.
C68|The Economic Geography of Innovation|This paper outlines a quantitative global multi-region model to assess the importance of country-level investment incentives towards innovation at the level of 5,633 regions of heterogeneous size. While incentives vary across countries (and time), the responses are largely heterogeneous across regions within as well as across countries. The reason for this heterogeneity roots in average technology differences -- in terms of the production of both output and innovation -- as well as in the geography (location) and amenities across regions. The model and quantitative analysis take the tradability of output as well as the mobility of people across regions into account. In the counterfactual equilibrium analysis we focus on the effects of R&D-investment incentives on three key variables -- place-specific employment, productivity, and welfare -- in a scenario where investment incentives towards innovation are abandoned. We find that the use of policy instruments which are designed to stimulate private R&D are globally beneficial in terms of productivity and welfare. In particular, low-amenity, peripheral places, and ones where patenting is relatively less common than elsewhere benefit more strongly than others, which implies that the studied nation-wide investment incentives also work as place-based policies. According to the quantification, about one-tenth of the long-run growth rate of real GDP on the globe can be attributed to the use of R&D investment incentives as used in the year 2005 alone.
C68|Forward Guidance: Is It Useful After the Crisis?|During recent economic crisis, when nominal interest rates were at their effective lower bounds, central banks used forward guidance -- announcements about future policy rates -- to conduct their monetary policy. Many policymakers believe that forward guidance will remain in use after the end of the crisis, however, there is uncertainty about its effectiveness. In this paper, we study the impact of forward guidance in a stylized new Keynesian economy away from the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates. Using closed-form solutions, we show that the impact of forward guidance on the economy depends critically on a specific monetary policy rule, ranging from non-existing to immediate and unrealistically large, the so-called forward guidance puzzle. We show that the puzzle occurs under very special -- empirically implausible and socially suboptimal -- monetary policy rules, whereas empirically relevant Taylor rules lead to sensible implications.
C68|Continuous Time Versus Discrete Time in the New Keynesian Model: Closed-Form Solutions and Implications for Liquidity Trap|Economists often use interchangeably the discrete- and continuous-time versions of the Keynesian model. In the paper, I ask whether or not the two versions effectively lead to the same implications. I analyze several alternative monetary policies, including a Taylor rule, discretionary interest rate choice and forward guidance. I show that the answer depends on a specific scenario and parameterization considered. In particular, in the presence of liquidity trap, the discrete-time analysis helps overcome some negative implications of the continuous-time model, such as excessively strong impact of price stickiness on inflation and output, unrealistically large government multipliers, as well as implausibly large effects of forward guidance.
C68|Bank to sovereign risk spillovers across borders: Evidence from the ECB’s Comprehensive Assessment|We study spillovers from bank to sovereign risk in the euro area using difference specifications around the European Central Bank’s release of stress test results for 130 significant banks on October 26, 2014. We document that following this information release bank equity prices in stressed countries declined. Surprisingly, bank risk in stressed countries was not absorbed by their sovereigns but spilled over to non-stressed euro area sovereigns. As a result, in non-stressed countries, the co-movement between sovereign and bank risk increased. This suggests that market participants perceived that bank risk is shared within the euro area.
C68|Modelling the G20|World leaders have declared the G20 to be the premier forum for economic cooperation. But as its influence and policy agenda has grown, so too has the need to be able to effectively model the G20 and the implications of its policy agenda. The paper introduces the G-Cubed (G20) model: a multi-country, multi-sector, intertemporal general equilibrium model of the G20. The paper gives an overview of the model and highlights its key features through four simulated shocks, all of which relate to the G20’s goal of reducing global current account imbalances: a fiscal shock (reducing the fiscal deficit in the United States), a productivity/fiscal shock (increasing infrastructure investment in Germany), a consumption shock (increasing domestic consumption in China) and the collective impact of all three shocks occurring simultaneously. The results demonstrate that, to be effective, any model of the G20 must reflect the complex trade and financial linkages between countries, the structural differences across G20 economies and the short-term rigidities observed empirically in the data, as well as a high level of disaggregation across economies, markets and sectors. The simulations show that reducing current account imbalances through these policies often comes with a real economic cost. The results also explain some of the shifts in global current account balances observed since 2007.
C68|Automation, Taxes And Transfers With International Rivalry|Continued automation and declines in low-skill shares of GDP have been widespread globally and linked to inequality. We examine the long-term, global consequences of policies that foster automation or address the distributional consequences of it, using a six-region global macro model. Results depend on whether welfare criteria are Rawlsian, emphasizing the performance of low-skill households, Benthamite, which aggregate pecuniary measures, capital-owner friendly, or simply based on real GDP. Even where automation delivers only bias against the low skilled, we find that the fostering it is a dominant strategy under all but the Rawlsian criterion. We then consider a post automation scenario in which worker displacement is significant, examining inequality-constraining but balance-preserving fiscal interventions, such as tax-financed “earned income tax credits”. These generate only small international spillover effects and are for the most part not preferred under all criteria except the Rawlsian one.
C68|Introducing Roy-like Worker Assignment into Computable General Equilibrium Models| This paper develops a new CGE model incorporating a Roy-like worker assignment in which heterogeneous workers endogenously sort into different technologies based on their comparative advantage. The model predicts significantly higher welfare-improving effects of trade liberalization due to technology-upgrading mechanism.
C68|Economic Effects of the USA - China Trade War: CGE Analysis with the GTAP 9.0a Data Base|An analysis of the economic effects of the ongoing USA-China trade war using the standard CGE Model and GTAP Data Base 9.0a revealed that both parties will be worse-off from this trade friction, having welfare losses and real GDP contractions regardless of international capital mobility status—i.e. whether the capital is internationally mobile or not. Moreover, the results indicated that the negative economic and trade impacts on China would be larger compared to those of the USA. Although, other countries and regions would be better-off having positive changes in their welfare and real GDP, their magnitudes were much lower than losses of the USA and China. Therefore, as a whole, the global economy will be worse-off as a result of this trade war between the world’s two largest economies, the USA and China.
C68|The Intergenerational Incidence Of Green Tax Reform|We examine the lifetime incidence and intergenerational distributional effects of an economy-wide carbon tax swap using a numerical dynamic general equilibrium model with overlapping generations of the U.S. economy. We highlight various fundamental choices in policy design including (1) the level of the initial carbon tax, (2) the growth rate of the carbon tax trajectory of over time, and (3) alternative ways for revenue recycling. Without revenue recycling, we find that generations born before the tax is introduced experience smaller welfare losses, or even gain, relative to future generations. For sufficiently low growth rates of the tax trajectory, the impacts for distant future generations decrease over time. For future generations born after the introduction of the tax, the negative welfare impacts are the smallest (largest) when revenues are recycled through lowering pre-existing capital income taxes (through per-capita lump-sum rebates). For generations born before the tax is introduced, we find that lump-sum rebates favor very old generations and labor (capital) income tax recycling favors very young generations (generations of intermediate age).
C68|Modelling Electric Vehicles as an Abatement Technology in a Hybrid CGE Model|We present a novel methodology to quantify the social costs and benefits (net social costs) of electric vehicles as an endogenous, demand-driven abatement technology in a general equilibrium framework. This new costing approach relates general equilibrium effects resulting from an increased market penetration of electric vehicles to the external environmental and health effects of the corresponding change in emissions. To this end, we develop a hybrid model combining a computable general equilibrium (CGE) with a discrete choice (DC) model that is capable of depicting an endogenous demand-driven uptake of alternative fuel vehicles. The discrete choice model of the consumer purchase decision between conventional, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles is directly integrated into the CGE model. This hybrid CGE-DC model features a detailed accounting of vehicle fleet development, including yearly numbers of vehicle purchases and cohort depreciation. It depicts nine households differentiated by the degree of urbanization and education, accounts for detailed consumer preferences for the purchase of a passenger vehicle and mode choice decisions. The hybrid CGE-DC model is additionally hard-linked to a bottom-up module for elektricity production by several technologies to provide input for an established impact pathway analysis to quantify the external costs relating to the changed composition of the vehicle fleet and technologies to generate electricity. We apply this methodology to Austria as an empirical example, considering current measures and trends for the uptake of electric vehicles into the vehicle fleet. In particular, we quantify the net social costs of additional measures to foster the introduction of electromobility that are part of the current policy discussion in Austria, and thus provide a blueprint for further application in different national contexts.
C68|Automation, taxes and transfers with International rivalry|Continued automation and declines in low-skill shares of GDP have been widespread globally and linked to inequality. We examine the long-term, global consequences of policies that foster automation or address the distributional consequences of it, using a six-region global macro model. Results depend on whether welfare criteria are Rawlsian, emphasizing the performance of low-skill households, Benthamite, which aggregate pecuniary measures, capital-owner friendly, or simply based on real GDP. Even where automation delivers only bias against the low skilled, we find that the fostering it is a dominant strategy under all but the Rawlsian criterion. We then consider a post automation scenario in which worker displacement is significant, examining inequality constraining but balance-preserving fiscal interventions, such as tax-financed “earned income tax credits”. These generate only small international spillover effects and are for the most part not preferred under all criteria except the Rawlsian one.
C68|Natural Instability of Equilibrium Prices|We develop a theory of market fluctuations caused by strategic trade with complete information and without outside shocks. The constructed general equilibrium duopoly is a strategic market game with infinite strategies and multiple mixed strategies equilibria. First order conditions (FOC) of the game are the ill-posed problems (Hadamard, 1909), but every equilibrium mixed strategy can be only approximated. This imposes restrictions on convergence of common beliefs of players about actions of each other, existence of rational expectations and a price discovery property of the market, although the market is informationally efficient (Fama, 1970). We suggest a modification of Tikhonov regularization to construct pseudo-solutions. All endogenous variables of the model are exposed to unremovable instabilities, ‘natural instabilities’, specific to parameters of a chosen approximation. Our result is also related to existence of common knowledge, sun-spot equilibrium, and noise trade.
C68|Exploring Long Run Structural Change with a Dynamic General Equilibrium Model|In this paper we present a computable general equilibrium model (G-RDEM), specifically designed for the generation of long run scenarios of economic development, featuring a non-homothetic demand system, endogenous saving rates, differentiated industrial productivity growth, interest payments on foreign debt and time-varying input-output coefficients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model of this kind. We illustrate how parameters of the five modules of structural change have been estimated, and we test the model by comparing its results with those obtained by a more conventional recursive dynamic CGE model. Both models are driven by the same GDP and population data, exogenously provided by the IPCC Shared Socio-economic Pathway 3. GDP levels determine the endogenous productivity parameters. Population affects the definition of per capita income, which in turn affects the household demand system and the variation of input-output coefficients. Information on the demographic structure is also employed to modify the aggregate saving rate parameters. It is found that the two models do produce different findings, both globally and at the regional and industrial level. Understanding the origins of such differences sheds some light on how mechanisms of structural change operate in the long run.
C68|Sekt oder Selters? Ökonomische Folgen der Reformzurückhaltung bei der Beendigung des Solidaritätszuschlags|Während der Sachverständigenrat die vollständige Abschaffung des Solidaritätszuschlags nach dem Auslaufen des Solidarpakts II empfiehlt, sieht der Koalitionsvertrag der Bundesregierung lediglich vor, die Einkommensteuer teilweise vom Zuschlag zu befreien. Die Simulationen beider Reformszenarien mit dem allgemeinen dynamischen Gleichgewichtsmodell PuMA zeigen, dass durch die Reformzurückhaltung erhebliche Wohlstandgewinne nicht realisiert würden. Im Vergleich fällt das BIP bereits kurzfristig um 0,2 Prozent (langfristig 0,3 Prozent) geringer aus. Damit verbunden ist eine um 35.000 Personen (langfristig 40.000) geringere Beschäftigung. Auch die Nettoeinkommen privater Haushalte würden weniger kräftig steigen. Der Selbstfinanzierungsgrad der Reformen würde kurzfristig in beiden Szenarien 40 Prozent (langfristig 50 Prozent) ausmachen. Effektiv würden demnach die im Koalitionsvertrag veranschlagten 10 Mrd. Euro zur Finanzierung einer vollständigen Abschaffung des Solidaritätszuschlags ausreichen. Das und die gegenwärtigen Überschüsse zeigen, dass eine vollständige Abschaffung des Solidaritätszuschlags möglich wäre, ohne die Solidität der öffentlichen Finanzen zu gefährden.
C68|Optimal fiscal policy with environmental tax and abatement spending in a model with pollution and utility-enhancing environmental quality: the case of Bulgaria|This paper characterized optimal fiscal policy - with environmental taxes, and public spending on abatement - in the presence of pollution, and evaluated it relative to the exogenous (observed) one in Bulgaria, an economy with a largely unreformed and polluting industry. The results are evaluated in light of the optimal environmental taxation of dirty production and the optimal spending on abatement, and the effect of those fiscal measures on the utility-enhancing environmental quality. To this end, a dynamic general-equilibrium model is calibrated to Bulgarian data (1999-2016). The main findings from the computational experiments performed are: (i) The optimal steady-state income tax rate is zero; (ii) The benevolent Ramsey planner provides twenty percent higher utility-enhancing environmental quality; (iii) The optimal level of carbon taxes is almost three times higher, and the optimal level of abatement spending is six times higher; (iv) The optimal steady-state consumption tax is twice lower.
C68|Endogenous Retirement Behavior of Heterogeneous Households Under Pension Reforms|We propose a unified framework to measure the effects of different reforms of the pension system on retirement ages and macroeconomic indicators in the face of demographic change. A rich overlapping generations (OLG) model is built and endogenous retirement decisions are explicitly modeled within a public pension system. Heterogeneity with respect to consumption preferences, wage profiles, and survival rates is embedded in the model. Besides the expected direct effects of these reforms on the behavior of households, we observe that feedback effects do occur. Results suggest that individual retirement decisions are strongly influenced by numerous incentives produced by the pension system and macroeconomic variables, such as the statutory eligibility age, adjustment rates, the presence of a replacement rate, and interest rates. Those decisions, in turn, have several impacts on the macro-economy which can create feedback cycles working through equilibrium effects on interest rates and wages. Taken together, these reform scenarios have strong implications for the sustainability of pension systems. Because of the rich nature of our unified model framework, we are able to rank the reform proposals according to several individual and macroeconomic measures, thereby providing important support for policy recommendations on pension systems.
C68|Idiosyncratic Risk, Aggregate Risk, And The Welfare Effects Of Social Security|We ask whether a pay‐as‐you‐go financed social security system is welfare improving in an economy with idiosyncratic and aggregate risk. We show that the whole welfare benefit from insurance against both risks is greater than the sum of benefits from insurance against the isolated risks. One reason is the convexity of the welfare gain. The other reason is a direct risk interaction amplifying the utility losses from risk. Our quantitative evaluation shows that introducing a minimum pension leads to sizeable welfare gains, despite substantial crowding out. About 60% of these gains would be missing from summing up the isolated benefits.
C68|Using emissions trading schemes to reduce heterogeneous distortionary taxes: The case of recycling carbon auction revenues to support renewable energy|While emissions trading schemes are developed by nations to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions, behavioural studies have shown that the political and public acceptability of these market-based instruments depends on the way the associated revenues are used. One option the general public approves of is to use them to support renewable energy. If this consists in reducing a pre-existing electricity levy that heterogeneously applies to the various sectors of the economy, the reduction of this distortionary tax thanks to the carbon revenues results in general equilibrium effects that may have unequal sectoral impacts. This is what we examine in the case of the European Union. With a modelling approach including a detailed disaggregation of European sectors, we find that using auction revenues from the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to support electricity generation from renewable sources results in a 2% rise in electricity demand in the whole economy due to the reduced electricity levy that electricity consumers have to pay to support renewable energy. This results in a 1.8% ETS carbon price increase. The carbon constraint for the non-ETS sectors is 5.9% looser as a consequence of the larger electricity use by these sectors. While the energy intensive sectors generally benefit from electricity levy exemptions, we observe that, due to the energy and ETS price increase, the combination of these exemptions and of the use of carbon auction revenues to support renewable energy makes the ETS sectors worse off than if carbon revenues are transferred to households. In aggregate, the recycling option analysed here results in a GDP gain due to its impacts on the non-ETS sectors, the reduction of the electricity levy and associated distortionary effects.
C68|Automation and inequality with taxes and transfers|The dependence of real income and inequality on changes in factor abundance, total factor productivity, factor bias, the relative cost of capital goods and the progressivity of the tax system are quantified using an elemental general equilibrium model with three households. Observed declines in low-skill labour shares are shown to have been generic in the OECD and to have been responsible for most of the increase in US inequality between 1990 and 2016. The widely anticipated future twist away from low-skill labour toward capital is then examined, in combination with expected changes in population and its skill composition. With downward rigidity of low-skill wages the potential is identified for unemployment to rise to extraordinarily high levels. Productivity growth at twice the pace since 1990 is shown to limit this, though it does not slow the concentration of income. The superior policy response is shown to be a generalization of the US “earned income tax credit” system, with financing from taxes on consumption, rather than capital income.
C68|Assessing Kuwaiti Energy Pricing Reforms|From mid-2014 Kuwait has experienced a substantial drop in its petroleum export price and,consequently, government revenue, causing a severe fiscal deficit and impaired economic performance. Cutting energy subsidies has become a policy priority. In the face of widespread opposition, the government raised gasoline prices in August 2016, proclaiming such reform the key to solving economic problems; yet recent policy discussions have not addressed the mechanism of pricing reforms. The paper offers a quantification and assessment of energy pricing reform in the current low petroleum price environment via a general equilibrium model of the Kuwaiti economy that embodies the structure of its economy and its labor market, its oligopolistic industries, and external flows associated with its sovereign wealth fund. Simulations clarify the required adjustments, including the seldom discussed expatriate labor exit and the decline in oligopoly rents. While necessary, subsidy reform implies trade-offs, notably between fiscal stabilization and cost of living sustainability. The results confirm that successful implementation must be accompanied by carefully designed mitigation measures and associated microeconomic reforms.
C68|Beyond Water Stress: Structural Adjustment and Macroeconomic Consequences of the Emerging Water Scarcity|This work analyzes some system-wide macroeconomic consequences of lower (sustainable) water availability, when global economic growth is postulated according to the Shared Socio-Economic Pathway 1 (SSP1), for the reference year 2050. After finding that the rather optimistic forecasts of economic development cannot be met in most water scarce macro-regions, we assess what consequences for the structure of the economy, welfare and the terms of trade, the insufficiency of water resources would imply. The analysis is undertaken by means of numerical simulations with a global computable general equilibrium model, under a set of alternative hypotheses. In particular, we consider whether (or not) the regional economic systems have a differentiated capability of adaptation (by means of innovation and modification of economic processes), and whether (or not) the scarce water resources can be allocated among industries, such that more water is assigned where its economic value is greater.
C68|Demand-Driven Structural Change in Applied General Equilibrium Models|This study analyzes the variations in industrial structure induced by income-sensitive patterns of final consumption, and how these changes can be captured by a multi-sector numerical model with a flexible demand system. We focus, in particular, on the estimation of parameters for an AIDADS (An Implicitly, Directly Additive Demand System) specification. We then test the latter by inserting it in the ENVISAGE global general equilibrium dynamic model, which is run under the SSP2 scenario from 2011 to 2050. It is found that time-varying income elasticity can generate sizable variations in the industrial structure. This finding has important practical implications, particularly when structural models are applied at a medium and long term horizon.
C68|To what extent will climate and land-use change affect EU-28 agriculture? A computable general equilibrium analysis|This paper assesses the structural, joint implications of climate and land-use change on agriculture in the European Union, by means of a computable general equilibrium model of the world economy. The counterfactual simulations are conducted at the year 2050 under the second Shared Socioeconomic Pathway. We find that climate and land-use change are likely to affect agricultural systems very differently across Europe. Northern countries are expected to benefit from climate change impacts, whereas other areas in Europe will suffer negative consequences in terms of reduced agricultural output, real income and welfare. The most vulnerable region is not made of Mediterranean countries, but rather Central Europe. Our results suggest that climate and land-use changes may exacerbate existing disparities within the EU. Therefore, appropriate adaptation strategies and a more flexible land-use are required to limit these negative consequences and possibly exploit the beneficial effects of climate change in some countries.
C68|Hosting a Mega-Event: Is it Good or Bad for the Economy? General Equilibrium Models as a Litmus Paper Test|Hosting mega-events has long been regarded as an opportunity for economic growth, creating long-lasting benefits and attaining international recognition. Recently, both the scientific community and the public opinion at large have turned much more skeptical about the impact of mega-events. Why is it that some events appear successful and other disasters? Why the perception of impacts has changed over time? To answer these (and other) questions, there is a need to go beyond the simple narratives and “stylized facts”, to undertake some serious scientific investigation, based on verifiable data and testable models. Despite the fact that most recent studies use the same modeling tool, namely some Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, results are sometimes contradictory, thereby hindering the trustiness of the economic analysis for policy guidance. In this paper, we show that results are different because assumptions are different and because the range of effects considered is different, even when the same model is employed. Furthermore, some critical hypotheses are not often clearly stated. We advocate some kind of standardization in the process of model building for the economic assessment of mega-events. Only a transparent and replicable model exercise can serve as a “litmus paper”, to ascertain whether hosting a mega-event is good or bad for an economy.
C68|Pareto tails in socio-economic phenomena: A kinetic description|Various phenomena related to socio-economic aspects of our daily life exhibit equilibrium densities characterized by a power law decay. Maybe the most known example of this property is concerned with wealth distribution in a western society. In this case the polynomial decay at infinity is referred to as Pareto tails phenomenon (Pareto, Cours d'économie politique, 1964). In this note, the authors discuss a possible source of this behavior by resorting to the powerful approach of statistical mechanics, which enlightens the analogies with the classical kinetic theory of rarefied gases. Among other examples, the distribution of populations in towns and cities is illustrated and discussed.
C68|The Economic Impact of Brexit: Evidence from Modelling Free Trade Agreements|Abstract This paper assesses the economic implications of the United Kingdom (UK) leaving the European Union (EU). The basic data on trade in goods and services and investment between the two parties suggest that the cost of “Brexit” could be substantial. Trade between the UK and the EU-27 is large and of a similar order of magnitude as transatlantic trade (between the EU and the U.S.). The precise nature of the (hopefully free) trade agreement UK-EU-27 is still being negotiated. All available studies concur that a significant disruption of trade links will impose economic costs on both sides. However, the EU-27 would bear only a disproportionally small share of the total cost, not just because it is about five times larger than the UK in economic terms, but also for fundamental reasons such as greater market power of its enterprises. Other studies on different free trade arrangements confirm the general proposition that the smaller party has more to gain from eliminating trade barriers (and more to lose from imposing them). This implies that the EU will have a stronger negotiating position.
C68|Economic effects of climate change in developing countries: Economy-wide and regional analysis for Ethiopia|Quantifying the economic effects of climate change is a crucial step for planning adaptation in developing countries. This study assesses the economy-wide and regional effects of climate change induced productivity and labor supply shocks in agriculture in Ethiopia. The study shows, in worst case scenario, the effects on national GDP may add up to -8% with uneven regional effects ranging from -10% in agrarian regions (e.g. Amhara) to +2.5% in urbanized regions (e.g. Addis Ababa). Cost-free exogenous structural change scenarios in labor markets and transaction costs may offset about 20-30% of the ripple effects of climate change. Therefore, the ongoing structural transformation in the country may underpin the resilience of the economy to climate change. Nevertheless, given the role of agriculture in the current economic structure of the country and the potency of biophysical impacts of climate change, adaptation in the sector is indispensable. Otherwise, climate change may hamper economic progress of the country, and make rural livelihood unpredictable.
C68|General equilibrium effects of public adaptation in agriculture in LDCs: Evidence from Ethiopia|Ethiopia is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. This is because its important economic sector, agriculture, is virtually rain-fed. The role of the sector in the current economic structure and the potency of the anticipated biophysical impacts of climate change necessitates proactive adaptation in agriculture. This, however, breeds questions of adaptation costs and adaptation finance. This study attempts to derive plausible range of planned adaptation costs in agriculture along with their economy-wide and regional effects in Ethiopia. It also assess the economy-wide and regional effects of the likely options available to a government of a least-developed country to finance adaptation in agriculture. The results show that planned public adaptation in agriculture puts pressure on government surplus, impedes on manufacturing and private services, and GDP of urbanized regions. As such, it may strain the current macroeconomic endeavors of the country which puts government driven structural transformation and reducing fiscal deficit relative to GDP at the center. Government of Ethiopia may reconcile this by laying out incentives to urban agriculture and private investment in agriculture. Besides, foreign support in the form of biotechnology transfer and debt-relief may help to control the side effects of grants on foreign exchange market and trade balance.
C68|Time to Build and the Business Cycle|Investment is central for business cycles and a key characteristic of investment is time to build (TTB). I document that TTB is volatile and largest during recessions. To study these fluctuations, I develop a model. In the model, the longer TTB, the less frequently firms invest, and the less investment reflects productivity, which worsens the allocation of capital. In the calibrated model, one month longer TTB lowers GDP by 0.5%. Empirical evidence corroborates the quantitative results.
C68|Extending the Public Sector in the ICES Model with an Explicit Government Institution|This paper aims to present an extension of the ICES model to capture the public sector. Departing from a demand system mainly derived from the GTAP model, ICES-XPS model disentangles the private and the public actors. The paper reviews the changes in both the database and the model equations following the existing literature and considering the availability of data as well. The model is then tested with a series of simple experiments to highlight its contribution to economic analysis in which the public sector may play an important role. Finally, we show the flexibility in the closure rule of the public sector that allows addressing different policy research questions.
C68|Sensitivity of modeling results to technological and regional details: The case of Italy's carbon mitigation policy|Model differences in technological and geographical scales are common, but their contributions to uncertainties have not been systematically quantified in the climate policy literature. This paper carries out a systematic assessment on the sensitivity of Computable General Equilibrium models to technological and geographical scales in evaluating the economic impacts of carbon mitigation policies. In particular, we examine the impacts of sub-national details and technological details of power generation on the estimate of carbon price and economic cost. Taking Italy as an example, we find that the estimation for carbon price and the economic cost of a de-carbonization pathway by means of a model with technological and regional details can be lower than a model without such details by up to 40%. Additionally, the effect of representing regional details appears to be far more important than the effect of representing the details of electricity technology in both the estimated carbon prices and the estimated economic impacts. Our results for Italy highlight the importance of modeling uncertainties of these two key assumptions, which should be appropriately acknowledged when applying CGE models for policy impact assessment. Our conclusions can be generalized to different countries and policy scenarios not in terms of absolute numbers but in terms of economic explanations. In particular, intra-national trade and the sub-national sectoral/technological specialization are important variables for understanding the economic dynamics behind these outcomes.
C68|Can the Paris Deal Boost SDGs Achievement? An Assessment of Climate Mitigation Co-benefits or Side-effects on Poverty and Inequality|The paper analyses the synergies and trade-offs between emission reduction policies and sustainable development objectives. Specifically, it provides an ex-ante assessment that the impacts of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), submitted under the Paris Agreement, will have on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of poverty eradication (SDG1) and reduced income inequality (SDG10). By combining an empirical analysis with a modelling exercise, the paper estimates the future trends of poverty prevalence and inequality across countries in a reference scenario and under a climate mitigation policy with alternative revenue recycling schemes. Our results suggest that a full implementation of the emission reduction contributions, stated in the NDCs, is projected to slow down the effort to reduce poverty by 2030 (+2% of the population below the poverty line compared to the baseline scenario), especially in countries that have proposed relatively more stringent mitigation targets and suffer higher policy costs. Conversely, countries with a stringent mitigation policy experience a reduction of inequality compared to baseline scenario levels. If financial support for mitigation action in developing countries is provided through an international climate fund, the prevalence of poverty will be slightly reduced at the aggregate level (185,000fewer poor people with respect to the mitigation scenario), but the country-specific effect depends on the relative size of funds flowing to beneficiary countries and on their economic structure.
C68|Comment on Suzuki’s rebuttal of Batra and Casas|Batra and Casas (1976) claimed that ‘a strong Rybczynski result’ arises in the three-factor two-good general equilibrium trade model. In subsequent comments, Suzuki (1983) contended that this could not be the case. Among his comments, Suzuki found that the set of three equations holds for the Allen-partial elasticity of substitution under the assumption of perfect complementarity, and he applied these to his analysis. In the following, I demonstrate that these are impossible, hence his dissenting proof is not plausible.
C68|Should Central Banks Worry About Nonlinearities of their Large-Scale Macroeconomic Models?|How wrong could policymakers be when using linearized solutions to their macroeconomic models instead of nonlinear global solutions? This question became of much practical interest during the Great Recession and the recent zero lower bound crisis. We assess the importance of nonlinearities in a scaled-down version of the Terms of Trade Economic Model (ToTEM), the main projection and policy analysis model of the Bank of Canada. In a meticulously calibrated “baby” ToTEM model with 21 state variables, we find that local and global solutions have similar qualitative implications in the context of the recent episode of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates in Canada. We conclude that the Bank of Canada’s analysis would not improve significantly by using global nonlinear methods instead of a simple linearization method augmented to include occasionally binding constraints. However, we also find that even minor modifications in the model's assumptions, such as a variation in the closing condition, can make nonlinearities quantitatively important.
C68|Beyond Water Stress: Structural Adjustment and Macroeconomic Consequences of the Emerging Water Scarcity|This work analyzes some system-wide macroeconomic consequences of lower (sustainable) water availability, when global economic growth is postulated according to the Shared Socio-Economic Pathway 1 (SSP1), for the reference year 2050. After finding that the rather optimistic forecasts of economic development cannot be met in most water scarce macro-regions, we assess what consequences for the structure of the economy, welfare and the terms of trade, the insufficiency of water resources would imply. The analysis is undertaken by means of numerical simulations with a global computable general equilibrium model, under a set of alternative hypotheses. In particular, we consider whether (or not) the regional economic systems have a differentiated capability of adaptation (by means of innovation and modification of economic processes), and whether (or not) the scarce water resources can be allocated among industries, such that more water is assigned where its economic value is greater.
C68|Demand-Driven Structural Change in Applied General Equilibrium Models|This study analyzes the variations in industrial structure induced by income-sensitive patterns of final consumption, and how these changes can be captured by a multi-sector numerical model with a flexible demand system. We focus, in particular, on the estimation of parameters for an AIDADS (An Implicitly, Directly Additive Demand System) specification. We then test the latter by inserting it in the ENVISAGE global general equilibrium dynamic model, which is run under the SSP2 scenario from 2011 to 2050. It is found that time-varying income elasticity can generate sizable variations in the industrial structure. This finding has important practical implications, particularly when structural models are applied at a medium and long term horizon.
C68|To what extent will climate and land-use change affect EU-28 agriculture? A computable general equilibrium analysis|This paper assesses the structural, joint implications of climate and land-use change on agriculture in the European Union, by means of a computable general equilibrium model of the world economy. The counterfactual simulations are conducted at the year 2050 under the second Shared Socioeconomic Pathway. We find that climate and land-use change are likely to affect agricultural systems very differently across Europe. Northern countries are expected to benefit from climate change impacts, whereas other areas in Europe will suffer negative consequences in terms of reduced agricultural output, real income and welfare. The most vulnerable region is not made of Mediterranean countries, but rather Central Europe. Our results suggest that climate and land-use changes may exacerbate existing disparities within the EU. Therefore, appropriate adaptation strategies and a more flexible land-use are required to limit these negative consequences and possibly exploit the beneficial effects of climate change in some countries.
C68|Privatisation and the unusual case of Belarusian accession to the WTO|The accession negotiations of Belarus to the WTO are unusual since, due to its obligations in the Eurasian Economic Union, WTO accession is not expected to impact its tariffs or formerly substantial trade distorting agricultural subsidies. Nonetheless, we estimate that WTO accession will increase welfare by 8.8 percent per year in Belarus in the medium term. We show that inclusion of (i) foreign direct investment; (ii) reduction on non-discriminatory barriers against services providers; and (iii) our model with imperfect competition and endogenous productivity effects together produce esti-mated gains eleven times larger than a model of perfect competition with only cross-border trade in services. Our analysis is enabled by our production of a dataset on both discriminatory and non-discriminatory barriers in services and their ad valorem equivalents. Based on a new dataset on labor productivity by sector and type of ownership, in our central model we estimate that privatization will increase welfare by 35.4 percent. We find substantial variance in the estimated gains from privatiza-tion depending on model assumptions; but all the estimates of the impacts of privatization indicate substantial welfare gains.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
C68|The Biofuel-Development Nexus: A Meta-Analysis|Although the production of biofuels has expended in recent years, the literature on its impact on growth and development finds contradictory findings. This paper presents a meta-analysis of computable general equilibrium studies published between 2006 and 2014. Using 26 studies, we shed light on why results differ. We investigate factors such as the type of biofuels, the geographic area and the characteristics of models. Our results indicate that the outcomes of CGE simulations are sensitive to models parameters. They also suggest a divide between developed / emerging countries versus Sub-Saharan African countries.
C68|Discretizing nonlinear, non‐Gaussian Markov processes with exact conditional moments| Approximating stochastic processes by finite‐state Markov chains is useful for reducing computational complexity when solving dynamic economic models. We provide a new method for accurately discretizing general Markov processes by matching low order moments of the conditional distributions using maximum entropy. In contrast to existing methods, our approach is not limited to linear Gaussian autoregressive processes. We apply our method to numerically solve asset pricing models with various underlying stochastic processes for the fundamentals, including a rare disasters model. Our method outperforms the solution accuracy of existing methods by orders of magnitude, while drastically simplifying the solution algorithm. The performance of our method is robust to parameters such as the number of grid points and the persistence of the process.
C68|Impactos estruturais do programa Bolsa família na dinâmica recente da economia brasileira|The aim of this study is to introduce a methodology to project impacts of cash transfers programs, which we exemplify through the evaluation of the BolsaFamília Program in a recent period of the Brazilian economy (2009-2015). An original dynamic recursive computable general equilibrium model, modified to consider issues related to income distribution and their impact on households consumption levels as well as on sectoral output was applied. The results suggest that the program also generates income gains for classes which do not receive cash transfers from Government by its indirect effects on labor and capital income, but has effects on labor income inequality decrease and on productive structure. We conclude that cash transfers policieshave important impacts over the process of development of the country, even though its effect on growth is small.
C68|Assimetrias na tributação da renda do trabalho e do capital : impactos de modificações na estrutura de tributação da renda de pessoa física no Brasil|This paper discusses the asymmetry between labor and capital (profits and distributed dividends) income taxation in Brazil and simulates changes in the personal income tax structure in a neutral approach. An original dynamic recursive computable general equilibrium modelis applied. The results indicate that a more progressive taxation of personal income would lead to a drop in household income inequality in the Brazilian economy. Consumption, Investment and production oriented to domestic market would be encouraged. However, the impacts on inequality and on the economy are small given the small representativeness of the personal income tax in the Brazilian tax base. We conclude that for effective changes towards a more progressive tax structure in Brazil it is needed to study a higher taxation on capital income associated to a decreaseof consumption taxes
C68|La politique commerciale au service de la politique climatique|S’il constitue une avancée, l’Accord de Paris, entré en vigueur en novembre 2016, pose un certain nombre de questions, notamment quant à la responsabilité «?commune mais différenciée?» –?qui se traduit par des engagements très variables d’un pays signataire à l’autre?–, mais aussi concernant l’articulation entre politique climatique et politique commerciale. Pour réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre (GES), une politique commerciale ferait-elle mieux qu’une politique climatique?? À défaut, pourrait-elle inciter à des engagements plus ambitieux de réduction des émissions?? Cette Lettre montre, à partir de simulations d’un modèle dynamique de l’économie mondiale développé au CEPII, que la politique commerciale seule n’est pas un bon outil pour limiter les émissions de CO2, mais qu’elle peut venir compléter une politique plus ambitieuse.
C68|¿Es conveniente una autoridad monetaria “blanda”?|Resumen: Teniendo como marco de referencia la “estrategia de inflación objetivo” es usual discutir lo que es m ?as conveniente para una sociedad en cuanto al grado de “dureza” o “agresividad” de una autoridad monetaria para defender su meta de inflación, y la credibilidad en esta entre los agentes económicos. En este documento utilizamos un modelo de equilibrio general dinámico estocástico (DSGE, por sus siglas en inglés) neo-keynesiano tanto con expectativas racionales como con adaptativas para analizar esta cuestión. Nuestros resultados sugieren que el problema que se puede derivar de una autoridad “blanda” es arriesgar la pérdida de credibilidad en su (supuesto) empeño para alcanzar una determinada meta de inflación. Además, presentamos y utilizamos una solución del modelo lo suficientemente simple como para permitir que sus simulaciones sean implementadas en una hoja de cálculo. Abstract: Within the framework of the so-called “inflation targeting” strategy there is a discussion about the convenience for a society as to the degree of “hardness” of a monetary authority looking to defend its inflation target, and the credibility that this authority enjoys between the private agents about it. In this paper we use a neo-Keynesian stochastic dynamic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with both rational and adaptive expectations to answer this question. Our results suggest that the social problem that can be derived from a “soft” authority is that it risks losing credibility in its effort to reach a certain inflation target. In addition, we present and use a solution of the rational expectations version of the model simple enough to allow its simulations to be performed using a spreadsheet.
C68|Un modelo de equilibrio general dinámico para la evaluación de la política económica en Colombia|Este documento presenta un modelo de equilibrio general dinámico para el análisis de la economía colombiana. A diferencia de la mayoría de modelos de equilibrio general aplicado, este integra simultáneamente (i) el modelamiento dinámico de la toma de decisiones; (ii) la posibilidad de simular política económica discrecional; y (iii) un tratamiento explícito de los encadenamientos intersectoriales en la economía. Gracias a esto, resulta idóneo para responder preguntas que no se prestan para ser estudiadas con otros modelos económicos, como los modelos de equilibrio general dinámico estocástico (DSGE) o los modelos de equilibrio general computable (CGE). El trabajo consta de cuatro capítulos. En el primero se hace una detallada revisión de la literatura, tanto teórica como de modelos aplicados al caso de Colombia. Queremos con ello hacer plena claridad respecto del vacío que pretendemos llenar con nuestro trabajo. El segundo capítulo desarrolla el modelo mientras que en el tercero se presenta la calibración de los parámetros. El cuarto capítulo se presenta un par de simulaciones para ilustrar el uso del modelo.

C68|Updating USAGE: Baseline and Illustrative Application|USAGE is a dynamic, CGE model of the U.S. economy created at CoPS in collaboration with the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC). The model has been used by and on behalf of: the USITC; the U.S. Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Energy, Transportation and Homeland Security; private sector organizations such as the Cato Institute and the Mitre Corporation; and the Canadian Embassy in Washington DC. To keep the model relevant for policy analysis, it must be updated periodically. This paper describes a major update of USAGE undertaken for the USITC. In accordance with the CoPS contract with the USITC, the update task was to: 1. build a NAICS-based database at the 400-industry level for USAGE using the 2007 BEA benchmark input-output tables; 2. update this database to 2014; 3. create a baseline projection starting from the base year of 2014 and proceeding at 5 year intervals to 2024; and 4. conduct an illustrative USAGE policy simulation around the baseline. At the completion of this work in August 2016, the ITC requested a fifth task: 5. update from 2007 to 2015 rather than 2014 and create a baseline from 2015 to 2020. This paper describes how we undertook the five tasks.
C68|Determining agent-specific rates of return in a Financial CGE model of Australia|This working paper describes the process followed to arrive at a suitable specification for the agent- and instrument-specific rate-of-return matrix for the VU-Nat financial computable general equilibrium (FCGE) model of the Australian economy. Several sources were consulted to obtain appropriate rates of return. These sources are documented in detail in this report.
C68|Macro, industry and regional effects of eliminating Buy America(n) programs: USAGE simulations|The U.S. government attempts to stimulate employment, especially in the manufacturing sector, by favoring U.S. contractors for public sector projects (Buy American regulations) and by insisting that these contractors themselves favor domestic suppliers of inputs such as steel (Buy America regulations). We refer to these policies collectively as Buy America(n). Using a detailed computable general equilibrium model, we demonstrate that Buy America(n) policies are counter-productive. The main reason is that they increase costs to the U.S. government. Scrapping these policies would reduce employment in manufacturing but boost employment in the rest of the economy with a net gain of about 306 thousand jobs. Even in the manufacturing sector, there would be many winning industries including those producing machinery and other high-tech products. Employment would increase in 50 out of 51 states and 430 out of 436 congressional districts.
C68|Biome composition in deforestation deterrence and GHG emissions in Brazil|We analyze the Brazilian commitments to COP21 under different scenarios, with a general equilibrium model of Brazil developed for land use change and GHG emissions analysis. The model is dynamic, inter-regional and bottom-up, and here distinguishes 16 regions and 6 biomes. We simulate different scenarios of future deforestation, including the halt of illegal deforestation, the restoration of 12Mha of forests, and replacing deforestation in the Amazon biome by deforestation in the Cerrado biome. Our analysis shows that the restoration of 12 Mha of forests would be enough to meet Brazil's 2025 commitments with no other extra GHG savings efforts, but would not meet 2030 commitments. Exchanging deforestation in the Amazon biome for deforestation in the Cerrado biome would seriously compromise the accomplishment of the targets. We note that emissions in the general economy are increasing in Brazil, suggesting that other efforts must be made to meet the COP21 targets.
C68|The relevance of inter-regional trade data produced by the 2012 Commodity Flow Survey for multi-regional CGE modelling|The objective of this study is to assess the suitability of Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) data released by the US Census Bureau as a check on the estimates of inter-regional trade generated in creating the USAGE-TERM master database. A close inspection of the Census Bureau's CFS data indicate that they record movements to and from transport nodes. In some cases, transport nodes may align with production origins and final use destinations. In other cases, nodes appear to be intermediate points rather than origins or final destinations. This implies that CFS data are often incompatible with the trade flows in a CGE database. Merchandise, that is primary and manufacturing commodities, account for no more than 15% of GDP in the U.S. economy. Therefore, even comprehensive merchandise trade flow data would have limited use in a CGE database. The usefulness of the CFS data is diminished further by its concentration on bulky goods, which account for a small fraction of total trade flows. Bulky trade flows may account for a substantial proportion of the volume of trade but make a small contribution to total economic activity. Mining products excluding oil and gas account for 50.9% of the recorded weight in the survey, but just 3.9% of the value of trades – and only 0.3% of GDP. The CFS data might be useful for examining transport logistics but are of little use in CGE database preparation. There is no evidence that the CFS data supersedes the Horridge gravity method of allocating inter-regional trades. However, CFS data point to the desirability of noting the difference between transport in the Mississippi basin and elsewhere. The basin relies heavily on water transport for moving agricultural, mining and fuel products.
C68|The National and Regional Consequences of Australia's Goods and Services Tax|The major political parties support the tenet of the original GST agreement that GST change requires unanimous state approval. However, GST change could differentially affect state economies, and thus influence support from individual states. We investigate the potential for GST change to differentially affect state economies. We do this by developing a multi‐regional model of the Australian economy that contains details of the legislated features of the GST. In this model, when we change any element of the GST, the economic effects are informed by regional differences in economic structure and their interactions with the details of our GST theory.
C68|A decomposition and microsimulation analysis of occupational wage growth in Australia, 2010-2017|Dynamic historical and comparative static decomposition CGE simulations are a powerful tool for understanding structural change and its impacts. In this paper, we examine the impact on wages of three sets of structural drivers: macroeconomic factors, qualification supply, and technical change. To the CGE analysis, we add a microsimulation analysis. Microsimulation addresses a shortcoming in CGE modelling, which is that the household sector is represented by one or several representative agents. With the representative agent treatment, CGE modelling is unable to capture all of the diversity in the household sector in relation to the levels of income, sources of income, and composition of expenditure by different households. Over the study period of 2010 to 2017, average growth in real wages in Australia was weak. Growth in high-wage occupations was generally stronger than growth in low-wage occupations, resulting in a widening gap between the wages of the highest- and lowest-paid workers. Over the period, key results from our research indicate that: (a) Macroeconomic factors played a role in determining overall wage growth, but did not explain the disparity between wage growth at the occupational level; (b) Strong growth in the supply of qualifications at the level of bachelor degree level and above detracted from wage growth in the high-skill occupations; (c) Skill-biased technical change in favour of the high-skill occupations led to relatively strong growth in the wages of high-skill occupations, an effect that dominated the results; and (d) Relatively strong growth in the wages of high-skill occupations added disproportionately to the incomes of high-income households and led to an increase in household income disparities and an increase in the relative poverty rate. However, this result did not take into account possible changes in occupation by households over the study period. With the wages of low-skilled occupations falling further below average, a change of occupation, rather than a pay-rise in their existing occupations, was a better prospect for low-income households to avoid falling into absolute or relative poverty. The decomposition analysis could be extended to a broader analysis of structural change in the Australian economy, and may be the subject of future research. The links built for this analysis between CGE modelling and microsimulation also suggest scope for future research. An earlier version of results reported here was presented at the Melbourne Economic Forum on December 12, 2017. We are grateful to members of the Forum including Peter Dixon, James Giesecke, Craig Emerson and Mark Wooden for valuable feedback.
C68|Using a regional CGE model for rapid assessments of the economic implications of terrorism events: creating GRAD-ECAT (Generalized, Regional And Dynamic Economic Consequence Analysis Tool)|The Terrorism Risk Assessment (TRA) groups in the Department of Homeland Security assess millions of terrorism scenarios defined by location, agent (e.g. nuclear device), and delivery method (e.g. car bomb). For each scenario they estimate deaths, injuries, property damage, clean-up and health expenses, visitor discouragement, and other damage dimensions. The TRA groups translate damages into economic measures, e.g. loss of GDP. Previously they used an input-output (I-O) model. Here we replace I-O with computable general equilibrium (CGE). Solving CGE models is computationally time-consuming and requires specialist skills. For the TRA groups this creates two challenges: feasibility and security. A model that cannot be solved in less than a fraction of a second is infeasible for analyzing millions of scenarios. The TRAs can rely only on people with high security clearances, limiting the possibilities for obtaining specialist advice. Our approach to these challenges was to use a CGE model to estimate elasticities that show the sensitivity of economic variables to direct damage effects of events occurring in different regions. For example, we supplied the TRA groups with CGE-based estimates of the percentage effect on national welfare of destruction of 1 per cent of the capital stock in congressional district NY14. Our elasticity approach meets both challenges. First, for any given terrorism scenario specified by a location and a vector of direct damage shocks, the TRA groups can use the elasticities in linear equations to estimate in nanoseconds the implications for a wide range of economic variables. Second, as outside contractors, we have no need for access to sensitive information on specific shock vectors and target regions. We describe how we used a dynamic, multi-regional CGE model, USAGE-TERM, to estimate the elasticities.
C68|Global Supply Chains: towards a CGE analysis|Economists have analysed global supply chains (GSC) using pure theory, case studies, econometrics and input-output calculations. We now need a new type of computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to show how GSC trade affects welfare and its distribution between and within nations. The new model must recognize: fragmentation of production; scale economies; intermediate inputs that cross national borders multiple times embodied in products at different stages of completion; and decision-making by global agents. We describe a prototype that incorporates these features and gives interpretable results not attainable with a standard CGE model. We discuss steps to move from the prototype to a policy-relevant model.

C68|Productivity, taxes, and hours worked in Spain: 1970–2015|Abstract In the early 1970s, hours worked per working-age person in Spain were higher than in the United States. Starting in 1975, however, hours worked in Spain fell by 40%. We find that 80% of the decline in hours worked can be accounted for by the evolution of taxes in an otherwise standard neoclassical growth model. Although taxes play a crucial role, we cannot argue that taxes drive all of the movements in hours worked. In particular, the model underpredicts the large decrease in hours in 1975–1986 and the large increase in hours in 1994–2007. The lack of productivity growth in Spain during 1994–2015 has little impact on the model’s prediction for hours worked.
C68|Welfare effects of fiscal policy in reforming the pension system|Most reforms of the pension systems imply substantial redistributions between cohorts and within cohort. Fiscal policy, which accompanies these changes may counteract or reinforce this redistribution. Moreover, the literature has argued that the insurance motive implicit in some pension systems plays a major role in determining the welfare effects of the reform: reforms otherwise improving welfare become detrimental to welfare once insurance motive is internalized. We show that this result is not universal, i.e. there exists a variety of fiscal closures which yield welfare gains and political support for a pension system reform. In an OLG model with uncertainty we analyze two sets of fiscal adjustments: fiscally neutral adjustments in the pension system (via contribution rate or replacement rate) and balancing pension system by a combination of taxes and/or public debt. We find that fiscally neutral pension system reforms are more likely to yield welfare gains. Many adjustments obtain sufficient political support despite yielding aggregate welfare losses and vice versa. Furthermore, we point to fiscal closures which attenuate and reinforce the relevance of the insurance motive in determining the welfare effects.
C68|Redystrybucja wewnątrzpokoleniowa w systemie emerytalnym|Wykorzystanie wspólnych tablic dalszego oczekiwanego trwania życia przy obliczaniu wysokości emerytury w systemie zdefniowanej składki skutkuje subsydiowaniem przeciętnie dłużej żyjących kobiet przez krócej żyjących mężczyzn. Celem pracy jest oszacowanie skali tej redystrybucji. Przeprowadzono symulacje w oparciu o model nakładających się pokoleń z obowiązkowym repartycyjnym systemem zdefiniowanej składki oraz heterogenicznością w ramach kohorty. Uwględniono również wydłużenie się dalszego oczekiwanego trwania życia, zgodnie z projekcjami demograficznymi. Zastosowanie wspólnych tablic życia skutkuje redystrybucją w kierunku kobiet na poziomie ok. 0,5-0,7 %, wyrażoną za pomocą ekwiwalentu konsumpcji jako procent konsumpcji mężczyzn w cyklu życia. Taka skala redystrybucji w ramach systemu emerytalnego w bardzo niewielkim stopniu rekompensuje kobietom dyskryminację na rynku pracy.
C68|Political (In)Stability of Social Security Reform|In this paper we consider an economy populated by overlapping generations, who vote on abolishing the funded system and replacing it with the pay-as-you-go scheme (i.e. unprivatizing the pension system). We compare politically stable and politically unstable reforms and show that even if the funded system is overall welfare enhancing, the cohort distribution of benefits along the transition path turns unprivatizing social security politically favorable.

It also shows that the demographic, educational, and productivity advantages of Catalonian residents, when compared with those of the rest of Spain, are not enough to ensure a more prosperous economic future for Catalonians or a more sustainable pension system.
