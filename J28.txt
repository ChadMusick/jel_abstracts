J28|Works Councils, Training and Employee Satisfaction|This paper investigates the role of works councils in job satisfaction. Using the recently developed Linked Personnel Panel, we consider both the direct and indirect impact via further training. Basic estimates on an individual level do not reveal clearly direct effects, but on an establishment level, the existence of a works council increases the average job satisfaction in a company. In more extended approaches, we also find a positive, weakly significant link on an individual level accompanied by positive training with regard to job satisfaction if we control for personal characteristics, working conditions, firm size, collegiality variables and industry dummies. Firms with industry-wide bargaining agreements drive this result. The effects are stronger if the firm carries the training costs and if the share of trained workers within the firm measures training. The direct impact of works councils remains positive but becomes insignificant if Lewbel’s instrumental variables estimator is applied.
J28|Opioids and the Labor Market|This paper finds evidence that opioid availability decreases labor force participation while a large labor market shock does not influence the share of opioid abusers. We first identify the effect of availability on participation using the geographic variation in opioid prescription rates. We use a combination of the American Community Survey (ACS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) county-level prescription data to examine labor market patterns across both rural and metropolitan areas of the United States from 2007 to 2016. Individuals in areas with higher prescription rates are less likely to participate after accounting for standard demographic factors and regional controls. This relationship remains significant for important demographic groups when increasingly strong panel data controls, including a full set of geographic fixed effects and measures of local labor market conditions in 2000, are introduced to the regressions. We also investigate the possibility of reverse causality, using the Great Recession as an instrument to identify the effect of weak labor demand on opioid abuse. The share abusing opioids did not increase after the onset of the Great Recession. The evidence on the frequency of abuse is more ambiguous since the identified increases could be the continuation of a pre-trend.

J28|Implementación de programas de inclusión social en territorios con población vulnerable: ¿cómo está cambiando Beca 18 la vida de los y las jóvenes del valle de los ríos Apurímac, Ene y Mantaro (VRAEM)?|Actualmente, Beca 18 es el programa de formación de capital humano más importante del Perú. Este estudio cualitativo, que analiza la implementación del programa en el valle de los ríos Apurímac, Ene y Mantaro (VRAEM), busca conocer las oportunidades de acceso a la educación superior de los y las jóvenes de la zona; asimismo, indaga sobre la influencia de Beca 18 en sus vidas, tanto en sus trayectorias educativas y/o laborales como en sus aspiraciones. Es preciso señalar, además, que los y las jóvenes que participaron en esta investigación forman parte del estudio longitudinal Niños del Milenio. El estudio encuentra que Beca 18 es un programa muy valorado por la población del VRAEM; sin embargo, señala que aún hay aspectos que deben mejorarse en su diseño e implementación. Por otra parte, el análisis longitudinal muestra que Beca 18 favorece el acceso de los y las jóvenes a la educación superior, pero también les ofrece la oportunidad de concluir sus estudios, lo que reduce el riesgo de deserción. Específicamente, Beca 18 mejora sus aspiraciones educativas y laborales, y los aleja de las amenazas que aquejan a la población juvenil del VRAEM, tales como el narcotráfico, el alcoholismo, el embarazo temprano, entre otras.
J28|Works Councils and Workplace Health Promotion in Germany|From a theoretical viewpoint, there can be market failures resulting in an underprovision of occupational health and safety. Works councils may help mitigate these failures. Using establishment data from Germany, our empirical analysis confirms that the incidence of a works council is significantly associated with an increased likelihood that the establishment provides more workplace health promotion than required by law. This result also holds in a recursive bivariate probit regression accounting for the possible endogeneity of works council incidence. Furthermore, analyzing potentially moderating factors such as collective bargaining coverage, industry, type of ownership, multiestablishment status and product market competition, we find a positive association between works councils and workplace health promotion for the various types of establishments examined. Finally, we go beyond the mere incidence of workplace health promotion and show that works councils are positively associated with a series of different measures of workplace health promotion.
J28|Immigration and Work-Related Injuries: Evidence from Italian Administrative Data|There is growing evidence that foreign-born workers are over represented in physically demanding and dangerous jobs with relatively higher injury hazard rates. Given this pattern, do increasing inflows of foreign-born workers alleviate native workers' exposure to injuries? This paper provides evidence of the effects of immigration on the incidence and severity of workrelated accidents. We combine administrative data on work-place accidents in Italy with the Labour Force Survey from 2009 to 2017. Our approach exploits spatial and temporal variation in the distribution of foreign-born residents across provinces. Using province fixed-effects and an instrumental variable specification based on historical settlements of immigrants, we show that inflows of foreign-born residents drive reductions in the injury rate, paid sick leave, and severity of impairment for natives. Next, we investigate potential underlying mechanisms that could drive this effect, such as increased unemployment and selection of the workforce, and the sorting of native workers into less physically demanding jobs. Our results rule out that decreased injuries are driven by higher native unemployment. We find that employment rates are positively associated with immigration, in particular for workers with higher education. While not statistically significant at conventional levels, we also find that average occupational physical intensity for natives is lower in provinces that receive larger foreign-born inflows.
J28|Arbeitszufriedenheit in der modernen Arbeitswelt|Der fortschreitende Wandel der Arbeitswelt zeichnet sich durch steigende Flexibilitätsanforderungen und ein höheres Maß an eigenverantwortlichem Handeln aus. Verantwortung, Flexibilität und neue Freiräume im Job werden auch von vielen Erwerbstätigen geschätzt – aber nicht von allen. Der vorliegende Beitrag zeigt, dass die Arbeitszufriedenheit nicht allein mit den Eigenschaften des Arbeitsplatzes zusammenhängt, sondern auch damit, wie sehr diese Eigenschaften den Präferenzen des jeweiligen Arbeitnehmers entsprechen. Beschäftigte mit wenig Flexibilität und Eigenverantwortung können somit grundsätzlich genauso zufrieden mit ihrer Arbeit sein wie Arbeitnehmer mit viel Flexibilität und Eigenverantwortung.
J28|How Do Alternative Work Arrangements Affect Income Risk After Workplace Injury?|Alternative work arrangements, including temporary and contract work, have become more widespread. There is interest in understanding the effects of these types of arrangements on employment and earnings risk for workers and the potential for existing social insurance programs to address this risk. We study employment and earnings risk in the context of workplace injuries among temporary and contract workers. We link administrative workers' compensation claims to earnings records to measure the employment and earnings risk posed by workplace injuries, comparing labor market outcomes after injury between temporary and contract workers and direct-hire workers injured doing the same job. We use a triple-difference identification strategy to isolate the effect of alternative work arrangements. We find that temporary workers have significantly lower probabilities of employment post-injury relative to similar direct-hire workers; temporary workers also have more severe earnings losses, which persist for at least three years after injury. This difference in income risk cannot be explained by differences in employment dynamics between temporary and direct-hire workers. We find evidence that the additional earnings losses suffered by temporary workers are offset by workers' compensation benefits, suggesting that the program provides insurance for the incremental risk faced by temporary workers.
J28|The Role of Work Engagement in Moderating the Impact of Job Characteristics, Perceived Organizational Support, and Self-Efficacy on Job Satisfaction|This research is aimed at figuring out the extent to which job characteristics, perceived organizational support and self-efficacy affect job satisfaction with work engagement serving as an intervening variable. The respondents of this research were 101 employees of the Centre for the Development and Empowerment of Educators and Educational Personnel (P4TK) of Art and Culture of Yogyakarta. The data were collected using questionnaires. The data were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative analysis techniques used in this research were t-test, F-test, multiple regression analysis and path analysis. The research yielded some results. Firstly, job characteristics and self-efficacy had a significant effect on work engagement and perceived organizational support did not have any significant effect on work engagement, but together it had a significant effect on work engagement. Secondly, job characteristics and perceived organizational support had a significant effect on job satisfaction, and self-efficacy did not have any significant effect on job satisfaction, but together it had a significant effect on job satisfaction. Thirdly, work engagement had a significant effect on job satisfaction. Fourthly, job characteristics and perceived organizational support had a greater effect on job satisfaction directly, and self-efficacy had a greater effect on job satisfaction indirectly through work engagement. The results of this research can be used as a reference for P4TK to improve employees' job satisfaction, and ultimately, support the achievement of organizational goals.
J28|Informal employment and work health risks: Evidence from Cambodia|Workplace safety is a topical issue in public policy debates in industrializing countries like Cambodia where high economic growth rates have yet to translate into higher job quality. This paper studies the relationship between informal employment and occupational health using the 2012 Cambodia Labour Force Survey. I estimate probit models and find that informal employment on its own is associated with a significant increase in the probability of work injury/illness. However in the most complete specification with controls for personal, job and firm characteristics, the effect of informal employment turns out to be small in magnitide and statistically insignificant. I discuss possible explanations for this finding. Results from this analysis suggest that in a context of weak administrative capacity for the enforcement of labour regulations, as is the case in Cambodia, work health risks are a concern across the board, not just in the informal sector.
J28|Determinants Of Involuntary Employment In Europe|The worker’s perception of a forced decision to work (i.e. involuntary employment) has a negative effect on the overall well-being of the older worker (aged 50 and above). This paper first investigates the job situation, the financial and health situation and the relationship status of the involuntary workers. The micro data of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) allows for panel estimations. We control for unobserved differences in personality traits between voluntary and involuntary workers. We find that the job situation of the worker and the retirement of the partner are important drivers of involuntary employment. Specifically, involuntary workers are more frequently employed in jobs that are physically demanding or that have more stress related tasks. Involuntary workers also often feel underappreciated for their work by the management or colleagues. Second, we focus on cross-country differences. The fraction of involuntary workers in the labor population aged 50 and more ranges from 29 percent in Switzerland to 62 percent in Spain. We find that in the countries with the lowest rates of involuntary employment, the involuntary workers have better working conditions and are more easily able to make ends meet. Furthermore, the country dummies in our estimations indicate that the probability of being involuntarily employed is partly explained by time-invariant factors that differ across countries, for example public policies, e.g. pension systems. We investigate cross-country differences in four aspects of the pension system. The countries with the lowest rates of involuntary employment are those with the highest rates of partial and joint retirement.
J28|The role of job satisfaction and local labor market conditions for the dissolution of worker-job matches|This paper scrutinizes the effect of job satisfaction on labor turnover. We use German SOEP data to estimate a multinomial logit model with random effects for the probability of a worker-job separation. In line with the previous literature, we find a negative relationship between job satisfaction and separations. We show that this relationship is entirely driven by less satisfied individuals, as the separation probability of more satisfied workers does not vary with job satisfaction. We also find that even among the most dissatisfied individuals, most workers remain in their current jobs. Finally, we show that the effect of job satisfaction varies with both local labor market conditions and the kind of separation under consideration (job-to-job or job-to-non-employment).

Finally, we go beyond the mere incidence of workplace health promotion and show that works councils are positively associated with a series of different measures of workplace health promotion.
J28|Labor market policy and subjective well-being during the Great Recession|Average subjective well-being decreased in Europe during the Great Recession, primarily among people with less than a college education and people younger than retirement age. However, some countries fared better than others depending on their labor market policies. More generous unemployment support, which provided income replacement or programs to assist unemployed workers find jobs, mitigated the negative effects for most of the population, although not youth. In contrast, stricter employment protection legislation exacerbated the negative effects. We present further evidence that suggests the exacerbating effects of employment protection legislation are due to greater rigidities in the labor market, which in turn affect perceived future job prospects. Our analysis is based on two-stage least squares regressions using individual subjective wellbeing data obtained from Eurobarometer surveys and variation in labor market policy across 23 European countries.
J28|Pay Level Comparisons in Job Satisfaction Research and Mainstream Economic Methodology|Although social scientists have been investigating the nature and impact of job satisfaction for many decades, economists only started to investigate job satisfaction systematically in the late 1980’s. Almost from the first systematic studies of job satisfaction by economists, the research potential of the notion of pay level comparisons was realized. The idea of pay level comparisons in job satisfaction has proven particularly useful also because it has important implications for a number of standard theoretical and economic policy results. However, the inclusion of the variable of comparison wage in job satisfaction and the resulting supporting empirical findings, are in sharp contrast to the orthodox approach, given that in mainstream economic theory an individuals’ utility is assumed to be a function of absolute income only. Despite the important theoretical and policy implications, mainstream economic theory has not paid much heed to the job satisfaction conceptual formulations and empirical findings. The paper argues that there are methodological reasons for this state of affairs which seem to be linked to the subjective well-being research in general, and to the job satisfaction literature in particular. A strong mistrust against the method of stated preferences and the inherent methodological bias against the integration of psychological findings, are suggested as the two prime reasons. Although a few prominent figures in job satisfaction research have realized the mainstream methodological attitude, it is necessary that job satisfaction specialists should consider more seriously the basic components of mainstream economic methodology that relate to their research field.
J28|To Become a Cawir Metua: Life Satisfaction of The Karo Elderly A Social Security Case Study on The Karo Elderly in Lingga Village, Simpang Empat Sub-District, Tanah Karo Regency|Elderly becomes one of the crucial issues faced by many countries in the world today. The composition of the elderly population is growing rapidly in both developed and developing countries. The increase in the number of elderly requires attention so that they not only live long but can enjoy their old age happily and improve the quality of their life. In some areas, large numbers of elderly people become burdensome if they have health problems resulting in increased health care costs, decreased income, increased disability, lack of social support and independence. This statement is not entirely true, because there are elderly who are still able to be independent to achieve life satisfaction. This study employed a qualitative approach to get a picture of life and concepts related to elderly life. Emik view of the power was used to analyze the life of elderly from Karo ethnicity. The data were collected by using participant observation and depth interview which was performed on five elderly families and questionnaires for 100 respondents of elderly Karo family in Lingga Village. The strength of informants in establishing rapport became the key of success in this Karo elderly research. The result of the research showed that Karo elderly felt shame if they have to live with their children or be dependent because it is the nature of a Karo person to be independent. It is reinforced by a very strong culture of shame. In addition, Karo people have a standard of life satisfaction which has been a part of their culture. It is the satisfaction of life when all of their children have married and have enough income. In Karo society, it is called Cawir Metua. Someone who has reached the Cawir Mertua is supposed to hold a party to tell people that he or she has achieved satisfaction in life.
J28|Education-job mismatches and their impacts on job satisfaction: An analysis among university graduates in Cambodia|Education-job mismatches, especially overeducation or vertical mismatch, are generally found to lower the worker's job satisfaction, which may generate the counter-productive behaviors such as high rates of absenteeism and turnover in developed countries. The purpose of this article is to examine the impacts of educational mismatches from their both forms and dimensions (match, overeducation, horizontal mismatch and double mismatch) on the job satisfaction among university graduates in Cambodia. To deal with the sample selection bias owing to the unobserved job satisfaction of unemployed graduates, this study applies the Heckman probit model on a survey conducted with nineteen higher education institutions in Cambodia. Results indicate that the both forms of mismatches adversely affect the job satisfaction and the consequence is stronger if graduates suffer both vertical and horizontal mismatches. This suggests that the literature has to focus on all forms and dimensions of mismatches when examining their impacts on the individual outcomes in the labor market. The findings also underline the importance of improvement in the quality of education-job matching in Cambodia because the possible counter-productive behaviors due to inadequate education-employment may affect the productivity of firms and thus limit their development.
J28|Well-being and intended early retirement among older European workers: does job satisfaction matter? A 6-Wave follow-up|In recent years, population aging has received great attention in developed countries given the social challenges that it entails. At this regard, it is well documented that this collective is associated with fewer resources (both physical and economic). Furthermore, ageing societies incite an increase in the inactive population and so, threaten the financial viability of the social protection systems. This study investigates the effects of different factors on early retirement intentions among European workers aged 50-65 using the latest available data (waves 1-6: 2004-2015) from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). We shed new light on this causal relationship controlling for job characteristics and well-being indicators. Our empirical results based on logistics regressions suggest that people that is satisfied with their jobs (OR = 0.61; 95 % C.I. 0.53, 0.71), with very high appreciation of their quality of life (OR = 0.56; 95 % C.I. 0.49, 0.64) or with good health (OR = 0.55; 95 % C.I. 0.47, 0.65) would have less intentions of early retirement, that is, decreased odds of work exit. Besides, social-environment would matter.
J28|Work and family as factors determining Individual Subjective Well-Being in Spain|We investigate the degree of satisfaction with life carried by individuals for the Spanish case and which are some of the most influential work and personal factors, all according to their family structure: single, single parent, couples with children and childless couples, and two periods in the recent economic cycle. In this paper, the subjective individual well-being level is analyzed as an indicator of inequality. We use factors from two of the areas in which the individual develops most part of his life: work and family. It is an empirical analysis with not too many precedents in the literature, using these family models and incorporating only labour and personal factors and not considering other variables such as health, to better highlight the relevance of labor considerations. The results indicate substantial differences in the degree of individual well-being depending on family type and cycle. Furthermore, of the explanatory variables, job satisfaction, and good labour relations and social relations on the job were found to be the most important and significant in relation to well-being. The research could serve to orient human resource policies in companies and also public policies to improve the plight of those least satisfied with the lives they lead, here single parents and couples with children.
J28|Influence of Female Leadership Styles and Organization Culture on Locus of Control and Job Satisfaction|This study is categorized in exploratory research and included in the descriptive analysis. The population of this research is all lecturers in UIN Alauddin Makassar, Indonesia. The sampling technique used in this research is purposive sampling which sample criterion used is civil servant lecturers who occupy structural positions. The sample size uses maximum likelihood (ML) with 105 numbers of samples. In this study, the techniques used include questionnaire; observation; interviews, and documentation. The method of analysis used in this research is structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis. Findings of this research are female leadership style influence on the locus of control and job satisfaction; organizational culture influences the locus of control and job satisfaction, meanwhile locus of control influence on job satisfaction.
J28|The Effect of Social Media on Employees’ Job Performance: The mediating Role of Organizational Structure|Social media is creating a drastic change at workplaces, and organizations are increasingly interested in adaption of it for their business processes. The aim of social media usage at workplace may differ but ultimate objective is to build social networks and sharing. This empirical research examined the effect of use of social media on employees’ job performance and the mediating effect of an organizational structure. Survey data gathered from 205 valid responses and analyzed by structural equation modelling technique. Results revealed that “use of social media” is positively correlated with “employees’ job performance”, while organizational structure has positive mediating effect.
J28|The influencing factors of turnover on nurses in private hospitals in Binjai city, Indonesia|In Indonesia, turnover in hospital employees often occurs in private hospitals. Some private hospitals in Binjai city, find some obstacles in human resources because the turnover rate on nurses is quite high. Almost all hospitals have an average turnover rate above 10% every year and it is increasing. Basically, there are no hospitals can avoid the turnover, however, if the high turnover rate is immediately declined, it is feared to be able to interrupt the service to patients, and becomes a problem for the hospital as a whole. The purpose of this study is to determine the influencing factors of turnover on nurses at Private Hospitals in Binjai City, Indonesia. This research is categorized as Correlational Research. The population of this research was the nurses who have made a turnover and are working in private hospitals in Binjai City. There were 60 respondents taken as the sample of research. The data were analyzed using multiple linear regression test. The results showed that there are simultaneously and significant effect on the following variables; job satisfaction; working environment has positive and significant effect; organizational commitment has positive and significant effect on turnover on nurses in private hospital nurses in Binjai city. Based on these results, the most influencing factor on turnover on nurses is job satisfaction.
J28|HPWS in the Public Sector: Are There Mutual Gains?|Few studies investigate the links between high-performance work systems (HPWS) on public sector organizational performance and worker job attitudes. We fill this gap with analyses of these links using linked employer-employee surveys of workplaces in Britain in 2004 and 2011. We find robust evidence of positive associations between the use of HPWS and organizational performance in the public sector but no associations with worker attitudes. The implication is that, in contrast to similar work on the private sector in the United States (Appelbaum et al., 2000) HPWS is not delivering mutual gains for employers and employees in the British public sector.
J28|Labor Precarization: Russian Empirical Evidence|In the conditions of educational and health institutions reforming and a series of economic crises, representatives of social-oriented helping professions move to the precarization zone. Based on the survey conducted in the spring of 2017 (2,054 school teachers and 870 physicians in state organizations in Moscow, Rostov-on-Don and Kazan), signs of precracious labor were identified: instability, the risk of job loss/changing, an increase in workload, not accompanied by higher wages, social and economic vulnerability. The empirical data shows that despite the satisfactory self-assessment of socially-oriented professionals' life, the level of precarious labor is higher for teachers from provincial cities and lower in the capital schools. In the field of health care, the extent of precarization is approximately the same in the different cities. Most teachers and doctors are concerned about the growth of workload without increasing wages and the risks of job loss. The majority of representatives of helping professions do not agree with the fact that the state effectively solves the social and economic problems of teaching. At the same time, interviewed teachers and doctors will take a rather passive attitude in case of violation of their labor rights. Nothing will be done by more than a half of all respondents. However, the excessive regulation of school teachers and physicians, on the one hand, and the continuing high demand for the work of schools and hospitals on the other, are associated with the risk of social tension increase in the Russian society.
J28|Analysis of Factors Affecting Employee Job Satisfaction|The aim of this study is to understand and determine the factors situations that may occur in the workplace affecting job satisfaction. In particular, the experiences of the employees at the workplace (quantitative workload and interpersonal conflict) and their emotional abilities are considered as reasons. The study group consisted of 199 employees. The length of employment in the workplace at the time of the study was with a range of 2-26 years. According to the results obtained, these four variables have a statistically significant effect in explaining job satisfaction. 30% of the variance of job satisfaction is explained by these variables. Results show that the workplace experiences and the emotional ability of the people are effective on job satisfaction. Empathy and self-esteem positively affected job satisfaction, however, conflict and workload negatively affected. The most important variable explaining job satisfaction had found empathy.As a result of this study, empathy, self-esteem, quantitative workload and interpersonal conflict were identified as important variables to increase job satisfaction.
J28|The Effect on the Safety Culture of Occupational Accidents and Safety Behavior: The Case of Turkey|Work accidents are one of the most important problems encountered in working life. The purpose of this study is to measure the impact of safety culture on safety behaviour of employees and occupational accidents In literature, various measurement tools have been used for the evaluation of safety culture. In this study, a questionnaire was created which made use of the measurement scales in these previous studies, whilst also taking into consideration particular Turkish cultural characteristics. The dimensions of safety culture scales are as follows: Managers' commitment, priority of safety, safety training, safety communication, safety awareness and competency, employees' involvement, reporting culture. The sample of the study consisted of total 1371 working manufacturing sector in Turkey. The questionnaire was applied to all the employees during a 1-week period. The mean age of the participants was 30.36±7.69, mean working years 6.31±5.61. The data are analysed using frequency distribution, reliability analysis, correlation, t test and regression analysis.According to the results obtained with the safety culture dimensions it is a significant relationship between occupational accidents. It has also been found that safety cultures have a positive effect on the safe behavior of employees. According to results, safety culture has an important key role to create a safe and healthy working environment in workplace.
J28|How are different means of happiness related? Life, job and income satisfaction in Turkey|This study investigates life (happiness), job and income satisfaction of women and men in paid work according to different demographic and value-based (in terms of the values associated with paid work and income) components, and to the extent they are correlated (findings are derived using the Life Satisfaction Survey (2016) provided by Turkish Statistical Institute). Preliminary descriptive statistics refer to relatively lower income satisfaction levels of women and men in Turkey (46.0 per cent of women and 48.6 per cent of men report that they are ?satisfied? or ?very satisfied? with their income), moderate levels of overall happiness levels (59.1 per cent of women and 59.6 per cent of men report that they are ?happy? or ?very happy? with their lives) and relatively higher levels of job satisfaction (81.0 per cent of women and 80.9 per cent of men report that they are ?satisfied? or ?very satisfied? with their jobs). Spearman's rank correlation coefficients demonstrate that happiness (life satisfaction) levels of women and men in paid work are positively correlated with their job and income satisfaction levels, and there is also a positive correlation between their job satisfaction and income satisfaction levels, all of which are on a weak to moderate level yet statistically significant. For men, the correlation between happiness and job satisfaction has the lowest (yet positive) value, whereas for women the lowest (though positive) value is observed for the relationship between happiness and income satisfaction. For both women and men, the correlation between job satisfaction and income satisfaction has the highest value, which is slightly stronger for women. The findings of this study support the spillover hypothesis, which claims that life and job satisfaction are positively correlated (income satisfaction also being involved in this context) as these components affect each other (Strauser, 2014).Strauser, D. R. (2014). Career development, employment, and disability in rehabilitation: From theory to practice. Springer Publishing Company.Turkish Statistical Institute. (2016). Life satisfaction survey.
J28|Generalised self-efficacy and work values as indicators of job satisfaction: evidence from China|This paper examines the role of generalised self-efficacy and work values, on employee reports of overall job satisfaction in China from 2012 to 2014. This paper is novel in two ways. The first is that different aspects of job satisfaction in China are examined in addition to overall satisfaction and the second is that we examine self-efficacy and work values after controlling for occupation and income. The evidence presented supports our various hypotheses that self-efficacy and perceived work values play a large role in determining both reported overall job satisfaction and job satisfaction with various aspects of the job in China. In particular, we find a strong link between the National Vocational Qualification system in China and generalised self-efficacy, which we believe enhances workers sense of capability. The implication for Chinese employers is that it is imperative for their worker productivity that they look after their employees’ perceived self-efficacy, possibly by encouraging access to the National Qualification system and that they also facilitate a good working environment where worker relations or ‘guanxi’ can flourish.
J28|Permanent Contracts and Job Satisfaction in Academia: Evidence from European Countries|Temporary contracts are increasingly used in academia. This is a major concern for non-tenured researchers, since weak job security may hamper job satisfaction. In spite of the relevance of this topic, scholarly research on the theme is scant. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the role of academic tenure for job satisfaction of researchers in European countries. The work uses data from the MORE2 survey, a recent large-scale representative survey of researchers in European countries. The results show that, ceteris paribus, academics with a permanent contract are on average more satisfied with their job than those that are employed on a temporary basis. We also show that academic tenure is a relatively more important factor of job satisfaction for researchers at an intermediate stage of the career. Finally, we point out some important differences in the working of the model among European countries. Our hypotheses receive significant empirical support for the groups of Continental EU and Nordic economies, which combine high job satisfaction and good working conditions, on the one hand, with relatively weak job security for younger academics, on the other.
J28|Labor Market Effects of US Sick Pay Mandates|This paper exploits temporal and spatial variation in the implementation of US sick pay mandates to assess their labor market consequences. We use the Synthetic Control Group Method (SCGM) and the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) to estimate the causal effect of mandated sick leave on employment and wages. Our findings do not provide much evidence that employment or wages were significantly affected by the mandates which typically allow employees to earn one hour of paid sick leave per work week, up to seven days per year. Joint tests for all treatment regions let us exclude, with 90% statistical probability, that wages decreased by more than 1% as a result of the mandates. With 92% probability, we can exclude that employment decreased by more than 1%.
J28|Overeducation Wage Penalty among Ph.D. Holders: An Unconditional Quantile Regression Analysis on Italian Data|The wage effect of job-education vertical mismatch (i.e. overeducation) has only recently been investigated in the case of Ph.D. holders. The existing contributions rely on OLS estimates that allow measuring the average effect of being mismatched at the mean of the conditional wages distribution. This paper, instead, observes the heterogeneity of the overeducation penalty along the wage distribution and according to Ph.D. holders' study field and sector of employment (academic/non-academic). We implement a Recentered Influence Function (RIF) to estimate an hourly wage equation and compare PhD holders who are over-educated with those who are not. The results reveal that overeducation hits the wages of those Ph.D. holders who are employed in the academic sector and in non-R&D jobs outside of the academic sector. Instead, no penalty exists among those who carry out R&D outside the Academia. The size of the penalty is higher among those who are in the mid-top of the wage distribution and hold a Social Science and Humanities specialization.
J28|School-Age Bullying, Workplace Bullying and Job Satisfaction: Experiences of LGB People in Britain|Using a data set that contains information on retrospective school-age bullying, as well as on workplace bullying in the respondents' present job, the outcomes of this study suggest that bullying, when it is experienced by sexual orientation minorities tends to persist over time. According to the estimations, it seems that school-age bullying of LGB people is associated with victims' lower educational level and occupational sorting into non-white-collar jobs, especially for gay/bisexual men. In addition, the outputs suggest that for both gay/bisexual men and lesbian/bisexual women, school-age bullying is positively associated with workplace bullying and negatively associated with job satisfaction. Additional results suggest a negative association between workplace bullying and job satisfaction. However, the outcomes show a positive association between the existence of an LGBT group in the workplace and job satisfaction.
J28|Wage Satisfaction and Wage History: How the Present Shapes the Past|"Although satisfaction measures strongly depend on personal history, the relationship between memory and current well-being is still unclear. This article is dedicated to empirically investigating if current wage satisfaction affects the ability to date past wage changes. We match answers from a French national survey with administrative records, to compare the recalled and actual wage history. Our data support and extend some previous findings from the psychology literature: relatively remote events are recalled as closer in time, while relatively recent events are recalled as further in time. An instrumental variable strategy shows that these effects – respectively known as ""forward"" and ""backward telescoping"" – are partially caused by current satisfaction, so that, ceteris paribus, people who are satisfied with their wage tend to date wage cuts as more remote than they actually are. We suggest that this pattern of imperfect recall, which we denote as hedonic telescoping, opens a new perspective in the understanding of the well-known phenomenon of hedonic adaptation."
J28|Has the Economic Crisis Worsened the Work-Related Stress and Mental Health of Temporary Workers in Spain?|This paper analyses the causal effects of temporary employment on work-related stress and mental health before (2006/07) and during the economic crisis (2011/12) and examines whether the economic recession worsened these two health outcomes. To control for selection bias, propensity scores (PS) are computed separately for men and women using microdata from two cross-sectional surveys, considering temporary (treatment group) versus permanent employment (control group). Next, we use difference-in-differences estimators stratifying by age, education level, and regional unemployment differences using PS as weights. Our results indicate that a male salaried worker with a temporary labour contract tends to have lower levels of work-related stress in the pre-crisis period, but not for women. The stratification analysis shows lower work-related stress levels among older male adults, workers with a high education level, and employees in regions with high unemployment rates. The economic crisis is responsible for increasing stress only among older temporary workers and male university graduates, without affecting women. We also see evidence of a positive link between temporary employment and poor mental health in both periods, although only for men. We neither find significant impacts for our sample of men or women, nor for most of our population subgroups with the exception of male workers with a university degree.
J28|How Much Does Others' Protection Matter? Employment Protection, Future Labour Market Prospects and Well-Being|Employment protection legislation (EPL) is an important determinant of workers’ perceived future labour market prospects as well as their subjective well-being. Recent studies indicate that it is not only a worker’s own level of protection, but also the employment protection of other workers that matters for individual prospects and well-being. We contribute to this literature by examining how such cross-effects on well-being are mediated by a workers’ perceived risk of job loss and future employability. We apply a structural model to data from the Third Wave of the European Quality of Life Survey, combined with summary indices from the OECD Employment Protection Database. Our results are indicative of cross-effects. Stricter protection for permanent workers (stricter regulation on the length and number of renewals of fixed-term contracts) is associated with lower (higher) perceived employability for both permanent workers and fixed-term workers. In addition, stricter protection for permanent workers is positively related to fixed-term workers’ perceived risk of job loss. We do find some evidence that EPL has significant indirect (cross-)effects on life satisfaction via the mediators. There are no indications for direct, non-mediated effects.
J28|Looking for the Bright Side of the China Syndrome: Rising Export Opportunities and Life Satisfaction in China|"China's increased export capacity in recent decades has disrupted developed-country labor markets and the well-being of workers exposed to foreign competition. We here attempt to complete the assessment of the social and human consequences of globalization by exploring the other side of this ""China syndrome"". We evaluate the extent to which increased export opportunities have influenced well-being in China using panel data on approximately 25,000 adults across 122 Chinese localities in 2010, 2012 and 2014. The results show that perceived life satisfaction rises significantly as local export markets grow. This effect goes beyond higher local GDP per capita and individual incomes."
J28|Employee Involvement and Job Satisfaction: A Tale of the Millennial Generation|The purpose of this paper is to empirically study the effect of employee involvement in the workplace on job satisfaction for millennial workers in Colombia. Data were obtained from a sample of 2103 millennial employees working in 11 companies of different sectors located in the five main cities of Colombia. Ordered probit models were estimated to study the effect of employee involvement on job satisfaction, in general, and how different forms of participative decision-making in the workplace produce different impacts on individual satisfaction with objective and intrinsic aspects of the job, in particular. The empirical results show that, for millennial workers, there is a positive link between employee involvement and job satisfaction. Moreover, there is a higher positive impact on job satisfaction when millennial workers participate in decisions on general aspects of the company than when they participate in specific decisions such as those concerning teamwork or main tasks at work. Another interesting result is that millennial workers attach high importance to intrinsic aspects of their jobs (such as the possibility to use their knowledge in the work), which may improve their satisfaction in a higher participative environment.
J28|Job satisfaction, time allocation and labour supply|This paper reinterprets the neoclassical theory of labour supply by introducing job satisfaction into the utility function of the worker. This integration is feasible and also straightforward from a theoretical point of view and, furthermore, it produces interesting results. Precisely, this extended version of the standard model of labour supply can describe situations in which working produces utility beyond consumption, with the result that the disutility of giving up leisure time is lowered or even reversed. As a result, the paper is able to reconcile the standard theory of labour supply with the well-established finding of happiness research, according to which working could yield substantial non-monetary benefits.
J28|Different Strokes for Different Folks: Entrepreneurs' Job Satisfaction and the Intersection of Gender and Migration Background|Migrant enterprises comprise about 10% of all enterprises in Germany and are therefore a crucial part of the German economy and its entrepreneurial ecosystems. Relatedly, migrant entrepreneurship is a highly recognized topic within political discussions as well as within entrepreneurship research. While there is already an impressive body of work regarding the nature and quality of migrant enterprises, many questions regarding the personal motives and satisfaction of migrant entrepreneurs still remain unanswered (particularly with reference to gender and generation of migration). Using the German Socio-Economic Panel dataset, we close this research gap by investigating the job satisfaction of migrant entrepreneurs in Germany compared with native entrepreneurs, and also with conventionally employed migrants and natives. First generation migrants show, in general, less job satisfaction than the native population. Second generation male migrant entrepreneurs’ show less job satisfaction, however this association is reversed for females: second generation female migrant entrepreneurs are more satisfied with their self-employment than their native counterparts. These differing results lead to differing implications for policy makers who wish to create and develop entrepreneurial and labour market support for different target groups.
J28|The Impact of Minimum Wages on Well-Being: Evidence from a Quasi-Experiment in Germany|To analyze well-being effects of minimum wages, the introduction of a minimum wage in Germany in 2015 is used as a quasi-experiment. Based on the representative SOEP data, a difference-in-differences design compares the development of life, job, and pay satisfaction between those who are affected by the reform according to their pre-intervention wages and those who already have marginally higher wages so that they are not directly affected. The results show that the minimum wage has significantly positive effects on all considered dimensions of well-being, on average, with an increase in life satisfaction by 0.10 standard deviations (0.15 points on a ten-point Likert scale). Positive effects last at least until one year after the reform. Life satisfaction tends to increase particularly in the region that is overall economically less developed (East Germany). The results hold if those who are not employed anymore after the reform are included in the analysis.
J28|Concentration and Other Wage Determinants|This research presents evidence on how the impact of industry concentration and unionism affect the Portuguese wage levels. The influence of employer association is also considered. We use sector information - two-digit level disaggregation of “Classificação das Actividades Económicas” -, and control for other wage determinants, as usually done in earnings functions regressions. Dependent variables are logarithms of the mean sector wages considered for each case. Some statistical distribution indicators are also used to provide possible insights on the impact of skill composition and dispersion - eventually reflecting good assignment of people to jobs and/or tasks - on productivity and, thus, production.
J28|Incentives Can Reduce Bias in Online Reviews|Online reviews are a powerful means of propagating the reputations of products, services, and even employers. However, existing research suggests that online reviews often suffer from selection bias—people with extreme opinions are more motivated to share them than people with moderate opinions, resulting in biased distributions of reviews. Providing incentives for reviewing has the potential to reduce this selection bias, because incentives can mitigate the motivational deficit of people who hold moderate opinions. Using data from one of the leading employer review companies, Glassdoor, we show that voluntary reviews have a different distribution from incentivized reviews. The likely bias in the distribution of voluntary reviews can affect workers’ choice of employers, because it changes the ranking of industries by average employee satisfaction. Because observational data from Glassdoor are not able to provide a measure of the true distribution of employer reviews, we complement our investigation with a randomized controlled experiment on MTurk. We find that when participants’ decision to review their employer is voluntary, the resulting distribution of reviews differs from the distribution of forced reviews. Moreover, providing relatively high monetary rewards or a pro-social cue as incentives for reviewing reduces this bias. We conclude that while voluntary employer reviews often suffer from selection bias, incentives can significantly reduce bias and help workers make more informed employer choices.
J28|Impacto económico de los 26 principales proyectos de cobre del Perú, en los siguientes 20 años|En el 2016 y 2017, Perú se consolidó como segundo productor de cobre en Latinoamérica y en el mundo. La presente investigación tiene como objetivo cuantificar el impacto que tendría en la economía peruana la puesta en marcha de los 26 principales proyectos mineros de cobre que forman parte de la cartera estimada de inversión minera del Ministerio de Energía y Minas. Es importante mencionar que el monto total de inversión para los 26 proyectos suma US$ 44,229 millones. El impacto de la ejecución de dichos proyectos se cuantifica con los siguientes indicadores: monto estimado de producción de cobre, impuestos (impuesto a la renta y canon minero, impuesto especial a la minería y regalías mineras), exportaciones y generación de empleo.
J28|Unfairness at work: Well-being and quits|We here consider the effect of the level of income that individuals consider to be fair for the job they do, which we take as measure of comparison income, on both subjective well-being and objective future job quitting. In six waves of German Socio-Economic Panel data, the extent to which own labour income is perceived to be unfair is significantly negatively correlated with subjective well-being, both in terms of cognitive evaluations (life and job satisfaction) and affect (the frequency of feeling happy, sad and angry). Perceived unfairness also translates into objective labour-market behaviour, with current unfair income predicting future job quits.
J28|Wage Satisfaction and Wage History: How the Present Shapes the Past|Although satisfaction measures strongly depend on personal history, the relationship between memory and current well-being is still unclear. This article is dedicated to empirically investigating if current wage satisfaction affects the ability to date past wage changes. We match answers from a French national survey with administrative records, to compare the recalled and actual wage history. Our data support and extend some previous findings from the psychology literature: relatively remote events are recalled as closer in time, while relatively recent events are recalled as further in time. An instrumental variable strategy shows that these effects – respectively known as “forward” and “backward telescoping” – are partially caused by current satisfaction, so that, ceteris paribus, people who are satisfied with their wage tend to date wage cuts as more remote than they actually are. We suggest that this pattern of imperfect recall, which we denote as hedonic telescoping, opens a new perspective in the understanding of the well-known phenomenon of hedonic adaptation.
J28|Employment of people with a history of sickness absence|This register-based follow-up study focuses on the association between workplace characteristics and recruitment of people with a history of sickness absence. The aim was to study whether recruitment differs with regard to workplace sector, number of employees, gender composition, educational level and average age, and whether these workplaces recruit differently with regard to gender and diagnosis. Swedish workplaces with five employees or more in 2012 were chosen (n = 138 081). The results showed that workplaces most likely to recruit people with a history of sickness absence were those characterized by being in the public and non-profit sector, being female-dominated, having few employees, a high proportion of low educated employees and a high average age. The likelihood of recruiting people with different diagnoses was, with a few exceptions, similar between various types of workplaces. Recruitment of men and women with a history of sickness absence was similar between the different workplaces.
J28|Self-employment and Life Satisfaction among the Elderly: Survey-based Evidence from Sweden|This paper compares life satisfaction among the elderly (61 years of age or older) who are self-employed, wage-employed or out of the labour force in Sweden with the help of a unique survey. Sweden is interesting since the share of elderly, just as in other countries, has increased during the last decade. Encouraging the elderly to remain in the labour force is now high on the political agenda. We find that people who are self-employed report higher life satisfaction than people who are wage-employed or out of the labour force. General health is a strong determinant of life satisfaction but the differences among the groups remain when we control for health related variables. Further, the self-employed report higher job satisfaction than the wage-employed, and find their work less mentally straining or stressful. Even though our results are driven by different types of selection, we conclude that they underline the need for a flexible working life. Stimulating self-employment among older people may be an effective way to improve their life satisfaction, to increase Sweden’s labour supply and to keep older people in the labour force.
J28|(I Can’t Get No) Job Satisfaction? Differences by Sexual Orientation in Sweden|We present results from a unique nationwide survey conducted in Sweden on sexual orientation and job satisfaction. Our results show that gay men, on average, seem more satisfied with their job than heterosexual men; lesbians appear less satisfied with their job than heterosexual women. However, the issue of sexual orientation and job satisfaction is complex since gay men, despite their high degree of job satisfaction, like lesbians find their job more mentally straining than heterosexuals. We conclude that gay men and lesbians are facing other stressers at work than heterosexuals do. We also conclude that discrimination and prejudice may lead gay men to have low expectations about their job; these low expectations may translate into high job satisfaction. In contrast, prejudice and discrimination may hinder lesbians from realizing their career plans, resulting in low job satisfaction.
J28|Gender inequality and the gender job satisfaction paradox in Europe|Although women are paid less than men, face worse working conditions, lower promotion opportunities, and work-place discrimination, they typically report job satisfaction higher or similar to men's. Twenty years ago Clark (Clark, 1997) suggested that the reason behind women's higher job satisfaction are their lower expectations, driven by a number of factors related to current and past positions of women on the labour market. Although this hypothesis is one of the leading explanations of the gender differences in the job satisfaction, cross-country research investigating the relationship between the gender inequality and gender job satisfaction gap are rare and only descriptive. In this paper we use the data from EU-SILC module on subjective well being from 2013 to analyse adjusted gender job satisfaction gaps in 32 European countries and relate them to the country differences in gender inequalities. Results provide extensive and robust evidence of a relationship between exposure to more gender equal settings in the early stages of life and smaller gender gaps in job satisfaction, once all other possible drivers are controlled for. This suggests that women who experienced higher gender equality have expectations increasingly aligned to those of their male counterparts. Our results also show that this alignment is further favoured by being employed in typically male occupations, whereas higher levels of education do not play a similar effect.
J28|Rather a trigger than a cause of change.Responses of firms and workers to the statutory minimum wage in Germany| The introduction of the statutory minimum wage in Germany directly affected firms with wage earners paid less than EUR 8.50 per hour. This paper studies a variety of responses by employers and employees to adapt to this shock, in particular changes in compensation packages, employment at the extensive and intensive margin, working conditions, and position in product markets. Strategies of non-compliance are also in focus. The analysis is qualitative and based on 131 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with firm representatives, workers and members of work councils. A key finding is that while many firms and workers changed behavior with the introduction of the minimum wage, these changes are less response to concomitant changes in labor costs. Rather, it appears that the reform at many workplaces served as a catalyst to trigger or accelerate pending change processes.
J28|Inequality, employment and public policy|This paper examines dimensions of inequality including labour market inequalities and discusses public policies needed for reduction in inequalities. It discusses both inequality of outcomes and inequality of opportunities. In terms of income, India is the second highest inequality country in the world next to South Africa. Wealth inequalities are also high in India. Most of the inequalities will have labour market dimension. Labour market inequalities can be found across sectors, wages and earnings, quality of work, labour market access and, between organised and unorganised sectors. On public policies and inequalities, the paper discusses redistribution measures, macro policies, sectoral policies and impact on employment, social policies such as education, health, hunger and malnutrition, social protection, corruption, gender disparities and climate change. The paper argues for fundamentals change to human capital and universal basic services. Investments in social infrastructure, health, education, affirmative action and provision of public services can lead to the creation of egalitarian society.
J28|Overeducation wage penalty among Ph.D. holders. An unconditional quantile regression analysis on Italian data|The wage effect of overeducation has only recently been investigated in the case of Ph.D. holders. The existing contributions rely on OLS estimates that allow measuring the average effect of being educationally mismatched at the mean of the conditional wage distribution. This paper, instead, observes the heterogeneity of the overeducation penalty along the hourly wage distribution and according to the study field and sector of employment (academic/non-academic) of Ph.D. holders. We estimate a Recentered Influence Function. The results reveal that overeducation hits the wages of those Ph.D. holders who are employed in the academic sector and in non-R&D jobs outside of the academic sector. Instead, no penalty exists among those who carry out R&D outside the Academia. The size of the penalty is higher among those who are in the mid-top of the wage distribution and hold a Social Science and Humanities specialization.
J28|Job Satisfaction among Young Workers in Eastern and Southern Africa: A Comparative Analysis|The creation of job opportunities for the increasingly educated youth population is a major current policy challenge in sub-Saharan Africa, even though very little is known about the extent to which young workers in the region are satisfied with the employment they currently have. This paper aims to help to fill this latter gap by presenting an analysis of job satisfaction of youth aged 15-29 in four countries from Eastern and Southern Africa: Madagascar, Malawi, Uganda and Zambia. We estimate ordered probit models of the degree of satisfaction in a respondent's main job, using data from the School-to-work Transition Survey (SWTS). It turns out that while a majority of workers are satisfied with their work, a large minority are not. We find that being over-educated or under-educated for the current job is strongly and negatively correlated with job satisfaction in all four countries. With respect to employment status, we find that those who report having chosen to be self-employed are substantially most satisfied in all four countries compared to formal sector wage employees, after controlling for many other factors. Formal wage employees are more satisfied than informal employees in only two of the four countries. These results reinforce the case made by Fields (2014) for not assuming that all self-employment is a 'last resort'. They also raise questions about the quality of available wage jobs for young people.
J28|The Effect of Prenatal Maternity Leave on Short and Long-term Child Outcomes|Maternity leave policies are presumed to be essential to ensure the health of pregnant workers and their unborn children. However, little is known about the optimal duration of prenatal maternity leave and existing policies are not evidence-based. We evaluate a substantial maternity leave extension in Austria, which increased mandatory leave prior to birth from six to eight weeks. Our estimation strategy exploits that the eligibility for the extended leave was determined by a cutoff due date. As an additional source of exogenous variation, we use information on non-working mothers, who are not eligible for maternity leave. Across estimations, we consistently find no evidence for significant effects of this extension on children’s health at birth, subsequent maternal health and fertility, and longterm human capital outcomes of children. Our finding is confirmed by a supplementary cross-country panel analysis.
J28|How Has the Two-Day Weekend Policy Affected Labour Supply and Household Work in China?|This paper examines the effects of working time reduction policy on labour supply (hours of work and whether an individual takes a second job) and household production, by exploiting the Chinese Two-Day Weekend Policy, which effectively reduced weekly working days from six to five in May 1995, as a natural experiment. We construct a theoretical model that predicts a decline in labour supply in both private and public sectors as work hours were reduced. In theory, the time spent on household production may increase or decrease or the time spent on the second job may increase or decrease depending on how much agents care about household production or the income from a second job. Using the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we adopt a difference-in-differences strategy to estimate the policy effects on work hours of wage earners in both public and private sectors. Relative to the control group deemed unaffected by the policy change, our estimates show that the Two-Day Weekend Policy significantly reduced the working hours of wage earners by 4 percent and the public sector by 5 percent while increasing the probability of having a second job by 3 percent and reducing the time spent on household work by 98-107 minutes per week. The results are robust to different specifications and a propensity score matching technique.
J28|School-age bullying, workplace bullying and job satisfaction: Experiences of LGB people in Britain|Using a data set that contains information on retrospective school-age bullying, as well as on workplace bullying in the respondents’ present job, the outcomes of this study suggest that bullying, when it is experienced by sexual orientation minorities tends to persist over time. According to the estimations, it seems that school-age bullying of LGB people is associated with victims’ lower educational level and occupational sorting into non-white-collar jobs, especially for gay/bisexual men. In addition, the outputs suggest that for both gay/bisexual men and lesbian/bisexual women, school-age bullying is positively associated with workplace bullying and negatively associated with job satisfaction. Additional results suggest a negative association between workplace bullying and job satisfaction. However, the outcomes show a positive association between the existence of an LGBT group in the workplace and job satisfaction.
J28|“Has the economic crisis worsened the work-related stress and mental health of temporary workers in Spain?”|This paper analyses the causal effects of temporary employment on work-related stress and mental health before (2006/07) and during the economic crisis (2011/12) and examines whether the economic recession worsened these two health outcomes. To control for selection bias, propensity scores (PS) are computed separately for men and women using microdata from two cross-sectional surveys, considering temporary (treatment group) versus permanent employment (control group). Next, we use difference-in-differences estimators stratifying by age, education level, and regional unemployment differences using PS as weights. Our results indicate that a male salaried worker with a temporary labour contract tends to have lower levels of work-related stress in the pre-crisis period, but not for women. The stratification analysis shows lower work-related stress levels among older male adults, workers with a high education level, and employees in regions with high unemployment rates. The economic crisis is responsible for increasing stress only among older temporary workers and male university graduates, without affecting women. We also see evidence of a positive link between temporary employment and poor mental health in both periods, although only for men. We neither find significant impacts for our sample of men or women, nor for most of our population subgroups with the exception male workers with a university degree.
J28|Child Sleep and Maternal Labour Market Outcomes|We show that sleep deprivation exerts strong negative effects on mothers' labour market performance. To isolate exogenous variations in maternal sleep, we exploit unique variations in child sleep disruption using a UK panel dataset that follows mother-child pairs through time. We find that sleeping one hour less per night on average significantly decreases maternal labour force participation, the number of hours worked, and household income. We identify one mechanism driving the effects, namely the influence of maternal sleep on selection into full-time versus part-time work. Increased schedule flexibility for mothers with sufficient tenure mitigates the negative effects of sleep deprivation.
J28|Combat, Casualties, and Compensation: Evidence from Iraq and Afghanistan|Our research examines the effect of combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan on casualties. We use restricted data from the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) and Social Security Administration (SSA) to construct a panel of all U.S. Active Duty service members having served at some point during the years 2001-2012. Casualties disproportionately occur at higher rates among (i) young, white, males (ii) enlisted personnel (iii) less educated personnel (iv) and those in combat job types. Our estimates indicate that overall U.S. military personnel who deployed in an individual year to Iraq or Afghanistan had a 48 per 100,000 higher probability of death than non-deployed military personnel who remained stateside. The increased fatal injury risk of deployed U.S. military personnel is 15 times higher than the national average civilian workplace fatality rate, but roughly equal to the fatal injury risk faced in some of the most dangerous civilian occupations. Our estimates suggest a compensating wage differential equal to $808 per month would be appropriate, in comparison to the current status quo of $225 per month in danger pay (and additional tax benefits) provided to U.S. military personnel deployed into combat zones. The additional compensation should also be adjusted by service or job type.
J28|How Common Are Bad Bosses?|Bosses play an important role in workplaces. Yet little is currently known about a foundational question. Are the right people promoted to be managers, team leaders, and supervisors? Gallup data and the famous Peter Principle both suggest that incompetent bosses are likely to be all around us. This paper's results uncover a different, and more nuanced, conclusion. By taking data on 35 nations, the paper provides the first statistically representative international estimates of the extent to which employees have 'bad bosses'. Using a simple, and arguably natural, measure, the paper calculates that approximately 13% of Europe's workers have a bad boss. These bosses are most common in the Transport sector and large organizations. The paper discusses its methodology, performs validation checks, and reviews other data and implications.
J28|Works Councils, Training and Employee Satisfaction|This paper investigates the role of works councils in job satisfaction. Using the recently developed Linked Personnel Panel, we consider both the direct and indirect impact via further training. Basic estimates on an individual level do not reveal clearly direct effects, but on an establishment level, the existence of a works council increases the average job satisfaction in a company. In more extended approaches, we also find a positive, weakly significant link on an individual level accompanied by positive training with regard to job satisfaction if we control for personal characteristics, working conditions, firm size, collegiality variables and industry dummies. Firms with industry-wide bargaining agreements drive this result. The effects are stronger if the firm carries the training costs and if the share of trained workers within the firm measures training. The direct impact of works councils remains positive but becomes insignificant if Lewbel's instrumental variables estimator is applied.
J28|HPWS in the Public Sector: Are There Mutual Gains?|Few studies investigate the links between high-performance work systems (HPWS) on public sector organizational performance and worker job attitudes. We fill this gap with analyses of these links using linked employer-employee surveys of workplaces in Britain in 2004 and 2011. We find robust evidence of positive associations between the use of HPWS and organizational performance in the public sector but no associations with worker attitudes. The implication is that, in contrast to similar work on the private sector in the United States (Appelbaum et al., 2000) HPWS is not delivering mutual gains for employers and employees in the British public sector.
J28|Does Telework Stress Employees Out? A Study on Working at Home and Subjective Well-Being for Wage/Salary Workers|Using data from the 2010, 2012, and 2013 American Time Use Survey Well-Being Modules, this paper examines how subjective well-being (SWB) varies between working at home and working in the workplace among wage/salary workers. Both OLS and individual fixed-effects models are employed for estimation, and the results are largely consistent. In general, we find that working at home is associated with a lower level of net affect and a higher probability of having unpleasant feelings relative to working in the workplace. We further decompose homeworking into telework and bringing work home and find that the effect of SWB varies by types of homeworking. In comparison with working in the workplace, telework increases stress in both samples of weekdays and weekends/holidays, and it also reduces net affect and increases unpleasantness in the sample of weekends/holidays. In contrast, bringing work home on weekdays results in a lower level of net affect due to less happiness received. The only positive effect of homeworking we discover is that telework reduces tiredness on weekdays. As to the existence of gender difference in the effect of homeworking, our OLS results show that working at home is associated with positive affections for males but negative affections for females. However, fixed-effects models suggest that both males and females feel more stressed when teleworking, indicating the existence of individual heterogeneity.
J28|The Effect of Prenatal Maternity Leave on Short and Long-Term Child Outcomes|Maternity leave policies are presumed to be essential to ensure the health of pregnant workers and their unborn children. However, little is known about the optimal duration of prenatal maternity leave and existing policies are not evidence-based. We evaluate a substantial maternity leave extension in Austria, which increased mandatory leave prior to birth from six to eight weeks. Our estimation strategy exploits that the eligibility for the extended leave was determined by a cutoff due date. As an additional source of exogenous variation, we use information on non-working mothers, who are not eligible for maternity leave. Across estimations, we consistently find no evidence for significant effects of this extension on children's health at birth, subsequent maternal health and fertility, and longterm human capital outcomes of children. Our finding is confirmed by a supplementary cross-country panel analysis.
J28|Creators’ Income Situation in the Digital Age|The digital transformation imposes both opportunities and risks for creativity and for creative employment, with implications for trends in income levels and the distribution of income. First, we consider skill-biased technological change as a determinant of income and labor market outcomes in the arts. Arguably, the IT revolution has changed the demand for certain skills, with creative occupations being more in demand than general employment. Second, we consider declines in the costs of generating new works and artistic experimentation due to digital technologies, and their effect on the barriers to entry in labor markets. Third, we touch upon the rise of online contract labor in certain creative professions as a determinant of income. Here, online platforms can change creators’ access to work opportunities and it may alter the way income is distributed. We find that wage trends for creative workers in the digital age outperform general trends in the population: based on various data sources and various ways to identify creators, we see creators losing less or even gaining a better income position in relative terms. From a policy perspective, results do not lend support to the idea that creators’ income situation has systematically worsened with the rise of the internet and its intermediaries. Evidence on changing distributions of income is ambiguous as trends differ from one country to the next.
J28|The Asymmetric Experience of Gains and Losses in Job Security on Health|Is workers’ health more sensitive to losses than gains in job security? While loss aversion, whereby losses loom larger than gains, is typically examined in relation to decisions about anticipated outcomes, I first show using a large sample of workers from the Euro- pean Household Community Panel and value-added models that losses in job security have a larger effect on health than equivalent job security gains. Second, I address endogeneity issues using the 1999 rise in the French Delalande tax as a quasi-natural experiment. It allows evaluating separately the causal impact of exogenous gains and losses in job security on workers’ health. Difference-in-differences estimation results confirm that lower job security generates significant and robust losses in self-assessed health. Meanwhile a greater feeling of job security does not translate into a higher level of self-assessed health. These results are in line with the predictions of the model linking job security to health under the hypothesis of loss aversion built in this paper. This article also demonstrates that losses in health induced by lower job security are not transitory.

J28|Do Opioids Help Injured Workers Recover and Get Back to Work? The Impact of Opioid Prescriptions on Duration of Temporary Disability|We estimate the effect of opioid prescriptions on the duration of temporary disability benefits among workers with work-related low back injuries. We use local opioid prescribing patterns to construct an instrumental variable that generates variation in opioid prescriptions but is arguably unrelated to injury severity or other factors directly affecting disability duration. Local prescribing patterns have a strong relationship with whether injured workers receive opioid prescriptions, including longer-term prescriptions. We find that more longer-term opioid prescribing leads to considerably longer duration of temporary disability, but there is little effect of a small number of opioid prescriptions over a short period of time.
J28|Are Recessions Good for Government Hires? The Effect of Unemployment on Public Sector Human Capital|Utilizing a large dataset on U.S. federal government employees covering 24 years, we estimate and analyze the persistent wage effect of entering government employment during recessions for recent college graduates and other new employees. Contrary to previous results in the literature for private sector employees, we document a significant and long-term wage increase for federal civil servants who enter government service in recessions. We show this result is robust to alternative samples and model specifications. We conclude by examining agency occupation composition and job matching as mechanisms for these results.
J28|The Changing (Dis-)utility of Work|We study how changes in the distribution of occupations have affected the aggregate non-pecuniary costs and benefits of working. The physical toll of work is less now than in 1950, with workers shifting away from occupations in which people report experiencing tiredness and pain. The emotional consequences of the changing occupation distribution vary substantially across demographic groups. Work has become happier and more meaningful for women, but more stressful and less meaningful for men. These changes appear to be concentrated at lower education levels.
J28|I only get some satisfaction: Introducing satisfaction into measures of accessibility|Improving accessibility is a goal pursued by many metropolitan regions to address a variety of objectives. Accessibility, or the ease of reaching destinations, is traditionally measured using observed travel time and has of yet not accounted for user satisfaction with these travel times. As trip satisfaction is a major component of the underlying psychology of travel, we introduce satisfaction into accessibility measures and demonstrate its viability for future use. To do so, we generate a new satisfaction-based measure of accessibility where the impedance functions are determined from the travel time data of satisfying trips gathered from the 2017/2018 McGill Transport Survey. This satisfaction-based measure is used to calculate accessibility to jobs by four modes (public transport, car, walking, and cycling) in the Montreal metropolitan region, with the results then compared to a standard gravity-based measure of accessibility. We then offer a dissatisfaction index where we combine the ratio between satisfaction-based and gravity-based accessibility measures with mode share data. This index highlights areas with potentially high proportions of dissatisfied commuters and where interventions for each mode could have the highest impacts on the quality of life of a given mode commuter. Such analysis is then combined with a vulnerability index to show the value of this measure in setting priorities for vulnerable groups. The study demonstrates the importance of including satisfaction in accessibility measures and allows for a more nuanced interpretation of the ease of access by researchers, planners, and policy-makers.
J28|Job Quality, Health and Productivity: An evidence-based framework for analysis|The nature, content and milieu of work – i.e. the quality of the working environment – matter in many ways for people, firms and society as a whole. There is a great deal of evidence to show clear associations between job quality and the health of workers, their ability to successfully combine work and life while fully mobilising their skills and abilities to build a career, and their productivity. Investments in quality working environments can be welfare enhancing and economically efficient. Policies and practices reflect these findings insufficiently, an apparent paradox that finds its roots in various market failures. There is scope for public intervention to raise awareness, to ensure better coordination of key stakeholders (employers, workers’ representatives and various public entities) and to put in place the right financial incentives for firms to invest in better working conditions. Action in this field is also important in view of ongoing considerable changes in the labour market. The future of work is very uncertain at this stage; the digitalisation and uberisation of work have the potential for improvements in working conditions but also bear the risk of de-skilling, lower pay, lower job security and poor working conditions for parts of the labour force.
J28|Hedonic recall bias. Why you should not ask people how much they earn|The empirical literature which explores the effect of wage on job satisfaction typically uses data drawn from social surveys. In these surveys, the amount of wage is reported by the respondents themselves: thus, the explanatory variable of the econometric models may differ from the true wage people earn. Our paper shows that the use of survey data can lead to considerable over-estimation of the importance of wage as a determinant of wage satisfaction. In particular, responses seem to be affected by a recall bias: people who are satisfied with their wage are more likely to over-report their wage in questionnaires. The more satisfied they are the more they over-report (and vice versa unsatisfied people). We name this behavioral disposition “hedonic recall bias”.
J28|Partial employment protection and perceived job security: evidence from France|This paper assesses the causal effect of partial employment protection on workers’ subjective job security via the perceived probability of layoff. We consider the rise in the French Delalande tax, which is paid by private firms if they lay off older workers. This reform was restricted to large firms and therefore allows us to use a difference-in-differences strategy. In ECHP data, we find that the change in the perceived probability of layoffs induced by the higher Delalande tax improved the subjective job security of older (protected) workers, but at the cost of a negative externality on other workers. The changes in job security in both groups are of similar size, but as unprotected workers are the large majority of the sample, the population effect of the tax on layoffs was to reduce job security.
J28|Is work bad for health? The role of constraint vs choice|This paper reviews the literature on the impact of work on health. We consider work along two dimensions: (i) the intensive margin, i.e. how many hours an individual works and (ii) the extensive margin, i.e. whether an individual is in employment or not, independent of the number of hours worked. We show that most of the evidence on the negative health impact of work found in the literature is based on situations in which workers have essentially no control (no choice) over the amount of work they provide. In essence, what is detrimental to health is not so much work per se as much as the gap which may exist between the actual and the desired amount of work, both at the intensive and extensive margins.
J28|The causal effect of multitasking on work-related mental health - the more you do, the worse you feel|This paper analyses whether there is a causal relationship between work-related mental health problems and multitasking, the number of tasks performed at work. The data comes from two cross sectional surveys on the German working population. The empirical strategies uses technological change as an instrument for multitasking. In the first stage, the introduction of new production and information technologies is associated with increases in multitasking. Production technology adoption has larger associations to manual multitasking and informational technology adoption to cognitive multitasking. There is evidence for a causal effect of multitasking on emotional strain, emotional exhaustion and burnout.
J28|The task composition and work-related mental health - a descriptive study|This paper analyzes the relationship between work-related mental health problems and multitasking (the number of different tasks at work) in two cross sections from the German working population in 2006 and 2012. The analysis is exploratory and hence, descriptive. For an additional task, medium severe and severe work-related mental health problems increase by 0.02 standard deviations. Absenteeism and presenteeism due to work-related mental health problems rise by one percentage point. This is driven by tasks that require interaction with other human beings but not by the simultaneity of tasks. The estimates appear small at first sight but multitasking increased by nearly one task from 2006 to 2012. The loss in gross value added due to the rise in absenteeism and presenteeism amounts to roughly 1 billion euro.
J28|Education and work-related mental health - higher educated employees are worse off|This paper analyzes the relationship between work-related mental health and education in the German working population using cross sectional survey data from 2006 and 2012. Low education is associated with lower mild health problems, higher education with increased mild and medium severe problems. In the Job Demands and Resources model, work-related mental health problems arise from an imbalance between job demands and resources. Low education is significantly associated with lower job demands and resources but not with a different stress perception of missing resources. Higher educated have significantly higher demands and resources and perceive high job demands as more stressful. Education is also associated with less job satisfaction but there is suggestive evidence for monetary and some non-monetary compensation.
J28|Assessing the Propensity for Presenteeism with Sickness Absence Data|Presenteeism occurs when an employee attends work while sick or unwell. It is a major Human Resource and organizational issue: in addition to productivity losses, presenteeism is believed to increase sickness absence and decrease self-rated health. However, by its very nature, presenteeism cannot be monitored in the same manner as sickness absence. We show how the probability of presenteeism can be estimated from simple absence data by means of a zero-inflated binomial regression analysis (ZINB). The approach is validated on a Danish data set that contains self-reported sickness absence and presenteeism, whereas causality and reliability are verified by conducting Monte-Carlo simulations. The objective of paper was to explore how far the traditional but costly tool used to assess presenteeism behaviour, a questionnaire, could advantageously be replaced by a statistical approach that relies on easily available information on sickness. We show that the ZINB model captures presenteeism well via the inflation process and delivers insight on both absenteeism and presenteeism. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we further highlight that the model can be used to compute a global indicator, propensity for presenteeism, even when important assumptions are violated.
J28|What makes employees satisfied with their working time? : The role of working hours, time-sovereignty and working conditions for working time and job satisfaction|"""Working time arrangements are key elements of working conditions and determine the possibilities for employees to balance work with their other life spheres. Therefore, this paper examines the level of working time satisfaction of employees and identifies the factors that may facilitate or impede satisfaction with working time using crosssectional data from the German BIBB/BAuA-Employment Survey. The analytical basis is a generalized ordered logistic regression model. The main results indicate that individual time-sovereignty is positively linked with a high level of working time satisfaction. Worker-friendly working time arrangements, which lead to less stress, insecurity and mental pressure, increase satisfaction levels, whereas atypical working time arrangements, such as unpaid overtime and working shifts, weekends and under high intensity, reduce satisfaction levels.""

J28|The Careers of Teachers in Australia: A Descriptive Study|This study uses longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey to provide a descriptive analysis of teacher careers in Australia, looking at transitions in and out of teaching, the length of spells spent teaching, remuneration and job satisfaction in both government and non-government school sectors. Each year, approximately 14 per cent of teachers leave teaching (becoming a principal is not counted as leaving teaching). Most who leave return to teaching at some stage, commonly after a gap of just one or two years. This absence from teaching is typically associated with starting a family. Overall, teachers are just as satisfied with their jobs as other professionals, and express aboveaverage levels of job satisfaction in relation to job security, but below average satisfaction in relation to job flexibility (i.e. work/life balance). Those who left teaching recorded substantially lower job satisfaction on all aspects of their job while teaching, which su gests they were no longer well suited to teaching. The starting wages of full-time teachers are similar to those of other full-time professions, but their wages grow much more slowly with experience than other professions, for both males and females.
J28|Contribution Of High-Level Structures For Management Integration, Aportes De La Estructura De Alto Nivel En La Gestion Integrada|"This article presents the results of a study analyzing the contributions of the high-level structure proposed by the International Organization for Standardization ISO. The goal is to meet the requirements on quality management and management of health and safety working in private sector organizations. To do this, the scientific literature was consulted. This search was performed using the key terms ""integrated management"", ""integration of management systems"" and ""High-level structure. Additionally, an iterative search of the publications of the two main authors took place. Further, the current legal regulations in Colombia were analyzed on applicable management companies analyzed. The texts that met the criteria were retrieved and analyzed following the methodology of critical reading on the proposal for Alvarado 2012. They were subsequently contrasted with Annex SL directives of ISO / IEC. We concluded that highlevel structure facilitates the integrated quality management and safety and health at work and optimizes resources to achieve the objectives organizational"

Through these programs we seek to improve comprehensive dynamic improvement in universities and reward performance and encourage faculty productivity. This productivity is linked to motivation by a process of openness to change and renewal. Renewal being reflective of the results obtained in the classroom. The present study analyzes the performance of teachers at the Universidad Veracruzana. Specifically, we examine teaching in the School of Accounting and Administration campus Xalapa
J28|Temporary Employment Boom in Poland: A Job Quality vs. Quantity Trade-off?|Between 2002 and 2015, temporary employment in Poland more than doubled. Poland became the country with the highest share of temporary jobs in the EU. In this paper, we study how this process affected job quality and job quantity. We analyse the gaps between temporary and permanent workers in six dimensions of jobs quality, adopting measures proposed by the OECD and Eurofound. Of these gaps, the differences in earnings quality, job security, and work scheduling quality were the most pronounced. Job quality has improved for both groups of workers, but the gaps have not closed completely. Firms in Poland prefer to employ temporary rather than permanent workers because of the lower firing costs, tax wedges, and wages associated with temporary contracts. We use a stylised labour demand model to quantify the upper bound of a potential job creation effect due to lower labour costs incurred through the use of temporary contracts. We find that this effect did not exceed 4% of dependent employment in 2015. We cannot rule out the possibility that the net employment effect was zero. Our findings show that even if the availability of less-costly temporary contracts caused some additional jobs to be created, temporary workers suffered from lower job quality in several dimensions.
J28|The Value of a Statistical Life for Risk Averse and Risk Seeking Individuals|This paper estimates the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) under the hedonic wage method accounting for individual risk preferences. This estimation is based on a unusual approach; it empirically uses two approaches to account for risk preferences in the estimation of the wage-risk trade-off and VSL estimation. First, risk aversion is directly measured using survey-measures of preferences toward hypothetical gambles, and second observed individual behaviors, that may proxy for risk preferences such as smoking status are used. The empirical results and the used of observed measures of risk aversion are reconciled with a theoretical model of economic behavior that predicts how the wage-risk trade-off changes as risk aversion differ across individuals. It also captures the effect of risk aversion across the wage distribution using quantile regressions to test for the modeling assumption that safety is a normal good. The VSL estimates range between 0.81 and 9.16 million dollars. The results using smoking behavior as proxies for risk attitudes are consistent with previous findings. However, directly measuring risk aversion corrects the wage-risk trade-off estimation bias in the opposite directions than when using smoking status. This suggests that, consistent with the literature that connects smoking behavior with labor market outcomes, smoking status could be capturing productivity effects due to poor health in addition to purely risk preferences. This paper contributes to the literature by mitigating potential bias that may appear due to individual rusk preferences using a novel approach.
J28|Choice of colleagues as reference group for wage comparison: does group composition matter?|Social comparison is an important issue in the context of subjective well-being. Subjective well-being is not only affected by individual salary but also by the salary of a reference group. However, in the literature the question of the choice of reference group is rarely addressed. In most studies, the reference group is considered an exogenous variable which is imposed by the analyst and is the same for all individuals. This paper assesses, in the framework of wage comparison, variables that influence the choice of colleagues as the reference group. In particular, we focus on the link between the choice of this group and the demographic characteristics of the potential reference group itself. To our knowledge, this question has not been studied in the literature. Utilizing a recent survey on working conditions and quality of working life in Luxembourg, we estimate a model of the choice of colleagues as the reference group rather than other alternatives. Due to the diversity of its labor force, Luxembourg provides an interesting context for studying the link between reference group and the demographic makeup of the firm. Our results show that the demographic characteristics of the potential reference group matter in the choice of reference group.
J28|Does Job Support Make Workers Happy?|Using linked employer-employee data for Finland we examine associations between job design and ten measures of worker wellbeing. In accordance with Karasek's (1979) model we find positive correlations between many aspects of worker wellbeing and job control. However, contrary to the model, job demands have no adverse effects on worker wellbeing. We find a strong positive correlation between job support and all aspects of worker wellbeing that is independent of job controls and job demands, a finding that has not been emphasized in the literature. The effects are most pronounced in relation to supervisor support. We also find evidence of unemployment scarring effects: substantial experience of unemployment has long-term consequences for the wellbeing workers experience in their current jobs, even controlling for the quality of those jobs.
J28|Native-Migrant Differences in Trading Off Wages and Workplace Safety|Applying propensity score reweighting to Italian administrative data covering the period 1994-2012, we study the conditional distributions of injuries by wage of native and foreign workers and distinguish between the component that is explained by observable characteristics and the component that is instead attributable to the immigrant status. Our analyses highlight some stylized facts. Besides a substantial gap in wage and injury risk that cannot be attributed to differences in the characteristics, foreign workers face higher levels of risk by the same level of wages. The gap is significantly above the level predicted by their observable characteristics by remunerations that are close to the minimum wage level set by collective bargaining. After this threshold, injury rates decline, but less steeply for foreign workers than their observable characteristics would predict. We show that the hedonic wage model could explain the first result as a corner solution whereby workers with low wage potential are forced to accept higher levels of risk due to the lower bounds on minimum wage. The second results could simply be explained by assuming different utility functions for natives and foreigners. We also show that the hedonic wage model is compatible with the marked reduction in injury rates and in the gap that we observe in the recession years.
J28|I Can't Get No Satisfaction: The Power of Perceived Differences in Employee Retention and Turnover|This study explores the role of salary raises and the perception of employees of these salary raises on employees' intended retention and turnover. By using a unique survey data set from an American university, this study investigates a novel hypothesis that faculty perceptions of salary raises, relative to their perceptions of other faculty members' assessments of the raises, influences their labor supply. Using both Ordered Probit and OLS modelling frameworks, we focus on the impact of salary raises and the relative perception of these raises on intended labor supply behavior. We explore a hypothesis that a mismatch between one's ranking of the salary raise and the perception of others' rankings causes dissatisfaction. Our results provide evidence that salary raises themselves are effective monetary tools to reduce turnover; however, our results also suggest that relative deprivation as a comparison of one's own perceptions of a salary raise with others affects employee retention. We find that employees who have less favorable perceptions of salary adjustments, compared to what they believe their colleagues think, are more likely to seek another employer, holding their own perception of raises constant. Conversely, more favorable views of salary raises, compared to how faculty members think other's perceived the salary raises, does not have a statistically significant impact on retention. Our results indicate that monetary rewards in the form of salary raises do impact employee retention; however, perception of fairness of these salary raises is also as important as the actual raises. Given the high cost of job turnover, these findings suggest that employers would benefit from devoting resources toward ensuring that salary- and raise-determining procedures are generally perceived by the vast majority of employees as being fair. This is the first study that explores the employee satisfaction with salary raises relative to perceptions of other employees' satisfaction with salary raises, and intended labor supply in an American university.
J28|Does a satisfied student make a satisfied worker?|We investigate the effect of satisfaction at higher education on job satisfaction using propensity score matching, the special regressor method and a unique European dataset for graduates. Acknowledging that perceptions of satisfaction at higher education are endogenous to job satisfaction, we present models available to address this endogeneity. Our analysis confirms that a positive university experience is important for success in future employment and suggests that emphasis should be focused on the utility of participating in third-level education along with academic outcomes.
J28|Access to and returns from unpaid graduate internships|We use the Destination of Leavers from Higher Education Survey (DLHE) to estimate the socio-economic gradient in access to unpaid internships among English and Welsh graduates six months after completing their first degree, and the return to this internship experience 3 years later in terms of salary, occupation, contract type and career satisfaction. We show a significant salary penalty at 3.5 years after graduation compared with those going straight into paid work or further study, but also that graduates from higher socio-economic status have an advantage in accessing internships while being significantly insulated from their negative effects.
J28|What Chinese Workers Value: An Analysis of Job Satisfaction, Job Expectations, and Labour Turnover in China|This study uses data from the 2012 China Labour-Force Dynamics Survey and 2010-2012 China Family Panel Studies to investigate job satisfaction and job expectations, as well as the association between job satisfaction and job turnover by gender among employees aged 16-65. We find not only that job satisfaction levels are relatively low, with only 46% of workers explicitly satisfied, but also that worker expectations differ significantly from what their jobs actually provide. In particular, many jobs are less interesting than expected, which prevents workers from realizing their perceived potential. This expectation gap is thus a strong determinant of job satisfaction. Men and women have similar levels of job satisfaction, yet based on observables, one would expect women’s job satisfaction to be lower than it actually is, thereby lending support to the genderjob-satisfaction paradox encountered in Western studies. In contrast to Western research, we find no link between job satisfaction and job change, an observation we attribute to China’s unique Confucian-based work ethic.
J28|Do Good Working Conditions Make You Work Longer? Evidence on Retirement Decisions Using Linked Survey and Register Data|We analyze the potential role of adverse working conditions and management practices in the determination of employees' retirement behavior. Our data contain both comprehensive information regarding perceived job disamenities, job satisfaction, and intentions to retire from nationally representative cross-sectional surveys and information on employees' actual retirement decisions from longitudinal register data that can be linked to the surveys. Using a trivariate ordered probit model, we observe that job dissatisfaction arising from adverse working conditions is significantly related to intentions to retire, and this in turn is related to actual retirement during the follow-up period.
J28|Temporary employment boom in Poland – a job quality vs. quantity trade-off?|Between 2002 and 2015, temporary employment in Poland more than doubled. Poland became the country with the highest share of temporary jobs in the EU. In this paper we study this process from the job quality vs. job quantity perspective. We analyse gaps between temporary and permanent workers in six dimensions of jobs quality, adopting measures proposed by the OECD and Eurofound. The gaps in earnings quality, job security and work scheduling quality were the most pronounced. Job quality has improved for both groups of workers but the gaps have not closed completely. Firms in Poland prefer temporary contracts because of lower firing cost, tax wedge and wages. We use a stylised labour demand model to quantify the upper bound of a potential job creation effect due to lower labour costs incurred by temporary contracts. We find that this effect doesn’t exceed 4% of dependent employment in 2015. We cannot rule out that the net employment effect was 0. Our findings show that even if cheaper, temporary contracts might have induced some job creation, workers suffered from lower job quality in several dimensions.
J28|Mutual Gains? Is There a Role for Employee Engagement in the Modern Workplace?|I examine the history of employee engagement and how it has been characterised by thinkers in sociology, psychology, management and economics. I suggest that, while employers may choose to invest in employee engagement, there are alternative management strategies that may be profit-maximising. I identify four elements of employee engagement – job ‘flow’, autonomous working, involvement in decision-making at workplace or firm level, and financial participation – and present empirical evidence on their incidence and employee perceptions of engagement, drawing primarily from evidence in Britain. I consider the evidence regarding the existence of mutual gains and present new evidence on the issue. I find a non-linear relationship between human resource management (HRM) intensity and various employee job attitudes. I also find the intensity of HRM use and employee engagement are independently associated with improvements in workplace performance. I consider the implications of the findings for policy and employment practice in the future.
J28|Generation Internship: The Impact of Internships on Early Labour Market Performance|Many university graduates conduct internships before starting to work in a direct-hire job. I analyse the effects of internships on early labour market performance to evaluate whether they enhance or hinder the university-to-work transition. I use propensity score matching to identify graduates that resemble each other in important characteristics such as cognitive ability, and only differ with respect to the internship experience. This allows comparison between interns and non-interns in key dimensions of job market performance: monthly earnings, employment status, and job satisfaction. The results suggest that internships have detrimental effects across dimensions. Graduates with an internship experience are significantly less likely to be employed one year after graduation, and, if employed, earn significantly less than their non-intern peers. However, the negative effects are short-lived and vanish within five years. Due to this catching up, I can rule out that interns are a negative selection of all graduates. Instead it seems that the internship sends a negative signal to prospective employers and is thus causing the underperformance at job entry. The measured effects are less pronounced for female interns.
J28|Does Sick Pay Affect Workplace Absence?|Higher replacement rates often imply higher levels of absenteeism, yet even in generous welfare economies, private sick pay is provided in addition to the public sick pay. Why? Using comparative workplace data for the UK and Norway we show that the higher level of absenteeism in Norway compared to UK is related to the threshold in the Norwegian public sick pay legislation. This threshold's importance is confirmed in a Regression Kinked Design (RKD) analysis on the Norwegian micro-data. Private sick pay is provided as an employer-provided non-wage benefit and when training costs are high.
J28|The Effect of Workplace Inspections on Worker Safety|The Occupation Safety and Health Administration enforces safety regulations through workplace inspections. To identify the effect of inspections on worker safety, this study exploits quasi-experimental variation in inspections due to OSHA’s Site Specific Targeting plan. The SST plan used establishment-level data on accidents and injuries to target establishments for inspection. The primary inspection list consisted of establishments with case rates exceeding a cutoff. This cutoff generated a discontinuous increase in inspections, which is used to identify the effect of inspections on worker safety. Using the fuzzy regression discontinuity design and local linear regression, the estimated effect of an inspection on cases involving days away from work, job restrictions, and job transfers is -1.607 per 100 full-time equivalent workers. The effect is most pronounced among manufacturing establishments below the 90th percentile of the case-rate distribution.
J28|Labor Unions and Occupational Safety: Event-Study Analysis Using Union Elections|This study examines the dynamic relationship between union elections and occupational safety among manufacturing establishments. Data on union elections come from the National Labor Relations Board, and data on workplace inspections and accident case rates come from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The results indicate that union elections improved occupational safety. First, workplace inspections trended upwards before the election, then decreased immediately after the election, due almost entirely to employee complaints. Second, accident case rates were relatively stable before the election, then trended downwards after the election, due to accidents involving days away from work, job restrictions, and job transfers. These effects are evident regardless of the election outcome. Based on the value of statistical injury, the improvement in occupational safety is equivalent to an increase in the hourly wage between $0.47 and $2.62.
J28|Percezione della criminalitÃ e diseguaglianza di reddito: un'indagine sui paesi europei|La letteratura economica su diseguaglianza di reddito e criminalitÃ Ã¨ abbastanza recente e tende a scorgere una relazione positiva tra queste due variabili. Alcuni autori hanno anche segnalato che la criminalitÃ tende ad essere anticiclica e che la forza d'inerzia sembra essere considerevole. Una relazione positiva Ã¨ stata trovata anche tra povertÃ e omicidi, cosÃ¬ come tra insicurezza e benessere attraverso un'associazione positiva tra insicurezza, bassi redditi, limitata istruzione, alta mortalitÃ infantile. Altri contributi hanno messo in evidenza la relazione tra diseguaglianza di reddito e crimini violenti, che si manifesterebbe specialmente nelle aree urbane ed in particolare in America Latina. In genere la diseguaglianza di reddito fa riferimento ad una sua valutazione in termini puramente monetari e i dati sulla criminalitÃ si riferiscono a quella che viene ufficialmente denunciata dalle vittime. Questa ricerca si propone invece di tratteggiare una descrizione che parta dall'evidenza empirica, fornita dalla banca-dati EuSilc per decine di paesi europei, e metta in relazione la diseguaglianza di reddito con la percezione della criminalitÃ nell'area di residenza espressa nelle interviste, esaminando allo stesso tempo un certo numero di variabili oggettive ed altre soggettive attribuite agli individui, cosÃ¬ come ai loro nuclei familiari. Lo scopo dell'indagine Ã¨ da un lato fornire un quadro dell'eterogeneitÃ sussistente tra i paesi europei in merito ad un fenomeno forse relativamente meno osservato, e dall'altro considerare non tanto la criminalitÃ denunciata, giÃ oggetto di numerose ricerche, quanto la percezione che gli intervistati dichiarano di avere di tale fenomeno. A causa delle caratteristiche di endogeneitÃ della relazione Ã¨ difficile stabilire un solido rapporto di causalitÃ ed accertare, sulla base dell'evidenza empirica, le eventuali cause determinanti. Lo studio qui condotto sui dati dell'indagine EuSilc tende piuttosto ad evidenziare profili di famiglie ed individui che piÃ¹ probabilmente di altri sono inclini a accusare la presenza di criminalitÃ nell'area di residenza, senza attribuire a ciÃ² altro che una eventuale regolaritÃ . Nonostante ciÃ², l'esame delle valutazioni espresse dagli intervistati, per quanto soggettive, puÃ² egualmente rivestire una certa importanza anche nell'ambito di quelle decisioni, prese soggettivamente, che riguardano tanto l'economia quanto la politica.
J28|How Participating In The Shadow Economy Affects The Growth Of Latvian Firms|This paper examines the relationship between the growth of Latvian firms and their involvement in the shadow economy in 2015. When up to 10% of the overall economic activity of firms is in the shadow economy, this had a growth-enhancing effect on firms that recorded non-positive growth during the last five years. Using the perceptions of corruption and interview languages as instruments of measuring the shadow economy participation rate, the authors conclude that there is a positive relationship between perceptions of corruption and the shadow economy participation rate.

J28|An empirical study of Job satisfaction of university staff|The paper examined university staff overall job satisfaction in Sunyani Technical University in a survey of 100 respondents in a cross-sectional study and a quantitative design. Using standard ordinary least square (OLS) method the findings of the study show that employees are satisfied with overall job satisfaction, and satisfied with the elements of satisfaction identified in the survey, with salary and workload been the most satisfied elements. The findings of the research in addition, indicate that elements of job satisfaction influence overall job satisfaction. Management of higher institutions should take into account the findings of the current study in motivating employees for enhance performance resulting from better service and quality service, since university workers are the first members of the community in dealing with students who are junior members of the community.
J28|An Empirical study of the Role of Demographics in Job Satisfaction of Sunyani Technical University staff|The paper analyses the effects of demographic variables on overall job satisfaction and satisfaction elements for Sunyani Technical University using standard Ordinary Least Square method (OLS). The estimates of the regression analysis indicate that demographic variables have insignificant positive and negative effect on overall job satisfaction. However, the estimates show significant positive and negative effect of demographic variables on some elements of job satisfaction. Managements of academic institutions should take into account the findings of the study to ensure that workers are well satisfied with their job so that productivity will not be affected. Future study should replicate the current study in a comparative study of private and public academic institutions.
J28|Combination of Content-Based User Profiling and Local Collective Embeddings for Job Recommendation|We present the approach to the RecSys Challenge 2017, which ranked 7th. The goal of the competition was to prepare job recommendations for the users of the social network for business Xing.com. Our algorithm consists of two di erent models: Content-based User Profiling and Local Collective Embeddings. The first content-based model contains many hand-tuned parameters and data insights, so it performs fairly well on the task of the challenge despite its simplicity. The second model is based on Matrix Factorization and may be applicable to a wide range of cold-start recommendation tasks. The combination of these two models have shown the best performance on local validation.
J28|On the Role of Migration on the Satisfaction of European Researchers: Evidence from MORE2|The aim of this study is to disentangle the role of international migration on the job satisfaction of academic researchers. Using a relatively novel database, MORE2, that tracks the migratory behaviour of European researchers, and correcting for potential sorting behaviour of individuals via a multinomial treatment model, we find that more migratory groups tend to demonstrate higher levels of satisfaction regarding pecuniary outcomes. They also present higher levels of satisfaction regarding career advancement and social status, both crucial components in the lives of PhD holders. Our results survive in a battery of robustness checks, corroborating our main findings.
J28|Leadership Styles and Job Satisfaction|Low compensation in the retail sector is adversely affecting employee satisfaction and turnover. Leadership style is important for motivating employees and increasing their satisfaction level. This study has examined the effect of transformational and transactional leadership styles on job satisfaction in selected retail outlets of Slough, United Kingdom. The adapted questionnaire was administered to the employees of the retail outlets. The sample size was 270 and the response rate was 85%. The study found that transformational leadership style has a positive effect on job satisfaction, whereas transactional leadership style has an insignificant effect on job satisfaction. Therefore, it can be argued that the transformational leadership style is more effective in the retail sector of Slough, United Kingdom.
J28|Stability and Satisfaction at Work During the Spanish Economic Crisis|This paper analyses temporary work and job satisfaction among salaried workers during the Spanish economic crisis of 2008. Using data from the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE) 2013 Economically Active Population Survey (EAPS), we find that temporary workers lost their job more than others during this period. However, salaried workers have higher average levels of satisfaction in 2007-2010, possibly due to the lower requirements of workers. We find a positive relationship between the unlikeliness of keeping a job and low job satisfaction levels in data from the Survey of Quality of Life at Work (2010) through a correspondence analysis. A linear model with a level of job satisfaction as a dependent variable shows negative coefficients for a level of job satisfaction if the probability of keeping the job is somewhat unlikely or very unlikely. Finally, an ordinal probit regression finds that the estimated likelihood to reach high job satisfaction is lower in temporary workers.
J28|Does Sick Pay Affect Workplace Absence?|Higher replacement rates often imply higher levels of absenteeism, yet even in generous welfare economies, private sick pay is provided in addition to the public sick pay. Why? Using comparative workplace data for the UK and Norway we show that the higher level of absenteeism in Norway compared to UK is related to the threshold in the Norwegian public sick pay legislation. This threshold's importance is confirmed in a Regression Kinked Design (RKD) analysis on the Norwegian micro-data. Private sick pay is provided as an employer-provided non-wage benefit and when training costs are high.
J28|Happy at University? Student Well-being and the Value of Higher Education|We report the results of a project monitoring Student Wellbeing in tertiary education. We investigate wellbeing broadly and wellbeing at university and focus on the role of both academic factors (teaching and learning experience and student expectations and performance) and non-academic ones (student health and finances, term-time employment and social life) and discuss our findings in the context of both student support and measuring the value of higher education.
J28|Conditions at work: how actual and expected working conditions drive perception|Working conditions exert a major influence on accidents and illnesses at work as well as on job satisfaction and health, yet very little research has examined the determinants of working conditions. By exploiting the Italian Labour Force Survey, this paper provides evidence on the underlying factors affecting working conditions. It provides a behavioural interpretation of the results, which stems from the discrepancy between actual and expected working conditions. Workers declare their perceived working conditions influenced by the difference between the actual and the expected working conditions. Variables concerning personal characteristics, such as gender, education and being employed in the first job, shift expectations about working conditions and accordingly perceived working conditions. On the contrary, variables related to work characteristics, such as working full time, with shifts and in a large place, affect actual and thus perceived working conditions (negatively).
J28|Boss Competence and Worker Well-Being|Nearly all workers have a supervisor or â€œboss.â€ Yet little is known about how bosses influence the quality of employeesâ€™ lives. This study offers new evidence. First, the authors find that a bossâ€™s technical competence is the single strongest predictor of a workerâ€™s job satisfaction. Second, they demonstrate using longitudinal data, after controlling for fixed-effects, that even if a worker stays in the same job and workplace, a rise in the competence of a supervisor is associated with an improvement in the workerâ€™s well-being. Third, the authors report a variety of robustness checks, including tentative instrumental variable results. These findings, which draw on U.S. and British data, contribute to an emerging literature on the role of â€œexpert leadersâ€ in organizations.
J28|The impact of a sick pay waiting period on sick leave patterns|Abstract This article assesses how a waiting period for sick pay impacts sick leave patterns. In the French private sector, statutory sick benefits are granted after 3 days. However, 60 % of employers in this sector provide complementary sick pay to cover this waiting period. Linked employee–employer survey data compiled in 2009 are used to analyze the impact of this compensation on workers’ sick leave behavior. The assessment isolates the insurance effect (moral hazard) from individual and environmental factors relating to sick leave (including health and working conditions). Results suggest that employees who are compensated during the 3-day waiting period are not more likely to have an absence. On the contrary, their sickness leaves are significantly shorter by 3 days on average. These results could be explained by consequences of presenteeism and ex post moral hazard when employees are exposed to a waiting period.
J28|The secret to job satisfaction is low expectations: How perceived working conditions differ from actual ones|Working conditions exert a major influence on accidents and illnesses at work as well as on job satisfaction and health, yet very little research has examined the determinants of working conditions. By exploiting the Italian Labour Force Survey, this paper provides evidence on the underlying factors affecting working conditions. It provides a behavioural interpretation of the results, which stems from the discrepancy between actual and expected working conditions. In light of this interpretation, workers would declare their perceived working conditions influenced by the difference between the actual and the expected working conditions. Variables concerning personal characteristics, such as gender, education and being employed in the first job, shift expectations about working conditions and accordingly perceived working conditions. On the contrary, variables related to work characteristics, such as working full time, with shifts and in a large place, affect actual and thus perceived working conditions (negatively).
J28|Subjective educational mismatch and signalling in Spain|Over-education may arise from the voluntary decisions of individuals to acquire more qualifications than those required in the workplace. In these cases, the mismatch may have a signalling role that allows workers to compensate for the lack of certain other skills, or to gain access to the labour market. The aim of this paper is to analyse the signalling role of over-education in Spain, a country characterised by a strongly-segmented labour market with high unemployment levels, and a large number of over-educated individuals. Using micro data for a representative sample of Spanish workers, we use three different methods to test the signalling value of over-education. The results obtained provide evidence that educational mismatch plays a clear signalling role.
J28|Over-qualification and dimensions of job satisfaction|Over-qualification may arise from voluntary decisions of individuals to acquire more qualifications than those required at the job place. In these cases, mismatch may have a role allowing workers to compensate the lack of some other skills, or to gain access to the labour market. Consequently, workers may feel no less satisfied, at least in some domains, than adequately matched workers. The aim of this paper is to analyse the relationship between over-qualification and different domains of job satisfaction in Spain, a country characterised by a strongly segmented labour market with high unemployment level, and a large number of mismatched. Using micro data for a representative sample of Spanish workers, we employ an IV estimation procedure to control for potential endogeneity arising from reverse causation or unobserved heterogeneity. Results obtained provide apparent evidence on that mismatched workers do not necessarily feel less satisfied than adequately matched workers in all domains of job satisfaction.
J28|Much Ado about Nothing? The Wage Penalty of Holding a PhD Degree but Not a PhD Job Position|Abstract This paper contributes to the literature on overeducation by empirically investigating the wage penalty of job–education mismatch among PhD holders who completed their studies in Italy; a country where the number of new doctoral recipients has dramatically increased over recent years while personnel employed in R&D activities is still below the European average. We use cross-sectional micro-data collected in 2009 and rely on different definitions of education–job mismatch such as, overeducation, overskilling, and dissatisfaction with the use of skills. We find that overeducation and skills dissatisfaction are associated with significantly lower wages but there is no wage penalty from overskilling. Furthermore, those who simultaneously report overeducation and skills dissatisfaction experience a particularly high wage penalty.
J28|Qualität der Arbeit in Europa: Eine empirische Analyse auf Basis des EWCS 2015|Die Arbeitszufriedenheit signalisiert, ob die Beschäftigten die Qualität des eigenen Arbeitsplatzes als gut einschätzen. Der Anteil der Arbeitnehmer in einem Land, die mit ihrer Arbeit zufrieden sind, ist damit ein Gradmesser für die Qualität der Arbeitsplätze in einer Volkswirtschaft insgesamt. Die Qualität der Arbeit ist vor diesem Hintergrund in der Europäischen Union und in den einzelnen Mitgliedstaaten hoch. Rund 86 Prozent der Arbeitnehmer in der Europäischen Union sind mit ihrem Beschäftigungsverhältnis zufrieden. In Deutschland sind es mit 88 Prozent etwas mehr. Dies entspricht dem Wert aus dem Jahr 2010. In vielen Ländern, insbesondere in Ostmitteleuropa, ist das Ausmaß der Arbeitszufriedenheit zwischen 2010 und 2015 von einem relativ niedrigen auf ein vergleichbares Niveau wie in Deutschland angestiegen. Für eine schleichende Verschlechterung der Qualität der Arbeit fehlt daher sowohl hierzulande als auch in der Europäischen Union insgesamt der empirische Beleg. Politischer Handlungsdruck existiert von dieser Seite nicht. Ökonometrische Schätzungen mit den Beschäftigtenstichproben für die Europäische Union und für Deutschland zeigen, dass die Wertschätzung und die Anerkennung, die in Geld, Aufstiegsperspektiven und Worten ausgedrückt werden, ein hohes Gewicht bei der Frage erhalten, ob ein Arbeitnehmer mit dem Job zufrieden ist. Eine ähnlich hohe Bedeutung fällt einem guten sozialen Umfeld am Arbeitsplatz zu. Die empirischen Befunde lassen zudem vermuten, dass vielerorts als eher belastend empfundene Arbeitsplatzmerkmale, die für sich genommen mit einer niedrigeren Arbeitszufriedenheit einhergehen, durch andere als unterstützend empfundene Arbeitsbedingungen kompensiert werden. Dadurch wird die Qualität der Arbeit von den Beschäftigten in diesen Fällen bei einer ganzheitlichen Betrachtung als gut wahrgenommen.
J28|Voluntary turnover: What we measure and what it (really) means|In this paper, we run regression analyses to explain voluntary turnover intentions with data from more than 5,000 employees and with about 250 explanatory variables. The findings of our multi-factor approach highlight the fact that previous empirical research might have over-estimated the impact and significance of many factors. We show the relevance of the so-called omitted variable bias to our findings and present an empirical approach to gain estimations that are more accurate. Our approach can estimate in detail the relevance of different factors from the following categories: (a) employees’ satisfaction, (b) industry, (c) firm size, (d) status and position, (e) commuting and working hours, (f) income, incentives and fairness, (g) career development, (h) health, (j) political orientation, (k) demographics, and (l) personality traits.
J28|How much does others’ protection matter? Employment protection and well-being|Workers’ well-being depends crucially on the legal framework and its statutes regulating the level of protection. While it seems obvious that a worker’s level of satisfaction is directly affected by the level of protection she receives, this paper argues that the level of protection other workers receive constitutes in integral part as well.
J28|The anticipation and adaptation effects of intra- and interpersonal wage changes on job satisfaction|This paper analyses how individual job satisfaction is affected by wage changes. In order to account for potential dynamic effects of wage changes on job satisfaction, we include lead and lag effects of wage changes in our analysis. Furthermore, we examine the role of social comparisons. This strategy allows us to account for implications of behavioural theory and permits an appropriate methodological approach.
J28|"The Distortionary Effects of Incentives in Government: Evidence from China's ""Death Ceiling"" Program"|"We study a 2004 program designed to motivate Chinese bureaucrats to reduce accidental deaths. Each province received a set of ""death ceilings"" that, if exceeded, would impede government officials' promotions. For each category of accidental deaths, we observe a sharp discontinuity in reported deaths at the ceiling, suggestive of manipulation. Provinces with safety incentives for municipal officials experienced larger declines in accidental deaths, suggesting complementarities between incentives at different levels of government. While realized accidental deaths predict the following year's ceiling, we observe no evidence that provinces manipulate deaths upward to avoid ratchet effects in the setting of death ceilings."
J28|Economics of a good night's sleep|Parents whose sleep quality is reduced by young children waking them in the night are less likely to work, work shorter hours and/or earn less than otherwise similar people who enjoy a good night's sleep. The negative labour market effects of sleep disruption caused by children are particularly strong for low-skilled mothers. These are among the findings of research by Joan Costa-i-Font and Sarah Flèche, which uses data on 14,000 families in and around the city of Bristol in the UK to investigate the link between mothers' employment outcomes and their quality of sleep, measured by how much they are woken by their children at night. The researchers note that before now, the effects of sleep deprivation on economic activity have received surprisingly scant attention.
J28|Parental sleep and employment: evidence from a British cohort study|We show that sleep deprivation exerts a strong negative effect on labour market performance. We exploit variations in child sleep quality to instrument for parental sleep quality. A one-hour reduction in sleep duration significantly decreases labour force participation, the number of hour’s worked and household income. In addition, we find that low-skilled mothers are more likely to opt out of the labour market and work less hours than high-skilled mothers when exposed to sleep deprivation. We argue that sleep is a major determinant of employment outcomes that needs more attention in designing economic models of time allocation and employment policies.
J28|Sickness absence from work in Spain: are there gender differences?|We use a sample of social security records containing work histories and sick leave episodes to investigate gender differences in the incidence and duration of absence from work due to sickness in Spain. For sick leave incidence we apply a competing risk model to a panel of newly employed workers who can be followed for two years until an episode of sick leave occurs or the job ends. For the duration of sick leave spells, we estimate a Weibull model. We distinguish between sick leave due to occupational illness or injury and sick leave due to common disease or accident. This distinction is important because only for the latter women have higher incidence and longer duration than men. In this respect, the presence of children under 3 years of age in the household becomes a significant explanatory factor.
J28|The Socio-Economic Determinants of Crime in South Africa: An Empirical Assessment|South Africa possess some of the highest reported crime statistics in the world, making the study of crime and its determinants of particular interest in this context. Three socio-economic factors can initially be identified as playing an important role in our understanding of the incidence of crime: Unemployment, income levels, and the prevalent level of income inequality. This research uses small area level data from the South African census to derive socio-economic variables and link this to crimes reported by the South African Police Service (SAPS). We briefly discuss the literature surrounding crime and socio-economic indicators, both internationally and in South Africa. We then turn to an overview of the other factors that can influence crime rates, before presenting the classic economic theory of crime in more detail. Finally, we discuss our conceptual approach, which draws on the literature and the economic model to determine what we can expect from the results to follow.
J28|Voluntary Turnover: What We Measure and What It (Really) Means|In this paper, we run regression analyses to explain voluntary turnover intentions with data from more than 5,000 employees and with about 250 explanatory variables. The findings of our multi-factor approach highlight the fact that previous empirical research might have over-estimated the impact and significance of many factors. We show the relevance of the so-called omitted variable bias to our findings and present an empirical approach to gain estimations that are more accurate. Our approach can estimate in detail the relevance of different factors from the following categories: (a) employees’ satisfaction, (b) industry, (c) firm size, (d) status and position, (e) commuting and working hours, (f) income, incentivesand fairness, (g) career development, (h) health, (j) political orientation, (k) demographics, and (l) personality traits.
J28|Entrepreneurial Success and Subjective Well-Being: Worries about the Business Explain One's Well-Being Loss from Self-Employment|Despite lower incomes the self-employed often report higher job satisfaction. But this increased job satisfaction only sometimes translates into higher life satisfaction, likely due to the heterogeneous nature of self-employment. By distinguishingdifferent types of self-employment, this paper sheds light onto why some self-employeds even report lower life satisfaction, focussing specifically on poor performance enterprises, a prevalent but disregarded type of entrepreneurship. Using German panel data (1984-2015), I find that self-employment (compared to employment) typically negatively impacts on life satisfaction, especially so if one enters self-employment from unemployment, earns low incomes from self-employment or has no employees. Worries about one's financial situation and job security appear to be the driving forces behind this negative effect. Only very few self-employeds report higher life satisfaction, a boost that seems to relate to the pursuit of entrepreneurial opportunities. In sum, looking at the average self-employed obscures the heterogeneity of well-being impacts resulting from different types of self-employment one might find themselves in, and being on the lower end of the success distribution carries a well-being cost instead of bringing joy.
J28|Social networks, job satisfaction and job searching behavior in the Chinese labor market|This study first investigates determinants of job searching strategies and then examines if social networks are connected with better job outcomes. Unlike previous studies that focus solely on income, this paper pays more heed to job satisfaction. Based on data drawn from China General Social Survey, we find that disadvantaged job seekers rely primarily on informal channels; whereas experienced and better-educated job seekers tend to search for jobs through formal channels. However, those reaping the largest benefit from using networks are the job seekers who are able to use formal and informal channels jointly. By disaggregating the whole sample, we further find that the promoting effect of network use is contingent on factors such as gender and types of jobs. Network use brings about larger benefits to female and job seekers target to prestigious occupations. Finally, it appears that whether a job seeker can receive influential help depends primarily on the social status of the contacts rather than their tie strength. The results of our paper thus urge us to examine the combination of different searching strategies rather than studying them separately.
J28|Earnings expectations and employee safety|We examine the relation between workplace safety and managers’ attempts to meet earnings expectations. Using establishment-level data on workplace safety from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, we document significantly higher injury/illness rates in firms that meet or just beat analyst forecasts compared to firms that miss or comfortably beat analyst forecasts. The higher injury/illness rates in firms that meet or just beat analyst forecasts are associated with both increases in employee workloads and in abnormal reductions of discretionary expenses. The relation between benchmark beating and workplace safety is stronger when there is less union presence, when workers’ compensation premiums are less sensitive to injury claims, and among firms with less government business. Our findings highlight a specific consequence of managers’ attempts to meet earnings expectations through real activities management.
J28|Workforce reduction, subjective job insecurity, and mental health|We examine the link between workforce reduction, subjective job insecurity, and mental health using individual level panel data for private-sector employees in Germany. We first estimate the effect of firm-level workforce reductions on mental health, finding a strong, negative, and statistically significant relationship. We then extensively examine the role of subjective job insecurity as mediating variable and its importance relative to other possible channels for the effect of workforce reduction on mental health. Eventually, as an extension to our analysis, we use life satisfaction as alternative outcome variable.
J28|The upside of pessimism − Biased beliefs and the paradox of the contented female worker|Both sexes display inaccuracies in estimating their labour market prospects, but in different directions. Consistent with the literature on sex differences in psychological bias, females are less optimistic than men and on average tend to be overly pessimistic. Optimism, measured as an upwardly biased perception of the labour market returns distribution, increases the likelihood of disappointment with realized performance. A substantial proportion of the female job satisfaction advantage appears to be associated with both overly pessimistic female expectations and overly optimistic male expectations. The implications of female pessimism on both job-search and gender earnings differentials is also discussed.
J28|That is what friends do: employee friendliness and innovation|Recent literature suggests that labor related issues can impact corporate innovation. In this study we hypothesize and find that firms with congenial work environments innovate more and have greater innovative efficiency. Our results also suggest that cash profit sharing and employee involvement have a positive bearing whereas union relationships have a negative impact on innovation output of a firm. In addition, subsample analysis reveals that employee-friendly policies are more important in industries having higher employee power. Our results are consistent with the logic that happy and satisfied employees tend to be more productive than the unhappy and dissatisfied ones. Our work suggests a channel through which satisfied employees contribute towards increasing firm value − by increasing the innovation productivity and efficiency of the firm. So, firms must make continued efforts towards creating and maintaining a friendly work environment.
J28|Parental Sleep and Employment: Evidence from a British Cohort Study|We show that sleep deprivation exerts a strong negative effect on labour market performance. We exploit variations in child sleep quality to instrument for parental sleep quality. A one-hour reduction in sleep duration significantly decreases labour force participation, the number of hours worked and household income. In addition, we find that low-skilled mothers are more likely to opt out of the labour market and work less hours than high-skilled mothers when exposed to sleep deprivation. We argue that sleep is a major determinant of employment outcomes that needs more attention in designing economic models of time allocation and employment policies.
J28|Changements organisationnels dans les entreprises, outils de gestion et risques psychosociaux : une analyse sur données françaises| Si la problématique de la santé au travail est ancienne dans le débat public, celle du risque psychosocial est plus récente. Elle s’est invitée dans le débat public depuis quelques années, illustrée par quelques exemples qui semblent interroger les choix organisationnels des entreprises. Le débat est vaste et passionnel parce qu’il touche au rapport entre l’individu et le travail, qui peut être un élément constitutif de son identité. Les mutations dans les entreprises, notamment les changements organisationnels sont-ils un facteur de hausse des risques psychosociaux? Pour répondre à cette question, il faut bien entendu un instrument de mesure. Le rapport Nasse-Légeron et à sa suite le comité Collac ont donné des indications sur la manière de construire un tel instrument Cet article propose, à partir de l’enquête Changements Organisationnels et Informatisation 2006, une évaluation non paramétrique de l’impact des changements organisationnels, des changements technologiques et de trois outils de gestions (certification qualité, certification environnementale, équipe de travail autonome) sur les risques psychosociaux des salariés.
J28|Access to and Returns from Unpaid Graduate Internships|We use the Destination of Leavers from Higher Education Survey (DLHE) to estimate the socio-economic gradient in access to unpaid internships among English and Welsh graduates six months after completing their first degree, and the return to this internship experience 3 years later in terms of salary, occupation, contract type and career satisfaction. We show a significant salary penalty at 3.5 years after graduation compared with those going straight into paid work or further study, but also that graduates from higher socio-economic status have an advantage in accessing internships while being significantly insulated from their negative effects.
J28|Does a Satisfied Student Make a Satisfied Worker?|We investigate the effect of satisfaction at higher education on job satisfaction using propensity score matching, the special regressor method and a unique European dataset for graduates. Acknowledging that perceptions of satisfaction at higher education are endogenous to job satisfaction, we present models available to the deal with this endogeneity. Our analysis confirms that a positive university experience is important for success in future employment and suggests that emphasis should be focused on the utility of participating in third-level education along with academic outcomes.
J28|Do Performance Appraisals Decrease Employees’ Perception of Their Psychosocial Risks?|This paper uses cross-sectional linked employer-employee data col- lected from the French Working Conditions Survey, to assess the po- tential positive or negative effect of performance appraisal interviews administered by firms on employees’ reported levels of psychosocial risk. A subjective measure of the psychosocial risks is used and in- dicates a perceived level of risk. In order to obtain a more objective evaluation, we compare the employees’ perceived level of psychosocial risk and the level of risk reported by firms. The results show that the reported levels of psychosocial risk decrease when employees receive performance evaluation reviews on a regular basis; reviews whose ef- fects vary depending on the type of psychosocial risk.
J28|Workforce Entry Conditions and Job Satisfaction|This paper examines the relation between macroeconomic experiences and job satisfaction. Specifically, we analyze whether former work entry conditions have persistent effects on job satisfaction. Pooled Ordinary Least Squares method is applied to eighteen waves of the British Household Panel Survey. In order to check robustness of the established results, we also use Fixed Effect and Ordered Probit Estimation techniques. The results of relationship between work entry unemployment rate and job satisfaction is found negatively statistically significant at rho=.01 level in all methods. Even controlling for important factors on job satisfaction, such as industry and occupation differences, age, gender and income, the negative and significant effect of work entry conditions on job satisfaction continues to survive. The established results indicate that people who entered workforce when unemployment rate is high has less job satisfaction even in later ages compared to the ones who entered workforce when unemployment rate is lower.
J28|Evaluación del impacto de la accidentabilidad en la productividad de las minas peruanas: caso de estudio: empresas de la BVL en la gran y mediana minería|La salud y la seguridad de los trabajadores es un objetivo principal de las Empresas Mineras y el estado, su mejora logra disminuir las lesiones personales, reducir las pérdidas de tiempo, incrementar la productividad, disminuir perdidas de capital y disminuir los riesgos de conflictos sociales. La seguridad es necesaria para velar por el bienestar de los trabajadores y para mantener una seguridad adecuada en las minas, las empresas deben aplicar acciones permanentes y tener índices de siniestralidad bajos. Un trabajo seguro, es un desempeño bien hecho y productivo, por lo que se puede concluir que a mayor seguridad mayor será la productividad de la empresa. Una correcta gestión de los riesgos aportará a la productividad en el corto y mediano plazo, pero en el largo plazo será una base importante para mantener la sustentabilidad de la empresa. Debido a que la información sobre costos mineros no es fácilmente accesiblesible, los estudios sobre productividad minera no son muy frecuentes. El objetivo principal del estudio es evaluar el impacto de la accidentabilidad en la productividad de las minas peruanas, y probar estadísticamente que tiene un efecto negativo muy significativo sobre la productividad. El estudio se basa en el análisis estadístico de los índices de accidentabilidad y de productividad obtenidos, entre los años 2010 y 2014 de operación, por las diferentes minas metálicas peruanas tanto del tipo subterráneas como las del tipo superficiales y que cotizan en la Bolsa de Valores de Lima. Los datos e información básica se han obtenido de OSINERGMIN y de la Bolsa de Valores de Lima.
J28|The Association between Big-Five Personality and Property Deviance|"""Objective – Property deviance is an inverse behaviour that has received widespread attention from all forms of organisations. This behaviour can be characterised as theft, embezzlement, bribery and corruption. The public sector has experiences wide exposure to this behaviour due to its prevalence among public sector employees. Thus, in this study, emphasis is given to the personality of the public administrator in identifying the contribution of personality in curbing property deviance. Methodology/Technique – The study was conducted on public organisations and questionnaires were distributed to public administrators using a convenience survey. The questionnaire uses the Big-Five Personality Dimensions developed by Lussier (2008), whilst the property deviance uses a three-item questionnaire developed by Robinson and Bennett (1995). Data was analysed through correlation analysis. Findings – The findings demonstrated that personality does contribute to property deviance, with all dimensions of personality having a significant negative association with property deviance. These findings highlight major implications for public organisations in identifying the personality of their staff, in order to control the rate of property deviance and establishing a system for translating these findings into action to be taken, in order for the existing staff and future employees to regulate desirable workplace behaviour. Novelty – The study suggests that screening should be conducted periodically in the selection process as well as in the form of employee training for staff with the personality traits found in people likely to engage in property deviance."""
J28|The Influence of Spirituality Workplace to Motivation, Job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment|"""Objective – Competition between organizations, demanded that any organization can provide quality service and quality for stakeholders. One important aspect which will also determine the achievement of college performance, namely the lecturers. The relationship between the individual commitment to the organization shows the relationship between motivation and job satisfaction can improve the quality of university. While a basic understanding of the meaning of work is closely related to spiritual values that are owned by the individual in his work. This awareness can also be pursued by university through the fulfilment of the needs of both psychological and spiritual faculty, thus creating a conducive work environment. This research is descriptive, so that verification and explanatory research method used was a survey of 320 professors in the region of East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Methodology/Technique – Tests in this study using structural equation modeling (SEM) based variants or components, namely the Analysis of Moment Structure (AMOS). Findings – The test results showed that (1) Spirituality in the workplace has an influence on the motivation. (2) Spirituality in the workplace does not have an influence on job satisfaction. (3) Spirituality in the workplace has an influence on organizational commitment. Based on the research results obtained by this research Novelty – Novelty where spirituality in the workplace and motivation generate positive motivation for the members of the organization. This shows that the spiritual values inherent in individuals produce more meaning to work, where the work is not for material gain alone."""
J28|Settling Inconsistencies Associated with The Genesis of The Financial Services Authority Act|"""Objective – The FSA Act the establishment of which is mandated by Article 34 of Law No. 23 of 1999 concerning the Bank of Indonesia, was enacted on 22 November 2011. This Act, together with Law No. 3 of 2004, regulates and supervises Indonesia’s integrated financial services sector. This article reveals the existence of inconsistencies between the legal terms underlying the establishment of the FSA one the one hand, and the provisions contained in the Financial Service Authority itself, on the other. These inconsistencies also become evident in the light of the 1945 Constitution which facilitated the establishment of the Bank of Indonesia Law. The purpose of this article is to ascertain a method of resolving these inconsistencies associated with the genesis of the Financial Service Authority. Methodology/Technique – The research method used in this article is doctrinal in nature that uses secondary data and information sources as material to analyse the relevant problems. Findings – The research has revealed that the most appropriate method of settling these inconsistencies requires a consideration of the express wording of the FSA. Novelty – This article indicates the need to apply legal principles rather and adjudicatory methods."""
J28|The Role of the Working Environment on the Employee Morale|"""Objective – The research aims to know the effect of forming aspects of the work environment consisting of the employee’s service, the work condition and the relationship among employees towards employee morale at Limited Liability Company of Bank Tabungan Negara Branch Jember, whether simultaneously or partially, and to know the forming aspects of the work environment that dominantly influence towards employee morale at Limited Liability Company of Bank Tabungan Negara Branch Jember. The population of this research is all of the employees at Limited Liability Company of Bank Tabungan Negara Branch Jember. Methodology/Technique – The applied method of census is multiple linear regressions. Findings – The result shows that the forming aspects of the work environment simultaneously have significant influence towards employee morale at Limited Liability Company of Bank Tabungan Negara Branch Jember. While the result of the test shows that the three forming aspects of the work environment partially have significant influence towards employee morale at Limited Liability Company of Bank Tabungan Negara Branch Jember. Novelty – The implication of this study is that there are many things to increase the employee morale, one of them is providing a good and comfortable work environment. At least, the company should pay attention to the three forming aspects of the work environment, such as giving employee services, working conditions, and employee relationship with the work place."""
J28|Is Financial Reward Still an Important Motivator for the Indonesian Multi-Generational Workforce?|"""Objective – Considering the importance of work motivation in the workplace for staff performance and organizational success, employers need to be sensitive and focusing more on work motivation of their employees to avoid losing them. However, previous studies still have conflicting results on this issue whether there is a significant difference on intrinsic and extrinsic motivators or not among employees from Baby Boomers, Gen X and Gen Y because many studies find generation is not the only driver influencing work motivators. The objectives of this study are to investigate whether a three-generation workforce differs in the level of work motivators and whether differences in generational work motivation are better explained by gender, education, or types of job to design effective human resources development programs. Methodology/Technique – Using survey method to collect data, 415 respondents who work in a manufacturing company were gathered and analyzed by applying descriptive and multivariate analysis. Intrinsic and extrinsic motivators were the subscales of work motivators. Findings – Results indicate that all generations are intrinsically motivated, in which Gen Y employees are found to have higher intrinsic motivators than Gen X and Baby Boomers. However, this study reveals that financial rewards are still considered as an important motivator for the three generations. Novelty – The study presents evidence that work motivators should not only be measured based on generational alone because other factors, such as gender, education, and types of job, can give impact to various outcomes."""
J28|The Relationships between Personal Values, Institutional Values and Affective Commitment (A Case of Graduate Students at A FaithBased Institution in Indonesia)|"""Objective – This research aimed at sketching personal values of graduate students at a faith-based institution in Indonesia. It also investigated the possible influence of these personal values and the students’ perceptions towards the values of their institution on their emotional attachment (affective commitment) to the institution. Methodology/Technique – A cross-sectional survey was employed as the primary method in the collection of the data. The fieldwork comprised the distribution of a self-administered questionnaire to potential respondents through direct contact. A convenience sampling was used to invite respondent participation. A total of 250 questionnaires were distributed of which 143 were usable, representing an overall response rate of 53 %. Findings – Results derived from the research suggested that the students, in general, embraced religious and intellectual values in their personal life. These dominant values seemed to be congruous with the demands of academic life in a faithbased educational institution as well as the demand of business worlds in the future. Likewise, a high level of affective commitment was exhibited by the students. Findings of the research also showed perceived institutional and personal values of students were more strongly predictors of students’ affective commitment than either one alone. Novelty – There has been little research on the relationships between personal values, institutional values and affective commitment in the Indonesian higher education institution contexts. Thus, this research fills this gap. """
J28|Examine the Effect of Organizational Justice on Job Satisfaction and Employee Performance |"""Objective – This study is aimed to analyze the effect of organizational justice on job satisfaction and employee performance. Methodology/Technique – The respondents are 104 employees who work in the Governor’s office in East Nusa Tenggara Province by using the questionnaires. The data are analyzed using Partial Least Square (PLS). Findings – The results show that organizational justice has significant effect on job satisfaction, but has not significant effect on employee performance. Furthermore, job satisfaction has significant effect on employee performance. Novelty – The implications of this study emphasize the important role of job satisfaction in improve the employee performance. Therefore, the organization should have an attention on interactional and informational justice to improve the employee performance, so that the employee is satisfied and try to provide an optimal contribution to the organization.

J28|Contribution of Work and Family Demands on Job Satisfaction Through Work-Family Conflict |"""Objective – Work environment and family roles are two of the most important life domains; they are different but interconnected with each other. Each role requires energy and responsibilities to be handled effectively. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the experience of work-family interaction in this process. The purpose of this study is to develop an understanding of the effect of work and family demands on job satisfaction which is mediated by the experience in work-family interaction, in particular the work-family conflict. Methodology/Technique – Self-report questionnaires were given to permanent employees who work in non-banking financial sectors in Kalimantan Barat, Indonesia. They were selected by purposive sampling and 100 valid questionnaires were collected. Findings – The path analysis results show that work demands have a significant positive effect on work-family conflict, while family demands have no significant effect on work-family conflict, and work-family conflict has a significant negative effect on job satisfaction. Novelty – Although it is believed that work and family demands contribute to outcomes such as job satisfaction, it is unclear how this occurs. It is recommended that organizations need to manage work-related stressors through familyfriendly policies and programs that enable work and family domains to integrate with each other, as well as developing an organizational culture that supports the positive interaction of work and family.

J28|Happiness in Higher Education Leader|"""Objective – This study examines Happiness Leaders in the higher education context. Methodology/Technique – Using Positive Psychology perspective, data were collected through an in-depth interview with 30 Indonesian heads of Department in some faculties of Higher Education Malang from December 2016 to February 2017. Respondents were selected using non-probability purposive sampling technique. Findings – The results of this study indicate that the respondents focused their happiness factor more on relationship (R) and meaningfulness (M), but less on positive emotion (P), engagement (E) and accomplishment (A). Almost all respondents agreed that good relationship ensured a sense of safety and comfort and helped gain social support, especially when they were in Bad Condition. Otherwise, most respondents tended to lack focus in setting targets and did not enjoy through the process of achieving the target. Responsibilities were exercised only to meet the demand of the institution. Novelty – This research developed five aspects: positive emotion, engagement, relationship, meaningfulness and accomplishment (PERMA) as a key question and tested it in the context of Indonesia."""

How do police constables get rid of their stress? Because stress and copings are the two most important factors that influence work-related wellbeing. This paper aims to understand the theoretical framework of police stress and coping procedures. The ideas that make up this system can be used in the appraisal, intervention, and assessment of the police stress reaction and the coping forms utilised after stressful situations. Methodology/Technique – 492 Tamil Nadu state police constables were chosen randomly. Information was gathered utilising two self-report questionnaires which include questionnaire related to police stress and coping strategies. Researcher measured the reliability and validity of the multiple-item research scales by analysing the measurement model using confirmatory factor analysis. Correlation analysis investigative the relationship between police stress and coping strategies, it found that it was positive and significant. Further, the researcher used the SEM approach to testing the relationship between police stress and coping strategies. Findings – SEM approach concludes that overall police stress influences self-supported emotional focused coping strategies positively and that overall police stressors have a positive impact on social supported emotional focused coping strategies. Furthermore, there is a positive impact on overall stress and problem-focused coping and avoidant coping strategies. Novelty – The outcomes can be utilised to help researchers and policy makers foresee police work execution and aid government consider police's identity attributes."""

J28|The Impact of Disability Benefits on Labor Supply: Evidence from the VA's Disability Compensation Program|Combining administrative data from the US Army, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Social Security Administration, we analyze the effect of the VA's Disability Compensation (DC) program on veterans' labor force participation and earnings. We study the 2001 Agent Orange decision, a unique policy change that expanded DC eligibility for Vietnam veterans who served in theater but did not expand eligibility to other veterans of this era, to assess the causal effects of DC enrollment. We estimate that benefits receipt reduced veterans' labor force participation by 18 percentage points, though measured income net of transfer income rose on average.
J28|The Role of Fairtrade Certification for Wages and Job Satisfaction of Plantation Workers|Worker welfare and employment conditions in the agri-food-producing and processing sectors in the global south have become an increasing concern for consumers. Sustainability standards, such as Fairtrade, play an important role in agri-food markets of horticultural produce and may be a tool to address these concerns. However, so far the implications of Fairtrade certification for extrinsic and intrinsic employment factors of hired labor on large-scale plantations remain hardly understood. In this paper we assess its effect on workers’ hourly wages and their level of job satisfaction with primary survey data from 325 randomly sampled workers from eight different export-oriented pineapple companies in Ghana. We apply a linear, linear mixed model, and instrumental variable approach to take into account the multilevel characteristics of our data and possible selection bias. Our findings show that both hourly wages and job satisfaction are indeed higher on Fairtrade-certified plantations. Factors of increased job satisfaction are likely driven by higher wages, permanent employment contracts, training opportunities, company services such as medical care and paid leave as well as established labor unions on Fairtrade-certified plantations.
J28|How do leadership styles influence the creativity of employees?|The objective of organizational creativity is to identify those factors that could affect creativity. One of the most influential factors is the leadership style. Following the review of literatures, we investigated this phenomenon in the Hungarian labor market. We analyzed the answers of more than 600 Hungarian employees. We asked them to categorize their leader on the basis of which classic Lewin leadership style is most characteristic of him or her. After this, they needed to judge how the perceived leadership style would affect the two phases of their workplace creativity. Similarly to international results, democratic leadership style proved to be stimulating, while the authoritarian leadership style was inhibitory. It has also been proved that not only leadership style influences creativity, as the model of successful creative organization cannot be described with the behavior of the leader(s) only.
J28|Why go public? A study of the individual determinants of public sector employment choice|This paper investigates why workers choose the public versus the private sector to understand which aspects of public sector labour contracts should be improved to attract more high-skilled individuals. Using data from the 2014 wave of the Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW), the paper finds that the public sector is generally chosen for its non-pecuniary aspects, and that for highly educated workers it presents a greater disadvantage in terms of salaries, career prospects and transparency of selection procedures, and a greater advantage in terms of work-life balance and job content, both in terms of social utility and closer relation to the field of study. For high-ability individuals, moreover, the public sector disadvantage deepens for career prospects while the advantage in terms of holding employment closer to the field of study increases. Estimates on actual sorting provide evidence that high-ability individuals are more likely to start a job in the private sector when the wage distribution in the public sector is more skewed, i.e. when the career prospects are less dynamic.
J28|The effect of economic cycles on job satisfaction in a two-sector economy|Economic growth improves the material well-being of all workers. However, when remuneration in the public sector is less sensitive to economic cycles than in the private sector, as is typically the case, economic growth will worsen the position of workers in the public sector relative to workers in the private sector, even though their income improves in absolute terms. As a result, job satisfaction may be countercyclical in the public sector. We test this counterintuitive hypothesis in a real-effort laboratory experiment that simulates an economy with two sectors differing only in their remuneration scheme. Economic cycles are introduced in order to test for their effect on job satisfaction and productivity in each sector. We find that job satisfaction in the “public” sector is negatively correlated with the state of the economy. This effect, however, does not carry over to productivity: even though an increase in a worker's productivity in the public sector reduces his relative income, in comparison to a similar private sector worker, we find that this does not have a negative effect on job satisfaction.
J28|Unions and the economic basis of attitudes|Unions make differences to employee satisfaction that correspond to their effects on individual economic advantage. Panel data reveal how changes in economic circumstance and changes in job satisfaction are linked to changes in union coverage. When individuals move into a union covered job they receive a wage mark-up and express enhanced pay satisfaction. Conversely, those moving from a union covered job on average lose any mark-up and have significantly reduced satisfaction. Similar findings emerge for working hours. On average individuals prefer shorter hours, something they tend to (not to) achieve on moving into (out of) a unionized job, resulting in higher (lower) satisfaction. Switching into union coverage lowers satisfaction with job security, even though coverage has no effect on the risk of unemployment. This is because covered employees suffer greater costs of re-employment for a given level of unemployment risk, partly due to loss of the union mark-up.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J28|Occupational Stereotypes and Gender-Specific Job Satisfaction|" type=""main"" xml:id=""irel12126-abs-0001""> Using representative data containing information on job satisfaction and workers’ gender-specific prejudices, we investigate the relationship between stereotyping and job satisfaction. We show that women in stereotypically male jobs are significantly less satisfied with their work climate and job content than in stereotypically female jobs but more satisfied with their income in those same jobs. Our findings indicate that women trade off their higher income satisfaction against the negative consequences of stereotyping. As long as we take into account that stereotypically male jobs are physically more demanding than stereotypically female jobs, men are generally more satisfied with stereotypically male jobs."
J28|How Job Changes Affect People's Lives: Evidence from Subjective Well-Being Data|For representative German panel data, we document that voluntary job switching is associated with higher levels of life satisfaction, though only for some time, whereas forced job changes do not affect life satisfaction clearly. Using plant closures as an exogenous trigger of switching to a new employer, we find that job mobility turns out to be harmful for satisfaction with family life. By investigating people’s lives beyond their workplaces, our study complements research on the well-being impact of labour mobility, suggesting some positive welfare effects of flexible labour markets, but also a previously undocumented potential for negative implications.
J28|The effect of urban violence on student achievement in Medellin, Colombia|This paper examines the impact of urban violence on the standardized test scores of public school students in Medellin. I use the school-level variation in exposure to local homicides for years 2004-2013 in a model that includes school and year fixed effects, allowing me to control for the endogeneity of violence. I find that each additional homicide per year occurring within 500 meters of a school reduces student achievement by slightly over 0.01 standard deviations on a variety of tested academic subjects. For an average school, this implies dropping from the 50th percentile to the 47th percentile in a typical violent period. The effect does not appear to be driven by bias from student migration, and evidence from differential effects estimates is more consistent with supply-side channels. Examining the causal pathways of the effect, the impact of local violence is shown to induce higher levels of teacher turnover, although this may actually improve the average qualifications of teachers in the school in the long run.

J28|La Calidad del Empleo en la Población Afrodescendiente Colombiana: Una Aproximacion desde la Ubicacion Geografica de las Comunas|Este artículo construye un indicador compuesto sobre la calidad del empleo, al utilizar el método de componentes principales para la población afrocolombiana radicada en Cali, a partir de una encuesta representativa por comunas realizada por el Ministerio de Trabajo de Colombia. Cali, al ser la primera ciudad colombiana con mayor proporción de población afrodescendiente y la segunda de América Latina, después de Salvador Bahpia, Brasil, se constituye en un referente de la situación laboral de la población afrodescendiente colombiana. Los resultados muestran que los afrocolombianos que viven en la zona Oriente, compuesta por las comunas 7, 13, 14, 15, y 21, tienen una mayor probabilidad de tener empleos de baja calidad, por lo que existen localizaciones espaciales en torno a la calidad del empleo. La educación universitaria aumenta la probabilidad de encontrar un empleo de alta calidad.
J28|Desigualdades laborales: el empleo y la calificación de la mano de obra en Chile|Son conocidas las grandes diferencias salariales entre personas de distinto nivel de calificación. Sin embargo, cuando se piensa en las condiciones laborales de los individuos, son muchas otras variables las que también entran en juego. ¿En cuántas de éstas se encuentran peor las personas menos educadas? ¿En cuáles las diferencias son mayores? ¿Cómo ha evolucionado la inserción laboral según el nivel de estudios? Este trabajo indaga en estas preguntas y otorga respuestas preocupantes, que dejan en evidencia las muchas desigualdades en el empleo de personas de alto y bajo nivel de calificación. En particular, se comprueba que, conforme aumenta el grado académico de los individuos, mayores son sus tasas de participación y ocupación, mayores son sus ingresos laborales, suelen trabajar en jornada completa y con menor probabilidad de hacerlo más de nueve horas al día, es más probable que tengan contrato, que trabajen de forma dependiente y que realicen cotizaciones previsionales. También es más probable que trabajen en el sector público, en relación a quienes son menos calificados; y que se desempeñen en empresas de mayor tamaño. De esta forma este documento expone un serio problema: en la mayoría de los casos quienes presentan carencias en alguna de las dimensiones de sus condiciones laborales, al mismo tiempo las evidencian en varias otras. Es así como se observan casos extremos en donde hay trabajos de muy buenas condiciones y otros sumamente precarios. Por último, este documento también posee un foco secundario, centrado en poder entender de mejor manera cómo se explican los niveles de desempleo contenido o moderado que se han observado últimamente, a pesar de la desaceleración económica existente. Hecho que ha mantenido en intriga a varios economistas en el último período. Se señala que un aumento de la cantidad absoluta de inactivos no parece ser la mejor hipótesis para explicar el fenómeno. En cambio, se sugiere tener en cuenta que: (i) han existido leves aumentos del porcentaje de la población en la fuerza laboral que podrían estar ocultando un aumento en el número de desempleados, siendo que estos incrementos probablemente han sido absorbidos por la categoría de ocupados; y (ii) que las empresas sí serían sensibles al menor crecimiento, pero harían sus ajustes vía salarios y no vía despidos.
J28|Reintegration upon return: insights from Ecuadorian returnees from Spain|Using the ECM2 survey data on Ecuadorian migrants returning from Spain, we investigate the determinants of reintegration upon return. We study how the migration experience, but also the before- and after-migration characteristics, correlate with migrants' outcomes upon return. We adopt a broad conception of reintegration, considering jointly labor market-related outcomes that proxy for structural reintegration and subjective indicators that provide insights on sociocultural reintegration. The determinants of these two types of outcomes appear to be different: reintegration indeed encompasses multiple dimensions which cannot be captured by a single indicator. Our results suggest that return assistance programs' efficiency in helping reintegration could be improved by (i) targeting, ex-ante, returnees who plan to launch their own business, and, ex-post, the most vulnerable workers (women, older returnees, unemployed), and (ii) facilitating the labor market integration of foreign-educated returnees. They also call for further research to better understand the consequences of these programs.
J28|Home Offices: Plenty of Untapped Potential|As far as the share of individuals with a home office is concerned, Germany is below the EU average and lags considerably behind other countries such as France, the UK, or the Scandinavian countries. Only 12 percent of all employees in Germany work primarily or occasionally from home, although this would theoretically be possible in 40 percent of jobs. In most cases, an employee’s desire to work from home is not recognized by employers. If these employers were to reconsider their position, however, the share of people working from home could rise to over 30 percent. The disparity between employees wanting to telecommute and the options offered by employers is greatest in the financial sector and in public administration. Well-qualified full-time employees in particular are interested in working from home. The main motive would appear to be more autonomy in managing their own time, not only reconciling work and family life, since there are just as many singles who would like to work from home as there are single parents. Telecommuters often end up working much longer hours than average, and it is not at all uncommon for them to do unpaid overtime. Nevertheless, their job satisfaction is higher than that of other employees— particularly those who would like to work from home but are not given the option.

J28|Effectiveness of Social Capital in the Job Search Process|The empirical literature has provided ample yet contradictory evidence on the effectiveness of social ties in the job search process in terms of post-hire outcomes, such as wages or job satisfaction. Whereas early research, mainly focussing on the U.S. labour market, found positive correlations between finding a job via social ties and post-hire outcomes, most recent studies reported inconclusive or even negative correlations. Country differences in the effectiveness of social ties could be explained by differences in the effectiveness of other search channels, e.g. public institutions. Therefore, this study contributes to the existing literature by investigating the effectiveness of social ties in the German labour market which is commonly regarded as rather strict and monitored by strong labour market institutions. Based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), it is analysed whether wages, job satisfaction, and fluctuation are affected by the job finding channel. Furthermore, this is the first study which investigates whether job changes affect wage and job satisfaction differentials between the current and the previous job. Results show that finding a job via social ties is not related to higher income; yet, weak evidence can be found for higher job satisfaction and a reduction in turnover.
J28|How Important is the Type of Working Contract for Job Satisfaction of Agency Workers?|Previous research has found that agency workers are less satisfied with their job than regular workers on a permanent contract. All these studies have in common that they treat agency workers as a homogeneous group; that is, they did not consider the contract type agency workers hold. This paper analyzes whether differences in job satisfaction can be explained by the contract type using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. The analysis leads to three main results. First, differences in job satisfaction cannot be explained by the contract type. Second, agency workers on a permanent contract are significantly less satisfied with their job than regular workers on the same contract. Third, agency workers on a fixed-term contract do not differ in reported job satisfaction from regular workers on both fixed-term and permanent contracts. These findings give rise to the hypothesis that as a policy instrument agency employment appears to be well-suited for short-term periods, but it should be prevented that workers are persistently employed in such a work arrangement.
J28|Helping with the Kids? How Family-Friendly Workplaces Affect Parental Well-Being and Behavior|Despite political efforts, balancing work and family life is still challenging. This paper provides novel evidence on the effect of firm level interventions that seek to reduce the work-life conflict. The focus is on how a specific workplace policy, namely childcare support, affects the well-being, working time, and caring behavior of mothers with young children. We exploit the fact that since the mid 2000s an increasing number of employers have become proactive and implemented more family-friendly workplaces. These changes over time allow us to identify causal effects of childcare support using a difference-in-differences approach combined with matching. Based on a large panel dataset on families with children in Germany (FiD), we find evidence pointing to welfare enhancing effects of childcare support, as it strongly increases both childcare satisfaction and job satisfaction. In particular mothers who worked limited hours before the introduction, possibly due to constraints, increase their working time and use formal care more intensively. Satisfaction levels are also more strongly affected if mothers are career-orientated. In comparison, flexible work schedules, another family-friendly policy, only affect job satisfaction. Paternal well-being and behavior is not affected by the workplace policy.
J28|Betriebliche Unterstützung bei der Kinderbetreuung steigert die Zufriedenheit von Müttern|A family-friendly workplace is increasingly being regarded as essential in helping employees to balance work and family responsibilities. However, when it comes to the types of family-friendly work practices and the effects of these policies on parents’ well-being, hardly any representative evidence exists for Germany. In this study, we focus on child care support offered by employers in order to investigate how family-friendly workplaces affect the satisfaction of mothers and fathers in terms of work, family, and child care, as well as life overall. Results based on the dataset “Families in Germany” (Familien in Deutschland, FID) reveal that the introduction of child care support at the workplace significantly increases mothers’ satisfaction in all areas except for family satisfaction. Fathers’ satisfaction, however, remains largely unaffected by the type of policy considered here. Familienfreundliche Arbeitsplätze werden zunehmend als wesentlich gesehen, um die Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf zu erleichtern. Zu den Fragen, welche familienfreundlichen Maßnahmen Unternehmen anbieten und wie sich diese Maßnahmen tatsächlich auf das Wohlbefinden von Eltern auswirken, gibt es jedoch für Deutschland kaum repräsentative Forschungsergebnisse. In dieser Studie wird am Beispiel der betrieblichen Unterstützung bei der Kinderbetreuung untersucht, inwiefern familienfreundliche Arbeitsplätze die Zufriedenheit von Müttern und Vätern mit der Arbeit, der Familie, der Kinderbetreuung sowie dem Leben insgesamt beeinflussen. Auf Basis des Datensatzes „Familien in Deutschland“ kann gezeigt werden, dass die Einführung einer Unterstützung bei der Kinderbetreuung von Seiten des Arbeitgebers die Zufriedenheit von Müttern in fast allen Bereichen signifikant erhöht. Nur die Zufriedenheit mit der Familie ändert sich nicht signifikant. Die Zufriedenheit von Vätern hingegen bleibt von einer solchen Maßnahme weitestgehend unbeeinflusst.

Deutschland liegt beim Anteil der Personen mit Home Office (Heimarbeit) unter dem EU-Durchschnitt und deutlich hinter anderen Ländern wie Frankreich, dem Vereinigten Königreich oder den skandinavischen Ländern zurück. Nur zwölf Prozent aller abhängig Beschäftigten hierzulande arbeiten überwiegend oder gelegentlich von zu Hause aus, obwohl dies bei 40 Prozent der Arbeitsplätze theoretisch möglich wäre. In den meisten Fällen scheitert der Wunsch nach Heimarbeit an den Arbeitgebern. Würden sie umdenken, könnte der Anteil der Heimarbeiter auf über 30 Prozent steigen. Im Finanzsektor und in der öffentlichen Verwaltung klaffen die Wünsche der Arbeitnehmer nach Heimarbeit und die von den Arbeitgebern angebotenen Möglichkeiten am weitesten auseinander. Vor allem gut qualifizierte, vollzeitbeschäftige Arbeitskräfte sind an Heimarbeit interessiert. Grundlegendes Motiv ist offenbar der Wunsch nach mehr zeitlicher Autonomie und nicht allein die Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie, denn Singles möchten ähnlich häufig zu Hause arbeiten wie Alleinerziehende. Heimarbeiter kommen oft auf weit überdurchschnittlich lange Arbeitszeiten, und nicht selten leisten sie unbezahlte Mehrarbeit. Gleichwohl sind sie mit ihrer Arbeit zufriedener als andere Arbeitskräfte – insbesondere als jene, die sich Heimarbeit wünschen, aber nicht die Möglichkeit dazu erhalten.

J28|Job Satisfaction Amongst Public Employees Working Within Tax Administrations: Analyzing The Case Of Spain|This article entails an analysis of the satisfaction with which the human resources in the employ of the Spanish tax administration carry out their work, offering the results of an empirical study grounded on the results of a survey taking in 1401 employees. The results indicate that these employees do not feel valued in their workplace, define their career expectations as unfulfilled and display very little initiative in terms of the tasks they carry out. However, they are aware of the objectives to be met and possess a certain degree of autonomy when engaged in their job. On a general level, employees within the Spanish tax administration are unsatisfied with the tasks they perform, which negatively impacts the fulfillment of the ends pursued.
J28|The Impact of Organizational Justice on Employee Retention: Evidence from Oman|Increasingly, retaining competent employees is becoming a major concern for organizations. Sustainability and success of organizations are dependent on reducing turnover. Therefore, this research is designed to identify the role played by organizational justice dimensions in retaining employees within organizations. For that, a sample of 148 respondents working in Omani airports was selected for the study. The results reveal that all three dimensions of organizational justice i.e., distributive, procedural and interactional justices have positive and signifi cant impact on employee retention. Implications and directions for future research were also discussed
J28|Towards a Better Understanding of Foreign Workers’ Satisfaction with Cooperative Health Insurance: The Role of Service Characteristics, Financing, Choice of Plan and Customer Knowledge|This study explored the relationships among several antecedent factors, namely service characteristics, financing and choice of plan and foreign workers’ satisfaction (FWS) with cooperative health insurance (CHI). The study also hypothesized that customer knowledge situation would moderate the relationships among these antecedent factors and FWS with CHI. Drawing from a sample of 384 expatriates in Saudi Arabia, we found that service characteristics were positively related to FWS with CHI. We also found evidence regarding the relationship between CHI financing and FWS with CHI. Similarly, CHI choice of plan was found to be a significant predictor of FWS with CHI. Importantly, we predicted that perceived antecedent factors would each interact with customer knowledge in explaining FWS with CHI, such that this relationship would be stronger when customer knowledge situation is high and weaker when customer knowledge situation is low. Accordingly, the results generally supported our predictions
J28|What Drives Employee’s Involvement and Turnover Intentions: Empirical Investigation of Factors Influencing Employee Involvement and Turnover Intentions?|Research findings on job involvement and turnover intentions have been somewhat mixed. Scholars have often studied job involvement as an antecedent of some employee and organization outcomes, including job satisfaction and turnover. The present study examines the antecedents of job involvement and factors influencing it. Namely, organizational attractiveness, pay satisfaction, and organizational support. I also examine the effects of job satisfaction, job involvement, person-organization fit, and organizational support on turnover intentions and whether mediation mechanisms exist underlying the relationships between these constructs and turnover intentions. The analysis yielded mixed results for both constructs, involvement and turnover; suggesting further studies might be necessary, and that incorporating more intervening variables might help improve our understanding of the interrelationships between these constructs. Results are discussed and future research directions are suggested
J28|The Influence of Human Resource Management Practices on Career Satisfaction: Evidence from Malaysia|The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between human resource management practices (training and development, compensation and benefit, performance management) and career satisfaction. Data was collected through questionnaire from 80 employees of various banks in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. The results of the regression analysis showed that training and development and compensation and benefit were significantly related to employee career satisfaction. The findings suggested that training and development is the most important factor that influence career satisfaction followed by compensation and benefits. Performance management was found to be not significant in predicting career satisfaction.
J28|Job stress in Japanese academia: The role of relative income, time allocation by task, and children|We examine the role of income relative deprivation, time allocation by task, and children in the job stress experienced by Japanese academics. Males’ job stress increases when their incomes are lower than that of their peers’, but females are not susceptible to such income comparisons. Job stress decreases with hours spent on research, provided the hours are not excessive; however, hours spent in teaching and on administrative tasks always increase job stress. The presence of young children increases job stress only for females, and children largely explain the observed gender differences in job-related stress.
J28|Are employee-friendly workplaces conducive to innovation?|We find strong evidence that firms with employee-friendly workplaces achieve greater innovative success, particularly in industries where innovation is more difficult to achieve. Furthermore, employee-friendly firms were also more inclined to sustain R&D investment during the recent crisis. These findings are consistent with the view that an employee-friendly workplace helps to develop tolerance for failure, which encourages engagement in innovation. We find no support for alternative explanations, such as employee-friendly workplaces helping to attract and retain talented employees and reducing career concerns of executives, which could nurture innovation.
J28|Can workfare programs offset the negative effect of unemployment on subjective well-being?|Previous research suggests that unemployment negatively affects indicators of mental health and well-being, but it remains unclear whether active labor market policy can offset this effect. This paper examines a workfare program that was a key part of Germany’s active labor market policy for over 30 years. Fixed effects panel estimates suggest that participation in the workfare program offset most, though not all, of the negative effect of unemployment on subjective life satisfaction. Robustness tests find no evidence that this estimate is due to non-parallel time-trends, unobserved shocks in the pre-treatment period, adaptation to unemployment or differences in regional unemployment rates. These results suggest that active labor market policies can help reduce the negative psychological effect of unemployment.
J28|The impact of a closed formulary on prescribing patterns in the treatment of injured workers|Prescription drug spending accounts for nearly twenty percent of workers’ compensation (WC) health care costs, and prescription drug overdose is a leading cause of death in the United States. To guide physicians to prescribe safer, less addictive, and more cost-effective drugs, Texas WC implemented one of the first formularies tailored specifically for the treatment of work-related injuries by establishing a list of non-preferred drugs that require preauthorization before they can be prescribed. I draw on Texas WC administrative data on medical and pharmacy bills to examine the impact of the formulary on health care bills paid for through WC several months after a worker’s initial injury. I find that the closed formulary results in workers being half as likely to use non-preferred drugs and reduces average spending on non-preferred drugs by half several months after claims begin. I find no evidence that spending on preferred drugs or spending on non-pharmacy medical care increase to compensate for the decreased spending on non-preferred drugs. The lack of a shift towards preferred drugs suggests that doctors were not choosing non-preferred drugs over preferred drugs prior to the formulary. Instead, non-preferred drugs were one of multiple approaches doctors used in treating work-related injuries.
J28|Cash on the table: Why traditional theories of market failure fail|Many modern progressives attribute the market's failings to conspiracies by powerful corporate actors to exploit workers and consumers. In this paper I defend the claim that many of the same failures are instead often rooted in competition among individuals for relative advantage. In the familiar stadium metaphor, all stand to get a better view, only to discover that no one sees any better than if all had remained comfortably seated. Analogous discrepancies between individual and collective incentives help explain the presence of overtime laws, workplace safety regulations, and many other institutional features of the modern welfare state. These features would be useful even if all consumers were perfectly informed and rational and markets took the perfectly competitive ideal form described in textbooks.
J28|The fatality and morbidity components of the value of statistical life|The fatality risk–money tradeoff that is the value of a statistical life (VSL) may vary with the nature of the fatality event. While all fatalities involve loss of future life expectancy, the morbidity effects and their duration may differ. This article analyzes fatality risks accompanied by morbidity effects of different duration to disentangle the mortality and morbidity components of VSL using data from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI). The VSL is comprised of the sum of the value of the fatality risk and the value of the morbidity risk. Labor market valuations of morbidity risks are positive, even for fatalities that are caused by traumatic injuries. The value of the fatality risk is the dominant component of VSL, rather than the value of the morbidity risk.
J28|Household finances and well-being in Australia: An empirical analysis of comparison effects|This paper explores the importance of the household’s financial position for an individual’s level of well-being. Initially, the empirical analysis, based on the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, a large nationally representative panel survey, aims to ascertain the impact of the household’s monetary financial position on overall life satisfaction and financial well-being, with the latter being measured by financial satisfaction and subjective prosperity. The empirical analysis confirms that the household’s level of net wealth, assets and debt are important determinants of overall life satisfaction and financial well-being. The paper goes on to explore whether the financial situation of households in a comparison group influences an individual’s overall life satisfaction and financial well-being. The results suggest that the financial position of households in the comparison group is an important determinant of an individual’s level of overall life satisfaction and financial well-being, with information effects generally dominating comparison effects. In addition, the effects of the comparison group are asymmetric depending on whether a household’s financial position is above or below the average of the reference group.
J28|Wealth effects on job preferences|Preferences over jobs depend on wages and non-wage aspects. Variation in wealth may change the importance of income as a motivation for working. Higher wealth levels may make good non-wage characteristics relatively more important. This hypothesis is tested empirically using a reduced form search model in which differential job leaving rates identify willingness to pay for non-wage aspects of jobs. Marginal willingness to pay for non-wage aspects (measured by “job satisfaction for work in itself”) is found to increase significantly after large windfall wealth gains in British panel data. Thus, wealth influences more than just the hours worked.

J28|Quitting and peer effects at work|This paper studies the influence of peers on the extensive margin of effort at work by means of a real-effort experiment in which subjects have to decide on the intensity of effort and when to stop working. Participants perform a task alone or in the presence of a peer. The feedback on the co-worker's output is manipulated and we vary whether the two workers can communicate. We find that when communication is allowed, the average productivity per unit of time and the quitting time are not increased but the presence of a peer causes workers to stay longer and to quit at more similar times. Peer effects on the extensive margin of effort derive more from a sociability effect, i.e. a reduction of the social distance between co-workers that could make the other's presence more valuable, than from performance or quitting time comparisons.
J28|Share capitalism and worker wellbeing|We show that worker wellbeing is determined not only by the amount of compensation workers receive but also by how compensation is determined. While previous theoretical and empirical work has often been preoccupied with individual performance-related pay, we find that the receipt of a range of group-performance schemes (profit shares, group bonuses and share ownership) is associated with higher job satisfaction. This holds conditional on wage levels, so that pay methods are associated with greater job satisfaction in addition to that coming from higher wages. We use a variety of methods to control for unobserved individual and job-specific characteristics. We suggest that half of the share-capitalism effect is accounted for by employees reciprocating for the “gift”; we also show that share capitalism helps dampen the negative wellbeing effects of what we typically think of as “bad” aspects of job quality.
J28|Do women prefer female bosses?|The participation of women in the labor force has grown significantly over the past 50 years, and with this, women are increasingly holding managerial and supervisory positions. Yet little is known about how female supervisors impact employee well-being. Using two distinct datasets of US workers, we provide previously undocumented evidence that women are less satisfied with their jobs when they have a female boss. Male job satisfaction, by contrast, is unaffected. Crucially our study is able to control for individual worker fixed effects and to identify the impact of a change in supervisor gender on worker well-being without other alterations in the worker's job.
J28|Does choosing jobs based on income risk lead to higher job satisfaction in the long run? Evidence from the natural experiment of German reunification|Workers make job choices based in part on their income risk preferences. But how important is risk matching for long-run job satisfaction? Empirical research has been limited because job choices are endogenous, hindering identification of causal effects. We circumvent these problems by using data from the natural experiment of German Reunification. Pre-reunification East Germans chose jobs in a socialist environment without market income risk. These jobs were then exposed to market risks post-reunification, providing quasi-experimental variation. We find that workers in pre-reunification jobs report relatively higher job satisfaction, despite being less well-matched in terms of risk preferences. This unexpected result is robust to alternate explanations which might affect job satisfaction such as potential differences in job expectations, self-selection into leaving pre-reunification jobs, and past unemployment spells. We conjecture the results are consistent with projection bias: individuals at the start of their careers may over-estimate the extent to which risk matching matters for their future job satisfaction.
J28|Injured workers and their return to work: Beyond individual disability and economic incentives|Purpose - – The purpose of this paper is to study the factors affecting the return to work (RTW) of injured workers in an institutional setting where workers’ earnings are fully compensated during the disability period. Design/methodology/approach - – The authors use a unique data set matching employer-employee panel data with Italian workers’ compensation records. The authors estimate survival models accounting for workers’ unobserved heterogeneity. Findings - – Workers with higher wage growth, higher relative wages and from firms with better histories of stable employment, RTW sooner. More vulnerable workers – immigrants, females, members of smaller firms – also tend to return sooner. But even when we control for such measures of commitment, status, and job security, high-wage workers RTW sooner. Research limitations/implications - – The authors use proxies as measures of commitment and status. The authors study blue-collar workers without finer job qualifications. The authors estimate a reduced form model. Practical implications - – In an institutional environment where the immediate cost of workers’ compensation benefits falls largely on firms, employers seem to pressure those workers whose time off is more costly, i.e., high-wage workers. The lack of evidence of Social implications - – Workers who are induced to RTW before full recovery jeopardize their long- term health and employability. Firms that put such pressure on employees might generate social costs that can be particularity high in the case of high productivity workers. Originality/value - – The paper offers the first quantitative analysis of an institutional setting where injured workers face 100 percent benefits replacement rate and have job security. This allows focus on other workers’ or employers’ reasons to speed RTW. It is one of very few economics studies on this topic in the European context, providing implications for human resource managers, state regulators, and unions.
J28|Social interactions in job satisfaction|Purpose - – The purpose of this paper is to test empirically whether there exist spillover externalities in job satisfaction, i.e., to test whether individual-level job satisfaction is affected by the aggregate job satisfaction level in a certain labor market environment. Design/methodology/approach - – The authors use a linear-in-means model of social interactions in the empirical analysis. The authors develop an original strategy, motivated by the hierarchical models of social processes, to identify the parameters of interest. BHPS and WERS datasets are used to perform the estimations both at the establishment and local labor market levels. Findings - – The authors find that one standard deviation increase in aggregate job satisfaction leads to a 0.42 standard deviation increase in individual-level job satisfaction at the workplace level and a 0.15 standard deviation increase in individual-level job satisfaction at the local labor market level. In other words, the authors report that statistically significant job satisfaction spillovers exist both at the establishment level and local labor market level; and, the former being approximately three times larger than the latter. Originality/value - – First, this is the first paper in the literature estimating spillover effects in job satisfaction. Second, the authors show that the degree of these spillover externalities may change at different aggregation levels. Finally, motivated by the hierarchical models of social processes, the author develop an original econometric identification strategy.
J28|Good boss, bad boss, workers’ mental health and productivity: Evidence from Japan|It is widely believed that the relationship between a supervisor and his/her employees greatly affects employees’ well-being and/or productivity. However, only a few papers in the economics literature analyze how supervisors influence employees’ well-being and enhance productivity. This paper uses longitudinal data of employees with information about their immediate bosses’ ability, management skills, and characteristics (such as competency, communication skills, and personality traits) to investigate the influence of supervisors on employees. The main findings are as follows. First, even after controlling for individual-specific fixed effects and other job characteristics, such as those proposed in the job strain model, we find that supervisors’ good communication with staff and competency in managerial tasks significantly improve employees’ mental health. Second, we find that good communication between the boss and his/her staff enhances the latter’s productivity and lowers presenteeism. Third, supervisors’ bad communication and low competency increase the probability of quitting. Fourth, good communication partially depends on boss–staff compatibility, which is governed in part by their combined personality traits.
J28|Financing workforce development in a devolutionary era|"Workforce development financing has changed significantly over the last 25 years. In 2008, federal funding for the traditional workforce development system was 83 percent lower in real terms than it had been in 1980. As the federal system plays a smaller role in workforce development financing, the job training landscape better represents a ""marketplace"" where students and job seekers use federal training vouchers and grant and student loan money from various sources, primarily the Higher Education Act's Pell Grant and Federal Student Loan programs. Additionally, increasing volatility in the labor market has changed the relationship between employer and employee, leading to the need for a very different workforce development delivery and financing system than currently exists. These trends mark changes in the way that the broad workforce development financing system is consumer driven rather than driven by government or institutional priorities. Also, federal workforce development financing often carries significant restrictions on its use, limiting access to funding for innovative workforce development programs. {{p}} In the context of less centralized decision making, declining federal formula funding for workforce development financing, and increasingly complex and changing training needs, workforce development programs and state and local governments often find themselves responsible for developing and funding training. Devolution of responsibility for workforce funding has led to nascent innovation in state and local financing of workforce training, but many of the models have not been widespread. This paper examines the potential for some of these newer models of financing, such as bonding incremental payroll tax and social impact bonds as well as several prospective training models, including income-share agreements."

J28|Análisis de los factores que afectan la accidentabilidad minera con énfasis en los sistemas de trabajo|Aborda los sistemas de trabajo y su posible influencia en los factores determinantes de los accidentes laborales en minería. Se busca averiguar cuánto de la accidentalidad puede ser explicada por medio de este factor, así como de otros 4 relacionados a las condiciones de trabajo: el tamaño de la empresa, el nivel de automatización de las operaciones, el tipo de mina (tajo abierto o subterránea) y el nivel de tercerización de la fuerza laboral. Para esto se han realizado tres tipos de de análisis: Un estudio cualitativo de casos de operaciones mineras de algunas empresas en el que se puso mayor énfasis a los sistemas de trabajo y su influencia en la accidentabilidad, Un análisis descriptivo cualitativo por medio de encuestas de campo a supervisores mineros a fin de conocer su opinión respecto de los diversos determinantes de la accidentalidad, con énfasis en los 5 factores mencionados, Y finalmente: Un modelo cuantitativo basado en un análisis de regresión múltiple que considera como variables a los 5 factores mencionados para definir su poder explicativo respecto de la accidentabilidad.
