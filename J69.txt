J69|Factors Affecting the Intention of Millennial Workers in Indonesia to Leave|Objective - This study examines the effect of mediating work pressure on the relationship between the quality of work life and the desire to leave of millennial employees. Methodology/Technique - The highest portion of the workforce in Indonesia in 2016 is the millennial generation, which comprises around 62.5 million people. Millennials possess different attitudes, characteristics and skills than the Baby Boomer generation. Millennial employees are perceived to look for the value of work to improve the quality of work life rather than financial benefits. Organizations must understand the character of millennial employees to gain the best talents. Finding - The findings of the study show that quality of work life has a negative and significant effect on work stress. Meanwhile, work stress has a positive and significant effect on intention to leave. Finally, the quality of work life has a negative and significant effect on intention to leave. Research Limitations / Implications – This study concludes that work stress mediates the relationship between the quality of work life and intention to leave. This study concludes that quality of work life is very important for low work stress and reducing the intention to leave among millennial employees. Novelty – These findings expand upon existing research related to the quality of work life, work stress and turnover intention and provides recommendations for organizations to retain millennial employees.
J69|Political Ideology and the Intragenerational Prospect of Upward Mobility|We examine the effect of prospects of upward mobility (POUM) on the support for redistribution in an intragenerational context. In this context, existing literature so far fails to consider the potential indirect channel via political ideology through which mobility expectations affect redistributive preferences. We address this by including an interaction between income mobility and political ideology, such that the POUM-effect is allowed to vary with political beliefs. We find a robust POUM-effect that is conditional on political preferences. Only for right-wing individuals expected upward income mobility negatively affects support for redistribution. Left-wing individuals on the other hand prefer redistribution, regardless of expected upward income movements.
J69|Wage Income Distribution and Mobility in Malta|This paper uses information from a detailed administrative database on reported full-time employment incomes to study the distribution of wage incomes and mobility between 2000 and 2015 in Malta. Developments in wage distributions and mobility are discussed within the context of the structural changes that took place in the Maltese economy over the last decade. The main finding is that while inequality in Malta remains subdued by international standards, there has been an increase in recent years as low wages have remained stable in real terms, while those in the middle and at the top of the distribution have seen significant rises. Due to the rising demand for certain types of skills, wage mobility appears to have declined, particularly for older workers. This points to an importance of increased investment in education and retraining.
J69|Analysis of Unemployment Determinants in North Africa Countries, à Panel Data co-integration Approach|The aim of this study is to determine the Macroeconomic Determinants of unemployment in four countries of North Africa which are: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt. This study has applied the PANEL-VECM Model using annual data from 2000 to 2016 of unemployment rate, growth economic, government expenditure, money supply, oil price and population size, the data were taken From World Bank (WDI).Our results show that there is a long run relationship between unemployment and those macroeconomics variables in north Africa countries. in the short run, unemployment is defined by growth economic with a strong negative effect, but in the long run growth economic affects positively unemployment, but economic policies don?t affect unemployment in the short run, in the long run government expenditure and money supply affect negatively unemployment, but the impact of fiscal policy is more than monetary policy impact, oil price has a negative significant effect in the lag two, in the long run the impact of oil prices on unemployment is positive, population size don?t affect unemployment in the short run, however its impact is positively in the long run.
J69|Student Mobility in Tertiary Education: institutional factors and regional attractiveness|Member States have committed themselves to promoting the learning mobility of young people following the 2011 Communication on an agenda for the modernisation of Europeâ€™s higher education system (COM(2011) 567). The Council conclusions on a benchmark for learning mobility (2011/C 372/08) specified that by 2020 â€˜an EU average of at least 20% of higher education graduates should have had a period of higher education-related study or training abroadâ€™. In this report, two types of mobility are distinguished, namely degree mobility and credit mobility, both of which are included in the benchmark. Little research has been carried out on international student mobility determinants in general and on Erasmus students in particular, especially taking into account the regional dimension of learning mobility. This report focuses on student mobility in the EU between 2011 and 2014, through the description of the main destinations of mobile students, as well as on inward mobility across and within countries (measured as the share of mobile students on total student population), with a particular focus on institutions and regions. It also analyses the main factors associated with degree and credit mobility, taking into account different tertiary education levels (i.e. undergraduate, master and PhD level), through the comparison between institutional factors (teaching and research activities of universities as well as their reputation) and regional attractiveness (level of urbanisation, employment opportunities and regional education systems). There are five main conclusions from this report. First, in relation to the most attractive destinations, degree mobility appears to be very concentrated in a few countries, while credit mobility tends to be more equally distributed across Member States. Second, degree mobility is higher than credit mobility across and within countries. Third, institutional characteristics tend to be associated with student mobility more than regional ones. Fourth, among institutional characteristics, better quality universities and those with a higher reputation are associated with a higher share of mobile students, while research orientation and excellence are more relevant for degree mobile PhD students. Fifth, among regional characteristics, the level of urbanisation of the region is an important factor in shaping studentsâ€™ mobility: high-density regions have higher degree mobility rates, but a lower share of credit mobile students.
J69|The quality of employment in the early labour market experience of young Europeans|This paper presents a new approach to evaluating individuals' employment quality, considering the evolution of individuals' employment conditions over a period of time, instead of the quality of jobs held at a certain point in time. In particular, we present a new definition of employment quality, based on four dimensions: employment security, income security, economic success and the successful match between education and occupation. Using EU- SILC data, we analyse the extent to which the achievement of employment quality five years after leaving education varies according to gender, education, country groups and time periods. Our findings suggest that there is still a pressing need to enhance women's chances to remain continuously in employment and to move up in the labour income distribution. Loosening the rules on the use of temporary contracts actually generates more difficulties for women and low-educated individuals and it also appears to worsen youth employment prospects in general.
J69|Decomposing Beveridge Curve Dynamics By Correlated Unobserved Components|"""Between 1979 and 2009, the German labour market moved along a Beveridge curve with changing slope that usually shifted outwards but once inwards. We employ an unobserved components model to simultaneously disentangle permanent and transitory components of matching efficiency and separation rate (shifting parameters) as well as unemployment and vacancies. Cointegration and identification are especially addressed. We find a steady overlay of structural and transitory shocks for both shifts of and movements along the curve. Thereby, the separation rate is more important than matching efficiency and the two are negatively correlated. Labour market tightness is mostly driven by stochastic trends, which leads to permanent rotations of the job creation curve, i. e. movements along the Beveridge curve.""

J69|Tougher Than the Rest? Relationship between Unemployment and Crime in Croatia|In this paper, the relationship between unemployment and crime is analysed. A panel of 20 Croatian counties over the years 1998-2013 is used to estimate the effect of unemployment on the rates of various groups of property and violent crimes. According to the theory of economics of crime, increase in unemployment leads to higher crime rates. A fixed-effects model, including time- and county-specific effects and several covariates, is estimated. The results show there is no impact of unemployment on aggregate property crimes. For all violent crimes bar rapes, the results oppose the theory and intuition. The unexpected results are discussed in the context of the Croatian-specific macro-environment.
J69|Parental Unemployment and Child Health in China|This paper studies the causal effect of maternal and paternal unemployment on child health in China, analyzing panel data for the period 1997-2004, when the country underwent economic reforms leading to massive layoffs. We find that paternal unemployment reduces child health, while maternal unemployment has beneficial child health impacts. Analysis of channels shows that paternal and maternal unemployment have different effects on income, time use, mothers' blood pressure, and certain health investments, including children's diets. Our results support the notion that traditional gender roles can explain why mothers and fathers' unemployment affect child health so differently.
J69|The Impact of Late-Career Job Loss and Genotype on Body Mass Index|This study examines whether the effect of job loss on body mass index (BMI) at older ages is moderated by genotype using twenty years of socio-demographic and genome-wide data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). To avoid any potential confounding we interact layoffs due to a plant or business closure—a plausibly exogenous environmental exposure—with a polygenic risk score for BMI in a regression-adjusted semiparametric differences-in-differences matching framework that compares the BMI of those before and after an involuntary job loss with a control group that has not been laid off. Results indicate genetically-at-risk workers who lost their job before they were eligible for Social Security benefits, or before age 62, were more likely to gain weight. Further analysis reveals heterogeneous treatment effects by demographic, health, and socioeconomic characteristics. In particular, we find high risk individuals who gained weight after a job loss were more likely to be male, in worse health, single, and at the bottom half of the wealth distribution. Across the board, effects are concentrated among high-risk individuals who were not overweight prior to job loss, indicating unemployment at older ages may trigger weight gain in otherwise healthy or normal weight populations.
J69|Migration Impact On Economical Situation|This paper presents recent trends and flows of labor migration and its impact on economic and social life. Main aim of this research sets up the influence of the migration on the European economics and its competitiveness. Methods of research are: method of comparison, analysis method, method of deduction, method of statistics, modeling method. The economic impact of migration has been intensively studied but is still often driven by ill-informed perceptions, which, in turn, can lead to public antagonism towards migration. These negative views risk jeopardising efforts to adapt migration policies to the new economic and demographic challenges facing many countries. Migration Policy looks at the evidence for how immigrants affect the economy in three main areas: The labour market, public purse and economic growth. In Europe, the scope of labour mobility greatly increased within the EU/EFTA zones following the EU enlargements of 2004, 2007 and 2014-2015. This added to labour markets’ adjustment capacity. Recent estimates suggest that as much as a quarter of the asymmetric labour market shock – that is occurring at different times and with different intensities across countries – may have been absorbed by migration within a year
J69|The Refugee Crisis On Twitter: A Diversity Of Discourses At A European Crossroads|In the last decade, the European Union has approved and launched measures to promote Intercultural Cities, Diversity Management and the Integration of Immigrants in Europe. Despite this European framework, we are now at a crossroads between solidarity and humanity and an important restriction of refugees’ human rights across Europe. In this paper, we try to compare the international approaches to the refugee crisis in different countries in Europe. Data were extracted from Twitter. We obtained thousands of tweets about “refugees”, using this word in six different languages (English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish) from end November 2015 to 27 February 2016 as search strings. We performed a discourse analysis, focusing on the comparison between countries. A qualitative analysis with the help of both Atlas ti and T-Lab software was performed. The results showed a diversity of current discourses in Europe about refugees and the refugee crisis (from solidary to xenophobic ones), some of them very characteristic of particular countries or of local events experienced in these countries. These results allow us to reinforce the idea that we are at a key moment for the future development of Europe, especially regarding aspects concerning living together in cities and villages.
J69|The remittance behaviour of Kenyan sibling migrants|Abstract This paper examines the remittance behaviour of multiple-sibling migrants and the motivations of Kenyan siblings in sending remittances to their household of origin. The presence of other siblings is found to decrease the probability of remitting but has no effect on the amount sent. The volume of remittances sent by other siblings is also found to have no statistically significant effect on the amount sent by a sibling. Thus, the evidence obtained offers some mild, though not unambiguous, support for sibling remittances being driven by altruistic as well as independent motives. JEL Classification: B21, D19, J69
J69|Hogyan Tovább Közmunkaprogram? - Avagy A Példaértékű Nagyrédei Közmunkaprogram-Modell Bemutatása| Napjainkban a munkanélküliség problémájának leküzdése egyre nagyobb nehézséget jelent társadalmunk jelentős részének. A kormányzatok évtizedek óta próbálják lecsökkenteni a munkanélküliséget az országban. A munkahelyteremtés fontos szemponttá vált, melynek eredményeképp került előtérbe az átmeneti munkalehetőséget biztosító közfoglalkoztatás. Véleményünk szerint a közfoglalkoztatottság nem tökéletes megoldás, de szükséges, mivel a munkanélkülieknek lépcsőt képez a munka világába történő visszalépéshez. Fenntarthatósága viszont kétséges állami támogatások nélkül. Ennek okán tűztük ki célul, hogy a közmunka-program fenntartható működéséhez egy olyan gyakorlati példákkal megalapozott modellt dolgozzunk ki, amely az Észak-magyarországi régió településeinek és más hasonló települések számára is adaptálható. Elsődleges cél a közmunkaprogram fenntarthatóságának és a települések önállóságának elérése innovációkkal és jól átgondolt fejlesztésekkel. Mintaterületül Nagyrédét választottuk, ahol a Start közmunkaprogram jelentős szerepet játszik a település fejlődésében. Primer kutatásaink során többszöri látogatást tettünk a településen és mélyinterjúkat készítettünk az érintettekkel és néhány lakossal. Esettanulmányunk egy egyedi közmunkaprogramot, és a benne rejlő lehetőségeket mutatja be, további fejlesztési ötletek felvázolásával. A közmunkaprogram jövőjét egyfajta társadalmi vállalkozásban, szövetkezet létrehozásában látjuk, ami egybefogja az általános közmunka-programot, emellett folyamatos innovációk révén kihasználja a helyi adottságokat piacképes termék-előállítással. -------------------------------------------------- Nowadays combat the problem of unemployment is becoming more difficult for mean part of our society. The governments trying to reduce unemployment in the country for decades. Job creation has become an important point, as a result is came to prominence of public employment ensure for temporary jobs. In our opinion, the public employment is not a perfect solution, but it is necessary, as the unemployed constitute a step back to step into the world of work. The public employment is not fully sustainable without government subsidies. For this reason, we aim to create a sustainable a public works program, which practical examples of substantiated models and transferable to the settlements in region of Northern Hungary and other similar places. The primary goal of the public works program to achieve sustainability and autonomy of settlements with innovations and well thought out development projects. We are chosen Nagyréde, because plays a significant role in Start public works programs in the development of the town. During our primary research we has several times visited the village and made interviews with stakeholders and some residents. Our case study is a unique public works program, which shows the potential for further development ideas.
J69|Mismatch on the Dutch labour market in the Great Recession|The Great Recession has caused unemployment in the Netherlands to rise from 3.1% in 2008 to over 7% at the beginning of 2014. Structural imbalances caused by labour mismatch could be one of the explanations underlying this high rate. The goal of this paper is to examine this hypothesis. We adopt an eclectic approach to study if mismatch has increased during the Great Recession. First, we examine the development of the Beveridge curve. We estimate so-called â€œsteady-stateâ€ Beveridge curves based on underlying labour market flows. Outward shifts of these curves are associated with decreasing matching efficiency. Second, we construct a mismatch index which enables us to calculate the contribution of sector mismatch to the unemployment level. Our analyses show little support for the hypothesis that mismatch currently is a problem on the Dutch labour market. At the aggregate level, the Beveridge curve has not shifted outwards. Furthermore, at most one-seventh of Dutch unemployment can be attributed to sector mismatch, which is comparable to or below periods prior to the Great Recession.
J69|Dynamics of the black–white gap in academic achievement|The black–white test score gap remains a measurable phenomenon in the United States. Up to this point the literature has primarily focused on the black–white achievement gap without taking into account the underlying mobility patterns of individual students as they progress from one grade to the next. However, the degree to which policy makers and educators should be concerned about the black–white test score gap should be tied to how mobile the two groups of students are through the distribution of test scores from one grade to the next. In this paper I apply two nonparametric estimators of distributional mobility to data on test scores and track black–white differences in mobility across the entire distribution of achievement. When compared to whites, blacks tend to be less upwardly mobile and more downwardly mobile for both math and reading. This pattern is particularly prominent for reading in the very early years of schooling.
J69|The Rhode Island labor market in recovery: where is the skills gap?|There has been much anecdotal evidence claiming that Rhode Island's labor force is unable to supply the skills that the state's employers seek. The anecdotal evidence has given rise to the concern that labor market mismatch is holding back the state's economic recovery. Such a concern comes with particularly high stakes in the case of Rhode Island, which suffered the most severe drop in employment in New England during the Great Recession and has endured the region's highest unemployment rate during the recovery. This paper conducts a data-driven analysis of several indicators of potential labor market mismatch in Rhode Island in order to ascertain whether the state does indeed suffer from a skills gap that significantly restrains employment growth.
J69|Convergence, Crisis and Unemployment in Europe: The Need for Innovative Policies|The paper reviews the double crisis that affected the euro area in the recent period. The focal point is that the austerity measures that have been undertaken in the area, especially in the peripheral countries hurt by the sovereign debt crisis, have not only caused a deep recession but are likely to lead to stagnation and persistent unemployment. In the first part of the paper, original weaknesses in the construction of the monetary union are examined, the emphasis being placed on nominal convergence criteria without taking into account the need for real convergence. This analysis is corroborated by some econometric investigations based on sigma and beta convergence for different macroeconomic variables, distinguishing between the pre-crisis period, 1999-2007, and the recent 2008-2013 period. The empirical section continues with a discussion of recent macroeconomic trends focusing on unemployment: it stresses that the deep and prolonged recession can be defeated only by adequate demand management policies. The next section explains how the excessive austerity policies recently carried out have also been caused by wrong assumptions about the size of the fiscal multipliers. The final policy section emphasizes three aspects: (i) the radical reforms, at the European level, necessary if the monetary union is to survive; (ii) the changes in macroeconomic policies required to put an end to the present stagnation; (iii) the different and innovative policies needed to fight the high level of unemployment (especially youth unemployment).
J69|Are there Long-Term Earnings Scars from Youth Unemployment in Germany?|We analyze the relationship between early-career unemployment and prime-age earnings with German administrative linked employer-employee data. The careers of more than 720,000 male apprenticeship graduates from the cohorts of 1978 to 1980 are followed over 24 years. On average, early-career unemployment has substantial negative effects on earnings accumulated later in life. An identification strategy based on plant closure of the training firm at the time of graduation suggests that the revealed correlation is not the result of unobserved heterogeneity. Scarring effects also vary considerably across the earnings distribution. Workers with a high earning potential are able to offset adverse consequences of early-career unemployment to a large extent. Workers who are located at the bottom of the prime-age earnings distribution, in contrast, suffer substantial and persistent losses. Our findings imply that a policy with the aim of preventing early-career unemployment would have long-lasting beneficial effects on future earnings.
J69|Long-Term Unemployment and the Great Recession in the Netherlands: Economic Mechanisms and Policy Implications|A decomposition of GDP changes during the Great Recession shows that a relatively large part of the economic shock in the Netherlands translated into unemployment. Wages absorbed a larger part of the shock in Germany, the UK, and the US. The Netherlands has faced more long-term unemployment than other countries, particularly in recent years. Long-term unemployed workers are on the margins of the Dutch labour market. Neither real wages nor the number of vacancies respond to an increasing rate of long-term unemployment. Long-term unemployment is for an important part a problem of older unemployed workers. In the Netherlands, 40 % of the long-term unemployed workers are over age 50, which is almost twice as much as in the EU and the US. We identify three possible avenues for labour market reform: unemployment insurance, employment protection legislation and active labour market policies.

J69|Mismatch on the Dutch Labour Market in the Great Recession|We study if labour market mismatch has increased in the Netherlands during the Great Recession. First, we estimate a so-called “steady-state” Beveridge curve based on labour market flows. An outward shift of this curve implies decreasing matching efficiency. Second, we construct a mismatch index which enables us to calculate the contribution of sector mismatch to the increase in unemployment. Our analyses show little support for the hypothesis that mismatch is currently a significant problem for the Dutch labour market. At the aggregate level, the Beveridge curve has not shifted outwards. In addition, at most one-ninth of the Dutch unemployment rise can be attributed to sector mismatch, which is comparable to the contribution during the previous downturn.

J69|Access to Higher Public Education and Location Choices of Undocumented Migrants: An Exploratory Analysis|Many states have experienced a large influx of undocumented migrants in recent years. This phenomenon has created new demands on higher educational systems at the state level. Some states have passed legislation to restrict the access of undocumented migrants to higher public education whereas others provide access in various forms including in-state tuition. Our research examines a related issue that has not been researched much, namely, the impact of educational access on the location decisions of undocumented migrants in the U.S. Undocumented migrants appear to locate in states with high average median real per capita incomes. There is also evidence of clustering of undocumented migrants in states with large migrant networks. The effect of educational access on the percentage of undocumented workers in a state is mixed and small in most specifications, a finding perhaps indicative of a trade-off between competing priorities in the choice of location.

J69|Estimates of the Non-accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) for Hungary|Labour market tightness, that is the ratio of jobs to the unemployed, has an impact on wage setting, which also affects inflation. Among other things, the unemployment gap, which is the difference between unemployment rate and non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), is used to measure inflationary pressure from the labour market. This paper examines which of the NAIRU estimation methods described in the literature can be applied to Hungary. In evaluating the results, the revisional property of the NAIRU is also examined, as well as the forecast capacity of the unemployment gap with regard to wages. Based on these, the model containing the tightness indicator performs the best. This is notable from a forecasting perspective, because the vast majority of estimates in the literature use wages to provide an estimate of the unemployment gap. Therefore, an indicator which does not use wages at all to estimate the unemployment gap performs the best in forecasting wage growth. Based on the estimation the NAIRU has decreased in recent years. Of the factors affecting the NAIRU, the variables describing the general macro environment (total factor productivity, long-term unemployed, number of persons employed in construction, risk premium) have considerablely contributed to the decrease in the NAIRU, which may have been complemented by changes in labour market institutions. Based on the literature, the latter may be useful when explaining the differences between countries. For the estimation of these factors’ effects (e.g. decrease in the tax wedge, transformation of the unemployment benefit system etc.) further research is necessary. Within the framework of the sensitivity analysis, if the groups which are loosely linked to the labour market (e.g. discouraged workers) are also regarded as part of the free labour force capacity, the view of the tightness of the labour market (the unemployment gap) does not change. However, the results are sensitive to the assumption made about the labour market status of fostered workers.

J69|Skilling India: An Indian Perspective in the Global Context|This comprehensive paper deals with the efforts made, recent trends in, and critical issues and challenges pertaining to Skill Development in India. This paper argues that development and articulation of a national policy on skill development is a matter of priority. A task of skill development has many challenges. This paper further argues that the skills and knowledge are the driving forces of economic growth and social development for any country. Countries with higher and better levels of skills adjust more effectively to the challenges and opportunities of world of work. This paper critically evaluates the concepts of ?graduateness? and ?employability? that have also been the subject of much recent debate. This paper also critically evaluates the claim made that developing these skills will enable students to become more effective learners and they are seen to be crucial to enhanced study skills, the personal development planning processes, and consequently to higher levels of attainment. This paper further argues that the students of Higher Education are not getting desired practical benefits of education. This is equally applicable to the students of technical education also. This paper elaborately discusses on the emerging trends in and efforts made and role being played by/on the part of all concerned in Skill Development in India. This paper suggests various modes, modalities, methods of the Industry and Academia Interaction, for better results in the endeavour of skills development initiatives for sustainable and inclusive growth and development of India?s economy.
J69|Benchmarking Metis Economic and Social Development|This is a report on the socio-economic development of the Metis in Canada. The report identifies appropriate indicators to benchmark Metis socio-economic development against non-Aboriginal socio-economic development, while establishing a benchmark against which future progress can be gauged. Quite briefly, there have been strong gains in Metis socio-economic development, especially concerning income and education. In particular, Metis median income reached 86.7 per cent of non-Aboriginal median income in 2010, up from 72.9 per cent in 2000. In terms of education, the share of the Metis with a college, CEGEP or other non-university certificate or diploma as their highest degree actually surpassed the share of the non-Aboriginal population in similar areas by 2011. However, there are still a number of gaps that remain. For example, the Metis continue to have poorer indicators of health, especially concerning smoking. Furthermore, the Metis still have lower levels of suitable housing than the non-Aboriginal population. One of the most interesting findings of the report is the large gaps that exist within the Metis Nation between provinces. The report concludes that concerted efforts, determined cooperation, and substantial participation from Metis leaders and Metis organizations at both the provincial and national level will be required to close the remaining gaps between provinces within the Metis Nation and between the aggregate Metis and non-Aboriginal populations.

J69|Regional matching (in)efficiency on the Croatian labour market|This article investigates the efficiency of the matching process by panel stochastic frontier estimation of the matching function in Croatia. The empirical analysis is conducted on a regional level using regional office-level monthly data obtained from the Croatian Employment Service for 2000–2011. The results suggest that the efficiency of the matching process is rising over time, although with significant regional variations. In order to explore these variations, structural characteristics of the labour market together with some policy variables are included in the second-stage estimation. Various structural variables have different impact on the matching efficiency, while policy variables are mostly positively correlated with it. For instance, both active labour market programs and the number of high-skilled employees in regional employment offices positively affect matching efficiency. Additionally, when regional income per capita is included in the model, it shows positive impact on the matching efficiency, indicating that demand fluctuations predominantly affect the matching process. Finally, in order to get consistent estimates, panel stochastic frontier model transformation is applied. The obtained results show that there is no major difference in estimated mean technical efficiency coefficients in comparison to the original estimation.
J69|Salarios reales, desempleo y productividad en España|Este artículo estudia la relación entre los salarios reales y sus determinantes en la economía española durante el período 1980-2000, mediante la técnica de análisis de series temporales. Nuestro objetivo es analizar en qué medida la evolución de los salarios está influida por los desajustes del mercado de trabajo, medidos por la tasa de desempleo, así como por variables de negociación, como la productividad. Los resultados muestran un nulo efecto del desempleo sobre la evolución de los salarios reales, los cuales crecen de acuerdo con los incrementos de la productividad con una elasticidad positiva, aunque inferior a la unidad. ***** This paper studies the relationship between real wages and their determinants in the Spanish economy during the period 1980-2000 by means of the time series methodology. Our aim is to analyze to what extent the evolution of wages is influenced by the disequilibrium in the labour market, measured by the unemployment rate, as well as by bargaining variables such as productivity. The results show that there is no effect of unemployment on the evolution of real wages, which rise according to increases in productivity, with a value of the elasticity less than one.
J69|A Balancing Act at Times of Austerity: Matching the Supply and Demand for Skills in the Greek Labour Market|This paper provides an evidence-based assessment of the current situation prevailing in the Greek market for skills and jobs. The synthesis of available skills intelligence for Greece, the country most severely affected by the global economic crisis of 2008, is crucial as it is currently faced with tough decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources in the face of economic austerity. The paper engages in a comparative overview of Greece's performance on flagship Europe 2020 indicators on education and employment in relation to the EU. An empirical analysis of the incidence and determinants of skill mismatches in the Greek and EU job markets is also undertaken, using data from several European data sources. It is argued that a stronger vocational education and training pillar may constitute a valuable option for strengthening the links between the initial educational system and the labour market in Greece. But tackling skill mismatch requires skill development and skill utilization policies in the workplace. A stronger commitment to enhancing the skill content of jobs by employers via the adoption of high performance workplace practices, investment in continuous training, less reliance on casual labour and policies to support small and medium-sized enterprises in the war for talent are necessary if Greece is to make the most of its rich skills reserves.

J69|Low pay persistence in Europe|Using panel data for twelve European countries over the period 1994–2001 we estimate the extent of state dependence in low pay for male workers. Controlling for observable and unobservable heterogeneity as well as the endogeneity of initial conditions we find positive, statistically significant state dependence in every single country. The magnitude of this effect varies by country, however this variation is not systematically related to labour market institutions.
J69|El Ajuste al Equilibrio a Largo Plazo de los Salarios en España|This paper provides empirical evidence about the relationship between wages and their determinants in the Spanish economy from a macroeconomic perspective, as well as about the adjustment speed back to long run equilibrium, estimating an error correction mechanism by non-linear methods. The results reveal that the unemployment rate and the bargaining variables have nox effect on the evolution of wages. The variable that explains the evolution of wages in the long term is prices, with wages showing slightly inflationary behavior. In the short term, wages are explained by their past values, reflecting a nominal inertia.
J69|Factors Influencing the State-Level Settlement Pattern of the Undocumented Immigrant Population in the United States|This study empirically attempts to identify key factors determining the settlement patterns of undocumented immigrants within the United States. The estimations imply that undocumented immigrants appear to settle in states that border the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, or the Gulf of Mexico, and states where median family income is higher, average January temperatures are higher, the percent of the state population that is Hispanic is higher, and where economic freedom is higher. On the other hand, undocumented immigrants are less likely to settle in states with a higher cost of living. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2013
J69|(In)Efficiency of matching: the case of a post-transition economy|The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we provide estimates of the evolution in matching efficiencies in Poland, demonstrating decrease in estimated efficiency scores. These trends are accompanied by decreasing outputs in the matching function, as well as the lowering of the elasticities. Second, we relate the estimated efficiency scores to the use of active labour market measures. We find that job brokering intensity is conducive to matching efficiency, but active labour market policies coverage in general is not. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013
J69|Effectiveness of Further Vocational Training in Germany – Empirical Findings for Persons Receiving Means-tested Unemployment Benefits|Further vocational training for the unemployed aims at enhancing their job prospects. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of subsidized training programs for means-tested unemployment benefit recipients in Germany. The empirical findings are based on rich administrative data from the German Federal Employment Agency using propensity score matching to construct a suitable comparison group. We consider the initiation of training in early 2005, just after the reform of the German means-tested benefit system, which aimed at activating hard-to-place job-seekers, and after the introduction of a voucher system as the sole assigning mechanism for vocational training. We estimated the effects of vocational training for several groups differentiated by age, gender, migration background, skills, program duration, length of time since last job and differences between East and West Germany. As a result, we show that vocational training has a considerable beneficial impact on participants as it raises the employment rate in the intermediate term by up to 13 percentage points, and – with a slightly lower impact – it reduces the number of unemployment benefit II recipients.
J69|Ex post Investigation of Employment Drops: Case of Slovak and Czech Republic|In the study we propose an index of unemployment caused by structural changes. In the case of employment drop, the index enables to quantify what fraction of jobs has been lost because of ongoing structural changes. The index is based on distinction between temporary and permanent changes in employment in different industries. We consider fluctuations outside the corridor defined by initial and final level of employment to be temporary. It is possible to calculate the index only after employment reaches its former level which is its major drawback. We apply this methodology on Slovakia and Czech Republic during the period 1996 - 2007. We find out that in Slovakia, 62 % of jobs have been lost due to structural reasons. In Czech Republic, corresponding number is 55 %.
J69|The Effects of On-the-job and Out-of-Employment Training Programmes on Labor Market Histories|We evaluate the impact of both on-the-job and out-of-employment training on the mobilities on the labour market. Using a French survey that provides work and training participation histories over a five-year period, we estimate a multi-spell multi-state transitions model with unobserved heterogeneity and treatment of initial conditions à la Wooldridge. This allows to take participation in programmes and their duration as endogenous. We allow training to have an impact up to 12 months after entry into a program, so that we study both current and past duration and state dependencies. We find that there are interdependencies between the two types of training. Participation in training has a lasting effect on the individual trajectories. Receiving on-the-job training increases the risk of separation, but both types of training increases the hazard rate to employment.
J69|Structural unemployment and its determinants in the EU countries|Variables commonly used, in a panel setting, to explain unemployment rate developments (e.g. Bassanini and Duval (2006a, 2006b)) provide similarly good fit for structural unemployment rate, as measured by the Commission services (i.e. the so-called NAWRU). Those variables include labour market structural indicators, thus confirming the impact of labour market structural reforms on the NAWRU. In addition, we find that persistent demand shocks also have a bearing on the NAWRU. Such shocks are related to crisis events (i.e. unwinding of unsustainable developments). In particular, housing boom-bust episodes have statistically significant impacts on the NAWRU. Real interest rate and TFP growth, which controls more generally for the presence of such shocks, also matter. Put together, the explanatory variables account for 90% of the variance of NAWRU, in a 13 EU countries panel covering the period 1985-2009. The tight fit leaves no scope for statistically significant linear trend or period-effects. The paper also presents a new measure of the degree of generosity of unemployment benefit schemes, which has superior explanatory power compared to alternative measures commonly used to account for the role of this variable in similar studies.
J69|The Efficiency of the Matching Process: Exploring the Impact of Regional Employment Offices in Croatia|This paper investigates the efficiency of the matching process in Croatian labour market by estimating matching function by panel stochastic frontier estimation on a regional level using Croatian Employment Service data over the 2000-2011 period. Results suggest that the efficiency is rising over time, with great variations across regions. In order to explore these variations, structural characteristics of the labour market together with some policy variables are included into the second-stage estimation. Among structural variables the proportion of agricultural and high-skilled workers have the most important positive effect on matching efficiency, while the local unemployment rate and the share of low-skilled and workers without any experience among job-seekers have the most important negative effect. As far as policy variables are concerned, both ALMPs and the number of high-skilled employees in regional employment offices positively affect matching efficiency. Additionally, when regional income per capita is included into the model it shows positive impact on matching efficiency, indicating that demand fluctuations also affect the matching process. In order to get consistent estimates, panel stochastic frontier model transformation is applied. Preliminary results show that there is no major difference in estimated mean technical efficiency coefficients in comparison to the original panel stochastic frontier model.
J69|The Impact of Economic Freedom and Total Freedom on Gross State In-Migration: An Exploratory Study of the Great Recession Experience|Typically, the greater the degree of economic freedom, the more successfully and efficiently markets perform and the greater the prosperity created through private enterprise. These outcomes from greater freedom accelerate economic growth, which in turn creates opportunities for yet further success. It can also be argued that greater personal freedom promotes higher levels of utility for consumers in non-economic ways. Accordingly, the present study empirically investigates whether the prospects of greater economic freedom on the one hand and greater economic plus personal freedom, i.e., greater total freedom, on the other hand in any given state vis-à-vis other states act(s) to induce a greater influx of migrants. This empirical study of domestic U.S. migration during the Great Recession finds clear evidence that migrants prefer to move to those states affording higher levels of economic freedom and higher levels of total freedom.

J69|Gender Differences in Subjective Well-Being In and Out of Management Positions|"This study used data from the German Socio-economic Panel to examine gender differences in the extent to which self-reported subjective well-being was associated with occupying a high-level managerial position in the labour market,compared with employment in nonleadership, non-high-level managerial positions, unemployment, and non-labour market participation. Our results indicated that a clear hierarchy exists for men in term of how status within the labour market was associated with subjective life satisfaction. Unemployed men were the least satisfied, followed by men who were not in the labour market, while men in leadership positions reported the highest level of subjective life satisfaction. For women, no statistically significant differences were observed among women in high-level managerial positions, women who worked in non-high-level positions, and women who specialized in household production, with no market work. Only women who were unemployed reported lower levels of life satisfaction, compared with women in other labour-market statuses. Our results lend evidence to the contention that men can ""have it all"", but women must still choose between career and family in Germany. We argue that interventions need to address how the non-pecuniary rewards associated with high-level managerial and leadership positions can be increased for women. Such policies would also likely serve to mitigate the ""pipeline"" problem concerning the number of women who are available to move into high positions in the private sector.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
J69|Social-Cognitive Proximity And Labor Mobility: An Examination Through The Fellowmen Ties|Labor mobility is one of the important topics gaining importance in recent years in the international literature. Although the fact that mobile labors usually find their new jobs through the social relations of which they are part is discussed with reference to concepts of the social and cognitive proximity, there is almost no study devoted to the identification of the methods of measurement of the respective distance. In this study, firstly it is assumed that fellowmen relationships can be used as a proxy variable in order to measure the social proximity, and then databases compiled for Siteler, an industrial cluster located in Ankara and specialized in furniture making, is analyzed by employing the tools of the social network analysis in order to examine the relationships between fellowmen relationships and labor mobility. This study revealing the melting-pot characteristics of the cities, on the one hand, shows how to monitor the respective melting-pot on the base of an indicator developed by employing social network analysis, on the other hand, unveals the fact that although fellowmen relationships can be taken as a measure of social proximity facilitating the identification of new jobs for the mobile labors, the respective function of the fellowmen relationships is decreasing in importance.
J69|Unemployment and Right‐wing Extremist Crime|It is frequently argued that unemployment plays a crucial role for the occurrence of right-wing extremist crimes. We empirically test this hypothesis using data from Germany. We find that right-wing criminal activities occur more frequently when unemployment is high. The big difference in right-wing crime between East and West German states can mostly be attributed to differences in unemployment. This finding reinforces the importance of unemployment as an explanatory factor for right-wing crime and questions explanations based solely on the different socialization in former communist East Germany and the liberal West German states.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
J69|Industry structure and labor market flexibility in the South African manufacturing sector: A time series and panel data approach|This paper presents a joint analysis of labor market flexibility and product market structure. Our investigation confirms earlier results of imperfect competition in South African manufacturing where we find an average mark-up of 50% for the period 1970 to 2004 that is without consistent trend over time. The contribution of the paper is to provide a theoretically grounded means of linking output market conduct to labor market flexibility. We infer the proportion of labor associated with rigidities in the labor market from the mark-up, and find that two thirds of total labor employed in South African manufacturing is associated with rigidities. We find that this proportion falls during the 1980s and rises during the 1990s, suggesting an increase in labor flexibility followed by a decrease.
J69|Reservation Wages and Starting Wages|We analyse a unique data set that combines reservation wage and actually paid wage for a large sample of Dutch recent higher education graduates. On average, accepted wages are almost 8% higher than reservation wages, but there is no fixed proportionality. We find that the difference between reservation wage and accepted wage is virtually random, as search theory predicts. We also find that most information contained in the accepted wage is included in the reservation wage, as one would predict if individuals are well informed about the wage structure that characterizes their labour market.
J69|The Global Economic Crisis: Long-Term Unemployment in the OECD|This paper analyses the impact of the global economic crisis on unemployment and long term unemployment in the OECD. It uses simple econometric models using panel data (quarterly) and time series data. In general, we find that long term unemployment increases with the unemployment rate, there is persistence in long term unemployment, and that the employment protection variable and the replacement rate are statistically insignificant. Overall, the findings of our research are that there are many differences between the impact of the Great Recession on different countries. Countries that faced a significant financial crisis and a collapse of the housing market bubble have had large increases in unemployment and long term unemployment. There was a big fall in employment in the (especially) construction and manufacturing industries. The financial collapse led to an increase in unemployment in the financial and business sector. As a result of these twin shocks labour mobility of the unemployed is likely to be affected: with negative equity in housing, unemployed workers are unlikely to move regionally. With a loss of wealth (in housing and financial assets, including superannuation) there will be a fall in consumer spending which will slow down the recovery of economies. This means that, especially for some countries, there will be a long period of high unemployment and long term unemployment.
J69|Universities and Authors: A Ranking Based on Published Papers|We rank universities and colleges using the EconLit database and measuring quality by the number of American Economic Review-equivalent articles published over the ten-year period 1996-2005. We observe that there is some dissimilarity between the sub-fields rankings and that of the general field of Economics, so that the sub-field rankings provide extra information. The sub-fields ranks may be useful for students considering post-graduate work in specific areas.
J69|Entrepreneurship and unemployment: A nonlinear bidirectional causality?|This paper tests the view that the relation between unemployment and entrepreneurship is dynamic and possibly nonlinear. It performs Granger-causality tests and STAR-EXT estimation to assess the causality direction and the nonlinear nature of the relation for a set of OECD countries. The results reveal a bidirectional and nonlinear relation between business creation and changes in unemployment.
J69|Características de la marginalidad urbana: el caso del Estado de Oaxaca|Any conventional poverty line, determined from the purchase power standard ought to establish distinctions inside the essential expenditures, defining that poverty line, in the urban space as well as in the countryside. Migration flows toward cities are the result of employment composition. Farming activities are developed in rural fields, meanwhile industrial and service ones are achieved in urban spaces. Urban expansion has a diversifying capability for income and occupational structure. Marginalization is related to the anarchical urban growing, one of which consequences is that population groups can be found at the periphery, searching for job or carrying out low productivity activities.
J69|Of similarities and divergences: why there is no continental ideal-type of 'activation reforms'|"In matters of ""activation of social protection"" as in other policy areas, one would expect that three types of welfare regimes would be identifiable. However, with the hindsight of 20 years of the deployment of ""activation strategies"", it is still impossible to draw the stylized characters of a ""Bismarckian"" or "" conservative-corporatist"" type to compare with the Scandinavian and Liberal ones. In the domain, Germany and France have reformed, each with their own pace and timing, according to their institutional systems, systems of actors and political culture. They have much in common, but also persistent dissimilarities that can be ascribed to their long term history. The empirically detailed survey (from the 1960's) contributes to confirming that a ""broad view"" comparison leaves aside many crucial explanatory factors. It also shows the limits of an analysis in terms of welfare regimes, when it comes to explaining change and reform. Finally, both societies have implemented policies and reforms that have fostered an amazing fragmentation of situations, a much more complex situation that the simple opposition between ""insiders"" and ""outsiders"" is unable to capture, while it postulates a ""dualization"" of their social protection systems"
J69|The Impact of Financial Crises on Youth Unemployment Rate|"The impact of last financial crisis (2007-08) and subsequent global recession (2008-09) has been deeper on the weakest segments of the labour market. In this paper, we mainly focus on the extent and persistence of the impact of (past and last) financial crises on youth (15-24) unemployment rate. After a review of the existing (theoretical and empirical) literature on the determinants of youth unemployment rate in general and at the occurrence of economic crises, we present empirical estimations on the impact of past financial crises on young workers. We empirically investigate the relationship between financial crises and youth unemployment rate by employing fixed effects panel estimation on a large panel of countries (about 70) around the world for the period 1980-2005. Gender specific effect of crises on young workers is also investigated. To analyse the severity of financial crises for economies at different levels of economic development, we re-estimate our model for sub-samples of high income OECD countries and other economies in the sample. For further robustness check and sensitivity analysis, alternative definitions of crises are considered. The ""persistence"" of the impact of financial crises for young workers is also investigated. Finally we also estimate the Arellano-Bond dynamic panel, confirming the significance of the results. Young people are far more affected by the employment crises than the elder; long term unemployment for young workers can be harmful and may result in “discouraged workers” effects and social exclusion from labour market. Notwithstanding some peculiarities of the last crisis, our econometric investigations can be useful to better assess its impact on youth unemployment. At the end of the paper, before presenting some final considerations and policy implications, very recent data on youth labour market dynamics are analysed and discussed."
J69|School to Work Transition, Employment Attainment and VET. Theories Guide for Policy Makers|The employment attainment after a vocational training course, in a lifelong learning perspective is due to several factors, those inherent to the individual and those through exogenous scopes. In this theoretical revue we identify the most and the least notorious theories that can support policy maker’s decisions. This paper is a result of a subchapter of the author’s PhD thesis. The usefulness of the theories briefly described is under the reader’s verdict and judgment. The objective is barely to share a structured way to compare eleven “big groups” of theories, underneath ten different elements, that are commonly the aim of public and private policies.

We aim to provide to the reader a set of elements that help to distinguish, to compare and turn out accessible the eclectic dominant mainstream, in order to standardized, to clarify and to apply concepts in future research works and studies. We also suggest a study model with a different point of view.
J69|Wage Inequality and Labour-market Performance. A Role for Corporate Social Responsibility - Disuguaglianza salariale e performance del mercato del lavoro|In this paper we assess the scope for corporate social responsibility (CSR) within the area of wage inequality. We begin by noting that the salient trends in wage structures and employment across European and US labour markets are more complicated than implied by the so-called ‘unified theory’. This leads us to examine in detail the factors mentioned in the literature as contributing to poor labour-market performance in Europe. We find that (a) strong unions, a factor often believed to bring about wage compression and poor labour-market performance, are not necessarily associated with the latter when bargaining is sufficiently coordinated; (b) successful welfare reforms can bring about considerable improvements in performance without significant impact on inequality; © territorial mobility and child-care policies may considerably increase work participation, especially among women. We conclude that there is room for CSR to affect wage inequality, especially through firm-provided training. / Un ruolo per la responsabilità sociale di impresa? In questo lavoro si valuta il possibile ruolo della responsabilità sociale di impresa nell’ambito delle disuguaglianze salariali. Dopo aver rilevato che le tendenze salienti di salari e occupazione in Europa e Stati Uniti sono più complesse di quelle implicite nella cosiddetta ‘teoria unificata’, vengono esaminati in dettaglio i fattori a cui la letteratura attribuisce la cattiva performance del mercato del lavoro in Europa. Da questa disamina scaturisce che (a) il potere sindacale, spesso ritenuto fonte di compressione salariale e cattiva performance del mercato del lavoro, non è necessariamente connesso con quest’ultima, in presenza di contrattazione salariale sufficientemente coordinata; (b) appropriate riforme del sistema di welfare possono portare a migliori performance del mercato del lavoro senza un impatto significativo sulla disuguaglianza; © le politiche per l’infanzia, nonché una maggiore mobilità territoriale, aumentano notevolmente il tasso di attività, soprattutto tra le donne. Si conclude che vi è spazio per la responsabilità sociale di impresa nella riduzione delle disuguaglianze salariali, in particolare attraverso una maggiore formazione professionale fornita dalle imprese.

J69|Frontières d'efficacité et processus d'appariement sur le marché du travail au Maroc|The capacity of a labour market to generate new jobs from a pool of vacant positions and unemployed workers is interpreted as a form of transactional efficiency. It can be measured by estimating a matching function which describes the exchange situation between the demand expressed by businesses and the supply represented by workers looking for a job. In this article, we propose to calculate these estimates using efficiency boundary techniques. Two alternative methods, parametric and non-parametric, are applied to the regional labour markets in Morocco. The results are used to evaluate the matching efficiency on each market and to evaluate the activity of the Employment Information and Orientation Centres (Centres d’Information et d’Orientation pour l’Emploi [CIOPE]) created in the beginning of the nineties to make it easier to match the supply of graduates to demand.
