R51|Análisis de la Pobreza y Condiciones de Vida en Valledupar|En Valledupar la pobreza ha incrementado durante los últimos cuatro años, pasando de 27% en 2014 a 33,4% para 2017. La distribución del ingreso también sufrió un revés importante durante el mismo periodo de tiempo, cuando el coeficiente de Gini pasó de 0,42 a 0,46, lo que indica que en 2017 hubo una mayor concentración de la riqueza que en 2014 (DANE, 2018). Este documento estudia los principales factores que han incidido en el aumento de la pobreza y propone una serie de inversiones para contrarrestar la desmejora en las condiciones de vida de los valduparences. Los resultados indican que el deterioro en el mercado laboral (empleo, salarios e informalidad) y la calidad de la educación son los factores que explican el incremento en pobreza. Las inversiones propuestas en temas de educación, vivienda y trabajo, que reducirían la pobreza y generarían un entorno propicio para el desarrollo económico de Valledupar, requieren de $230 millones de dólares para los próximos 10 años, lo que implicaría un esfuerzo fiscal adicional por generar $22,8 millones de dólares adicionales anuales hasta 2030. **** ABSTRACT: Poverty rate increased six percentage points in the past four years in Valledupar (DANE, 2018). The income distribution deteriorated as well during the same period of time. This document studies the main factors that explain the rise in poverty in Valledupar during 2014-2017 and proposes a series of investments that will help the city to overcome this drawback in their economic and social development. The results show that the worsening in labor market conditions (wages, employment and informality rate) due to negative shocks in coal prices and low quality of education are the factors driving the poor performance of Valledupar in terms of poverty reduction. We propose a set of investments in education, labor policy and housing that cost $230 millions of dollars for the next 10 years, in order to create structural conditions for development and lower poverty.
R51|The Role of the Federal Housing Administration in the Reverse-Mortgage Market|The Federal Housing Administrationâ€™s Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program guarantees repayment on qualifying reverse mortgages made by private lenders. Reverse mortgages let older homeowners borrow money by using the equity in their home as collateral. The borrowed funds can be used to repay an existing mortgage or to fund other expenses. In this report, CBO examines how the HECM program works, how it affects the federal budget, and how various policy changes might reduce costs and risks to the government or to borrowers.

R51|Affordable Housing and City Welfare|Housing affordability has become one of the main policy challenges for the major cities of the world. Two key policy levers are zoning and rent control policies. We build a new dynamic equilibrium asset pricing model to evaluate the implications of such policies for house prices, rents, production and income, residential construction, income and wealth inequality, as well as the spatial distribution of households within the city. We calibrate the model to New York City, incorporating current zoning and rent control systems. Our model suggests large welfare gains from relaxing zoning regulations in Manhattan, and more modest gains from reducing the size of the rent control program. The former policy is progressive and a Pareto improvement, while rent control reform is regressive in nature and hurts the current beneficiaries.
R51|Time-Geographically Weighted Regressions and Residential Property Value Assessment|In this study, we develop and apply a new methodology for obtaining accurate and equitable property value assessments. This methodology adds a time dimension to the Geographically Weighted Regressions (GWR) framework, which we call Time-Geographically Weighted Regressions (TGWR). That is, when generating assessed values, we consider sales that are close in time and space to the designated unit. We think this is an important improvement of GWR since this increases the number of comparable sales that can be used to generate assessed values. Furthermore, it is likely that units that sold at an earlier time but are spatially near the designated unit are likely to be closer in value than units that are sold at a similar time but farther away geographically. This is because location is such an important determinant of house value. We apply this new methodology to sales data for residential properties in 50 municipalities in Connecticut for 1994-2013 and 145 municipalities in Massachusetts for 1987-2012. This allows us to compare results over a long time period and across municipalities in two states. We find that TGWR performs better than OLS with fixed effects and leads to less regressive assessed values than OLS. In many cases, TGWR performs better than GWR that ignores the time dimension. In at least one specification, several suburban and rural towns meet the IAAO Coefficient of Dispersion cutoffs for acceptable accuracy.
R51|On Regional Borrowing, Default, and Migration|Migration plays a key role in city finances with every new entrant reducing debt per person and every exit increasing it. We study the interactions between regional borrowing, migration, and default from empirical, theoretical, and quantitative perspectives. Empirically, we document that in-migration rates are positively correlated with deficits, that many cities appear to be at or near state-imposed borrowing limits, and that defaults can occur after booms or busts in productivity and population. Theoretically, we show that migration creates an externality that results in over-borrowing, and our quantitative model is able to rationalize many features of the data because of it. Counterfactuals reveal (1) Detroit should have deleveraged in the financial crisis to avoid default; (2) a return to the high-interest rate environment prevailing in the 1990s has only small long-run effects on city finances; and (3) anticipated bailouts double default rates.
R51|Taxes, traffic jam and spillover in the metropolis|This paper studies local governments' public policies in a metropolitan area plagued by traffic congestion, where both residents and workers consume local public goods. We develop a new spatial sub-metropolitan tax competition model which features a central city surrounded by suburban towns linked by mobile capital and mobile residents who commute to work. We show that Pareto-efficiency is achieved if towns can retain their workers using labor subsidies. Otherwise, traffic congestion in the city is inefficiently high and local governments respond by setting inefficient public policies: (1) the city over-taxes capital and under-taxes residents, which leads to too little capital and too many residents in the city; (2) local public goods are under-provided in the city and over-provided in the towns.
R51|Un impôt immobilier tout en un : rendement, progressivité et faisabilité|We examine the feasibility of a single property tax on the property and real estate holdings of households that would replace all the existing taxes on this type of wealth, in particular, the property tax, the IFI tax, the DMTO tax, the tax on real estate capital gains and the tax on rental income received by landlords. Net property worth, after deducting real estate debt and 50,000 euros for the value of the principal residence, would be taxed at a rate of 1% up to the threshold of the IFI (1.3 million euros) and at 1.5% beyond that. The revenue would be shared between the State and the local authorities through an equalization fund. After presenting the reasons underlying our reform proposal, we first assess the profile of the tax yield and tax burden according to income, family size and age by drawing on the INSEE wealth survey (enqu?te Patrimoine). The partial decorrelation of real estate income and assets makes a large tax yield difficult, even if the expected tax revenue is equivalent to the revenue lost from the taxes replaced. A cap on a single property tax in terms of disposable income would bring down its yield fairly quickly. JEL?classification: H23, H61, H71, R51
R51|2019/01 Merging city and suburban governments: A public choice perspective on the Norwegian local government reform|The administrative boundaries of the central city almost universally cover a smaller area than its functional boundaries. As mobility patterns go mainly into the central city, local governments in central cities supply public goods beyond their own residents. They should want to extend their boundaries in order to internalize more of these externalities, while suburban municipalities should oppose this. This implication is clear from a theoretical perspective, but can rarely be tested given that local government reform is infrequent and typically top-down. However, the 2014-2017 Norwegian municipal reform offers a rare opportunity for empirical evidence to test this proposition. The paper examines the merger decisions made by municipalities in all city regions in Norway. The analysis provides support for the proposition that central cities want to internalize more of the externalities from their public goods production, while suburban municipalities oppose this: First, central cities tend to have higher property tax rates and to provide more public goods compared to suburban municipalities. Second, central cities were much more interested in merging than suburban municipalities: while the central cities wanted to merge with a total of 75 suburban municipalities, only 15 of the latter were positive to merging with the central city.

R51|Whitelashing: Black Politicians, Taxes, and Violence|This paper provides the first evidence of the effect of tax policy on the likelihood of violent attacks against black politicians. I find a strong positive effect of local tax revenue on subsequent violence against black politicians. A dollar increase in per capita county taxes increases the likelihood of a violent attack by more than 25%. The result is robust to numerous economic, social, historical, and political factors. I also find that counties where black officeholders were attacked had the largest negative tax revenue changes between 1870 and 1880 and that violence against black politicians is unrelated to other forms of post-Reconstruction racial violence. This provides the first quantitative evidence that political violence at Reconstruction's end was related to black political efficacy.
R51|Business development and the growth of rural SMEs|The paper reviews the role of Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs) as drivers of employment and economic growth in rural regions across a number of OECD geographies. It argues that SME creation is especially important for rural economic development and identified lessons for national level policy that can help strengthen the performance of SMEs and enhance the creation of new SMEs. This working paper focuses on four cases studies in Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Scotland and the United States to derive general findings and recommendations.
R51|Should French municipalities foster urban densification to reduce their expenditures?|The relationship between population density and the costs of public services remains the subject of controversies due to the wide range of estimated elasticities. This disparity derives essentially from measurement and identification issues. Based on a sample of French municipalities for the period 2003-2015, this paper addresses both considerations and provides further evidence in support of a non-linear relationship between density and public expenditures per capita. First, we measure density differently from the traditional literature and consider two metrics. Second, to tackle endogeneity, we exploit historical records of population, settlements and soil characteristics as an exogenous source of variation. Our preferred specifications imply elasticity estimates equal to -0.13 and 0.12 for per capita current and capital expenditures respectively. Under a cubic B-spline specification, current spending initially decreases with density (up to 20 inhabitants plus jobs per ha) before increasing. In contrast, capital spending features several return points at 20, 30 and 50 inhabitants plus jobs per ha respectively
R51|Subnational government finances and capabilities for regional economic development in Uruguay: 1990-2016|The purpose of this work is to reflect on the relationship between subnational finance and the capabilities for regional economic development in Uruguay. It presents rigorous evidence of recent work on the relationships between fiscal decentralization, intergovernmental transfers and regional disparities in Uruguay. This is analyzed together with new available information on the evolution of subnational finances and a critical analysis of the productive policies developed in the country. It seeks to contribute to the current debate on the relationships between territorial development, decentralization and the role of public policy to reduce regional disparities. In this regard, it is concluded that these challenges require a better financing scheme for local development, with greater management capacity for decision-making at the local level. For this, as a prerequisite, it is urgent to improve the technical and management capacities of subnational governments.
R51|Move a Little Closer? Information Sharing and the Spatial Clustering of Bank Branches|We study how information sharing between banks influences the geographical clustering of branches. We construct a spatial oligopoly model with price competition that explains why bank branches cluster and how the introduction of information sharing impacts clustering. Dynamic data on 59,333 branches operated by 676 banks in 22 countries between 1995 and 2012 allow us to test the hypotheses derived from this model. Consistent with our model, we find that information sharing spurs banks to open branches in localities that are new to them but that are already relatively well served by other banks. Information sharing also allows firms to borrow from more distant banks.
R51|Der Einfluss sozioökonomischer Faktoren auf die Nutzung des digitalen Zugangs zu Finanzdienstleistungen: Risikopotenzial für eine informationelle Kluft in den Geschäftsgebieten der Sparkassen|Bisherige Studien haben den digitalen Zugang zu Finanzdienstleistungen untersucht und gut versorgte sowie unterversorgte Regionen in Deutschland identifiziert. Das Vorhandensein eines hinreichend guten digitalen Zugangs sagt aber nichts darüber aus, ob dieser auch genutzt wird, um damit Finanzdienstleistungen nachzufragen. Dieses Papier stellt die Kunden in den Mittelpunkt und untersucht, welche sozioökonomischen Faktoren Einfluss auf die Nutzung des digitalen Zugangs für die Nachfrage nach Finanzdienstleistungen haben. Als Ergebnis können auch jene Attribute benannt werden, die eine sogenannte informationelle Kluft befördern. Ein regionaler Vergleich ermöglicht schließlich eine Aussage dazu, in welchen Gebieten (hier Geschäftsgebiete der Sparkassen) Deutschlands die Gefahr einer informationellen Kluft besonders groß ist. Es zeigt sich, dass dieses Risiko in ländlichen, dünn besiedelten Gebieten, mit einem hohen Durchschnittsalter der Bevölkerung und in Regionen mit einem relativ geringen durchschnittlichen Ausbildungsgrad vergleichsweise hoch ist. Hier droht insofern ein besonders hohes Risiko, dass Menschen infolge der voranschreitenden Digitalisierung von Bankdienstleistungen abgehängt werden und den Zugang zu grundlegenden Finanzdienstleistungen als Basis gesellschaftlicher Teilhabe verlieren.
R51|Las finanzas públicas territoriales en Colombia: dos décadas de cambios|El panorama de las finanzas de las entidades territoriales en Colombia ha cambiado sustancialmente en los últimos años. Su dinámica ha estado estrechamente relacionada con la descentralización y las normas que la regulan. Este documento tiene el objetivo de presentar la evolución de las principales cuentas de los gobiernos subnacionales durante las dos décadas entre 1996 y 2015. El análisis se realizó por tipo de entidad territorial y por regiones. Los resultados muestran que el proceso descentralizador ha fortalecido las finanzas de municipios y departamentos, especialmente para los primeros a causa de la mayor fortaleza tributaria que han dejado las reformas administrativas y la coyuntura económica nacional. En el ámbito regional se evidencian tendencias similares pero con significativas disparidades, con mayor desventaja para la periferia. Por otro lado, aunque la dependencia de las transferencias continua alta, no hay evidencias de una relación negativa entre el crecimiento de las transferencias y las regalías y los ingresos propios de las los gobiernos subnacionales. *******ABSTRACT: The context of the Colombian subnational finances have changed during the last years. These changes have been closely related to fiscal decentralization and its regulatory standards. The main objective of this paper is to show the evolution of the subnational governments’ main financial accounts between 1996 and 2015. The analysis is carried out by type of territorial entity and also by regions. Results show that decentralization has actually strengthen municipalities and departments’ finances, especially the former because of the higher tax robustness given by administrative reforms and the national economic situation. At regional level, we found similar trends but significant disparities, with the highest in peripheral regions. On the other hand, even when transfers’ dependency is still high, it is also true that there is no evidence of a negative relationship between transfers and royalties’ growth and the growth of the subnational governments’ own revenues.
R51|Municipal Fiscal Health in Colombian Main Cities|Local governments are primary providers of basic services to their communities, and any decision they make will echo in the economy as a whole. That is why healthy and sustainable local public finances should be a national priority. With the purpose of contributing to the discussion on subnational fiscal health, a recently developed approach by Slack (2017) is applied to the 23 main Colombian cities. After preparing a brief and general profile of each city, five dimensions are analyzed in-depth: external, financial, tax and revenue, debt, and infrastructure. Results highlight the high complexity of what making a fiscal health diagnosis of local governments implies. Colombian cities do not seem to face profound fiscal health issues. Nevertheless, there is evidence of regional differences, where coastal lagged behind Caribbean and Pacific cities seem to suffer of structural and long-term weaknesses. On the other hand, inner Eastern and Central cities’ issues are more related to cash-flows and shortterm sustainability. **** RESUMEN: Los gobiernos locales son los principales proveedores de los servicios básicos en sus comunidades y, por tanto, cualquier decisión que adopten se verá reflejada en la economía como un todo. Esta es la razón por la que finanzas públicas locales sostenibles y saludables deberían ser una prioridad nacional. Con el propósito de contribuir a la discusión sobre salud fiscal subnacional, en este documento se aplica, para las principales ciudades de Colombia, la metodología reciente de Slack (2017) en la construcción de indicadores de salud fiscal. Luego de preparer un perfil general de cada una de las ciudades, se analizan más detalladamente el comportamiento de indicadores en cinco dimensiones: externa, financiera, impuestos e ingresos, deuda, e infraestructura. Los resultados dejan en evidencia la alta complejidad que implica el análisis y diagnóstico sobre salud fiscal de los gobiernos locales. Las ciudades colombianas no parecen enfrentar, en general, profundos problemas de salud fiscal. Sin embargo, existe evidencia de patrones regionales, en donde las ciudades pertenecientes a las regiones Pacífica y Caribe parecen mostrar fragilidad estructural de largo plazo. Por otro lado, los desafíos de las regiones del interior, Oriental y Central en particular, están más relacionadas con los flujos de caja y la sostenibilidad de corto plazo.
R51|Federal Support for Financing State and Local Transportation and Water Infrastructure|State and local governments own much of the nationâ€™s transportation and water infrastructure, such as highways, mass transit systems, airports, and water treatment systems. The federal government helps states and localities finance investments in such infrastructure through tax-exempt bonds, tax credit bonds, state revolving funds and infrastructure banks, and direct federal credit programs.
R51|Will destination-based taxes be fully exploited when available? An application to the U.S. commodity tax system|We develop a tax competition model that allows for the setting of both an origin-based and a destination-based commodity tax rate in the presence of avoidance and evasion. In the presence of evasion, jurisdictions will give cross-border shoppers tax preferential treatment, thus not fully exploiting the potential of destination-based taxation. Moreover, the divergence between origin-based and destination-based taxes is stronger when the incentives for consumers' tax-arbitrage opportunities increase. The United States is one example of many such systems. While sales taxes are due at the point of sale, use taxes are due on goods purchased out-of-state. We document that when able to set both rates, a majority of jurisdictions levy destination-based use taxes at a lower rate than origin-based sales taxes. In response to changes in state-level policies that increase tax avoidance opportunities, the results of the empirical model broadly confirm our theory.
R51|Analyzing the Efficiency of County Road Provision – Evidence from Eastern German Counties|This study analyzes the efficiency of the road provision of the local governments of eastern German counties using data envelopment analysis. The provision of roads is a costly public service, which makes an efficiency analysis in this field an interesting subject. I enhance the previous literature by first, examining the differences in the efficiency of eastern German counties; I consider the age of the foundations of roads, which previous studies have not considered due to data limitations. Second, I use a unique dataset on road quality for my efficiency analysis and show that efficiency levels differ from studies that apply proxies, such as the number of accidents, to analyze the quality of roads. These findings indicate there is a great need to develop suitable proxy variables to describe government services. Additional, I show that the correlations between efficiency levels and county characteristics vary greatly depending on the quality indicator used.

R51|Regional lobbying and structural funds. Do regional representation offices in Brussels deliver?|In recent years regional representation offices have proliferated in Brussels. Among the many aims of these offices are influencing the allocation and securing the transfer of European Structural and Cohesion funds to their respective regions. However, our knowledge about whether they have succeeded in this goal is limited. In this paper we assess the extent to which regional offices in Brussels have managed to affect the territorial commitment and payment of Structural and Cohesion funds for regional development beyond the main officially stated economic criteria of eligibility. The paper uses a custom-made survey of regional offices in Brussels, complemented by economic, institutional, and political data involving factors that should determine how much money is channelled to and disbursed in each region. The results of the Fixed Effects and Instrumental Variable analyses for a total of 123 regions over the period 2009-2013 highlight that the capacity - proxied by the budget and staff of the office - of the regional representation offices to influence the commitment and payment of Structural and Cohesion funds has been negligible, when not outright negative. Regional lobbying in Brussels does not lead to more funds or to an easier disbursement of regional development funds.

R51|Effects of State Taxation on Investment: Evidence from the Oil Industry|We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that firms do not in general respond equally to changes in prices and taxes in the setting of oil well drilling in the United States. Our key theoretical contribution is that in a multi-state model, a change in output price changes both the benefit and opportunity cost of drilling, whereas a change in a state tax rate only changes the benefit of drilling in that state. Thus, a firm responds more to a change in tax than a change in price. Our econometric results support this theoretical prediction. We find that a one dollar per barrel increase in price leads to a 1 percent increase in wells drilled, but a one dollar per barrel increase in tax leads to at least an 8 percent decrease in wells drilled. These estimates correspond to elasticities of about 0.5 and -0.3, respectively. These results are robust to interstate spillovers, other state regulations, and econometric specification. They imply that using state tax rate decreases to incentivize investment may lead to losses of government revenue.
R51|Distance and Decline: The Case of Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg, Virginia, prospered over two centuries as a center of production and trade. However, the city experienced economic difficulties beginning in the 1980s as a large number of layoffs at production plants in the area coincided with an erosion of retail trade in the city. Prolonged economic decline followed. In contrast, somewhat similar shocks in other moderate-sized cities in Virginia were followed by gradual economic recovery. We examine these differing outcomes and offer an explanation that hinges on the proximity of Petersburg to its larger neighbor, the greater Richmond area. We find evidence suggesting that after the job declines, higher-skilled residents in Petersburg initially commuted to jobs nearer to Richmond, later relocating from Petersburg toward Richmond--an option not readily available in the other Virginia cities considered. We suggest that, as a result, Petersburg suffered a sharp decline in tax revenues and that municipal costs could not be proportionately scaled down, leading to severe fiscal stress.
R51|Revisiting the determinants of non-farm income in the Peruvian Andes in a context of intraseasonal climate variability and spatially widespread family networks|Las fuentes de ingresos no agrícolas son cada vez más importantes en el mundo en vías de desarrollo, representando hasta el 50 por ciento del ingreso promedio de los hogares rurales. Aunque existe una amplia literatura sobre los determinantes de las estrategias de diversificación de ingresos de los hogares rurales, dos factores asociados con las transformaciones a largo plazo y comunes a muchos países en vías de desarrollo aún no se han integrado al análisis: (i) el rol de la variabilidad climática intraestacional (afectada por el cambio climático), y (ii) el rol de las redes familiares ubicadas en áreas distantes (cada vez más relevante dado el desplazamiento de la población debido al conflicto interno y al aumento de la conectividad a través de carreteras y comunicaciones). Mientras que un aumento en la variabilidad climática implica un aumento en el riesgo y la vulnerabilidad para las actividades agrícolas, las redes familiares ubicadas en regiones distantes (que no comparten el clima local o los shocks del mercado) pueden convertirse en un activo clave para gestionar el riesgo y promover oportunidades de ingresos (siempre y cuando transmitan información y oportunidades que no estén disponibles a través de las redes locales). Dadas las imperfecciones del mercado que son comunes en las áreas rurales en desarrollo, especialmente aquellas relacionadas con la gestión del riesgo climático, la consideración explícita de ambos factores es clave para entender las estrategias de diversificación de los hogares rurales. Este estudio tiene como objetivo contribuir con esta agenda pendiente, investigando el rol de estos dos factores en la diversificación de ingresos de un hogar en actividades no agrícolas en los Andes peruanos, una región montañosa con gran variabilidad climática intraestacional y conectividad espacial limitada pero creciente, donde la población rural la población se vio severamente afectada por el conflicto interno que tuvo lugar en el país durante los años ochenta y noventa. Se modelan dos resultados económicos: la proporción de horas de trabajo no agrícolas y la proporción de los ingresos del trabajo no agrícola. Se encuentra que al controlar por otros activos y condiciones ambientales, los hogares con redes distantes, pero fuertes tienden a diversificarse más en actividades no agrícolas (los resultados sugieren que existe un efecto de sustitución entre los vínculos lejanos fuertes y débiles). Los aumentos en la variabilidad climática intraestacional (representados por el rango de temperatura durante la temporada principal de cultivo) inducen a los hogares rurales a aumentar la participación relativa de los ingresos no agrícolas y las horas de trabajo. El análisis muestra efectos heterogéneos dentro de la región andina. Mientras que en la región norte y las áreas más frías de la región centroandina (menos de 13ºC durante la temporada de cultivo) un aumento en la variabilidad climática intraestacional induce a los hogares rurales a aumentar las actividades generadoras de ingresos no agrícolas, la región sur no muestra un impacto significativo. Se necesita de un análisis más amplio para comprender si esta falta de un efecto se explica por las respuestas relacionadas con la granja. Estos resultados sugieren que las intervenciones centradas en ayudar a los agricultores a hacer frente al cambio climático deberían considerar no solo las actividades agrícolas, sino también las habilidades y los activos necesarios para acceder a ocupaciones no agrícolas. Un tipo de activo que generalmente es descuidado por los proyectos de desarrollo son las redes distantes de los hogares, que de hecho pueden desempeñar un rol en las estrategias de gestión de riesgos, de acuerdo con nuestros hallazgos.
R51|Using a co-occurrence index to capture crop tolerance to climate variability: a case study of Peruvian farmers|Los pequeños agricultores peruanos de la región montañosa de los Andes han enfrentado históricamente una amplia variabilidad climática (de año a año y en la temporada de cultivo). Los conocimientos y prácticas tradicionales, incluida la diversificación de la cartera de cultivos y la selección de cultivos tolerantes, apuntan a salvaguardar la seguridad alimentaria incluso en los años “malos” cuando se materializan los riesgos relacionados con el clima o el mercado. A pesar de este conocimiento y experiencia históricos, los cambios climáticos acelerados plantean nuevos desafíos, frente a los que los agricultores luchan por adaptarse, especialmente debido a la falta de información oportuna y de recursos financieros y físicos. Comprender cómo los agricultores se están adaptando de forma autónoma es una necesidad pendiente, para poder informar a los responsables de las políticas sobre los cuellos de botella y las prácticas sostenibles que pueden fortalecerse para apoyar la adaptación eficiente. Este estudio se centra en un tipo de adaptación: seleccionar cultivos que parecen ser más tolerantes a condiciones climáticas variables. Los autores usan el índice de co-ocurrencia de Fridley et al. (2007), que mide la amplitud del nicho ecológico de una especie, para estimar la tolerancia relativa de los cultivos a un rango de condiciones ambientales. Utilizando datos del censo (paneles distritales de 1994 y 2012), estiman la tolerancia de cultivos para 252 cultivos en diversas condiciones ambientales en todo el país, desde las regiones montañosas de los Andes hasta las regiones costeras y selva amazónica. Los investigadores prueban la idoneidad del índice de cultivo para capturar la tolerancia del cultivo a condiciones climáticas variables (temperatura máxima, mínima y promedio, y precipitación) utilizando dos definiciones de variabilidad climática. Encuentran la correlación positiva esperada entre el índice y la variabilidad climática, lo que confirma la idoneidad del índice para capturar la tolerancia relativa a la variabilidad climática. También empíricamente aplican el índice para explorar el papel de la variabilidad climática intraestacional (durante la temporada de crecimiento) en la tolerancia relativa de la cartera de cultivos de los agricultores. Aunque se necesitan más análisis para modelar por completo las decisiones de los agricultores, nuestras estimaciones preliminares muestran que los agricultores ajustan sus carteras para incluir cultivos más tolerantes cuando enfrentan una mayor variabilidad climática.
R51|Local taxation and tax base mobility: Evidence from a business tax reform in France|This paper investigates the impact of tax base mobility on local taxation. We first develop a theoretical model in order to examine the connection between local business property taxation and tax base mobility within a metropolitan area. We find that decreasing capital intensity in the tax base increases the business property tax rates unambiguously. We then test this result using a French reform, which changes the composition of the main local business tax base in 2010. Estimations using Difference-in-Differences show that the reduction in the mobility of the tax base indeed results in higher business property tax rates. Housing tax rates were not affected by the reform.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R51|Optimal Fiscal Policy – Factors for the Formation of the Optimal Economic and Social Models|"Objective – The purpose of this paper is to develop the optimal economic and social model for the modern stage and analyze the Social Progress Index in Georgia. The research is based on the paradigm that ""what we analyze, this determines the decisions we make"". Consequently, emphasis is placed on issues that significantly affect human wellbeing. Methodology/Technique – In this top-down study, the empirical material is collected from official documents and public statements made by centrally placed politicians and administrators in Georgia as well as research conducted by international organizations in Georgia. The research database used is the legislative and normative acts adopted by the government of Georgia in the modern day, in particular: the National Statistics Office of Georgia, the Economic Development and Finance Ministries, the Georgian National Statistics Office, the Parliamentary Finance and Budget Committee and other related departments. Findings – This study shows that the formation of the optimal economic and social organization model of a country is particularly dependent on the selection and implementation of the most appropriate fiscal policy. The philosophy of social security is one of the greatest achievements of modern civilization. The present work is dedicated to the progress of human development – specifically, welfare issues. This provides the model for creating the optimal social security system of a population, with the following social system parameters: distribution of national income to the population and their families and addressing the issues of financing social security needs. Based on the study of the social experiences of social reform and the social indicators of the European Union, the alternate concept of prosperity and perfection is developed. These topics are the focus of the present work. Novelty – The empirical material contained within focuses on the period after 2005, when some important changes in political leadership took place. In 2003, Saakashvili became President of Georgia, Ivanishvili was elected as Prime Minister in 2012 and Kvirikashvili took over this position in 2015. During this time, there was also a shift in government social policy at a central level. The collection of empirical data for this study ends in 2017, giving a total study period of 12 years."
R51|The impact of the 2014 increase in the real estate transfer taxes on the French housing market|[eng] This paper estimates the effects of an increase in the share of the real estate transfer taxes (RETT) going to the French départements from 3.80% to 4.50%. Not all the départements voted the RETT increase on the same date, which is the starting point of a natural experiment. Using a difference-in-differences design, we estimate two main effects. (1) An anticipation effect, one month before the implementation of the reform, in order to avoid the RETT increase. (2) A retention effect in the post-reform period. In the end, the net effect (retention minus anticipation) corresponds to an average drop in transactions of around 6% over the first three months after the reform, that is, approximately 15,000 transactions lost at national level. If we find a short term effect of the reform, we do not find evidence of a medium- or long-term effect.

R51|“Does inter-municipal cooperation really reduce delivery costs? An empirical evaluation of the role of scale economies, transaction costs, and governance arrangements”|Inter-municipal cooperation in public service delivery has attracted the interest of local authorities seeking to reform public service provision in recent years. Cost saving has been among the most important drivers of such cooperation. However, the empirical results from the literature on inter-municipal cooperation and its associated costs offer contradictory outcomes in this regard. The boom in empirical studies addressing this question over the last decade offers insights into the factors that might explain the discrepancy in reported outcomes. With this objective in mind, we conduct a meta-regression analysis that considers all existing multivariate empirical studies of this matter. We formulate several hypotheses regarding scale economies, transaction costs, and governance of cooperation, based on the prior theoretical literature. While we find no clear indications of the role played by transaction costs in the relationship between cooperation and service delivery costs, we find strong evidence that population size and governance are significant in explaining the relationship. Specifically, small populations and delegation to a higher tier of government seem to offer cost advantages to municipalities when opting to cooperate. Furthermore, we build an extension of our model by disentangling service-related transaction costs based on asset specificity and ease of measurability of the service.
R51|Asymmetric regional dynamics: from bust to recovery|Regional convergence stands out in the severe adjustment of the Portuguese economy that followed the international financial crisis. This result contrasts with increasing regional inequality in other European countries. We show that regions’ GDP growth rates of the Portuguese economy were driven by debt and exports. Our estimates suggest that differences in regional debt-to-GDP and exports-toGDP ratios resulted in asymmetric regional economic dynamics. Highly indebted regions had a more severe recession and a slower recovery. Regions more open to trade had a milder recession and a stronger recovery. Finally, our results suggest that fiscal decentralization may improve regions’ resilience.
R51|“Causes of Sprawl”: A (Further) Public Finance Extension|There are good reasons to expect that attributes of local public finance may impact urban land use and, specifically, sprawl. A detailed and novel investigation of U.S. metropolitan areas (Burchfield et al., 2006) provides substantial insights into the causes of sprawl, but it overlooks the main characteristics of local public finance (taxes and user charges). Using a subset of the data matched to city public finance data, a parallel analysis yielded evidence that greater reliance on local property taxes reduces sprawl and suggested that user charges (primarily for water, sewerage and solid waste services) could have a similar effect (McMillan, 2016). Expansion of the local public finance data set allowed extension of the data analyzed from 83 to 109 observations. The subsequent analysis was expected to enable a refinement of the estimates made in the 2016 paper. However, analysis of the extended data set as reported in this paper indicates more nuanced results. In particular, the impacts of property taxes on sprawl depend upon the population of the metropolitan area.
R51|Community currency, local currency, negotiable voucher and others: a theoretical attempt to classify money substitutes into a system|"In our study we tried to group money substitutes including complementary currencies known as ""community currencies? in particular pursuing a new kind of approach. This objective was supported by the question whether there is a structuring principle according to which we can make groups of the different types of currencies and money substitutes in a structured manner. We have substantial and continuously developing literature of community currencies. However, as we know there are not many publications and studies about their classification. It is true that several authors and organizations have tried to make categories of currencies that exist besides legal currencies or that can be operated (e.g. Lietaer, Kennedy, Regiogelde. V Cooperation, Utterguggenberger Institution, Blanc, Bode, Boonstra and his colleagues, Greco, Mertignoni), but our opinion is that they are incomplete.On the one hand the aspects of classification developed in literature do not put the criteria of the classification into the whole monetary system and the currency system, on the other hand the main goal of certain criteria was not to create a structured system but to classify and to categorise the unique trials of money substitutes on the basis of some criteria. In our study we try to fill the two gaps above placing the certain types of money substitutes into a single system and a conceptual scheme."
R51|Smart Cities Ability to Address Economic Challenges|Smart City is a multi-dimensional concept, which includes several disciplines such as social, economic, and technological sciences. By using smart city data, city authorities and stakeholders are able to explore opportunities to enhance quality of life, to improve economic conditions, and to provide better services. Smart city data and its indicators have been conventionally applied for three goals: (a) emphasizing current strengths of a community; (b) measuring smartness in existing cities; and (c) creating a new (smarter) city. This paper explores smart cities ability to overcome economic challenges within cities in three phases. The first phase studies the existing literature of smart cities, their criteria and indicators. The second phase reviews specific previous and ongoing projects in order to identify the multi-dimensional aspect of the concept. The last phase investigates a new practical perspective of smart cities, which addresses economic challenges. The outcome of this study is a unique conceptualization of smart cities in economic and social projects.

R51|Tax Me, but Spend Wisely? Sources of Public Finance and Government Accountability|Existing evidence suggests that extra grant revenues lead to little improvements in public services in developing countries--but would governments spend tax revenues differently? This paper considers a program that invests in the tax capacity of Brazilian municipalities. Using variations in the timing of program uptake, I find that it raises local tax revenues and that the increase in taxes is used to improve both the quantity and quality of municipal education infrastructure. In contrast, increases in grants over which municipalities have the same discretion as taxes have no impact on any measure of local public infrastructure. These results suggest that the way governments are financed matters: governments spend increases in tax revenues more toward expenditures that benefit citizens than increases in grant revenues.
R51|Gridlock: Ethnic Diversity in Government and the Provision of Public Goods|How does ethnic diversity in government impact public good provision? We construct a novel dataset linking the ethnicity of California city council candidates to election outcomes and expenditure decisions. Using a regression discontinuity approach, we find that increased diversity on the council leads to less spending on public goods. This is especially true in cities with high segregation and economic inequality. Those serving on councils that experience an increase in diversity also receive fewer votes when they run for reelection. These results point towards disagreement within the council generating lower spending.
R51|Housing Supply Elasticity and Rent Extraction by State and Local Governments|Governments may extract rent from private citizens by inflating taxes and spending on projects benefiting special interests. Using a spatial equilibrium model, I show that less elastic housing supplies increase governments' abilities to extract rents. Inelastic housing supply, driven by exogenous variation in local topography, raises local governments' tax revenues and causes citizens to combat rent seeking by enacting laws limiting the power of elected officials. I find that public sector workers, one of the largest government special interests, capture a share of these rents through increased compensation when collective bargaining is legal or through corruption when collective bargaining is outlawed.
R51|Determinants Of Weanling Thoroughbred Auction Prices| Determinants of prices of 1,302 weanling Thoroughbreds sold at the 2010 November Breeding Stock Sale at the Keeneland Association, Inc. are investigated. Weanlings, who are less than one-year-old, are of unknown breeding and racing quality; still, prices at auctions display high variability. A hedonic price analysis is utilized to identify the determinants of weanling sales prices, and the corresponding marginal values of those determinants are estimated. Prices were highly responsive to variables related to pedigree quality, including the sire’s stud fee, whether the sire was relatively new in his breeding career or not, and whether the dam or the dam’s progeny had earned black type. In addition, prices were influenced by individual characteristics such as gender, age, state of birth. The weanling’s placement in the sale and pinhooked weanlings also influenced price. Results can be used as a decision tool by both buyers and sellers.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
R51|The Impact of a Rise in the Real Estate Transfer Taxes on the French Housing Market|This paper estimates the effects of an increase in the real estate transfer taxes (RETT) rate from 3.80% to 4.50%, following an optional reform implemented in March 2014 by French départements. Not all the départements implemented the RETT increase, which is the starting point for a natural experiment: using a difference-in-differences design, we estimate two main effects. (1) An anticipation effect a month before the implementation of the reform in order to avoid the RETT increase (timing response). The total tax base increased by 28% just the month before. (2) The classic depressing effect of a tax on the equilibrium quantity (extensive margin response) is estimated to be 7% on average from March 2014 to October 2015. All in all, the average net effect corresponds to a drop of the transactions of 4.6% over a period of ten months following the implementation date. Furthermore, we estimate that the elasticity of the tax revenue to the tax increase is about 0.65, meaning that départements' tax revenues are still on the increasing side of the Laffer curve.

R51|Gebietsreformen: Hoffnungen, Risiken und Alternativen|Seit Jahrzehnten fusionieren westliche Industrienationen kommunale Gebietskörperschaften in der Hoffnung auf Kosteneinsparungen, eine höhere Leistungsfähigkeit der Verwaltung sowie lokale Wachstumsimpulse. Verlässliche wissenschaftliche Evidenz zu Gebietsreformen ist jedoch erst seit wenigen Jahren verfügbar. In diesem Beitrag geben wir einen Überblick über empirische Studien zu den kausalen Effekten von Gebietsreformen auf öffentliche Ausgaben, die Effizienz und Qualität der Verwaltung, lokales Wachstum sowie mögliche politische Kosten der Zusammenschlüsse. Unser Überblick zeigt, dass bisherige Studien nur selten fiskalische Effizienzrenditen bei früheren Gebietsreformen nachweisen können. Allerdings zeigen sich substanzielle politische Kosten wie ein Rückgang der Demokratiezufriedenheit, der Wahlbeteiligung, der Zahl der Kandidaten bei Kommunalwahlen sowie eine Stärkung populistischer Strömungen. Vor diesem Hintergrund sind Instrumente mit geringerer Eingriffsintensität – z.B. interkommunale Zusammenarbeit, Funktionalreformen sowie verschiedene Maßnahmen der Verwaltungsmodernisierung – Alternativen zu Gebietsreformen, die bisher aber nicht systematisch evaluiert wurden.

R51|Out-of-town Home Buyers and City Welfare|The major cities of the world have attracted a flurry of interest from out-of-town (OOT) home buyers. Such capital inflows in local real estate have implications for affordability through their effects on prices and rents, but also for construction, local labor markets, the spatial distribution of residents, and ultimately economic welfare. We develop a spatial equilibrium model of a city that features heterogeneous households that make optimal decisions on consumption, savings, labor supply, tenure status, and location. The model generates realistic wealth accumulation and home ownership patterns over the life-cycle and in the cross-section. An inflow of OOT real estate buyers pushes up prices, rents, and wages. It increases the concentration of young, high-productivity, and wealthy households in the city center (gentrification). When OOT investors buy 10% of the housing stock, city welfare goes down by 0.3% of permanent consumption levels. The average renter suffers a large welfare loss while the average owner gains modestly. We adapt the model to the New York metro area, obtain detailed data on OOT purchases, and find that the observed increase in OOT purchases is associated with a 0.1% welfare loss.
R51|Las aglomeraciones urbanas y los impuestos: algunas ideas derivadas de la aplicación de la curva de Laffer al impuesto sobre la renta español en diferentes escenarios espaciales|Background: Optimal tax rates have been a recurrent theme in tax policy discussions. In particular, the link between tax structure and economic growth has revived the Laffer hypothesis that implies the existence of a parabolic relationship between level of taxation and achieved revenues. Our own hypothesis is that urban areas have an equally significant impact on willingness to pay taxes and that there can be as much or even more heterogeneity among urban sizes as there is among different territories. Methods: We contrast the Laffer hypothesis for the Spanish case under different spatial scenarios using microdata for 2009 provided by the country’s Institute for Fiscal Studies (IEF). We employ a cross-sectional sample of tax filers, estimated by means of least squares. Results: The presence of a parabolic relationship between the tax burden and tax collection enables us to obtain a revenue-maximizing tax rate of around 30%, twice the average rate currently applied. In our analysis by regions, we find significant variations that justify the existence of a high level of fiscal decentralization. However, this variability is also found to be significant in our analysis by size of city. The maximum tax revenue of the two main cities —Madrid and Barcelona— is obtained at a tax rate of 34%, with all other cities reaching their maximum revenue levels at similar rates. Conclusions: The smaller the city, the lower the rate that maximizes tax revenue, with the gap between the real rate and the optimal rate being greater the smaller the city.// Antecedentes: La búsqueda de las tasas impositivas óptimas ha sido recurrente en las discusiones de política fiscal. En particular, la relación entre la estructura tributaria y el crecimiento económico ha hecho resurgir la hipótesis de Laffer que implica la existencia de una relación parabólica entre el nivel de impuestos y los ingresos obtenidos. Nuestra hipótesis es que las zonas urbanas tienen un impacto igualmente significativo sobre la disposición a pagar impuestos y puede existir igual o más heterogeneidad entre los tamaños urbanos que entre los diferentes territorios. Metodología: En este artículo se contrasta la hipótesis de Laffer para el caso español utilizando microdatos del Instituto de Estudios Fiscales (IEF) para el año 2009 en diferentes escenarios espaciales. Para ello, se utiliza una muestra de declarantes de corte transversal estimada con mínimos cuadrados ordinarios. Resultados: La presencia de una relación parabólica entre la carga tributaria y la recaudación de impuestos permite obtener una tasa impositiva que maximiza los ingresos fiscales en torno a 30%, el doble del promedio aplicado. Por regiones, hemos observado variaciones importantes que justifican la existencia de un alto grado de descentralización fiscal. Pero esta variabilidad es también importante según el tamaño de las ciudades. Los ingresos fiscales máximos de las dos principales ciudades, Madrid y Barcelona, se obtienen con una tasa impositiva de 34%, mientras que todas las demás ciudades alcanzan el máximo de ingresos fiscales a tasas similares. Conclusiones: Cuanto menor es el tamaño de la ciudad, menor es la tasa impositiva que maximiza los ingresos fiscales, abriendo una brecha más grande cuanto más pequeña es la ciudad.
R51|Can Community Development Improve Health? Emerging Opportunities for Collaboration between the Health and Community Development Sectors|The two sectors of community development and health have long worked in the same neighborhoods, but they have not always worked together. This is starting to change, due in part to a growing recognition among health experts of the social, economic, and environmental factors that drive health outcomes. These social determinants of health have become the basis for new collaborations between community development and health professionals. This paper introduces professionals in both sectors to this emerging area of practice through a series of case studies of innovators in the southeastern United States. Case studies look at ways to bring housing and health professionals together, opportunities to leverage community development finance tools, and efforts to use Pay for Success to improve Medicaid spending. This discussion paper reviews early lessons on how to build a successful health and community development partnership, including an examination of the incentives for community developers, health professionals, state and local governments, and philanthropy to participate in these collaborations.

Also, this study shows the importance of local wisdom as a guide and as a source of knowledge, to fill and form the pattern of an agency relationship in the context of a more harmonious budget. Methodology/Technique – The research method used is ethnography. Ethnography is the science of writing about race, using a more contemporary language. Ethnography can provide detailed information on the daily activities of a culture in a group. Therefore, it could make detailed notes about the behavior and beliefs of the group from time to time. Findings – This study found that the interaction between principal and agent in traditional villages in the context of the budget have using local wisdom as a guide and as a source of knowledge. Balinese local wisdom forms the pattern of an agency relationship in the frame of a harmonious budget. The characteristics of Bali is very obvious from Hindu religion, customs, and culture. All are united in a harmonious atmosphere, which cannot be separated from the participation of all the components, as well as cultural heritage. The principle of people unity has been there long before Indonesia's independence, namely Pakraman village. Novelty – This study has explored the myth and value of traditional village in Bali by using ethnography methodology, which is taken the deep value of Bali tradition."""
R51|Spatial assessment of construction waste generated by residential buildings in rural areas|The management of construction waste it is at an early stage in urban areas and lacking in rural areas where this fraction is frequently uncontrolled disposed on public lands. Despite the fact some items of construction waste are considered inert for the environment (soil, concrete) it also contains hazardous items (paint additives, cans, and containers) or recyclables (plastics, metals, wood). Potential recovery of this waste stream is high if it is properly managed. The paper estimates the potential amounts of waste resulted from residential constructions across rural municipalities of Neamț County between 2002 and 2010. These statistical values are calculated at commune level (rural territorial administrative unit) in order to outline the disparities between various geographical areas using thematic cartography. This approach is correlated with demographic features in order to reflect such spatial patterns. The map of population density within built-up areas reveals where the construction sector is emerging at the county scale. Field observations highlight the existence of illegal disposal practices of construction waste in the proximity of settlements or water bodies. This waste stream should receive proper attention in following years in order to achieve recycling and recovery targets imposed by EU regulations.
R51|Local taxation and tax base mobility: Evidence from a business tax reform in France|This paper investigates the impact of tax base mobility on local taxation. We first develop a theoretical model in order to examine the connection between local business property taxation and tax base mobility within a metropolitan area. We find that decreasing capital intensity in the tax base increases the business property tax rates unambiguously. We then test this result using a French reform, which changes the composition of the main local business tax base in 2010. Estimations using Difference-in-Differences show that the reduction in the mobility of the tax base indeed results in higher business property tax rates. Housing tax rates were not affected by the reform.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

R51|Term limits for mayors and intergovernmental grants: Evidence from Italian cities|We investigate how term limits for mayors influence central government transfers to municipalities. Estimates are based on a dataset of Italian cities over the 1998–2010 period. To credibly identify the influence of term limits, our estimations include mayor fixed effects. We also consider intra-term differences in intergovernmental grants. We provide evidence that electoral incentives distort rather than discipline incumbent mayors’ behavior because transfers are higher before an election with an eligible incumbent, in line with the political budget cycle literature. This evidence is also consistent with the idea that the allocation of intergovernmental grants is influenced by lobbying on the part of eligible local government officeholders, as in Borck and Owings (2003).
R51|Vocational Schools as an Instrument of Interregional Competition – Empirical Evidence from German Counties|The German apprenticeship system is widely known throughout the world. We analyze expenditures on vocational schools on county level using data from 213 West-German counties between 2001 and 2006. We use spatial econometrics to test for spatial correlation in counties’ expenditure on vocational schools but find no evidence that vocational schools serve as instrument in inter-county competition. While the theoretical literature suggests that spending should be higher for apprentices from small firms, we find a negative relationship between the share of apprentices from small firms and the expenditures per pupil. Expenditures are found to increase in the share of Christian Democrats in the county council.
R51|City Equilibrium With Borrowing Constraints: Structural Estimation And General Equilibrium Effects|This article develops a general equilibrium model of location choice where mortgage approval rates determine household‐specific choice sets. Estimation of the model using San Francisco Bay area data reveals that the price sensitivity of borrowing constraints explains about two‐thirds of the price elasticity of neighborhood demand. General equilibrium analysis of the 2000–2006 relaxation of lending standards predicts the following impacts on prices and neighborhood demographics: (i) an increase in house prices accompanied by a compression of the price distribution and (ii) a reduction in the isolation of Whites reflecting gentrification. Both predictions are supported by empirical observation.

Besides the well-known tendency of concentration of the banking business in Moscow and reducing the number of banks in other regions we analyzed situation in the federal districts taking as an example the Siberian Federal District. This approach allowed us to formulate hypotheses about the causes of differences in the availability of banking institutions in Russian regions.

Starting from the theoretical aspects presented in the first part of this work, and ending up with the practical ones, an attempt was made to provide an answer to the following question: why are some cities more attractive than others and what criteria should be fulfilled in order for the life of a city’s inhabitants to be considered qualitative, and that city to be deemed liveable. For a city to be liveable, it is bound to fulfil several conditions, the most important ones being related to economy, environment, infrastructure (healthcare, transport, education etc.), and also to aesthetics & culture, ambient, ways of spending leisure time, safety of life, vicinity etc. Albeit there is no generally accepted concept of Liveable City, a series of methodologies recognised globally provide an assessment of this very aspect (many of them sharing the same elements). In this article, by means of the Liveability indices, cities are classified into several categories. The cities listed in one category are shown to be present in almost all the other categories, on positions that are similar. Hence, the city of Tokyo can be found in five out of six categories proposed by the international organisations which elaborated such methodologies, along with the City of London (in four out of six categories) and with New York City (in four out of six categories) etc. In Romania, the cities that might be classified as liveable are: Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Timisoara, Brasov, Constanța and Sibiu. The Capital City of Romania, i.e. Bucharest, is ranked the 28th in a List of European Capital Cities, being outranked by Cities like Sofia, Lisbon or Budapest, which means it still does not fulfil many of the criteria for a liveable city.
R51|Macroeconomic Trends and Factors of Production Affecting Potato Producer Price in Developing Countries|Principal component analysis is performed on 33 mainly agriculture related social variables of 40 developing countries. Important components are also put to explain potato producer price. The analysis reveals that the data set contains macroeconomic trends; economic growth, growing importance of the potato and improving infrastructures for the market economy. Although the coefficients for these trends in affecting potato producer price are not statistically significant, it is noteworthy that their signs are in line with observations from earlier research. Economic growth and increasing potato importance are often accompanied with potato price rising in developing countries, whereas improving infrastructures increase availability of food with lower average prices. Potato producer price is statistically significantly affected by four factors of production: land, labour, capital and technology. Relating potato supply constraints of earlier survey literature to principal component interpretation also revealed primary paths how these macroeconomic inputs are being formed in developing countries. Potato suitability allows more cultivated land and greater production with lower price. Agricultural poverty brings limited alternatives and poor terms of trade for farmers, with abundant labour at low wage rate leading to low potato producer price. Better alternative business lowers capital inflow to agricultural land development, entailing low production and high price. Knowledge increases productivity lowering price.
R51|Spatial assessment of construction waste generated by residential buildings in rural areas|The management of construction waste it is at an early stage in urban areas and lacking in rural areas where this fraction is frequently uncontrolled disposed on public lands. Despite the fact some items of construction waste are considered inert for the environment (soil, concrete) it also contains hazardous items (paint additives, cans, and containers) or recyclables (plastics, metals, wood). Potential recovery of this waste stream is high if it is properly managed. The paper estimates the potential amounts of waste resulted from residential constructions across rural municipalities of Neamț County between 2002 and 2010. These statistical values are calculated at commune level (rural territorial administrative unit) in order to outline the disparities between various geographical areas using thematic cartography. This approach is correlated with demographic features in order to reflect such spatial patterns. The map of population density within built-up areas reveals where the construction sector is emerging at the county scale. Field observations highlight the existence of illegal disposal practices of construction waste in the proximity of settlements or water bodies. This waste stream should receive proper attention in following years in order to achieve recycling and recovery targets imposed by EU regulations.
R51|Rural Waste Management Issues at Global Level(Introductory chapter)|This chapter intends to draw attention to solid waste management sector toward rural areas where bad practices and public health threats could be avoided through traditional and integrated waste management routes. The expansion of waste collection services across rural municipalities should be a priority for many countries. Agricultural and municipal waste diversion from wild dumps and open burning practices must be avoided through smart solutions at the local level which are cost-efficient particularly in developing countries. The book further examines, on the one hand, the main challenges in the development of reliable waste management practices across rural regions and, on the other hand, the concrete solutions and the new opportunities across the world in dealing with rural solid waste.
R51|Out-of-town Home Buyers and City Welfare|The major cities of the world have attracted a flurry of out-of-town (OOT) home buyers. Such capital inflows affect housing affordability, the spatial distribution of residents, construction, labor income, wealth, and ultimately welfare. We develop a spatial equilibrium model of a city with substantial heterogeneity among residents. We calibrate the model to the New York and Vancouver metro areas. The observed increase in OOT purchases is associated with 1.1% (5.0%) higher house prices and a 0.1% (0.34%) welfare loss in New York (Vancouver). Taxing OOT buyers can turn welfare losses into gains when tax revenues finance a local public good.
R51|Incidencia de la Política Fiscal en la Desigualdad y la Pobreza en El Salvador|La pobreza y la desigualdad son problemáticas que afectan a la población centroamericana, especialmente la que reside en el área rural. La política fiscal es la herramienta principal con la que cuentan los Estados para reducir la desigualdad. La reducción de la desigualdad a su vez incide en la disminución de los niveles de pobreza. Para determinar la incidencia de la política fiscal en la reducción de la pobreza y la desigualdad en Centroamérica se utilizó la metodología de «Compromiso por la Equidad» (CEQ por sus siglas en inglés). En términos generales, las intervenciones fiscales (impuestos y transferencias directas) aumentan la pobreza en la región centroamericana. El incremento de la pobreza en los países centroamericanos se da cuando se transita del ingreso disponible al posfiscal; es decir, después del pago de los impuestos indirectos; esto se debe a la naturaleza regresiva de este tipo de impuestos. En El Salvador la política fiscal tiene una leve incidencia en la reducción de la desigualdad, a través del gasto público y no por los impuestos. Las erogaciones en educación y salud y las transferencias, son los elementos que tienen mayor incidencia en la reducción de la desigualdad. La política fiscal salvadoreña no es capaz de reducir la pobreza total, especialmente de aquellos que habitan en las zonas rurales del país

R51|Labor versus Capital in the Provision of Public Services: Estimating the Marginal Products of Inputs in the Production of Student Outcomes|Does the enormous variation in financial resources available to local schools affect student achievement? There is an intense debate over the inequality of opportunity in public schools due to differences in financial resources, but there is little empirical evidence that sheds light on this issue. The main purpose of this paper is to measure the impact of various types of school expenditures (i.e. operating, minor capital, and major capital expenditures) on the short- and long-term educational achievement of students. This paper also looks at various channels (i.e. class size, attendance, discipline, and teachers' compensation) through which each type of expenditure could affect the performance of students. I use a dynamic regression discontinuity design that relies upon the exogenous variation in public school funding in Ohio that is created by marginally approved or failed local referenda to fund school districts. I find that only one type of expenditure, the approval of additional operating expenditures, has a positive effect in the short-term on the math proficiency of students subject to Ohio high school graduation tests, i.e. about 0.033 standard deviations (0.27 percentage points) for every additional $1,000 extra per pupil operating expenditure. I also find that the subsequent increase in the average expenditure on instructional staff is the only channel that can explain this effect. I do not find any long-term effect for any type of school expenditures.
R51|Do mergers of large local governments reduce expenditures? – Evidence from Germany using the synthetic control method|States merge local governments to achieve economies of scale. Little is known to which extent mergers of county-sized local governments reduce expenditures, and influence political outcomes. I use the synthetic control method to identify the effect of mergers of large local governments in Germany (districts) on public expenditures. In 2008, the German state of Saxony reduced the number of districts from 22 to 10. Average district population increased substantially from 113,000 to 290,000 inhabitants. I construct a synthetic counterfactual from states that did not merge districts for years. The results do neither show reductions in total expenditures, nor in expenditures for administration, education, and social care. There seems to be no scale effects in jurisdictions of more than 100,000 inhabitants. By contrast, I find evidence that mergers decreased the number of candidates and voter turnout in district elections while vote shares for populist right-wing parties increased.
R51|Einfluss des Regionalbankensystems auf die Mittelstandsfinanzierung|Infolge der Finanzkrise hatten britische Unternehmen deutlich häufiger Probleme Kredite zu erhalten als deutsche. Die Studie zeigt, dass ein Grund hierfür im deutschen Regionalbankensystem und seinen spezifischen Eigenschaften liegen könnte. Durch die Nähe zum Unternehmer besteht die Möglichkeit auch weiche Informationen in den Kreditvergabeprozess einfließen zu lassen. Ausnahmesituationen und deren Ursachen können so genauer erfasst und die vorhandenen Risiken besser bewertet werden. In den vergangenen Jahren wurde die Kreditvergabe aller Banken zunehmend stark reguliert. Gerade Regional- und Genossenschaftsbanken, die sich in der Krise als wichtige Stütze erwiesen, könnte dies jedoch finanziell überproportional stark belasten.
R51|Was bringen kommunale Gebietsreformen?: Kausale Evidenz zu Hoffnungen, Risiken und alternativen Instrumenten|Seit Jahrzehnten werden kommunale Gebietskörperschaften fusioniert, in der Hoffnung auf Kosteneinsparungen und eine höhere Leistungsfähigkeit der Verwaltung. In diesem Beitrag geben Sebastian Blesse und Felix Rösel einen Überblick über die bestehende kausale Evidenz zu den Effekten von Gebietsreformen auf öffentliche Ausgaben, Effizienz und Qualität der Verwaltung sowie zu den möglichen politischen Folgen der Zusammenschlüsse. Sie zeigen, dass Evaluationsstudien selten Effizienzrenditen von Gebietsreformen nachweisen. Allerdings ergeben sich unbeabsichtigte Nebenwirkungen auf die politische Partizipation: Die Bürger sind weniger zufrieden mit der Demokratie und gehen seltener zur Wahl, und die Ungleichheit zwischen den Ortsteilen nimmt zu. Vor diesem Hintergrund erörtern die Autoren alternative Instrumente wie interkommunale Zusammenarbeit, Funktionalreformen und Maßnahmen der Verwaltungsmodernisierung.
R51|Regional distribution of bank institutions in Russia: Role of state and education|The article presents results of research into territorial disparity of bank (branch) deployment for regions of Russia. It is suggested that there have been three periods of bank development in the country. The Siberian Federal District has been selected to illustrate each period and demonstrate real institutional changes of power distribution between the 'province' and the 'center' as well as the role of the state throughout the process. The dynamics of the number of regional banking institutions in recent years reflects falling concentration of banking business in all regions (with the exception of Moscow). However, despite the concentration of financial institutions in the capital there are notable regional financial centers. It has been attempted to identify factors for the territorial disparity. It turns out that beside regional population and income size significant factors include the status of the regional capital city and its educational potential.
R51|A Dynamic Model of Demand for Houses and Neighborhoods| This paper develops a dynamic model of neighborhood choice along with a computationally light multi‐step estimator. The proposed empirical framework captures observed and unobserved preference heterogeneity across households and locations in a flexible way. We estimate the model using a newly assembled data set that matches demographic information from mortgage applications to the universe of housing transactions in the San Francisco Bay Area from 1994 to 2004. The results provide the first estimates of the marginal willingness to pay for several non‐marketed amenities—neighborhood air pollution, violent crime, and racial composition—in a dynamic framework. Comparing these estimates with those from a static version of the model highlights several important biases that arise when dynamic considerations are ignored.
R51|Distance and Modern Banks' Lending to SMEs: Decentralised versus Centralised Banking in Germany|By lending to SMEs at low geographical distance, banks can realise competitive advantage due to enhanced access to soft information that allows the better screening of firms. As especially regional banks lend at a low distance, the decentralised German banking system is deemed ideal for SME finance. However, as banking regulation requires the use of rating systems for screening, it can no longer be assumed that modern regional banks “naturally” conduct credit decisions at lower distances to SMEs than big banks. In fact, drawing on an ethnographic study at one German savings bank and one big bank, this paper shows that the regional savings bank does not always reach credit decisions at a lower distance. However, at the moment when soft information becomes crucial the big bank decides at a high distance, which is likely to oppress the usage of soft information.
R51|Niedrigzinsphase, Standardisierung, Regulierung: Regionale Banken was nun?|Die dezentralen Sparkassen und Kreditgenossenschaften in Deutschland gelten als prädestinierter Finanzpartner von KMU. Jedoch werden Zweifel an der Bedeutung und Zukunftsfähigkeit dieser mehr als 1.400 kleinen und regionalen Banken geäußert. Exemplarisch zeigen wir auf, dass dezentrale Banken trotz der Standardisierung von Kreditvergabeprozessen und insbesondere dem gesetzlich vorgeschrieben Einsatz von Ratingsystemen weiterhin Kredite vor Ort entscheiden. Daher können sie weiche Informationen besser berücksichtigen und somit Kreditrestriktionen lindern. Eine wichtige Säule dieser Vor-Ort-Entscheidungskompetenz ist die gesicherte regionale (einlagenbasierte) Refinanzierung. Die expansive Geldpolitik der EZB setzt das Einlagengeschäft jedoch unter Druck und wird somit zu einer Herausforderung für die Sparkassen und Kreditgenossenschaften.
R51|Local governments' indebtedness and its impact on real estate prices|In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of public debt on real estate prices and rental prices. We identify shocks to investment credits of self-governed cities in Germany and control for potential benefits such as an increased supply of public goods, which might come in hand with increased indebtedness. Using spatial variation across self-governed cities allows us to estimate this effect. We find that shocks to public debt have a significant negative effect on apartment prices. Rental prices, on the other hand, do not seem to be affected by public debt. Tenants care more about the current and less about the future tax burden.
R51|Ready for Take-off? The Economic Effects of Regional Airport Expansion|This paper analyzes whether the expansion of regional airports in Germany caused positive spillover effects on the surrounding economies, exploiting the deregulation of the European aviation market as a quasi-experiment. Such potential spillovers are often used as an argument for the substantial annual subsidies to airports. Previous evaluations often suffer from the problem of reverse causality, since investment decisions are based on the economic conditions of the region. By contrast, the aviation deregulation under the Single European Market-initiative provides an exogenous incentive for investing in the expansion of existing regional airports. A difference-in-differences approach is used to estimate the causal effects of this expansion on regional growth. The results are sobering, though, as there is no evidence for any positive spillover effects.
R51|Crowdsourcing City Government: Using Tournaments to Improve Inspection Accuracy|"The proliferation of big data makes it possible to better target city services like hygiene inspections, but city governments rarely have the in-house talent needed for developing prediction algorithms. Cities could hire consultants, but a cheaper alternative is to crowdsource competence by making data public and offering a reward for the best algorithm. A simple model suggests that open tournaments dominate consulting contracts when cities can tolerate risk and when there is enough labor with low opportunity costs. We also report on an inexpensive Boston-based restaurant tournament, which yielded algorithms that proved reasonably accurate when tested ""out-of-sample"" on hygiene inspections."
R51|Do Fiscal Rules Matter?|Fiscal rules are laws aimed at reducing the incentive to accumulate debt, and many countries adopt them to discipline local governments. Yet, their effectiveness is disputed because of commitment and enforcement problems. We study their impact applying a quasi-experimental design in Italy. In 1999, the central government imposed fiscal rules on municipal governments, and in 2001 relaxed them below 5,000 inhabitants. We exploit the before/after and discontinuous policy variation, and show that relaxing fiscal rules increases deficits and lowers taxes. The effect is larger if the mayor can be reelected, the number of parties is higher, and voters are older.

El propósito es ofrecer un diagnóstico comparativo de la competitividad institucional en gobiernos locales de Monterrey mediante dos estudios complementarios. Primero, se analiza comparativamente la competitividad en una muestra de las 10 ciudades más competitivas del Norte de México, considerando diversos indicadores predeterminados. Después, en un segundo análisis se hace un estudio con diversos indicadores financieros a cinco de los municipios más importantes de la Zona Metropolitana de Monterrey, en el Estado de Nuevo León.

R51|Identifying the Benefits from Home Ownership: A Swedish Experiment|This paper studies the economic benefits of home ownership. Exploiting a quasi-experiment surrounding privatization decisions of municipally-owned apartment buildings, we obtain random variation in home ownership for otherwise similar buildings with similar tenants. We link the tenants to their tax records to obtain information on demographics, income, mobility patterns, housing wealth, financial wealth, and debt. These data allow us to construct high-quality measures of consumption expenditures. Home ownership causes households to move up the housing ladder, work harder, and save more. Consumption increases out of housing wealth are concentrated among the home owners who sell subsequent to privatization and among those who receive negative income shocks, evidencing a collateral effect.
R51|FHA loan performance and adverse selection in mortgage insurance|Using propensity score matching and survival analysis, we examine the performance of FHA- and privately-insured home purchase mortgages relative to uninsured mortgages. Privately-insured loans are more likely to default than uninsured loans with comparable risk characteristics, indicating the presence of adverse selection. By contrast, loans insured by FHA are not more likely to default than similar uninsured loans. Hazard ratios for both insurance types fall when an adjusted rate spread variable, but does not eliminate the disparity between uninsured and privately-insured loans. On the other hand, privately-insured loans are less likely to prepay while FHA-insured loans are more likely to prepay relative to uninsured loans.
R51|Payment changes and default risk: The impact of refinancing on expected credit losses|This paper analyzes how access to credit and the path of mortgage rates can affect borrower credit risk. This is a crucial issue for evaluating refinance programs as a form of loss mitigation, and it became prominent in the debates around the Treasury Department's Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP). These debates exposed gaps in the literature on the relationship between credit performance and changes in borrowers’ monthly mortgage payments. Since then, several new studies have attempted to fill these holes, each pursing a different methodology. In this paper, we review the relevant debates and look at what downward adjustments in prime adjustable-rate mortgages can tell us about modifications of prime fixed-rate mortgages. We argue that this method better addresses the various sampling biases that plague all attempts to predict HARP's impact. Our analysis indicates that typical monthly payment reductions under HARP would reduce credit losses by 56 basis points.
R51|Housing equity, residential mobility and commuting|Highly productive economies require a flexible labor force with workers that move in accordance with the changing demand for goods and services. In times with falling housing prices, the mobility of home owning workers may be hampered by a lock-in effect of low or even negative housing equity. This paper explores the effect of housing equity on both the residential mobility and the commuting pattern of homeowners. We merge administrative registers for the Danish population and properties and get highly reliable micro data for our analysis. We find that low and negative housing equity substantially reduces residential mobility among homeowners. The negative effect of locked-in low equity families on labor market mobility may be mitigated by commuting. However, our results show that family heads in low or negative equity homes are not found to commute more than households with higher housing equity, but also that a considerable fraction of home owning family heads commute. The analysis of the joint decision of homeowners to commute or move shows that the option of moving, as an alternative to not moving and not commuting, is chosen by five to six percent of homeowners with low housing equity, while the option of not moving but commuting is chosen by 60%.
R51|Housing price bubbles, new supply, and within-city dynamics|Although there is broad recognition that cities differ in their tendency to experience house price bubbles, most studies assume away any possibility of within-city heterogeneity in response to a bubble. We develop a model that suggests that this assumption may be appropriate when markets are rising but can be far from reality on the bust side of a bubble. During a housing boom, new construction and related supply adjustments by developers ensure stable relative prices between low- and high-quality segments of the housing market. On the bust side of a bubble, however, reduced housing starts allow demand-side forces and mortgage default to create pressure for relative prices to diverge across market segments. Absent a change in technology, as markets recover and new construction rebounds, relative prices should revert back to pre-crash levels. Evidence based on 2000–2013 single-family home sales in Phoenix, Arizona supports this modeling framework. Additional evidence also suggests that high rates of mortgage default contributed to divergence in relative prices when markets crashed.
R51|A spatial model of school district open enrollment choice|We provide an analysis of the determinants of adoption of inter-district open enrollment policies by school districts in Ohio. Legislation passed in 1997 allows Ohio's school districts to adopt one of the following open enrollment options: 1) prohibit enrollment of students from any other school district in the state (no open enrollment), 2) permit enrollment of students from adjacent school districts, or 3) permit enrollment of students from any school district in the state. We employ a recently developed spatial autoregressive lag multinomial logit model to examine the determinants of adoption of each open enrollment alternative. Among the most influential factors are school districts' demographic characteristics, financial factors, and competitive environment. More importantly, the results show evidence of strategic interaction, with a positive correlation in policy choice between neighboring school districts of about 0.4.
R51|Capitalization of equalizing grants and the flypaper effect|The wide-ranging empirical support for the flypaper effect in local public finance remains a puzzle in spite of various theoretical explanations. We exploit a reform of the fiscal equalization system in the Netherlands to show that the resulting change in grants to municipalities was fully capitalized into local house prices. Nevertheless, only a small fraction was passed on to residents through property taxes, indicating local public service provision as the main adjustment channel. As the marginal homebuyer was apparently willing to pay for these services, capitalization makes rent seeking by local politicians or bureaucrats improbable — thus effectively ruling out one class of explanations for the flypaper effect. The absence of a significant effect on municipal staff provides further evidence against a bureaucratic flypaper effect.
R51|The fiscal externality of multifamily housing and its impact on the property tax: Evidence from cities and schools, 1980–2010|Negative fiscal externalities produced by apartments and other small housing units are commonly cited as the justification for many local land-use restrictions, such as minimum lot requirements and limits on multifamily developments. Because these laws effectively limit the number of small dwellings that can be built within a community, proponents argue that restrictions of this type help to guarantee that new homes will “pay for themselves” by discouraging free-riding behavior within a system of property tax funded local governments. Critics, however, have maintained that such policies constitute a veiled attempt by suburban communities at restricting entry for low-income families. Focusing on the clear distinction between housing units located in multifamily structures (i.e., apartments) and single-family homes, this paper finds strong evidence that residential per-capita values, measured as value per person and value per child, are actually higher for apartments, not single-family residences. Consequently, communities' effective property tax rates decline as apartments' share of the housing stock rises, holding all else equal. These findings are contrary to the set of assumptions that are often used to justify many of today's land-use restrictions and raise serious questions regarding the efficacy of modern fiscal zoning as a tool for promoting efficient fiscal federalism.
R51|Further empirical evidence on residential property taxation and the occurrence of urban sprawl|Economic theory indicates that as the effective rate of taxation on residential property rises, a negative influence on capital intensity could occur through less multi-story structures built (an Improvement Effect). Alternatively, a positive influence on capital intensity could occur through housing consumers switching to smaller houses built on smaller lots (a Dwelling Size Effect). An empirical assessment of this issue is therefore necessary; however, methodological concerns in earlier empirical analyses cast doubt on the reliability of findings. Panel data, fixed effects, regression results indicate that a higher rate of effective residential property taxation increases the amount of land used for a given population (greater sprawl).
R51|Rural electrification in India: Galilee Basin coal versus decentralised renewable energy micro grids|The state of Bihar in India has approximately 75 million people with no access to electricity. The government of India has pursued a policy of rural electrification through the provision of centralised coal-fired power which has been unable to resolve the low levels of electrification. Coal supply woes in India have led Indian companies to pursue new coal mines in Australia's Galilee Basin. The costs of these mining ventures will be high due to the mining infrastructure required and long transport distances to rural India. A high level analysis of mining, transport and power station investment to meet rural demand in Bihar shows that the absolute investment requirement using coal, especially coal sourced from Australia, as an expensive option. Pursuing electrification through village level, renewable energy micro-systems provides more flexibility. Pollution costs associated with coal-fired generation, employment benefits associated with many village implementations and a rural load unsupported by industry load, show a benefit associated with decentralised, renewable energy electrification.
R51|Analyzing an elder’s desire for a reverse mortgage using an economic model that considers house bequest motivation, random death time and stochastic house price|In recent decades, the aging of the population and the lengthening of life expectancy have caused seniors to need more retirement income over a longer time period. Because the reverse mortgage (RM) can fulfill this requirement, it has become increasingly popular among elderly homeowners. Based on the assumption that seniors seek maximum utility, this article presents a theoretical economic model that derives a decision rule for participating in the RM program. The model takes account of the influences of bequest motivation, random death times and stochastic house prices. A critical value for the intensity of house bequest motivation is also derived from our formula for the decision rule. We then use this value to show how the elder's desire to participate in the RM program is influenced by three sets of factors: the elder's personal characteristics and circumstances, the content of the RM contract, and the current economic situation. Elders' desire to participate in the RM program is found to be negatively correlated with the fixed cost of applying for an RM, the RM contract rate, and the cash income from the elder's retirement plan; on the contrary, the desire to participate is positively correlated with the RM principle limit factors, the elder's age at the time of joining the RM program, the elder's time preference, the elder's initial cash wealth, the elder's initial house price, the current interest rate, and the volatility of the house return. These analyses should help RM policy executors and providers understand the RM borrower's decision-making process and how the factors mentioned above influence an elder's desire to apply for an RM.
R51|Fiscal gaps in amalgamated metropolitan areas: The case of Turin and Genoa|Estimates of fiscal capacity and expenditure needs are used to evaluate the relative fiscal health of municipalities in the metropolitan areas of Genoa and Turin. Using 2012 data, we find that in both areas the inner core is fiscally disadvantaged, in Turin relative to the adjacent belts, and in Genoa relative to the rest of the province. Despite higher fiscal capacity in a relatively resilient center city, the service requirements for which the city of Turin is responsible still leave it in weaker fiscal health than its suburbs. In Genoa, which has had a similar degree of economic decline as Turin, the entire metro area is fiscally weak relative to the rest of the province. One possible solution to the uneven geographic distribution of fiscal capacity and expenditure needs in metro areas is amalgamation. We simulate static amalgamations, in which the separate fiscal resources of the inner core city and the outer belts are combined into a single entity, and the expenditure needs are also equally shared across the metro area. In Turin, a metropolitan fiscal combination (ignoring the rest of the province) would, at least in the first instance, prove fiscally beneficial to Turin. In the case of Genoa, the fiscal weakness of the entire metropolitan area means that, for amalgamation to benefit the inner core, the merger would have to include at least some of the municipalities in the rest of the province.
R51|Sub-metropolitan tax competition with household and capital mobility|Abstract This paper investigates the efficiency properties of tax competition between sub-metropolitan jurisdictions when capital, residents and workers are mobile, and both households and firms compete for local land markets. We analyze two decentralized equilibria: (1) With a local tax on residents and two separate local taxes on capital and land inputs, efficiency is achieved and the existence of a marginal fiscal cost due to residents’ mobility is revealed; (2) Combination of the taxes on capital and land inputs into a single business property tax leads local authorities to charge inefficiently high taxation on capital. We show that capital mobility induces a reduction in the business land taxation and local public inputs are used to offset the distorting effects of the property tax, accounting for the distorting impact of workers’ mobility.
R51|The Portfolio Rebalancing Channel of Quantitative Easing|This paper analyzes the portfolio rebalancing channel of Quantitative Easing (QE hereafter) interventions. First, we identify the effects of a QE shock using a Bayesian VAR on US data using a sign and zero restrictions identification scheme. We find that QE shocks have substantial effects on corporate spreads with different ratings, supportive of a portfolio rebalancing channel. Second, we build a DSGE model with a securitzation mechanism. We confront the resulting impulse response functions to those uncovered by our VAR analysis, and find a fairly good match. Finally, we show that the portfolio rebalancing channel crucially affects the transmission of QE shocks to real economy.
R51|Missing the Mark: House Price Index Accuracy and Mortgage Credit Modeling|We make two contributions to the study of house price index and mortgage credit modeling accuracy. First, we assess the predictive power of house price indices calculated at different levels of geographic aggregation. Lower levels of aggregation offer superior fit when appreciation rates vary substantially across submarkets and the indices are based on a sufficient number of transactions. Second, we estimate a competing options credit model using 15 years of mortgage performance data in the United States. Model accuracy is highest when using indices at a city or lower level of aggregation to construct current loan-to-value ratios. Fit is weaker when using state or national price indices. Overall, this research highlights the benefits of using more localized house price indices when predicting property values and mortgage performance.

R51|European Start-up Hotspots: An Analysis based on VC-backed Companies|Through the perspective of VC-backed companies, this report describes the main locations of start-up activity in Europe, i.e. start-up hotspots. It aims at providing evidence on start-up activity in Europe and at describing the European VC activity over the last two decades. The study reports the following: â€¢ Europe receives 15% of global VC investments. After the dot.com hype, VC activity in Europe decreased and has never come close to the levels from 2000. VC funds have also moved away from seed to later stage of funding. â€¢ 28% of all European VC-backed companies are based in one of the 20 cities. Paris, London and Berlin lead the ranking of cities with the highest number of VC-backed companies in Europe. â€¢ The location of a start-up is likely to be one of the major factors influencing the amount of money it receives from VC funds and the number of funding rounds it goes through. â€¢ Majority of European VC-backed companies are up to 8 years old and have up to 100 employees. â€¢ The majority of VC-backed firms in Europe belong to the Business, Consumer and Retail industries.
R51|Amalgamation, free-rider behavior, and regulation|Abstract Amalgamation incentivizes municipalities to increase public debt because it allows them to subrogate their repayment and interest burden on the entire municipality after amalgamation. Smaller municipalities, in particular, tend to accumulate public debt in order to free-ride. Previous studies have shown this kind of opportunistic behavior in countries where municipalities can issue bonds freely in the market. However, in Japan, municipalities cannot issue bonds freely by regulation. When such regulation controls debt accumulation by the merging municipality, the free-rider effect should be weak. This study examines the relationship between the regulation of local government borrowing and free-rider behavior of Japanese municipalities. The difference-in-difference regression results confirm the existence of a free-rider effect in this regard. Moreover, the debt expenditure ratio, the index of the regulation of local public bond issues, has the same effect that prevents local public debt from increasing for both merging and never-merged municipalities. This fact shows that a merging municipality with a free-rider incentive cannot increase local public debt to excess by using the regulation. Therefore, the average free-rider effect per capita is approximately 7 % of the average local public debt per capita for the end of the pre-treatment period. This result is considerably lower than the effects of the Swedish cases.
R51|Taxation without representation: local fiscal response to intergovernmental transfers in China|Abstract This paper studies the effects of intergovernmental transfers on local public spending in China, an authoritarian country where local politicians are not largely accountable to residents. The identification exploits a discontinuity from the central government’s designation of National Poor Counties. We find that additional transfers to county governments increase local public spending one-for-one. We further confirm that counties receiving additional transfers do not reduce the effective tax burden borne by firms. The results echo the empirical anomaly of the flypaper effect found in developed economies under democratic governments.
R51|How to stop the race to the bottom|Abstract Standard tax multipliers are a widespread feature of fiscal equalization systems. A simple theoretical model shows that actual tax multipliers respond positively to changes in standard tax multipliers. This theoretical prediction is tested empirically using data on municipalities in Germany. A quasi-experiment in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia is exploited to identify the incentive effect. The empirical results confirm that local business tax policy is shaped by standard tax multipliers. They provide a straightforward practical tool to avoid a race to the bottom in local business tax rates.
R51|Identifying the Benefits from Home Ownership: A Swedish Experiment|This paper studies the economic benefits of home ownership. Exploiting a quasi-experiment surrounding privatization decisions of municipally-owned apartment buildings, we obtain random variation in home ownership for otherwise similar buildings with similar tenants. We link the tenants to their tax records to obtain information on demographics, income, mobility patterns, housing wealth, financial wealth, and debt. These data allow us to construct high-quality measures of consumption expenditures. Home ownership causes households to move up the housing ladder, work harder, and save more. Consumption increases out of housing wealth are concentrated among the home owners who sell subsequent to privatization and among those who receive negative income shocks, evidencing a collateral effect.
R51|Rational Expectations Voting in Agent-Based Models: An Application to Tax Ceilings|This paper introduces rational expectations voting into an agentbased model of collective choice. Our model is unique because it generates sophisticated forecasts of endogenous policy outcomes by computationally sampling the space of exogenous random variables. Together these forecasts generate a common prior, a joint distribution of all random variables as a function of the set of policy choices, which agents use to select the policy that maximizes their expected utility. We apply our simulated rational expectations methodology by using administrative data on property taxes from two U.S. cities to investigate how observed levels of (plausibly exogenous) tax-payment uncertainty affect collective choice. Specifically, we show that, for sophisticated risk-averse or loss-averse voters, higher levels of tax-payment uncertainty generate majority support for a binding constraint on collective choice.
R51|The Relationship between Societal attributes, Feminine Leadership & Management Style: Responses from Pakistan's Urban Region Female-Owned Businesses|Research paper investigates various societal attributes including; male employees' performances, living standards, level of poverty, and employment opportunities in relation with feminine leadership and style of management in urban regions of Pakistan's SMEs and Cottage Industries. 'Socio-Anthropological Paradigm' undertaken for exploring research variables. Epistemology under Post-positivism philosophy is used. Moreover, considering mixed method, 4 points Likert scale survey questionnaire and open ended interviews are used as research instruments for data collection. The survey sample size contains 37 female entrepreneurs and interviews with 30 male employees working under feminine leadership and style of management through quota, stratified, and convenience sampling in Pakistan's five urban regions. The results confirmed positive relationship between feminine leadership and management style and various societal attributes. Furthermore, male varying performances are due to situational commitment. Moreover, in male dominated society, cultural barriers and lack of governmental support is limiting the female entrepreneurship to urban regions.
R51|Free‐rider behaviour under voluntary amalgamation: The case of setting the long‐term care insurance premium in Japan|This study confirms free‐rider behaviour of pre‐merger municipalities in the case of voluntary amalgamation. The novel contribution of this study is dividing pre‐merger municipalities into two groups: those that had the chance to free ride when setting the long‐term care insurance premium and those that did not. Moreover, it focuses on the revision of the long‐term care insurance premium as the target of free‐rider behaviour. Therefore, the present study is able to capture free‐rider behaviour before the amalgamation. The regression results confirm that only pre‐merger municipalities that had the chance to free ride showed free‐rider behaviour. Este estudio confirma el comportamiento oportunista de los municipios antes de una fusión en el caso de la fusión voluntaria. La contribución novedosa de este estudio es dividir los municipios antes de una fusión en dos grupos: los que pudieron comportarse de manera oportunista al establecer la prima del seguro de cuidado a largo plazo y aquellos que no pudieron hacerlo. Además, se enfoca en la revisión de la prima del seguro de cuidado a largo plazo como el objetivo del comportamiento oportunista. Por lo tanto, el presente estudio es capaz de identificar el comportamiento oportunista antes de la fusión. Los resultados de la regresión confirman que solo los municipios antes de una fusión que pudieron comportarse de manera oportunista mostraron un comportamiento oportunista. 本稿では、自主的合併の場合における、合併前の自治体によるフリーライダー行為を確認する。本研究の新たな試みとして、合併前の自治体を、長期介護保険プレミアムを設定するときにフフリーライダー行為の機会を得た自治体と、それを行わなかった自治体の2つのグループに分ける。さらに、フリーライダー行為を目的とした長期介護保険プレミアムの改訂にも注目する。本研究は、これによって、合併前のフリーライダー行為を捉えることが可能である。回帰分析の結果は、フリーライダー行為の機会を得た合併前の自治体のみがそれを実行していることを示している。
R51|Identifying Discretion of Municipalities to Undertake Eligibility Assessments for Japan’s Long-Term Care Insurance Program|Eligibility assessments play an important role in Japan’s long-term care insurance program and have been designed so that municipalities do not have discretion in their working. However, there are doubts about eligibility assessments based on the municipal fiscal situation. This study empirically identifies the discretion of municipalities to undertake eligibility assessments employing the idea of opportunistic municipal behavior at amalgamation. Amalgamation offers municipalities an incentive to free ride (e.g., public debt accumulation) when they can subrogate the load to a new municipality after amalgamation. If so, pre-merger municipalities might increase the eligibility ratio before amalgamation. Difference-in-difference regression confirms a free-rider effect of pre-merger municipalities in the eligibility assessments for long-term care by Japanese municipalities. Smaller pre-merger municipalities increase the eligibility ratio immediately before amalgamation. These results mean that the Japanese long-term care insurance system is not managed in accordance with the institutional design.
R51|Housing policies in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the United States: lessons learned|We provide an analysis of the housing market and current housing policies in three developed countries: the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the United States. We focus on these three countries mainly because of the marked differences in their institutional settings. The United Kingdom is characterized by fiscal centralization and an extraordinarily rigid planning system. The consequences of this setting, which make housing supply extremely unresponsive to changes in house prices, are a high degree of urban containment, a severe housing affordability crisis, and a housing shortage, particularly for the young. The key UK policy, Help-to-Buy, which focuses on stimulating housing demand, fails to address the affordability crisis, because increasing demand only pushes up house prices further without expanding housing supply. Fiscal decentralization and a lax zoning system—both are encouraging residential development—and an extraordinarily low homeownership rate explain why Switzerland’s main political concerns are sprawl and rent stabilization. The country’s key policies aim to tackle these two concerns, but those same policies have some important unintended consequences. The United States is characterized by fiscal federalism and an enormous variation in the tightness of land use restrictiveness across metropolitan areas. The key policy concern across the country is homeownership attainment and the key policy to tackle this issue is the mortgage interest deduction (MID). This policy backfires in metropolitan areas that are prosperous and where land use is tightly regulated— “superstar cities”—because, in these places, the policy-induced demand increase mainly pushes up house prices. The MID increases homeownership attainment of only higher-income households in metropolitan areas with lax land use regulation. The net effect of the policy on homeownership attainment across the country is essentially zero. We conclude that the assessment of housing policies crucially depends on the fiscal and regulatory environment in local housing markets. Policies that stimulate housing demand, such as the MID or Help-to-Buy, are doomed to fail in markets with tight regulation or otherwise tight supply.
R51|Regional Inequality and Decentralized Governance: Canada's Provinces|"Regional scientists commonly concern themselves with topics involving regional inequalities-why they occur and persist, how inequality may be reduced or what exacerbates it, and the impact of policy interventions. Regional inequalities fuel our research and its policy relevance. For most of us, these investigations are in the context of exogenously defined ""regions,"" with political and administrative boundaries originating in a decentralized government context. The regions that are our units of analysis seldom reflect economic realities, yet their boundaries, once drawn, are very persistent and to a large extent determine the degree to which inequalities may be reduced over time, either through private decisions or through government policy. This paper offers a descriptive illustration of fundamental differences among Canada's provinces as a potential constraint on the possibility of convergence over time, interregional migration responses, and the impacts of an explicit national government equalization."
R51|The Texas economic model, miracle or mirage? A spatial hedonic analysis|Abstract As a state without a personal income tax that has experienced strong employment and population growth in the past, Texas was held up as the economic policy model for Kansas and Oklahoma to follow in recently cutting their personal income tax rates. Using microlevel data, this paper examines whether Texas has benefitted from its mix of public policies by examining the geographic patterns of estimated quality-adjusted wages and housing costs across the USA. The overall finding is the absence of significantly positive capitalized effects from the policies of Texas. The only significant capitalized policy effect found was lower quality of life in Texas nonmetropolitan areas relative to those in Oklahoma.

Der Autor beurteilt das Ländermodell vor dem Hintergrund einer reinen bodenwertbasierten Steuer.
R51|Determinants of margin in microfinance institutions| Microfinance institutions (MFIs) lend to the poor. However, microfinance clients suffer from high interest rates, a type of poverty penalty. This article analyses the margin determinants in MFIs. A banking model has been adapted to microfinance. This model has been tested using 9-year panel data. Some factors explaining bank margin also explain MFI margin, with operating costs being the most important factor. Specific microfinance factors are donations and legal status, as regulated MFIs can collect deposits. It has also been found that MFIs operating in countries with a high level of financial inclusion have low margins.
R51|Önfeladás Helyett Önellátás A Hegyalja Kistérségben -Hegyalja Kistérség Fejlesztési Alternatívái-| A Hegyalja Kistérség Székelyföld délnyugati peremvidékén, Hargita megyében található. Az ősi hagyományokkal rendelkező településekből álló kistérség, – amelyet nem kerülte ki a szocialista rendszerre jellemző és annak bukását követő társadalmi-gazdasági hanyatlás és lemaradás –, mára egy hátrányos, periférikus helyzetű kistérséggé vált, mely nem csupán viszonylagos földrajzi elszigeteltségéből adódik. A túlnyomó részben hegyvidéki településekből álló térségben, a hagyományok leértékelődése és a demográfiai hanyatlás mellett születtek kezdeményezések, melyek kudarcának következtében sokan úgy vélték, hogy a szomszédos Sóvidék Kistérséggel való társulás megoldást hozhat az egyre kilátástalanabb helyzetűvé váló térségben és ezáltal fellendíthető annak gazdasági, társadalmi élete. Mi úgy gondoljuk, hogy ez a társulás nem volt szükségszerű, és szeretnénk bebizonyítani, hogy léteznek olyan intézkedések, amelyekkel a kistérség önmagában is sikeressé válhatna. Az esettanulmányunk kidolgozásában figyelembe vettük és ennek alapján elemeztük a helyi természeti adottságokat, valamint a társadalmi és gazdasági szempontokat is. A helyi hagyományok továbbéltetésében véltük felfedezni a fejlődést elősegítő potenciál túlnyomó részét, ami a helyi identitás növelésében, a hagyományok átadásával, nagy szerepet vállalhatna a térségben. A helyi lehetőségekre és Székelyudvarhely segítő erejére alapozva dolgoztuk ki az általunk vélt önellátó, fenntartható kistérségre vonatkozó intézkedéssort. A helyi önkormányzat és a közbirtokosságok összefogásával és a kidolgozott intézkedések figyelembe vételével és alkalmazásával a kistérség területén levő települések fejlődését segítené elő, önálló alapokra támaszkodva. ------------------------------------------------ The Hegyalja microregion lies on the southwestern edge of Székelyföld (Szeklerland). It is part of the Harghita County. The villages and towns of the region have strong and old traditions. Of course this microregion too, was deeply affected by the social and economic impact of communism and its breakdown. Due to economic difficulties, ever increasing demographic erosion and to some extent also as a result of its geographical position the Hegyalja region has become a disadvantaged territory. There were some attempts to deal with the demographical decrease and the devaluation of traditions but they mostly have failed. This caused the leaders of the region to initiate a merge with the Sóvidék microregion as they were hoping to get better results of the two neighboring regions working together. They were hoping to solve the problems of both regions by this merge and to achieve social and economic goals. We think that this partnership is not necessary for the Hegyalja microregion and we would prove that the region alone could become a successful and developing part of the country. When working on this case study we took into consideration the natural capabilities, economic and social aspects of the region too. We run an analysis, and the preliminary results prove us that the future of the region lies in the development of endogenous possibilities. These are the ones that through reviving local traditions help increasing the awareness of local identities. The series of measures we suggest imply that development could be achieved based on the local resources, possibilities and the help of Székelyudvarhely (Odorheiu Secuiesc) which is the regional center. With the cooperation of the councils and other organizations and implementation of these measures we believe that the development of the villages in this microregion could be achieved based on local resources.
R51|Farmer Credit Delinquency in Southeastern US: Factors and Behavior Prediction| This study examines the factors and behaviors that affect Southeast US farmers’ ability to meet their loan payment obligations within the stipulated loan term. The study also estimates a credit risk model using farm-level financial information to determine the credit worthiness of various different farmers in different states and their possible repayment capabilities. The study uses a 10-year (2003-2012) pooled cross-sectional data from the USDA ARMS survey data (Phase III). A probit approach is used to regress delinquency against various borrower-specific, loan-specific, lender-specific, macroeconomic and climatic variables for the first part, whilst a logistic approach is used to regress farmers’ coverage ratio (repayment capacity) on financial variables (liquidity, solvency, profitability, and financial efficiency) in addition with tenure, to determine how creditworthy the various kinds of farmers are, and in what particular states. The results show that farmers with larger farms, farmers with insurance, farmers with higher net income, farmers with smaller debt to asset ratio, farmers with single loans and those that take majority of their loans from sources apart from commercial banks are those that are less likely to be delinquent. Temperature and precipitation increases also lowers farmer delinquency, unless in excessive quantities where certain thresholds are exceeded. The results for credit model also show which particular farmers and in what states are more likely to be creditworthy based on their financial variable information.
R51|Political Decentralization|I provide a critical overview of the literature on political decentralization. After reviewing first- and second-generation theories of federalism, I describe recent empirical studies focusing mainly on determinants of capture and local government accountability emphasized by second-generation theories. The article concludes by describing emerging new issues that deserve more attention in future research: a wider range of political distortions beyond capture and corruption; effects of decentralization on intercommunity allocations, learning, and experimentation, and on democracy itself; a comparison of decentralization with other organizational alternatives; and issues pertaining to design and implementation raised by first-generation federalism theories, such as interjurisdictional spillovers, vertical fiscal relations, the range of devolution, and the political economy of implementation.
R51|The Tax Gradient: Spatial Aspects of Fiscal Competition|State borders create a discontinuous tax treatment of retail sales. In a Nash game, local tax rates will be higher on the low state tax side of a border. Local taxes will decrease from the nearest high-tax border and increase from the low-tax border. Using driving time from state borders and all local sales tax rates, local tax rates on the low tax side of the border are 1.25 percentage points higher, reducing the differential in state tax rates by over three-quarters. A ten minute increase in driving time from the nearest high-tax state lowers a border town's local tax rate by 6 percent. (JEL H25, H71, H73, H77)
R51|Barreras de acceso de la mujer rural a crédito, programas asociativos y a la formalización de la tierra en el Norte del Cauca y el Sur del Tolima. Productos 3 y 4|El Ministerio de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural (MADR) y el Banco Agrario han desarrollado en los últimos años diversos programas asociativos y de microcrédito para mejorar la generación de ingresos y la competitividad en el campo, algunos de ellos con un énfasis especial de género. Sin embargo, y a pesar de no tener restricciones directas que discriminen a las mujeres en estos programas, según datos del MADR, la participación de las mujeres en las diferentes estrategias es significativamente menor que la de los hombres, salvo para el Programa de Formalización de la Propiedad Rural. El objetivo central de este estudio es identificar y analizar las barreras de acceso y los cuellos de botella que las mujeres en zonas rurales tienen que enfrentar para acceder a programas asociativos del MADR (i.e. Oportunidades Rurales, Mujer Rural y Alianzas Productivas), al Programa de Formalización de la Propiedad Rural del MADR y al crédito formal, en particular a las líneas de crédito para mujer rural de bajos ingresos del Banco Agrario. Para tal fin se llevó a cabo trabajo de campo cuantitativo y cualitativo en dos zonas del país fuertemente afectadas por el conflicto y con una proporción importante de población indígena y afrodescendiente: el Norte del Cauca y el Sur del Tolima. Se halló que existen barreras de acceso específicas de género (p.ej. falta de empoderamiento, autoridad patriarcal o machista, falta de acceso a información, falta de activos monetarios y productivos, baja participación laboral e importantes responsabilidades en el hogar y en el cuidado de los hijos que dificultan su participación en programas) y otras que son neutras en cuanto a género, pero que por el contexto en el que viven estas mujeres rurales, afectan más a las mujeres que a los hombres (p.ej. bajos niveles educativos, baja comprensión de textos, baja educación financiera, desconocimiento de estructuración de proyectos, poca experiencia en proyectos productivos, aislamiento geográfico, falta de documentos, desconocimiento de trámites y bajo conocimiento de aspectos jurídicos, entre otros).
R51|Barreras de acceso de la mujer rural a crédito, programas asociativos y a la formalización de la tierra en el Norte del Cauca y el Sur del Tolima: Documento resumen|El objetivo de este reporte es presentar las principales barreras que enfrentan las mujeres en situación de pobreza extrema o moderada en el Norte del Cauca y en el Sur del Tolima para acceder a programas del MADR y del Banco Agrario. Los programas estudiados incluyen el Programa de Formalización de la Propiedad Rural (PFPR), programas asociativos como Alianzas Productivas, Oportunidades Rurales y Mujer Rural y líneas de crédito para la mujer del Banco Agrario. El acceso al crédito formal, la conformación y consolidación de asociaciones productivas rurales, y la formalización de la propiedad de la tierra son cruciales para incluir a la mujer en el desarrollo productivo de las áreas rurales Colombia.

O artigo ressalta ainda a importância das avaliações de políticas públicas no Brasil acerca de três aspectos fundamentais: direito de cidadania e moradia, funçâo social da propriedade e do Imposto Predial e Territorial Urbano Progressivo no Tempo, assim como também dos movimentos sociais que demandam políticas universalizadas em busca da garantia da governança.
R51|Las finanzas públicas de Soledad, Atlántico: Un caso atípico|A pesar de ser la séptima ciudad más poblada de Colombia y de estar clasificada en la primera categoría municipal según la Ley 617 de 2000, Soledad, Atlántico, presenta una baja autonomía fiscal y un bajo nivel de recaudo de ingresos propios y, por ende, de inversión comparado con municipios de la misma categoría. Si bien su situación financiera mejoró en el periodo 2012-2014 gracias a las medidas implementadas por el Acuerdo de Reestructuración de Pasivos suscrito en 2012, todavía falta un amplio camino por recorrer. En términos per cápita, Soledad tributa como un municipio de categoría 6, es decir como un municipio rural de menos de 10.000 habitantes, constituyéndose así en un caso atípico dentro de las ciudades más grandes del país. Este documento analiza las finanzas públicas de Soledad en términos de su evolución y estado con relación al resto de municipios del Área Metropolitana de Barranquilla y municipios con similares características en términos de población y desarrollo económico del país, con el fin de examinar su aún débil situación fiscal e identificar campos de acción de fácil implementación.
R51|Impuesto terrirorial y financiamiento municipal|Since most municipal-generated revenues (from property taxes, business licenses and vehicle permits) depend on the income earned by local inhabitants and the business or industry within the municipality, it is not surprising that there is a significant asymmetry in the volume and standard of local public goods available in the Chilean territory. Measures such as reducing exemptions from property tax and directly compensating municipalities for the exempt portion aim at neutralizing this asymmetry. They would also broaden the base of taxpayers and increase the accountability of local authorities.
R51|Estimating the Effect of Transit on Residential Property Values: The Case of the Portland MAX System|"Using a hedonic price model with demographic, spatial, and house characteristic data, this study finds significant property value premiums associated with access to rail mass transit in the Portland, Oregon. Incremental changes to a ""benchmark"" model - similar to many used in the literature - lead to the adoption of a more appropriate ""target"" model that incorporates several innovations. This paper finds that assessment data is more appropriate and consistent than sale price data; that the use of a continuous measurement of the distance to transit is more powerful than a binary measure; and that the consideration of ""community amenities"" - such as schools or parks -in the model specification improves the resulting estimates. The target model finds significantly higher transit access premiums than prior models, suggesting that municipalities may see greater property tax benefits from transit construction than previously estimated."
R51|Officials on boards and the prudential behavior of banks: Evidence from China's city commercial banks|From the perspective of officials-and-directors (OADs), who are commonly appointed by the Chinese government to the banks it owns, this paper takes studies of government ownership and banks' behavior to the micro level of boards. We analyze the relationship between the special political connection of the OADs and banks' prudential behavior, using a sample of China's City Commercial Banks during 2006–2010. We further explore the impact of OADs' characteristics and the role of independent directors and female directors. The results indicate that banks with OADs exhibit lower prudential behavior, and the higher is the administrative rank of the OADs, the larger is the effect. And the older is the OADs, the larger is the effect. More importantly, the government ownership of banks does not have a significant and robust influence on their prudential behavior. Meanwhile, independent directors can significantly weaken the effect of the OADs, while female directors can enhance the prudential behavior of banks in the absence of OADs. Finally, our results persist even after controlling for sample selection bias and alternative variable measures. Our research contributes to the practice of improving bank governance and regulating systematic risk.
R51|The default of special district financing: Evidence from California|In response to a series of legislative measures curbing property tax revenues, special taxation districts emerged as a mechanism of financing public infrastructure by local governments in many U.S. states. Community facilities districts (CFDs) in California are but one example. These districts are financed by issuing a special type of land-secured municipal bonds known as CFD or Mello–Roos bonds, and levying special taxes to service the debt. Using a unique comprehensive data set on California CFD bond issues since the moment of their inception until 2006, we study the default experience of these largely nonrated bonds. Contrary to the general belief that the “dirt” CFD bonds are very risky, we find that their lifetime performance is at least as good as that of Standard and Poor’s B to BBB rated municipal bonds. Using duration analysis, we explore the dependence of the likelihood of CFD default on issue characteristics and macroeconomic and industry factors. We find that the state of local economy and construction industry are strong predictors of CFD default. The default is positively linked to the risk premium of the CFD bonds measured as the spread between their interest rate and the AAA rated general obligation municipal bonds yield index. We also find aging effects and relate them to stages of CFD development.
R51|Taxes in Cities|Most cities enjoy some autonomy over how they tax their residents, and that autonomy is typically exercised by multiple municipal governments within a given city. In this chapter, we document patterns of city-level taxation across countries, and we review the literature on a number of salient features affecting local tax setting in an urban context. In OECD countries, urban local governments on average raise some 10% of total tax revenue, and in non-OECD countries, they raise around half that share. We show that most cities are highly fragmented: urban areas with more than 500,000 inhabitants are divided into 74 local jurisdictions on average. The vast majority of these cities are characterized by a central municipality that strongly dominates the remaining jurisdictions in terms of population. These empirical regularities imply that analyses of urban taxation need to take account of three particular features: interdependence among tax-setting authorities (horizontally and vertically), jurisdictional size asymmetries, and the potential for agglomeration economies. We survey the relevant theoretical and empirical literatures, focusing in particular on models of asymmetric tax competition, of taxation and income sorting, and of taxation in the presence of agglomeration rents.
R51|Structural Estimation in Urban Economics|Structural estimation is a methodological approach in empirical economics explicitly based on economic theory, in which economic modeling, estimation, and empirical analysis are required to be internally consistent. This chapter illustrates the structural approach with three applications in urban economics: (1) discrete location choice, (2) fiscal competition and local public good provision, and (3) regional specialization. For each application, we first discuss broad methodological principles of model selection and development. Next we treat issues of identification and estimation. The final step of each discussion is how estimated structural models can be used for policy analysis.
R51|Local Polynomial Regressions versus OLS for Generating Location Value Estimates: Which is More Efficient in Out-of-Sample Forecasts?|As an alternative to ordinary least squares (OLS), we estimate location values for single family houses using a standard housing price and characteristics dataset by local polynomial regressions (LPR), a semi-parametric procedure. We also compare the LPR and OLS models in the Denver metropolitan area in the years 2003, 2006 and 2010 with out-of-sample forecasting. We determine that the LPR model is more efficient than OLS at predicting location values in counties with greater densities of sales. Also, LPR outperforms OLS in 2010 for all 5 counties in our dataset. Our findings suggest that LPR is a preferable approach in areas with greater concentrations of sales and in periods of recovery following a financial crisis.
R51|Individual tax rates and regional tax revenues: a cross-state analysis| Individual tax rates and regional tax revenues: a cross-state analysis. Regional Studies. This paper analyzes the effects of state-level personal tax rates on state tax revenue and individual welfare. The policy analysis based on a general equilibrium model suggests that tax revenues would benefit from higher wage–income, sales or property taxes, while any increase in dividend–income tax would result in a reduction of revenues. It is also shown that individuals would suffer from an increase in state-level wage–income tax, dividend tax or sales tax, while they would benefit from an increase in property taxes. The heterogeneity across states is determined by a TaxIndex, a weighted average of initial taxes at the state level.
R51|Assessing the Level of Income of the Rural Population in Ukraine|Market transformations in Ukraine significantly reduced income of population and caused its significant differentiation, especially in rural areas. Purpose of the article - to determine the influence of macroeconomic factors on the income of the rural population through the use of correlation analysis to predict the level of the main components of the income of the rural population in the future, as well as the scientific prove for the direction of improving the mechanism of formation of the income level of the rural population. It was revealed that the key determinants that influence the formation of the income of the rural population is the size of the GDP in agriculture, minimum wage and living wage. In addition, a significant role is also played by the rent for the provision of temporary use of land plots). Concluded the evaluation of influence of each of these factors on the level of income of the rural population and the forecast of average monthly salary in agriculture and pensions is made. The directions of improvement of the mechanism of income generation are outlined in order to maintain an adequate standard of living of the rural population.
R51|Social Assistance In The Rural Area – Between Desideratum And Reality|Social assistance is the main mechanism by which the society intervenes in order to prevent, limit or remove the negative effect of certain events that could affect vulnerable persons or groups, without their will. Because 45% of the whole country’s population lives in the rural area, the rural poor people represent two-thirds of the total Romanian population. Family plays the most important role in their support. The persons in difficulty benefit from the services provided by the local authorities representatives, as well as from the services of non-governmental organizations in the social sector involved in the development of some projects and programs in the rural area – the Regional Operational Program (ROP), the Sectoral Operational Program –Human Resources Development (SOP-HRD), etc. At present, the social assistance services in the rural area are also affected by the socio- economic context and by the general poverty both of the local budgets, which continue to remain the finance source for the social aid, and of the State budget, which represents the main source of finance for the allowances and other social aids for the population; it is the development of the non- governmental sector that represents the only viable way by which we could cover the vacuum represented by the need for specialized social services at rural community level.
R51|Common Agricultural Policy Reform and the New Priorities for Financing Rural Development in the European Union|This article proposes a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the new funding priorities of rural development in the Member States during 2014-2020. The central goal of our research aims to highlight the impact of Common Agricultural Policy reform on its main financing instruments: direct payments and rural development programs. Also, our research will assess, through a SWOT analysis, which are the main funding opportunities for Member States adapted to their specific national circumstances, but convergent with Common Agricultural Policy strategic objective: financing the sustainable rural development in European Union.
R51|Factors explaining inter-municipal cooperation in service delivery: a meta-regression analysis| Inter-municipal cooperation is an important public service delivery reform, whose drivers move beyond simple concerns with costs and economic efficiency, to policy issues related to governance structure and spatial context. We conduct a meta-regression analysis based on the existing multivariate empirical literature to explore what factors explain divergence in results in the existing empirical studies. We find strong evidence that fiscal constraints, spatial, and organizational factors are significant drivers of cooperation. Our meta-regressions do not yield results to explain divergence in results on community wealth, economies of scale, or racial homogeneity. More studies on these factors are needed to understand how these factors might affect cooperation. Future theoretical and empirical research should give more attention to spatial and organizational factors to develop a better understanding of factors driving cooperation, and how they differ across local government structures and regions.
R51|Regional Development Through Growth And Urban Development Poles In Romania|In 2008 the Ministry of Development, Public Works and Housing (now the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration) prepared the growth poles policy for Romania, establishing seven growth poles to be financed through the Regional Operational Programme 2007-1013, under the Priority Axis no. 1. For 2007-2013 there were also established 11 urban development poles. At present the Ministry is discussing with the European Commission the new Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020 in which the main policy lines regarding integrated territorial development also take into consideration the improvement of the quality of life and the “appearance” of towns and strengthening their role in the region. The main urban agglomerations (county seats) are seen as development engines of the regions. The authors analyze the results obtained and the problems that appeared at regional level in what concerns the projects financed under Axis 1 of the ROP 2007-2013 by answering two main questions: did they really had the estimated impact on the growth and urban development poles and on the regions? and was there really an integrated approach used? Based on the results obtained from the analysis of the previous programming period the authors try to recommend some improvements that could be taken into consideration for the development of the Integrated urban development plans and priority projects that are going to be financed by ESI funds under Axis 4 of the new ROP 2014-2020, recommendations that could be taken into consideration when preparing the Guidelines for applicants for this axis.
R51|Granting public or private consumption? Effects of grants on local public spending and income taxes|Most of the early empirical estimates on effects of intergovernmental grants contradict theoretical predictions. In the more recent literature that emphasizes the importance of convincing empirical strategies, the results are more mixed. This paper contributes to this literature by estimating causal effects on local expenditures and income taxes of general, unconditional grants. This is done in a difference-in-difference model utilizing policy-induced increases in grants to a group of remotely populated municipalities in Finland. The finding is that increased grants have a statistically and economically significant positive immediate effect on local expenditures. The effect on local income taxes, while statistically significant, is considerably smaller in magnitude. Furthermore, there is no evidence of dynamic crowding-out—i.e., that the immediate response in expenditures is reversed in later years. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
R51|Economic Values of an Urban Design Project - American Experiences of the New Urbanism|The article is an attempt to depict to the Polish readers, especially those dealing with housing investment (but also to all specialists related to the property market), a phenomenon of the movement of the New Urbanism. In spite of near thirty-years history and its Polish roots, there have been almost no broader interest in that issue in Poland so far. A short history, ideas and rules of the New Urbanism were presented in the article. Furthermore, relying on examples of US. research, a crucial role of a quality of urban and architectural projects in the investment process is explained. Last but not least, one of goals of this article is to trigger a concern of a broader discussion about theory and practice of the New Urbanism movement, especially in the context of urban planning, land use, and property market in Poland.
R51|Can’t Pay or Won’t Pay? Unemployment, Negative Equity, and Strategic Default|This paper uses new data from the PSID to quantify the relative importance of negative equity versus ability to pay, in driving mortgage defaults between 2009 and 2013. These data allow us to construct household budgets sets that provide better measures of ability to pay. Changes in ability to pay have large estimated effects. Job loss has an equivalent effect on the propensity to default as a 35% decline in equity. Strategic motives are also found to be quantitatively important, as we estimate more than 38% of households in default could make their mortgage payments without reducing consumption. Received September 29, 2015; editorial decision June 2, 2017 by Editor Philip Strahan. Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University PressWeb site next to the link to the final published paper online.
R51|Valuating Wine Brands Using The Brand Finance Method - A Case Study|Brand is a specific intangible asset which is nowadays in many companies one of the most important assets, in particular because of the economic and financial effects that brands have. Brands influence not only consumer’s choice, the employees and investors, but also public authorities and the general public. In the world of endless possibilities, such an impact is of utmost importance for market success and will provide added value to shareholders. This is the reason why strategic decision-making of the management is increasingly focused on value growth asset management. Moreover, brands are specific since in many cases they outlive their companies and have a number of different owners during their life-cycle. However, brands have to be not only identified, but also valuated. Various methods are used to valuate brands, and the aim of this paper is to present brand valuation by using brand finance valuation methodology on a case study.
R51|Measuring Brand Personality - Construct Validity Of A Short Version Of A Brand Personality Scale|Brand personality has gained a lot of attention in marketing research and brand management. For measuring these „human characteristics associated with a brand“ (Aaker, 1997, p. 347), several empirically validated questionnaires have been developed. Due to the high number of items of brand personality scales, their use in studies evaluating many diff erent brands and additional constructs is limited. Therefore the question arises, how brand personality could be measured reliably and validly using short questionnaire versions. This paper evaluates construct validity of a short questionnaire version based on a German brand personality scale (Mäder, 2005) comparing the short version with the original version in an online study with 298 students at Pforzheim University. Brand personality had to be rated for two German brands of the food retailing market. Results indicate high construct validity of the short scale, though the original version shows slightly higher stability when it comes to the underlying dimensionality of the scale and the prediction of the overall attitude towards the brands based on the different personality facets. Implications for further research and a more extensive validation including additional aspects of validity and reliability are discussed.

Today, almost a quarter of a century since the adoption of the agrarian reform and of the concept of the village’s social and economic development, we are presenting a rural development evaluation study.
R51|Dezvoltarea economica endogena la nivel regional. Cazul Romaniei<BR>[Endogenous economic development at regional level. The case of Romania]|Under the current global economic circumstances, characterized by growing uncertainties and the endurance of financial crisis effects, the approach of endogenous factors that contribute to the economic growth and welfare improvement is of major interest for academics and decision makers. The endogenous forces of development have a significant impact at both national and regional levels under the impact of recovery measures and actions related to different areas of economic policy. This book focuses on the complex dialectics between endogenous and exogenous components of local economic development, highlighting the main factors behind endogenous processes and emphasizing the particular importance of activating the regional endogenous potential in the case of Romania. The authors’ work is based on the interpretation of the main theories on endogenous development at national and regional level, completed by a multifaceted analysis based on statistical methods and econometric techniques for assessing competitive and comparative advantages to support economic growth and social development. The study has highlighted the need of a policy mix that would support the development of areas with a relatively lower development level, under the circumstances of a polycentric regional development. An optimal combination between top-down and bottom-up interventions may prove to be the most successful, offering an effective compatibility of decentralization with the coordination and monitoring requirements, supporting the smart specialization at regional level, that could create spillover effects at national level. The authors have pointed out the strategic orientations of regional growth for 2014-2020 resulting from Romania’s Territorial Agenda and the Regional Operational Programme, revealing the most important challenges in relation to endogenous development factors and the perspectives of regional convergence at EU level.
R51|Financing Indiaâ€™s Urban Infrastructure|Cities in India are envisioned as engines of growth but they suffer from severe service shortages. The realisation of the full potential of cities depends crucially on their ability in meeting the challenges of providing urban infrastructure on a sustainable basis. This article, therefore, reviews the current financing options for urban infrastructure and discusses the strategies for pursuing reform agenda needed to strengthen financial health of the municipalities. Given the inadequacies of the municipal financial resources and capacities, this article emphasises on the need for an integrated policy and regulatory environment, in which urban local bodies (ULBs) can enhance their capacities to generate resources from existing sources at their disposal and also can better utilise innovative sources of infrastructure financing. In particular, possible reform actions to improve municipal finance are clarifications in institutional arrangements for service delivery, true local financial autonomy, sustainable finances supported by user charges, restructuring of intergovernmental grants to incentivise reform with greater assistances for smaller cities, encouraging publicâ€“private partnerships (PPPs), deepening of the municipal bond market, local capacity building, strengthening regulatory framework of service delivery and public participation.
R51|City Deals, Decentralisation and the Governance of Local Infrastructure Funding and Financing in the UK|This article reflects upon a comparative analysis of the 28 â€˜City Dealsâ€™ agreed between UK government, Scottish government and city-regional groupings in England and Scotland since 2011. The City Deals have sought to incentivise local actors to identify and prioritise â€˜asksâ€™ of UK and devolved governments, fund, finance and deliver infrastructure and other economic development interventions, and to reform city/city-region governance structures to â€˜unlockâ€™ urban growth. Our analysis is based upon 32 in-depth interviews with lead actors in the City Deals, including elected officials from local government, central government officials and policy specialists from think tanks, as well as a secondary literature review. We find that City Deals are reworking the role of the UK state internally and through changed central-local and intra-local (city-regional) relations. Regional and urban public policy is being recast as a process of deal-making founded upon territorial competition and negotiation between central national and local actors unequally endowed with information and resources, leading to highly imbalanced and inequitable outcomes across the UK. As a template for public policymaking in an emergent and decentralising context, deal-making raises substantive and unresolved issues for governance in the UK that are especially pertinent as the new Conservative government at Westminster pledges to widen and broaden this approach as a central component of its future devolution strategy and policy.
R51|Payment Habits of Rural Population in Poland: Barriers and Challenges for the Financial Services System (Zwyczaje platnicze ludnosci wiejskiej w Polsce – bariery i wyzwania dla systemu uslug finansowych)|Socio-demographic features differentiated significantly habits of users of financial services, thus allowing a partial segmentation. The aim of the study is to diagnose and identify barriers and challenges facing the system of financial services in Poland – in the context of the prevalence of non-cash payment services among the rural population. We put emphasis on the presentation of potential models for the development of cashless payments in the country. Consumers of financial services in rural areas are accustomed to the “traditional” methods of cash withdrawals. It is less popular to take cash from an ATM. The proportion of population using cards is lower than in urban areas. The quantity and value structure of payments in various outlets confirms the existence of the conservative attitude of devotion to cash equated with transaction security. Depending on the domination of regulation or institutional activity, distinguishing “regulatory model” and “institutional model” was deemed appropriate.
R51|Optimal Fuel Taxes and Heterogeneity of Cities|In the United States all levels of jurisdictions are allowed to levy supplements to the federal fuel tax level. While fuel tax differentials at the state level are substantial, there is a relatively small differentiation across cities. This seems surprising given the heterogeneity of U.S. metropolitan areas. Against this background, the objective of the present paper is to analyze whether the current small level of tax differentiation across heterogeneous metropolitan areas is justified on efficiency grounds. We employ a spatial urban computable general equilibrium approach and calculate optimal gasoline taxes for an average U.S. prototype urban area characterized by a medium degree with respect to the spatial distribution of jobs (implying a medium spatial expansion of the urban area, medium degree of externalities, medium public transit share etc.) and for cities that differ with respect to these and further characteristics. We find that in our prototype urban economy the optimal gasoline tax is higher than current rates as suggested by previous studies calculating nationwide optimal gasoline taxes. Furthermore, it is shown that optimal tax levels may vary considerably across heterogeneous cities, much more than actual tax rates. This implies that stronger spatial fuel tax differentiation across cities could raise social welfare. However, we also show that setting an optimal spatially uniform tax, i.e. a uniform tax that maximizes the sum of the benefits generated in all cities, is capable to generate a significant fraction of the maximum achievable welfare gain under optimal city specific locally differentiated gasoline taxes. Interestingly, such an optimal uniform tax could deviate from all city specific optimal fuel tax levels. This suggests that the additional benefit from spatial fuel tax differentiation might actually be relatively small, in our case the efficiency premium is less than one-thirds.

R51|Banks, related variety and firms’ investments|In this paper, we study whether related variety affects firms’ fixed investment behaviour, and whether this relationship is linked also to the operational and organizational proximity between banks and local economies. By estimating different specifications of a dynamic investment equation on an unbalanced panel of Italian manufacturing firms for the period 2000–2007, we find that related variety boosts fixed investments by lowering their sensitivity to cash flow. This occurs because in technologically related areas banks benefit from lower screening and monitoring costs, easier re-allocation of property rights, and higher likelihood of establishing extended credit relationships with firms. However, we find also that the positive effect of related variety on investments disappears as the functional distance between local branches and their headquarters increases: more hierarchical and less embedded banks find it more difficult to collect tacit information on inter-firm production and financial linkages at the local level and therefore reduce credit provision.

R51|A Procedure for the Ex-Ante Assessment of Compulsory Municipal Amalgamation Programs|The aim of the paper is to develop a procedure that allows policy makers to make an ex-ante assessment of a general compulsory amalgamation policy, providing quantitative indications about the possible financial effects. The amalgamation of small municipalities is a widespread practice all over the world. This policy is based on the assumption that local public service provision is characterized by economies of scale and economies of scope. However, population size is not the only determinant of economies of scale, which depend on many other factors. For these reasons, the expected effects of any amalgamation program are uncertain, and ex-post empirical analyses are unable to offer unambiguous indications to policy makers since all programs differ. After a brief discussion of the relevant issues concerning amalgamation, we present the procedure used to simulate the economics and administrative effects of a general compulsory amalgamation policy. The procedure is tested with reference to the municipalities of Veneto, a region of Italy and we provide the results of a number of simulations under alternative amalgamation policies. The main result is that amalgamation policies based only on the a priori rule that small municipalities should merge may be very inefficient because the expenditure reduction following an amalgamation policy may depend to a considerable extent on other territorial and socio-economic characteristics of the municipalities involved.
R51|Expansions of Regional Airports and their Effect on the Local Economy|This paper exploits the deregulation of the European aviation market as a quasi-natural experiment to examine if the expansion of regional airports in Germany caused positive spillover effects on the surrounding economy. Such spillovers might justify the heavy subsidies which are transferred to airports annually. Standard evaluations of infrastructure investments have to face reverse causality problems since the investment decisions are based on the regional conditions of the regional economy. The deregulation act forms a exogenous incentive to invest in the expansion of existing regional airports. Furthermore, most of these airports act as military base and their location is not economically driven. Under these circumstances a Difference in Differences approach allows to estimate causal effects of the expansion on the regional growth. Following this identification strategy, the results are sobering since airport expansions are not found to have any positive spillover effect on regional growth.
R51|Size effect, neighbour effect and peripheral effect in cross-border tax games|This paper analyses a game theoretic model of tax competition in a system where tax authorities are revenue optimisers and countries are differentiated by size. The model accommodates more than two countries. In equilibrium, larger countries set higher tax rates non-cooperatively. By applying the Hotelling linear model, this paper gives examples where the size effect, neighbourhood effect, and peripheral effect coexist and push up the tax rate in equilibrium.
R51|The Cost of Misguided Urbanization: The Case of Informal Settlements in Butuan City, Philippines|The informal settlements in Butuan City, Philippines pose the intractable problem of housing and providing services for the urban poor. They exact tremendous costs to government infrastructure projects and the city as a whole. In this study, these costs are accounted for, particularly the costs the government will incur to compensate them for being displaced in the implementation of public infrastructure project. Primary data were collected through inventory of losses (IOL), socio-economic survey (SES) and the replacement cost surveys. Secondary data were obtained through key informant interviews with different stakeholders. The paper quantifies the costs of compensating them through replacement of their affected resources and providing resettlement. It also establishes different types of compensation to secure just terms for all parties. It presents a rich picture of how the informal settlers affect urban environment and the monetary and operational challenges they pose to the government and the society at large.
R51|Call for a Spatial Classification of Banking Systems through the Lens of SME Finance - Decentralized versus Centralized Banking in Germany as an Example|We are calling for comparisons of banking and banking systems from a spatial perspective. Therefore, this paper develops a classification identifying decentralized and centralized banking according to two characteristics: geographical market orientation (regional vs. supraregional) – to determine whether banks facilitate regional savings-investment cycles – and place of decision-making (proximity vs. distance) – to identify whether the flow of soft information is supported in SME lending. The degree of banks’ centralization is also approximated by the spatial concentration of bank employees and shows remarkable explanatory power in Germany, as de-centralized banks increase lending at the expense of centralized banks.

R51|Bubbles, Post-Crash Dynamics, and the Housing Market|This paper documents and explains previously unrecognized post-crash dynamics following the collapse of a housing bubble. A simple model predicts that speculative developers ensure stable pre-crash relative prices between small and large homes while their post-crash exit allows small-home relative values to fall. Evidence from Phoenix supports the model. Although home prices doubled 2004-2006, relative prices of small-to-large homes remained nearly constant but then plummeted post-crash. As speculative developers return relative prices must return to pre-boom levels, consistent with patterns since 2011. Anticipated mean reversion indicates that cities can reduce post-crash volatility and mispricing by publicizing size-stratified house price indexes.
R51|Modern trends and risks in the development of resource regions of Russia|"This paper, part of a larger project on governance and growth in Russia. It deals with the problems and priorities of the future development of primary producer regions of Russia. We design a regional strategy for socioeconomic development to 2025-2030. The analysis concerns growth and diversification of the economy of regions, where raw materials are abundant, in order to scale back the exploitation of mineral resources and diversify the economy. Almost all strategies involve a gradual change of the vector in the direction of modernization and diversification of the economy. We emphasize that the important role here is for a new regional policy. The paper examines regional financial resilience in Russia in the period following the global financial crisis. The level of risk is rising, as government emergency finance is withdrawn and regions face rising debt to cover even operational expenses, but ""resource"" regions seem securely well off, despite having been most affected by the financial crisis. This paper examines one region, Khanty-Mansiysk autonomous okrug (KhMAO), the largest ""donor"" to the federal budget, against the background of other mineral resource abundant regions. It traces developments since the dramatic budget reforms (late 1990s through 2005), including centralization of revenues and rationalized program expenditure (Alexeev and Weber 2013). It assesses regional budget and debt management in response to pressures from increased federal required expenditures, post-crisis withdrawal of subsidies, and the roll-out of new debt guidelines. It describes and explains KhMAO's stability and relative autonomy in these crisis conditions. The key questions are: Why are these ""donor"" regions, more affected by the crisis than others, also more resilient? Is Russia's growth core of regions financially stable because of federal intervention? How vulnerable is the resource region to future oil price shocks? Our findings are tenative, since there remain questions about transparency and soft budget constraints (Plekhanov 2006). We show federalism at its most cooperative: among other factors, regional collaborative action fosters flexible budgeting. In the longer run, the resilience of resource regions, such as KhMAO, with their overall steady growth, despite volatility in oil prices, arguably is due geopolitical factors, which attract energy producers and industrial giants other than in the oil sector, and the business environemnt, including steady maintenance of a higher standard of living and skills attracted in new clusters, which are supported by innovation-oriented budgets. The findings here, however, also include, even more fundamentally, an evolvinig cooperative federalist agenda, with groups of regions acting together to secure negotiated decisions on tax allocations and spending requirements. Supportive of the conclusion in Chebankova (2008), the term adaptive federalism applies to finance, and compels a rethinking of the concept of fiscal rigidity as applied to the Russian Federation."
R51|Responsibilities and Limits of Local Government Actions against Users of Public Services of Planning and Sustainable Territorial Development in Romania|In the context of the changes that have occurred in the Romanian society, the public authorities are required to play a coordinating role in providing the framework for a sustainable and balanced development of the national territory, and to ensure the quality of life of the citizens. In order to achieve these goals of social responsibility, the public administration authorities must build and adapt the tools of public territorial action based on their specificity and within the existing legal framework and resources,. Thus, the study shows the national and European context that frames the actions of public administration for what concerns the sustainable territorial development. It analyzes the characteristics of administrative-territorial structures of Romania, highlighting their socio-demographic diversity and the territorial forms of institutional cooperation. The approach of these issues is based in the first instance on an analysis of the European strategic documents in the field, as well as on the national regulations concerning the organization and functioning of public administration and territorial planning. The implementation of decentralization and local public autonomy has led to the capitalization of the local potential of some administrative divisions and caused a competition and a difficult cooperation between them. By analogy with the provisions of the quality standards regarding the responsibilities of the organizations towards customers, the study illustrates and analyzes the responsibilities and limits of public administration authorities in promoting sustainable development, territorial equity and the quality of life for the users of public services, i.e. the community members.
R51|Economic Characteristics Of Concrete Production From Fly Ash As A Way Of Land Recultivation| Application of fly ash in the construction industry is particularly significant in the terms of environmental protection and in the terms of improvement opportunities of certain properties of cement mortar and concrete. In addition to this, it is possible to perform the recultivation of significant area of agricultural land. Concrete production precedes the production of lightweight aggregate which is then used as an aggregate. Calculated costs of concrete production using lightweight aggregate were 70.52 €/m3. Most of these costs are energy costs in the sum of 85% of total costs. In the situation when the costs of concrete production using lightweight aggregate are compared to the concrete price at the market, or produced with the use of construction gravel, estimation of the economic viability gives a negative result. This result is caused by the high cost of the aggregate. The observed calculation did not include an improved thermal-insulating property of concrete and reduce pollution through binding of waste ash. According to this, final assessment can only be made after extensive technological, macroeconomic and environmental analysis. Economic analysis should be primarily based on the value of land that can be recultivation in this way.
R51|Magnitude and Determinants of Indebtedness Among Farmers in Punjab| The ongoing agrarian crisis in Punjab is becoming a centrestage issue as the farmers are reeling under debt arising from stagnant productivity and low profitability. The total debt burden on Punjab farmers is estimated to be Rs. 22943 crores and the debt per farm household is Rs. 218092. The level of education, non-farm income, farm size and non-institutional credit were the main factors which affect the level of farmers’ indebtedness. The farmers face a large number of problems in availing institutional credit which drives them to fall into the debt trap of the crafty and exploitative non-institutional sources of credit. There is a need to strengthen the existing credit delivery system to accelerate growth of the farming sector for evacuating the peasantry from the incessant debt trap.
R51|Factors Influencing Adoption of VSH Queens in the Honey Bee Breeding Industry| The Varroa mite is a threat to honey bees and beekeepers across the U.S. and is suspected to be one contributor to colony collapse disorder (CCD). In 2006, Varroa Sensitive Hygiene (VSH) bees were developed in response to this problem in the beekeeping industry. The hygienic behavior of VSH bees helps reduce susceptibility of colonies to Varroa mites, results in stronger colonies and decrease susceptibility to CCD. The objective of this paper is to identify factors that significantly influence the adoption of VSH technology. A probit model is used to identify factors these factors. Results indicate risk aversion, education and income significantly influence adoption decision.
R51|Urban sprawl and municipal budgets in Spain: A dynamic panel data analysis|" type=""main"" xml:lang=""es""> La dispersión urbana se ha convertido recientemente en un tema preocupante en toda Europa, pero es en los países del sur donde ha sido más grave su impacto ambiental y económico. Este patrón de desarrollo urbano de expansión espacial de baja densidad puede tener un impacto muy marcado en los presupuestos municipales. Por lo tanto, los gobiernos locales pueden ver la dispersión como una fuente potencial de financiación, en términos de ingresos asociados a la construcción y al aumento de transferencias desde los niveles superiores de gobierno. Al mismo tiempo, la dispersión conduce a mayores niveles de gasto, ya que puede aumentar los costos de provisión de ciertos bienes públicos locales y requerir una mayor inversión en la ampliación de la infraestructura básica para el nuevo desarrollo urbano. Por tanto, ¿cuál es el impacto fiscal neto de la dispersión urbana? ¿Consideran los gobiernos locales el impacto fiscal neto a largo plazo del nuevo crecimiento urbano o simplemente se preocupan de los beneficios a corto plazo, haciendo caso omiso de los costos futuros de desarrollo? Este artículo aborda estas preguntas mediante el análisis de la relación dinámica entre la dispersión urbana y las variables del presupuesto local. Para ello, estimamos un modelo de vectores autorregresivos para datos de panel mediante el empleo de datos de 4.000 municipios españoles para el período 1994–2005. El computo de funciones de impulso-respuesta generalizadas muestra: (i) que la dispersión aumenta considerablemente la demanda de nueva infraestructura; (ii) que el déficit de capital generado por esta nueva infraestructura está sufragado en su mayor parte por transferencias intergubernamentales y, en menor medida, por los ingresos vinculados al ciclo inmobiliario; y (iii) que la dispersión lleva a un superávit corriente a corto plazo, ya que el aumento de los ingresos corrientes compensa el aumento de los gastos corrientes, debido a la provisión de servicios públicos para las nuevas zonas urbanizadas. En conjunto, estos hallazgos apuntan a un conflicto moral para los gobiernos locales debido a que las transferencias intergubernamentales desmesuradas y los ingresos del desarrollo inmobiliario fomentan una excesiva dispersión urbana."
R51|Logement, crédit et surveillance macroprudentielle|Advanced countries now benefit from a macroprudential institutional framework. This article presents available monitoring tools for the analysis of the housing market as well as the housing loans market, clearly intertwined. Key indicators are regularly controlled but can be late due to inertia inherent to the housing markets. Complementary capitalization methods are also late indicators since ignoring the short-term supply reaction. Early warning systems are agnostic, but may ignore unexpected adjustment of the fundamentals. Modeling behaviors is theoretically more satisfactory but challenging from an operational perspective. We finally propose a simplified model of the housing and housing loans market for France. Classification JEL: G21, G28, R31, R51.
R51|A collective land tenure system with popular shareholding and sustainable agriculture|The Italian land structure displays some features which make access to land difficult for many farmers, in particular young people who have not received land by intergenerational transmission and who want to engage in alternative and sustainable agriculture. In Europe, innovative experiences facilitate the leasing of land for agricultural use, promote multifunctional agriculture, organic farming and short chain and, indirectly, counteract soil consumption and loss. These are forms of collective shareholding: the companies, which have small investors as their shareholders, own the land and lease it to farmers with long-term contracts. Similar solutions are in the planning phase in Italy, but they struggle to take off because of generally unfavourable structural and regulatory conditions. This article presents a preliminary overview of these experiences, highlighting risks and opportunities related to their different characteristics.
R51|Public support for forestry from EU funds – Cases of Czech Republic and Slovak Republic|Rural development policy in the European Union (EU) has been implemented through different instruments. This paper is focused on support for the forestry sector from the EU funds in the years 2004–2006 in two EU Member States – Czech Republic (CZ) and Slovakia (SK). The comparison of support for forestry activities from the EU funds, delivered through the implementation of National Operational Programmes, showed differences at country level. Both countries had the opportunity to apply for support based on common EU policy, but they were able to select measures that reflected their specific needs and priorities at national level. Within Operational Programmes the following indicators were evaluated: description of forestry measures, financial support, number of applications, beneficiaries, outcomes and impacts. The comparison of financial support showed that the greater part of support in SK was granted to non-profit investments, whereas in CZ into profit making investments. The main difference was in the interest shown by applicants for support. In CZ nearly 80% of submitted applications were approved compared to 59% in SK. The analysis showed that the main reason for differences in utilisation of available sources was that different principles were applied when selecting supported measures or defining the activities to be supported within the measure.
R51|Take-up of mortgage assistance for distressed homeowners: The role of geographic accessibility|Program participation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the success of housing policies such as mortgage assistance for distressed homeowners. Low rates of take-up of available assistance among eligible homeowners have hampered the potential success of programs such as the U.S. Treasury’s Hardest Hit Fund initiative. This paper investigates the effect of accessibility and related transaction costs, measured in terms of geographic access to application intake agencies, on the likelihood of application completion for homeowners who begin the assistance application process. Using data from a large-scale mortgage assistance program in Ohio, the work is motivated by the observation that a surprisingly small percentage of eligible homeowners who register for assistance submit a completed application. Consistent with the literature on access and transaction costs, we find that proximity to intake agencies increases the probability of application submission in a small, but significant, way. The results suggest that further emphasis should be given to the interactions at the front lines of mortgage assistance programs.
R51|Administrative Overspending in Indonesian Districts: The Role of Local Politics|We analyze the determinants of the excessive administrative spending of local governments in Indonesia. In an unbalanced panel data set of 399 districts for 2001–09, we show that the proliferation of districts has not led to increased administrative spending; instead a lack of political accountability is responsible for this excess. The degree of political competition influences the level of administrative spending significantly; newly introduced direct elections of district heads, however, did not curtail the waste.
R51|Banks, industrial relatedness and firms’ investments|In this paper, we study whether industrial relatedness affects firms’ fixed investment behaviour, and whether this relationship is linked also to the operational and organizational proximity between banks and local economies. By estimating different specifications of a dynamic investment equation on an unbalanced panel of Italian manufacturing firms for the period 2000-2007, we find that industrial relatedness boosts fixed investments by lowering their sensitivity to cash flow. This occurs because in technologically related areas banks benefit from lower screening and monitoring costs, easier re-allocation of property rights, and higher likelihood of establishing extended credit relationships with firms. However, we find also that the positive effect of industrial relatedness on investments disappears as the functional distance between local branches and their headquarters increases: more hierarchical and less embedded banks find it more difficult to collect tacit information on inter-firm production and financial linkages at the local level and therefore reduce credit provision.
R51|Modern Financial Tools that Can be Used by Municipalities: An Empirical Investigation from Greece|Present-day municipalities constitute important, dynamic, administrative and institutional entities which aim at developing local communities, tackling problems of peripherality and social cohesion and lifting exclusion. The primary aim of this survey is to investigate issues concerning Greek municipalities, such as the financial problems they face and which is the funding scheme they prefer. More specifically, the questionnaire - that was sent to the entire sample of Greek municipalities - examined the views of Mayors in each Municipality as regards: (a) What are the modern financial tools that can be used by municipalities? How they evaluate them? What they suggest what and what they prefer? The aim of the empirical analyses carried out is to draw useful and representative conclusions on issues concerning sources of funding in municipalities.
R51|Financial Innovations and Issuer Sophistication in Municipal Securities Markets|When local governments default or file for bankruptcy, it is often because public officials misunderstood the risks associated with innovative financial products. If unsophisticated municipal bond issuers were to widely adopt a high risk financial product, this could harm taxpayers and investors, as well as destabilize the financial system. This analysis uses municipal bond issuers’ total debt outstanding as a proxy for their sophistication and investigates the relationship between sophistication and adoption of financial innovations. Using comprehensive data on securities issued between 1992 and 2012, 25 innovations are identified. Products with these features were uncommon in the 1990s, and expanded their market share after 2000. The 600 issuers that back 75 percent of the outstanding debt adopted 21 innovations for a greater fraction of their new issuance, relative to the approximately 40,000 smaller market participants. When innovation-linked debt issuance is measured relative to annual expenditures, the mid-level jurisdictions adopted innovations to a significantly greater extent than either states and sophisticated jurisdictions or unsophisticated jurisdictions. The results suggest oversight should be concentrated on mid-level local governments where past innovations have made the greatest inroads.
R51|Household Debt and Local Public Finances|In the wake of the Great Recession, steep declines in state and local government expenditures and employment were a large and persistent source of economic weakness. The business cycle was also characterized by large increases and decreases in household debt. We estimate the extent to which variation in local government revenues and expenditures can be explained by variation in the expansion of household debt from 2002 to 2007, and the contraction thereafter. We merge individual credit balance data with municipal financial data from the Census of Governments. Using Census block indicators, we are able to place approximately 12 million credit bureau records into over 6,000 cities and 4,500 school districts. Our results indicate that a one percent additional increase in mortgage debt caused a 0.15 percent increase in local governments’ own revenue and a 0.17 to 0.21 percent increase in expenditures. These relationships were evident during the expansion and contraction of mortgage debt. We also find evidence linking nonmortgage debt to municipal finances.
R51|Semi-Parametric Interpolations of Residential Location Values: Using Housing Price Data to Generate Balanced Panels|We estimate location values for single family houses by local polynomial regressions (LPR), a semi-parametric procedure, using a standard housing price and characteristics dataset. As a logical extension of the LPR method, we interpolate land values for every property in every year and validate the accuracy of the interpolated estimates with an out-of-sample forecasting approach using Denver sales during 2003 through 2010. We also compare the LPR and OLS models out-of-sample and determine that the LPR model is more efficient at predicting location values. In a balanced panel application, we use GMM estimation to examine how the location value estimates are affected by airport infrastructure investments.
R51|Pay with Promises or Pay as You Go? Lessons from the Death Spiral of Detroit|As part of compensation, municipal employees typically receive promises of future benefits. Motivated by the recent bankruptcy of Detroit, we develop a model of the equilibrium size of a city and use it to analyze how pay-with-promises schemes interact with city growth. The paper examines the circumstances under which a death spiral arises, where cutbacks of city services and increases in taxes lead to an exodus of residents, compounding financial distress. The model is put to work to analyze issues such as the welfare effects of having cities absorb pension risk and how unions affect the likelihood of a death spiral.
R51|Rural waste generation : a geographical survey at local scale|The paper examines the per capita waste generation rates from from rural areas of Neamț County (Romania) using thematic cartography. Geographical approach of this issue is difficult because the lack of a geostatistic database at commune scale. Spatial analysis of waste indicators reveals several disparities between localities. Comparability of data between communes located in various geographical conditions must be carrefully made according to local waste management systems. Several dysfunctionalities are outlined in order to compare these results, on the one hand, between localities and on the one hand, between recent years. Geographical analysis of waste generation rates is imperative for a proper monitoring of this sector. Data from 2009, 2010 and 2012 shows that rural waste management is in a full process of change towards a more organized, stable and efficient system.
R51|Russian Regional Resilience: Finance, Cooperation And Resource Abundance (A Case Study Of Khanty-Mansiysk)|This paper, part of a larger project on governance and growth in Russia, examines regional financial resilience in Russia in the period following the global financial crisis. The level of risk is rising, as government emergency finance is withdrawn and regions face rising debt to cover even operational expenses, but “resource” regions seem securely well off, despite having been most affected by the financial crisis. This paper examines one region, Khanty-Mansiysk autonomous okrug (KhMAO), the largest “donor” to the federal budget, against the background of other mineral resource abundant regions. It traces developments since the dramatic budget reforms (late 1990s through 2005), including centralization of revenues and rationalized program expenditure (Alexeev and Weber 2013). It assesses regional budget and debt management in response to pressures from increased federal required expenditures, post-crisis withdrawal of subsidies, and the roll-out of new debt guidelines. It describes and explains KhMAO’s stability and relative autonomy in these crisis conditions. The key questions are: Why are these “donor” regions, more affected by the crisis than others, also more resilient? Is Russia’s growth core of regions financially stable because of federal intervention? How vulnerable is the resource region to future oil price shocks? Our findings are tentative, since there remain questions about transparency and soft budget constraints (Plekhanov 2006). We show federalism at its most cooperative: among other factors, regional collaborative action fosters flexible budgeting.
R51|"Is the Property Tax a Capital Tax?An Investigation of the ""Capital Tax View"" of the Property Tax"|"This paper examines whether or not the capital owners bear the burden of property taxes levied on capital (housing) using Japanese regional (prefectural) data. To do so, we follow the empirical framework of Wassmer (1993), which examines ""Capital Tax View"" of a property taxes. Empirical results show that while the effects of property taxes on capital are estimated to be negative and significant on the asset price of house, but have insignificant effect on the land price."
R51|Should Large Spanish Municipalities Be Financially Compensated? Costs and Benefits of Being a Capital/Central Municipality|We determine the costs and benefits of being a capital or central municipality, where central costs are understood to be incurred specifically as a result of the problems large municipalities located at the centre of an urban agglomeration face (including costs associated with social issues, immigration, commuting and diseconomies of scale) and capital costs result from the presence of regional and/or central government institutions in the municipality (loss of revenue or increase in expenditure because of activity substitution). However, these two qualities might also be beneficial to municipalities (resulting in a direct increase in their revenue or fiscal capacity). By estimating an equation of the expenditure needs and the fiscal capacity of Spanish municipalities with more than 75,000 inhabitants, we find that the central costs incurred by large municipalities are offset by their greater fiscal capacity, but that the same is not true for municipalities that serve as political/administrative capitals.
R51|Analysis Of The Impact Of The Implementation Of Projects Dedicated To The Rural Areas From The West Region Of Romania|The present paper intends to highlight the impact of projects dedicated to the rural areas from the West Region of Romania, in the context of sustainable development, raising stakeholders’ awareness in the implementation of European funded projects, which, approached with eagerness and professionalism, would respond to the institutional development needs and at the same time would implement a series of changes that are absolutely necessary and important for the rural area progress. Therefore, following our analysis, we tried to find the causes of the low absorption level of funds devoted to the Romanian rural area from the West Region (NRDP in particular), the deficiencies that have to be retrieved in the process of implementing these projects, as well as the solutions to the problems highlighted following the analysis made together with a group of consultants in EU funding.
R51|Market Research To Implement A Sustainable Backyard Acua-Agricultural Production System In The Community Of Benito Juarez, Sonora, Mexico Investigacion De Mercados Para Implementar A Traspatio Un Sistema De Produccion Acua-Agricola Sustentable En La Comunidad En Benito Juirez, Sonora, Mexico|The primary sources of information have an important part in business. Information provides businesses with more informed processes and future projects. According to (Kotler 2006), market research is an essential tool for the process of collection and use of information for better decision making in marketing. This information creates knowledge about the relevance of any new project. We conduct market research in the community of Benito Juarez, Sonora, Mexico. This was done along with the families of this area for the purpose of obtaining accurate information for decision-making on the implementation of the production system Aqua Agricultural. This system is to fit in the backyard of homes in the region under study. The intention is that the same families manage and administer its production. This could be for consumption, trade or recreation. From the above, we posit the following research question. Is it feasible to implement an Acua-Agricultural production system in the backyards of homes of families from the Benito Juarez municipality? To answer this research question, we conducted a market research and collect information and process it to develop conclusions of this project.
R51|Public debts capitalize into property prices: empirical evidence for a new perspective on debt incidence|In economies with reasonably mobile individuals, the demand for property depends on current as well as future taxes and public services. As a consequence, the current level of public net debts, i.e. public debts minus assets, should capitalize into property prices. While debt capitalization has been unduly disregarded in the academic literature and policy debates, the Swiss Canton of Zurich provides an institutional setting for identification. Our results imply that public net debts capitalize into property prices. The extent of debt capitalization seems to be substantial but it widely varies over estimation strategies. The existence of debt capitalization offers new perspectives on debt incidence. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
R51|Do constitutions matter? Evidence from a natural experiment at the municipality level|This paper asks if it does matter for taxes and government spending whether the mayor is elected (and recalled) by direct election or by the municipal council. It thus contributes to the economic literature on the impact of constitutions on economic outcomes. The effects are identified based on reforms of the municipal constitutions that were exogenous from the point of view of the municipalities in content and timing: each year, quasi-randomly selected groups of municipalities introduced the new constitution. This setup helps overcome endogeneity and identification issues that are common to many studies in the field using country level data. Using a new panel dataset of the 686 municipalities in three German states, this paper shows that direct mayoral election and recall through referendum only (as opposed to election and recall through the municipal council) reduce tax rates and increases spending on government employees.

R51|Greening the Property Tax|This paper reviews the literature and policy discussions about the role of the property tax for land use. Various externalities of the development of land, such as new infrastructure needs, the loss of open space or air pollution due to longer commutes as people locate far from city centres, are not internalised fully by property taxes or other policy instruments and this is often thought to contribute to excessive land use and urban sprawl. The impact of property taxes on land use intensity and sprawl is ambiguous in theory, however, and it depends on tax design, as well as land use regulation policies and other taxes that can influence municipalities’ incentives to convert land for development. Yet, there is some evidence suggesting that higher property taxes can limit urban sprawl, in particular when the tax on land is higher than on structures, although effects are small given relatively given a limited price elasticity of land use. Various property tax design options are discussed that may help to better internalise land use related externalities.
R51|Valuation and Assessment of Immovable Property|This paper addresses the following questions about immovable property taxation in OECD and partner countries: What is valued? How is it valued? And who values? It draws on published information and data on property tax policy and administration in 172 countries. It focuses on value-based taxes and the features of mass valuation systems. Main system options (such as whether taxes are based on annual rental values or capital values as reflected by sales prices) are described and briefly evaluated. It notes that valuation practices frequently ignore revaluation requirements; it identifies four areas for improving valuation performance based on the experiences of leading systems.
R51|Role Of Management In Organization Of Primary Health Care In Units Of Regional Government|The role of primary care is of great importance for the proper functioning of the health system. Social transformation in the last twenty year resulted in a fall of the interest of health care professionals to work in this segment of health care. At the same time, as a result of improving communications and increasing the available information, interested of individuals for their own health is growing. The first contact with an individual health care is in primary care segment, which must be equally accessible to all residents of Croatia, regardless of whether they live in rural or urban areas. Due to the reduced number of medical professionals who choose to work in primary health care, negative transformation of the health system and disconnect segments of primary health care that are organized through health centers, group practice or independent dealers, health care is not at the level of availability that is expected because the organization primary health care system has been left to the individual - doctor. Primary health care system lacks organization, which can be achieved by establishing health management at the level of regional governments.
R51|Efficient Scale of Local Government in China: Quantile Regression Approach to County-Level Data|We investigate the effects of urban and rural populations and area sizes on the expenditures of the prefecture-level local government. We found the following three results. The first relates to the expenditure for urban populations. At around 220,000 people, per capita local government expenditure is minimized in our simulation. The second is that the expenditure for rural populations is proportional to the population size. The third finding is that the expenditure in accordance with the areas is also proportional to the area size. This cost structure is the reason why China fs recent rapid urbanization increases prefectural government fs fiscal distress.

R51|Merkezi Yönetimin Vergi Gelirlerini Yerel Yönetimlere Dağıtımı (Küreyerelleşme)<BR>[Disturbition of Tax Revenue of Central Government to Local Governments (Glocalization)]|Main questions of this study are “How much autonomy?” and “Has autonomy take to feudalism?” Although the resolution of issue according to effective, efficient, rational and fair principles about the income distribution between the central administration and the municipalities is a precondition of permanent and efficient services of local governments. This study aims to identify regional goverments tasks and improve services of central governments with taxes (VAT) distirbution method. We also aim toincrease taxes that are collected from regional governments with the method of glocalization. In addition, if sharing criteria was different, it would how a change between the years 2003-2011 will be investigated. During the comprehensive analysis of these years with public revenues on the basis of VAT, local government’s expenditure, criteria/data to be applied to the share of public revenues to municipalities whether changing the method financing of municipalities can make local governments more efficient and productive will be explored.In a political structure that municipalities are financed from the center, it is very difficult to find an appropriate combination of equality and justice in the distribution of income. Local governments must have privileges which are proportionate with responsibilities on own mandates and source of income for producing to serve as an effective and efficient local services. The results show that if the central governments give budget to regional government according to taxes that are collected in this region, the productivity of taxation increase and regional government can collect taxes easier.
R51|Alleviating the Barriers to Domestic Investment in Addis Ababa: Underlying Causes and Proposed Solutions|While Addis Ababa is rapidly urbanizing, productive job creation remains to be a key challenge. The root cause of this has been the lack of structural transformation towards industries with higher potential for growth and job creation. In response, the government of Ethiopia and the Addis Ababa city government in particular through their Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP2) target the industrial sector to enhance structural transformation and create more productive jobs in Ethiopia’s cities. Despite the priority and importance accorded to the industrial sector and efforts to improve the investment environment, quite a few domestic investors go beyond the licensing stage to start production. A recent World Bank report on the investment climate in Addis Ababa shows that only about 5% of domestic firms that receive investment licenses are able to convert from the pre-operational to the operational phase of investment to establish their businesses. This is also consistent with government reports. By any standard, this is one of the lowest investment conversion rates, and hence is quite concerning. So, the key question is: why 95% of investors were not able to move beyond the licensing stage to start operating? We tried to tackle this using qualitative/semi-structured firm level research among the firms who received an investment license but are stuck or discouraged.
R51|The Non-Monotonic Political Effects of Resource Booms|This study uses variation in natural resource rents and mineral production among Peruvian municipalities to analyze the impact of resource booms on local politicians' behavior and citizens' well-being. Although this topic has recently attracted scholarly interest, existing empirical evidence remains inconclusive regarding whether resource booms are beneficial or detrimental to citizens via their effects on public good provision and living standards. Despite many existing theoretical models allowing for the possibility of non-monotonic responses, empirical literature has largely approached this phenomena using linear models, thus misunderstanding the complex nature of resource booms. By examining recent extraordinary mineral price increases along with particular rules for natural resource rent distribution in Peru, I show that the effects of resource booms on reelection outcomes, political competition, public goods provision, clientelism, and well-being are conditional to the size of the rents in a non-monotonic fashion. These results are robust to endogenous production responses and are consistent with recent theoretical scholarship for resource rich economies.
R51|Local economic development policy in Poland: Determinants and outcomes|The purpose of this article is to define nature, basis, and the effects of the economic development policy conducted by local governments in Poland. The analyses carried out are designed to define the role of local authorities in the management of economic development in the area. Furthermore, the purpose of this article is to analyse instruments for supporting economic development, which can be potentially used by local governments in Poland. The realization of this objective is possible by using descriptive methods based on a review of literature and the various types of documents and analysis on the policy of both the economic development and activities of local government, which implement this policy. The method of system analysis is also partially used in the article, and some results of surveys conducted among Polish and foreign investors and entrepreneurs in 2011 are presented. The article assumes that in spite of having a number of instruments, both formal and material, for encouraging economic development and business development, most local governments narrowly assess the current state of entrepreneurship and development trends, and perform an insufficient analysis of the potential of their area. Secondly, the formulated goals of economic development are not very innovative, ambitious or concrete. Furthermore, they do not arise directly from the analysis of the micro and macro-environment that affects the position and development of local government.
R51|Selected Constraints To Development Of Entrepreneurship In Poland|Small enterprises are a key source of employment, economic growth, innovation and productivity in advanced as well as emerging economies and as such they are a crucial sector of an economy. Access to financing plays an important role for the small enterprise sector in any economy. Based on previous empirical studies, it is known that small enterprises tend to suffer from limited access to financial resources across the globe. This study aims to investigate the current state of small enterprise financing although the data within the Polish context appears to be limited. While not every small enterprise has an opportunity to grow at a fast pace and turn into a much bigger entity, most owner-managers are concerned about financing their business, in order to sustain their business operations. The reality is that every business can experience some sort of financial trouble. Small enterprises are the ones that require more attention as they constitute a vital part of the Polish economy, their survival rate can have a significant impact on the economy. As such, analysis of small enterprise financing is called for due to the high vulnerability of these businesses.

As is well known from traditional studies of asymmetric tax competition, a pecuniary externality arises and distorts the efficiency of capital allocation between regions. We show that the difference-in-capital-endowment can improve the efficiency of capital allocation in the economy. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014

R51|L'incidenza delle politiche fiscali sulla pianificazione urbanistica. Gli oneri di urbanizzazione per la costruzione della cittÃ pubblica|"In this study, statistical data series of public finances, relatively little-known, has been analyzed to determine the activity carried out by Italian municipal administrations during the period 2000-2012, by conducting some of their important functions, consisting of: first, granting permits for the construction of new buildings, mainly for residential purposes; second, the collection of the revenue arising from existing municipal real estate taxes, and the expected income for the release of these building concessions, as well as for any sanctions in the urban field contextually applied; and finally, the construction of urbanization infrastructures, due to the increase in the share of the urban territory intended for residential or non-agricultural activities. It was so aimed to contribute to the verification of the arrangements by which local fiscal policies affected, even during the ""great recession"", the expansion of urban areas in Italy and the construction of related public infrastructures."
R51|I Progetti di legge in materia di governo del territorio: una prima analisi critica alla luce delle recenti tendenze in materia di finanza pubblica|In recent years, the issues of the territorial governance, in particular the so-called loss of land, and the local finance are central to the debate and the public agenda This paper analyzes the main proposals of the law of parliamentary and governmental initiatives, submitted by the middle of 2014, in the matter of governance of the territory limited to fiscal and financial aspects. In order to make a comparison and an overall assessment of these bills has been carried out a survey of recent trends in legislation in the field of public finance, finance of municipalities and ways of financing the metropolitan cities, and a review of the main experiences Italian and foreign taxation in urban development. The proposals analyzed taking joint objectives of disincentive the use of new building areas and to incentives the use of brownfield sites and the built heritage and involve the use of different tools of fiscal and financial position. From all of the proposals emerging awareness of the scarcity of financial resources currently available to local governments, the attention focused on the costs of urbanization and the need to use tools equalization or compensation to supra-municipal level with the participation of the regions. However, compared with the fiscal and financial instruments offered by the theoretical contributions and emerging from experiences foreign and domestic, further space for innovation emerge from the application of the extraordinary contribution to the urban transformation hypothesised for the financing of Metropolitan Cities
R51|Incentive Schemes for Local Government: Theory and Evidence from Comprehensive Performance Assessment in England|This paper studies Comprehensive Performance Assessment, an explicit incentive scheme for local government in England. Motivated by a theoretical political agency model, we predict that CPA should increase service quality and local taxation, but have an ambiguous effect on the efficiency of service provision. We test these predictions using Welsh local governments as a control group: CPA increased the property tax, and our index of service quality, but had no significant effect on efficiency overall. There is evidence of a heterogenous effect of CPA: it impacted more on councils where electoral competition was initially weak, in line with our theory.
R51|Sales Tax Collections in Nonmetropolitan Communities|Small communities sometimes increase their local sales tax rate in order to maintain or expand public services. The question addressed here is what is the net effect of changing sales tax rates on revenues from sales taxes? Using both semiparametric and nonparametric regression, we find retail sales to be mostly unaffected by sales tax rates as long as the local rate is less than 4 percent. At rates higher than 4 percent, however, there is a severe reduction in sales, yet not enough that sales tax revenues would decrease with increased rates. For a penny increase in sales tax rates from 4 cents, a city can expect their revenues to go up 0.86 cents according to the semiparametric model and 0.74 cents according to the parametric model.
