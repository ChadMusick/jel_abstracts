O54|Los legados del conflicto armado sobre la capacidad de los hogares para mitigar los choques económicos negativos: Evidencia para Colombia|Este artículo estudia los legados de las instituciones creadas en tiempos de guerra, medidas como rebelocracia, sobre la capacidad de los hogares para mitigar choques negativos de ingresos. La rebelocracia es el orden social establecido por los actores armados no estatales (AANE) en las comunidades que controlan (Arjona, 2016). Al proveer bienes públicos y unas reglas predecibles, la rebelocracia puede generar incentivos para que los hogares expandan su producción y acumulen riqueza. Esto los situaría en trayectorias de ingreso más alto frente a aquellos hogares que viven en zonas de conflicto, pero inmersas en la violencia y el caos. Si estas mejores condiciones persisten después de que los AANE abandonan el territorio, los hogares en áreas con una rebelocracia fuerte podrán mitigar mejor los choques negativos de ingreso. La estrategia empírica identifica las respuestas de los hogares rurales a choques climáticos aleatorios y estima su impacto heterogéneo respecto al nivel de rebelocracia. Con base en un panel de hogares en cuatro regiones de Colombia afectadas por el conflicto, las estimaciones controlan por variables no observables que no varían en el tiempo. El estudio encuentra que, en las regiones con una rebelocracia fuerte, los hogares mitigan mejor los impactos negativos de los choques climáticos comparados con aquellos que viven en regiones con una intervención limitada o nula de los AANE. Los primeros hogares sufren un impacto menor después de enfrentar un choque climático, y recurren menos a la migración de supervivencia. La provisión de bienes públicos explica una parte importante del efecto de la rebelocracia. Es fundamental aclarar que esto no implica que el conflicto tenga efectos positivos sobre la población. Los resultados sugieren que vivir con reglas claras en medio del conflicto es mejor que vivir en medio de la incertidumbre y el caos. Si bien este estudio no estima efectos causales, los coeficientes estimados son robustos a controlar por factores que pueden explicar la instauración de la rebelocracia.
O54|The Effect of Interdiction on Coca Cultivation in Colombia|This paper studies the effect of interdiction on coca cultivation in Colombia. Though directed against intermediate and final stages of cocaine production, this strategy could also have an impact on coca cultivation by affecting monopsonistic activities of ilegal groups. My results suggest that different types of interdiction operations have a negative effect on coca crops. In particular, I find that the presence of dismantling of laboratories causes a reduction of 0.003 to 0.006 hectares per squared kilometer in coca cultivation, coca base seizures cause a reduction of 0.003 to 0.008 hectares per squared km, coca leaves seizures cause a reduction of 0.006 to 0.019 hectares per squared km and cocaine seizures cause a reduction of 0.009 to 0.061 hectares per squared km. I interpret these results as evidence that interdiction is an effective anti-narcotic strategy; however,a cost-benefit analysis is needed to evaluate its convenience over other strategies, like aerial spraying campaigns.
O54|Trayectorias de desarrollo de los jóvenes en zonas de posconflicto: diagnóstico y propuestas de política|El presente estudio, financiado por la Fundación Ford y el IDRC, realiza un diagnóstico acerca de las trayectorias de desarrollo de jóvenes residentes en las zonas más afectadas por el conflicto (municipios PDET), las principales barreras estructurales que afrontan y propone intervenciones concretas que permitan maximizar las probabilidades de la realización de sus proyectos de vida. La investigación se apoya en un análisis cuantitativo y cualitativo de múltiples fuentes de información incluida la implementación de una encuesta representativa y trabajo de campo cualitativo. El análisis deja cuatro mensajes principales: (1) Los jóvenes que habitan los municipios PDET se encuentran rezagados en comparación con aquellos que habitan otros municipios. (2) Los jóvenes que habitan los municipios PDET se encuentran en un alto grado de vulnerabilidad (educativa, de fecundidad y de salud emocional). (3) Al comparar dentro de estos municipios a jóvenes han sido víctimas directas, encontramos que el conflicto ha afectado de manera negativa sus trayectorias de vida observadas y sus aspiraciones. (4) Aunque el conflicto armado ha tenido un impacto negativo en los sueños y expectativas de los jóvenes, la mayoría mantiene sus sueños de continuar sus estudios y ejercer en diferentes profesiones.
O54|Proceso de paz con las FARC y cultivos de coca en el período 2013-2017|Las negociaciones de paz emprendidas por el Gobierno Nacional y las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia –Ejército del Pueblo (FARC-EP), coincidieron con un repunte de las hectáreas sembradas con coca en el país. El repunte en el área cultivada puede estar explicado por la acción de grupos armados diferentes a las FARC que buscan controlar las zonas cocaleras abandonadas por las FARC o por los incentivos que generó el acuerdo de paz. El contenido del cuarto punto de los acuerdos hace referencia a la solución del problema de las drogas e incluye programas de sustitución de cultivos con beneficios para las familias que se acojan a dichos programas. Estos beneficios pueden haber operado como un incentivo perverso, estimulando la siembra de coca. A partir de un modelo de diferencias en diferencias para múltiples períodos, de 2012 a 2017, controlando por las políticas estatales de control de oferta, se encontró que en municipios donde las FARC tuvieron presencia continua durante el período de negociación, hubo un aumento de 604 hectáreas en promedio por municipio para el 2016, y 1032 para 2017. En los años 2013, 2014, 2015 no se observan diferencias significativas comparado con el año base 2012.
O54|Eficiencia del gasto en salud en la OCDE y ALC: un análisis envolvente de datos|Este artículo mide la eficiencia del gasto en salud en sesenta y dos países de América Latina y el Caribe (ALC) y de la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económico (OCDE), a partir de la relación entre el nivel de gasto total (como porcentaje del PIB) y algunos resultados en salud (esperanza de vida en años y mortalidad en menores de cinco años por cada mil nacidos vivos). Con este fin, se aplicó el método no paramétrico de análisis envolvente de datos, usando para cada grupo datos de 1995, 2005 y 2014. Los resultados permiten identificar la eficiencia y la posición relativa del conjunto de países dentro de ambos grupos. Para el año 2014, los países más eficientes de ALC fueron Chile, Cuba, República Dominicana, Venezuela y Jamaica, y de la OCDE fueron Japón, Luxemburgo y Turquía. El promedio de la eficiencia de los países de ALC fue inferior a la de los países la OCDE (0,938 y 0,974, respectivamente).
O54|Educación en Colombia: Un análisis regional|Uno de los retos que tiene el país en materia de políticas públicas es mejorar la cobertura, calidad, la equidad y la pertinencia en su sistema educativo, como uno de los pilares claves para mejorar la equidad social y la prosperidad económica. En esa vía, el país ha mostrado avances importantes en sus indicadores educativos, pero que aún no son suficientes para alcanzar la meta de ser el país más educado de la región, sobre todo se evidencian importantes brechas y diferencias entre los departamentos y regiones del país, que son necesario cerrar para lograr ese propósito. En este documento se muestra las diferencias en algunos indicadores educativos entre departamentos, como las tasas de asistencia neta, los promedios educativos e indicadores de calidad, entre otros, que contribuyen a entender las mencionadas brechas. Adicionalmente, se estima un modelo mixto tipo jerárquico que permitió estimar el efecto que sobre la calidad (Saber11) tienen los diferentes eslabones del proceso educativo: individual, el establecimiento y las características de los entes territoriales. Se encontró que en promedio para el país el más importante es el individuo (67%), seguido del establecimiento (27%) y un 6% el territorial.

O54|Economía del desarrollo en Colombia. análisis de las coincidencias entre el paradigma propuesto por Rubén D. Utria y el enfoque de Amartya sen en las instituciones y libertades instrumentales|El desarrollo es un fenómeno complejo y dinámico que se refiere al proceso de transformación y evolución de las instituciones y los sistemas por medio de los cuales los individuos de un país se relacionan tanto con sus compatriotas como con las personas del resto del mundo. El enfoque económico predominante ha relegado a un segundo plano el análisis de variables importantes para el estudio del desarrollo, como lo son: el nivel de escolaridad media, la calidad del aire, el nivel de desigualdad, el nivel de confianza, el riesgo político de corrupción dentro de entidades gubernamentales, entre otros. El presente ensayo busca, apoyándose en los aportes teóricos de Amartya Sen y Ruben Darío Utria, analizar el desarrollo en Colombia desde una perspectiva más completa que la ofrecida por la teoría económica tradicional, la cual ha confundido el desarrollo con crecimiento y ha tratado de cuantificar el nivel de desarrollo de los países por medio del Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) per cápita. *** Development is a complex and dynamic phenomenon that refers to the process of transformation and evolution of institutions and systems through which individuals in a country relate both to their compatriots and people in the rest of the world. The dominant economic approach has relegated to the background the analysis of essential variables for the study of development, such as the average level of schooling, air quality, level of inequality, consumer confidence, the political risk of corruption within government entities, among others. The present essay seeks, based on the theoretical contributions of Amartya Sen and Ruben Darío Utria, aims to analyze development in Colombia from a more complete perspective than that offered by traditional economic theory, which has confused development with growth and has tried to quantify the level of development of countries through the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita.
O54|Does Universalization of Healthwork? Evidence from Health Systems Restructuring and Expansion in Brazil|We investigate universalization of access to health in Brazil. We find large reductions in maternal, foetal, neonatal and post-neonatal mortality, a reduction in fertility and, possibly on account of selection, no change in the quality of births. Using rich administrative data, we investigate changes in organization, access and outcomes, thereby illuminating the driving mechanisms. We find sharp increases in coverage of primary health facilities with GPs and outreach workers and, in line with this, increases in outpatient procedures, prenatal care visits, health-education activities and home visits by medical professionals. Consistent with an attempt to rationalize use of hospital resources, we find a decline in specialists and hospital beds per capita. Despite this, we see increases in hospital births, C-sections, and maternal hospitalization for complications, with no change in rates of infant hospitalization.
O54|Obstáculos a la Innovación, Innovación y Productividad en Paraguay|En este trabajo analizamos la relación que existe entre diferentes tipos de obstáculos percibidos por las empresas (costos, conocimientos, mercados, institucionales) y la inversión en actividades de innovación, la innovación y la productividad de las empresas paraguayas. Los obstáculos financieros aparecen como la principal barrera a la inversión en actividades de innovación, a la innovación y al crecimiento de la productividad en Paraguay; los demás obstáculos se asocian con estas variables de forma más heterogénea. En este trabajo también exploramos heterogeneidades de estas relaciones de acuerdo a los tipos de innovaciones (tecnológicas vs. no tecnológicas) y tipos de empresas (por tamaño y productividad). Finalmente, a partir de los resultados encontrados extraemos implicaciones de política.
O54|What gains and distributional implications result from trade liberalization?|This paper investigates the distributional impacts of trade liberalization across firms, consumers and workers. Using firm-product-level census data for Ecuador, we exploit exogenous tariff changes at entry to the World Trade Organization. We show that with input tariff cuts firms access higher quality and new input varieties. Consequently, firms increase their product scope and quality, while their production’s skill-intensity increases and costs decrease. “Real” productivity (TFPQ) increases only in the medium run, following adjustments to produce more and higher quality products. Positive immediate revenue productivity (TFPR) gains result because firms’ markups increase. Consumers still gain as quality-adjusted prices decrease and varieties increase. Workers benefit differentially: skilled workers’ wages rise compared to less skilled workers’ wages. Input-tariff liberalization also has distributional impacts across firms. Only more productive firms with high markups increase product scope and quality and gain market shares. With output-trade liberalization the least productive firms decrease their product scope.

O54|Fooled by the Cycle: Permanent versus Cyclical Improvements in Social Indicators|This paper studies the time-series behavior of a set of widely-used social indicators and uncovers two important stylized facts. First, not all social indicators are created equal in terms of the importance of cyclical fluctuations. While some social indicators such as the unemployment rate and monetary poverty show large cyclical fluctuations, other social measures such as the Human Development Index are, by construction, dominated by long-run trends. Second, a large fraction of the cyclical fluctuations in social indicators can be explained by the cyclical changes in income (proxied by real GDP per capita). Since cyclical income volatility is much larger in the developing world, these two critical facts raise fundamental issues regarding how permanent are improvements in social indicators (like the ones observed in many developing countries during the last commodity super-cycle). Finally, and relying on a global sample of industrial and developing countries, we dig deeper into the importance of cyclical versus permanent components by extending the seminal contribution of Datt and Ravallion (1992). In particular, we show that more than 40 percent of the fall in monetary poverty observed in Latin America and the Caribbean during the so-called Golden Decade can be attributed to cyclical changes in income.
O54|Modeling the drugs and guns trade in a two-country model with endogenous growth|This paper develops a two-country, dynamic general equilibrium model of endogenous growth with illicit drugs and guns trade. With a trade framework that unies both drug-control policies in consuming- and producing-country, as well as explicit modeling of firearm trade, the model is solved and parameterized to study the dynamic trade-off and growth effects of various drug-control policies. A production-consumption growth trade-off not previously documented in the literature is found. Further, under different conditions, and depending on the resulting gain in formal trade expansion, there are economic rationale to either a prohibitive or liberalization drug-control policy.
O54|Income Inequality, Poverty, and the Rule of Law: Latin America vs the Rest of the World1|This paper investigates the relationship between the rule of law and income inequality and poverty in twenty Latin American countries using an unbalanced panel over the period 1995 - 2014. These results are then compared to estimates for non-Latin American counties. Using feasible GLS panel methods, we finnd that in many cases, improvements to legal systems reduce inequality and poverty in Latin America while having the opposite effect in the rest of the world. Results are robust to different definitions of inequality and rule of law. Protection of property rights is the most significant rule of law indicator for Latin America economies.
O54|Investment Constraints And Productivity Cycles In Bolivia|Bolivia has suffered from a series of investment constraints and negative productivity cycles in the last half-century. In this context, this article first presents suggestive empirical evidence that physical capital accumulation has been constrained by high volatility in investment per worker, low marginal product of capital, and high adjustment costs. Next, the article presents evidence about the cyclical behavior of Bolivia’s total factor productivity (TFP) during the 1980-2008 period. As expected, the cyclical dynamics of TFP are shaped by cyclical variables such as terms of trade and fluctuations in the real exchange. However, economic policy variables (such as macroeconomic stabilization and external debt management), institutional variables (such as democracy and civil rights) and initial conditions also appear to be significant when explaining the behavior of Bolivia’s TFP.
O54|Domestic Investment, Export, Import and Economic Growth in Brazil: An Application of Vector Error Correction Model|This paper aims to investigate the nexus between domestic investment, exports, imports, and economic growth for the Brazilian economy during the period 1970-2017, using the VECM methodology. In the short-run, our empirical results pointed out that import, exports, and domestic investment cause economic growth. Also, economic growth causes exports. Exports, imports, and economic growth cause domestic investment. However, in the long-run, our results revealed that domestic investment and exports have a positive effect on economic growth. Also, imports have a negative effect on economic growth. The results recorded a positive impact of economic growth and imports on domestic investment. Exports have a negative effect on domestic investment. Finally, we record the absence of significant impact of economic growth, exports and domestic investment on imports, and economic growth, domestic investment, and imports on exports. Due to the importance of these aspects to the economic performance of Brazil, the policymakers are invited to orient these issues towards the sustainability facets to guarantee a sustained growth path.
O54|Does Domestic Investment Contribute to Economic Growth in Uruguay? What did the Empirical Facts Say?|The fundamental role of domestic investment to provide economic prosperity is very well recognized by the economic theory since the Mercantilist theory. Hence, we investigate the impact of domestic investment on economic growth for the case of the Uruguayan economy over the period 1960-2017. For this aim, we employ the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). Our highlights reveal the absence of a significant impact of domestic investment on growth in the short- and long-run. Due to the marginal role of domestic investment played in the Uruguayan economy, the weak saving rate couldn’t significantly help the economy and creating wealth. Therefore, a strong saving policy is required to encourage domestic investors and reevaluate their crucial role in the economic process of Uruguay.

O54|Productive densification and hollowing-out process in the Brazilian manufacturing|Brazilian industrialization by import substitution provided high levels of productive densification, however, these levels reduced after the trade opening. However, the existing studies used sectoral disaggregation that does not allow the identification of productive niches that are densified or hollowed-out among the manufacturing sectors. This work mapped and analyzed, for the first time for Brazil, the degree of productive densification of all 258 industrial classes based on unpublished data obtained from IBGE. Thus, the study identified the more and less densified niches, possible targets of public policies. Results show that the low and middle-low technology classes are still predominantly densified, but half of the high and medium-high technology industrial classes have moderate to high productive rarefaction, and some technological classes are already maquiladoras. It is concluded that the productive hollowing-out process of the more technological industrial classes can delay the Brazilian development, especially in Science, Technology, and Innovation.
O54|The equalizing spiral in early 21st century Brazil: a Kaleckian model with sectoral heterogeneity|The relative success of the Brazilian and other South American economies in combining higher growth rates with a reduction of income inequality in the 2000s can be better understood through the study of the relationship between wage distribution, consumption patterns and the composition of employment. By starting from the Neo-Kaleckian framework, this paper builds a two-sector open economy model with two types of workers. An unstable cumulative causation mechanism through which a reduction in wage inequality increases consumption of non-tradable goods, leading to higher demand for low-skilled labor and a further reduction in inequality may arise.
O54|Public and Foreign Investment Spending in the Argentine Case.A Cointegration Analysis with Structural Breaks, 1960-2015|This paper examines whether public investment spending and inward foreign direct investment (FDI) enhance labor productivity growth in Argentina. It presents a simple modified production function that explicitly includes the positive or negative externality effects generated by increases in the stock of public or FDI capital. The paper estimates a dynamic labor productivity function for the 1960-2015 period that incorporates the impact of public and private investment spending, education expenditures (at all levels), the labor force, and export growth. It tests for both single and two-break unit root tests, as well as performs cointegration tests with an endogenously determined shift over the 1960-2015 period. Cointegration analysis suggests that a long-term relationship exists among the relevant variables. The error correction (EC) models suggest that (lagged) increases in public investment spending and education have a positive and significant effect on the rate of labor productivity growth. In addition, the model is estimated for a shorter period (1970-2015)to capture the impact of inward FDI flows. The estimates suggest that (lagged) FDI flows have a positive and significant impact on labor productivity growth, while increases in the labor force have a negative effect. From a policy standpoint, the findings call into question the politically expedient policy in many Latin American countries, including Argentina during the 1990s and 2000s, of disproportionately reducing public capital expenditures on education and infrastructure to meet reductions in the fiscal deficit as a proportion of GDP. The results give further support to pro-investment and pro-growth policies designed to promote public investment spending and attract inward FDI flows.
O54|Desarrollo económico regional, especializaciones productivas y cooperación empresarial. Un estudio comparado de Chile, El Salvador, Paraguay y Uruguay|This research has two aims. First, it characterizes regional development in the four selected countries. Second, it analyzes cooperation networks between firms and organizations, in 24 clusters in different regions of the four countries. Regarding the first aim, the work analyzes in each region the generation of wealth, the development of small business sector and socioeconomic conditions of the environment, complemented by the identification of the productive specializations in each region. Results show that economic development is not evenly distributed in the territory. Certain sub-national patterns in terms of economic development were found. In addition, there is a strong concentration of economic activity in the regions where the national capitals are located (except for the regions rich in mining or energy resources). The analysis of local business development and the socioeconomic environment shows that, in addition to external factors, a region must develop its own local capacities to take advantage of these external impulses and transform them into local development. Regarding the second objective, the study of 24 cooperation networks in clusters proves that organizations are the key actors to keep the networks connected. On the other hand, the level of cooperation among firms is, on average, low. In this sense, the countries under study do not present, in general, regions with high levels of local business capacity that can be the main support of cooperation networks. Therefore, organizations play an intermediary role between firms and provide access to external sources of innovation that can be disseminated through the network. Finally, the combination of social network analysis with econometric regression techniques revealed a positive relationship between the cooperation in networks and the economic performance of firms.

O54|Spillovers from Euro Area Monetary Policy: A Focus on Emerging Europe|This paper investigates the international effects of a euro area monetary policy shock, focusing on countries from Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe (CESEE). To that end, we use a global vector autoregressive (GVAR) model and employ shadow rates as a proxy for the monetary policy stance during normal and zero-lower-bound periods. We propose a new way of modeling euro area countries in a multi-country framework, accounting for joint monetary policy, and a novel approach to simultaneously identifying shocks. Our results show that in most euro area and CESEE countries, prices adjust and output falls in response to a euro area monetary tightening, but with a substantial degree of heterogeneity.
O54|The effect of air quality on welfare accounting|For several decades, there has been a discussion in economics on how to appropriately measure economic welfare. Although it is common perception that a simple GDP evaluation bears several shortcomings, GDP per capita is still the most prominent measure of countries’ welfare and of its development over time. In a recent paper, Jones and Klenow (2016) extend the huge existing literature on alternative welfare measures by a concept that is based on a utility framework and that incorporates, besides consumption, also life expectancy, inequality, and leisure. In this paper, we add a component of environmental quality, in particular air pollution, to this framework and show that for some country groups accounting for air quality remarkably changes their relative welfare position, both in terms of levels and growth rates over time. Especially for some emerging countries we find strong welfare reductions due to high levels of air pollution. Nevertheless, on average, our welfare measure is still highly correlated with GDP per capita. Our results highlight the importance of environmental aspects in welfare accounting.
O54|The Effects of Fair Trade Certification: Evidence from Coffee Producers in Costa Rica|We study the effects of Fair Trade (FT) certification of coffee on producers and households in Costa Rica. Examining the production dynamics of the universe of Costa Rican coffee mills from 1999–2014, we find that FT certification is associated with a higher sales price, greater sales, and more revenues. These effects are greater when global coffee prices are lower and the FT guaranteed minimum price is binding. Looking at households, we find robust evidence that FT is associated with higher incomes for farm owners. Part of this is due to a transfer of incomes from farm owners to intermediaries whose incomes decrease due to FT. We find no effect of FT on unskilled workers, who are the more disadvantaged group within the coffee sector.
O54|The role of industry, occupation, and location specific knowledge in the survival of new firms|How do regions acquire the knowledge they need to diversify their economic activities? How does the migration of workers among firms and industries contribute to the diffusion of that knowledge? Here we measure the industry, occupation, and location-specific knowledge carried by workers from one establishment to the next using a dataset summarizing the individual work history for an entire country. We study pioneer firms--firms operating in an industry that was not present in a region--because the success of pioneers is the basic unit of regional economic diversification. We find that the growth and survival of pioneers increase significantly when their first hires are workers with experience in a related industry, and with work experience in the same location, but not with past experience in a related occupation. We compare these results with new firms that are not pioneers and find that industry-specific knowledge is significantly more important for pioneer than non-pioneer firms. To address endogeneity we use Bartik instruments, which leverage national fluctuations in the demand for an activity as shocks for local labor supply. The instrumental variable estimates support the finding that industry-related knowledge is a predictor of the survival and growth of pioneer firms. These findings expand our understanding of the micro-mechanisms underlying regional economic diversification events.
O54|Structural reforms to boost growth and living standards in Argentina|Over the last decades Argentina’s living standards have lost ground relative to other developed and emerging economies. Putting Argentina on a path to stronger, inclusive and job-rich growth requires boosting productivity and strengthening investment through wide-ranging structural reforms. Areas that require reforms include the regulation of product and labour markets, taxes, infrastructure, skills, innovation, trade policy, rule of law and financial markets. Beyond changing the rules, implementation and restoring institutional capacity are equally important. Enhancing competition, for which implementation and institutions are particularly relevant, would stimulate private investment, facilitating the creation of new firms and jobs, and would bring benefits to consumers through lower prices. Finding the right packaging and sequencing of reforms is important to exploit synergies across different areas, to manage trade-offs and to protect the vulnerable from the costs of adjustment. In this context, improving active labour market policies and training can support workers in acquiring new skills and in getting ready for new jobs, improving their capacity to adjust to a changing economy.
O54| La economía peruana en vísperas del bicentenario de la independencia| Presentamos una interpretación sintética de la economía peruana, desde una perspectiva histórica. Resaltamos su naturaleza dual, entre un sector de subsistencia y uno exportador, este último más pequeño demográficamente que el otro, pero más dinámico. Ambos están conectados, sin embargo, por el mercado de trabajo y algunos otros mercados que se activan esporádicamente. El Estado nutre sus finanzas, básicamente del segundo sector, por lo que tiende a favorecerlo con sus políticas e inversiones. El artículo reseña la instauración del modelo liberal en el Perú desde los años noventa y su consolidación en las décadas siguientes y explica cómo al compás del último auge exportador iniciado en la misma fecha, el Estado inició una nueva modalidad de conexión con el sector de subsistencia mediante programas sociales de transferencias de dinero condicionadas.

O54|On the distribution dynamics of human development: Evidence from the metropolitan regions of Bolivia|Bolivia has experienced large socioeconomic transformations in the last decades. Among them, almost half of the population currently lives in the main metropolitan regions of the country. Motivated by the potential for growth and development convergence in these regions, this article documents the evolution of human development disparities and convergence patterns over the 1992-2013 period. Using a distribution dynamics framework, this article evaluates both the transitional dynamics and the long-run equilibrium of the cross-regional distribution of human development. Results from the transitional dynamics analysis suggest that the formation of multiple clusters of convergence is a salient feature of inequality reduction in human development. On the other hand, results from the long-run equilibrium analysis suggest that the process of regional convergence is characterized by the transformation of a trimodal distribution into a left-skewed unimodal distribution. The article concludes emphasizing that the cross-regional distribution of human development in Bolivia is quite sticky at its left tail, and as a result, the least developed regions are still relatively far from achieving complete convergence in the long run.
O54|Alta desigualdad en América Latina: desde cuándo y por qué|In recent years, a dense and fruitful debate on the history of inequality in Latin America has developed. The central points of the debate are: 1) the origin of Latin American inequality; 2) the role of the region’s colonial legacy; 3) whether the continent went through a period of “levelling” between 1930 and 1980; and 4) the sustainability of the recent trend towards inequality reduction. In this context, this paper has two main objectives. First, to evaluate the merits and empirical base of different positions under debate. Second, and most important, to offer a brief history of income inequality in Latin America based on the best evidence available. Thus, the paper presents an analytical narrative centered on the linkages between peripheral capitalism -to which Latin American economies moved in nineteenth century- and the institutional heritage, much of it of colonial origin. The main argument is that both changes and persistent features of inequality can be explained by the way in which the price cycles of exports interact with a political-institutional framework.
O54|Beta, Sigma and Distributional Convergence in Human Development? Evidence from the Metropolitan Regions of Bolivia|Almost half of the population of Bolivia currently lives in the metropolitan regions of La Paz, Santa Cruz, and Cochabamba. Motivated by the potential for growth and development of these regions, this article documents the evolution of their human development differences over the 1992-2013 period. In particular, using the United Nations' human development index at the municipal level, this paper evaluates the process of regional convergence through the lens of three frameworks: beta, sigma, and distributional convergence. The overall result is an increasing tendency toward convergence that is driven by both slower forward mobility of the less developed regions and faster backward mobility of the more developed regions. The distributional convergence framework provides further insights and suggests that the formation and merging of multiple convergence clusters is a salient feature of inequality reduction. Furthermore, in the long-run, convergence appears to be characterized by the transformation of a trimodal distribution into a left–skewed unimodal distribution. The article concludes emphasizing that the cross-regional distribution of human development in Bolivia is quite sticky at its left tail and, as a result, the least developed regions are still relatively far from achieving complete convergence in the long run.
O54|A Comparison of TFP Estimates via Distribution Dynamics: Evidence from Light Manufacturing Firms in Brazil|This article compares the distribution dynamics of two commonly used TFP estimation frameworks: the control function approach of Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) (LP for short) and the corrected control function approach of Ackerberg et al. (2015) (ACF for short). Using Brazilian firm-level data for the textile and furniture sectors, we estimate the transitional dynamics and long-run equilibrium of the TFP distribution for each framework over the 2003-2009 period. Results of this comparison are as follows. In the textile sector, the distribution dynamics for both frameworks are to some extent qualitatively similar. In the furniture sector, however, the distribution dynamics are largely different. While the LP framework shows relatively less mobility, two convergence clusters in the transition stage, and a bumpy distribution in the long run; the ACF framework shows relatively more backward mobility, a unique convergence cluster in the transition, and a highly symmetric distribution in the long run. In light of these results, the article concludes urging researchers not to rely too heavily on one or the other framework. It seems more appropriate to consider both frameworks for drawing inferences on productivity convergence and dispersion dynamics
O54|Brasil sem imigrantes: estimativas de longo prazo baseadas em microdados<BR>[Brazil without immigrants: microdata long run estimates]|This paper estimates the effect of non-Iberian immigration to Brazil based on historical and contemporary microdata. The historical database encompasses over 1.7 million immigrant records; the contemporary has more than 165 million records. The estimation of immigrant numeracy suggests that Stolz, Baten e Botelho (2013) underestimated their skills and, therefore, their impact on Brazil. An algorithm classified the surnames of contemporary Brazilians according to their ancestral origins. Two counterfactual estimates are constructed in order to estimate the income per capita if there had never been any non-Iberian immigration. The first counterfactual is built upon the regression of income on the percentages of each ancestral group in municipalities. The second, results from the regression of individual wages on the surname ancestry of workers. The coefficients of these regressions are used to estimate the income of a counterfactual Brazil with no descendants of immigrants. It was estimated that in the absence of non-Iberian immigrants today’s income would be from 12.6% to 17% lower.
O54|Increasing productivity dispersion: Evidence from light manufacturing in Brazil|Abstract Large productivity dispersion within narrowly defined sectors is widely documented. However, across studies, several statistics are used to assess dispersion and there is not enough discussion about differences among them. Using firm-level data for the textile and furniture sectors in Brazil over the 2003-2009 period, we estimated different TFP measures according to four methods: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS for short), the stochastic frontier model of Battese and Coelli (1988, 1992)(STCH for short), the control function approach of Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) (LP for short), and the corrected control function approach of Ackerberg et al. (2015) (ACF for short). Next, we calculated three dispersion statistics: Standard Deviation (SD); Coefficient of Variation (CV); and Interquartile Range (IQR). After confirming the existence of large productivity dispersion within the studied sectors, we analyzed if the dispersion is increasing or decreasing over time. For both sectors, SD and CV convey an increasing productivity dispersion message, but they do so at different rates (CV is seven times higher than SD). On the contrary, IQR suggests less productivity dispersion over time for textiles and mixed results for furnitures. Overall, in terms of characterizing the increasing productivity dispersion, the CV statistic combined with the ACF method define an upper bound while the IQR with LP method define a lower bound. Considering these results, the article underlines that there are non-trivial differences in the use of dispersion statistics. Thus, their use could not be interchangeable and should consider methodological issues, behavior in the tails of the firm productivity distribution, sample sizes and scenarios of divergence/convergence, among others.
O54|Multi-dimensional poverty among adults in Central America and gender differences in the three I’s of poverty: Applying inequality sensitive poverty measures with ordinal variables|The Alkire and Foster (2011) methodology, as the mainstream approach to the measurement of multi-dimensional poverty in the developing world, is insensitive to inequality among the multidimensionally poor individuals and does not consider simultaneously the concepts of efficiency and distributive justice. Moreover, the vast majority of empirical indices of multi-dimensional poverty in the literature overlook intra-household inequalities, an issue that is crucial to a better understanding of gender inequalities, because they equate the poverty status of the household with the poverty status of all individuals in the household. Consequently, using the general framework proposed by Silber and Yalonetzky (2013) and Rippin’s ideas on multi-dimensional poverty measurement (2013, 2017), we propose in this paper to depart somehow from the mainstream approach and take an individual-based and inequality sensitive view of multi-dimensional poverty when only ordinal (dichotomized) variables are available. We use such an approach to estimate multi-dimensional poverty among individuals aged 18 and 59 years living in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, shedding thus some light on gender differences in poverty and inequality in those countries. Overall, we find that individuals living in Guatemala have the highest probability of being multidimensionally poor, followed by the ones from Nicaragua; people living in Costa Rica, by contrast, have by far the lowest probability of being poor. In the middle appears Honduras and El Salvador, Hondurans having a larger probability of being multi-dimensionally poor than the Salvadorians. Regarding the gender gaps, the overall estimates suggest that the incidence and the intensity of multidimensional poverty in Central America are higher among females; inequality, however, is somewhat higher among males.
O54|Price-Setting Behavior in a Tourism Sharing Economy Accommodation Market: A Hedonic Price Analysis of AirBnB Hosts in the Caribbean|This study investigated the price-setting behaviour of hosts in the tourism sharing economy in the Caribbean. Generally speaking, we find that site, reputation, convenience, personal and amenities attributes, along with country-level indicators significantly affect prices in the Caribbean. More specifically, most attributes have a positive effect on price-setting. Larger accommodations charge higher prices. Hosts with superior reputations charge higher prices. However, listings with a larger number of ratings are associated with lower prices. This may be an artefact of tourists’ preferences for cheaper sharing accommodations, resulting in a relatively higher volume of reviews for properties at the lower end of the price spectrum. Provision of Convenience options have an overall positive effect on prices, although there is evidence that some options can result in lower prices for tourists. The sole Personal attribute investigated is associated with higher price-setting behaviour. Virtually all amenities examined result in greater prices being charged for the space. Results indicate that geography has significant effects on price-setting behaviour. Listings in countries with greater economic and infrastructural development, greater biodiversity, but weaker exchange rates have higher prices. On the other hand, prices are lower in countries where there is more competition for customers.
O54|Efectos del Cambio Climático sobre la Disponibilidad de Agua y los Recursos Hídricos en Bolivia: Pronóstico para el 2030|El presente trabajo evalúa la variación de la oferta hídrica bajo dos escenarios de cambio climático y consecuentemente la disponibilidad de agua para el año 2030 en 127 subcuencas hidrográficas de Bolivia. La disponibilidad de agua es evaluada mediante la construcción del índice de escasez, en base a 4 escenarios planteados. Todo el análisis fue realizado a través de un enfoque de cuencas hidrográficas aplicado por el método de humedad del suelo. Esta aproximación muestra que la oferta hídrica para el año 2030 tiene un comportamiento heterogéneo por subcuenca y que existe el riesgo de escasez de agua para unidades hidrológicas de la cuenca del Pilcomayo y del Altiplano.
O54|Determinants of Violence in Mexico|"This paper determines whether income inequality is the main determinant of violence (measured as the homicide rate) in Mexico, when considering the so-called ""hot zones"" of the country during the period from 2001 to 2013. By Least Squares in Two Stages (2SLS) with fixed effects, it was found that the main determinants to reduce violence are the increase in the number of students studying the secondary level and the better salary conditions. It was also found that the percentage change in wages is decisive to reduce the level of violence, specifically, a 1% increase in salaries decreases violence levels by 1.19%. As of 2007, the entities belonging to the ""hot zones"" had a level of violence 0.74% higher than the rest."
O54|A Dangerous Alliance? The Relationship Between Ecuador and China|Abstract The aim of this article is to outline the relationship between Ecuador and China, highlighting its main threats to the development of the Ecuadorian Republic, and in particular how the implementation of the buen vivir economic paradigm which Ecuador is experimenting with may be affected if it does not change the terms of engagement with the Asian giant. The article is structured as follows: in the introduction, we present an overview of the historical framework of the Chinese relationship with Ecuador. There follows an analysis supported by data on the commercial situation between the two countries and its implications for the development of the Latin-American state. In our final remarks, we present the possible routes that Ecuador could follow to secure its path to development, while highlighting possible conditions under which Ecuador could cooperate with China while avoiding a state of dependency.
O54|Alta Desigualdad en América Latina: desde cuándo y por qué<BR>[High inequality in Latin America: since when and why?]|In recent years, a dense and fruitful debate on the history of inequality in Latin America has developed. The central points of the debate are: 1) the origin of Latin American inequality; 2) the role of the region’s colonial legacy; 3) whether the continent went through a period of “levelling” between 1930 and 1980; and 4) the sustainability of the recent trend towards inequality reduction. In this context, this paper has two main objectives. First, to evaluate the merits and empirical base of different positions under debate. Second, and most important, to offer a brief history of income inequality in Latin America based on the best evidence available. Thus, the paper presents an analytical narrative centered on the linkages between peripheral capitalism -to which Latin American economies moved in nineteenth century- and the institutional heritage, much of it of colonial origin. The main argument is that both changes and persistent features of inequality can be explained by the way in which the price cycles of exports interact with a political-institutional framework.
O54|Redes de cooperación entre empresas: un estudio aplicado a cinco clusters en Uruguay|This research studies the collaborative relationships between firms and organizations interacting in five industrial and service clusters in Uruguay: the rubber and plastic cluster in Montevideo and Canelones, the pharmaceutical industry in Montevideo and Canelones, the dairy industry in the coast and south-west of the country, the hotels and restaurants in Colonia and the cluster of hotels and restaurants in Salto. Data was obtained in a fieldwork where face-to-face interviews were conducted with company managing directors in these five clusters. Subsequently, social network analysis was combined with multivariate regression techniques to estimate the causes and effects of inter-firm cooperation, with special attention to the relationship between innovation and cooperation networks. In addition to identifying sectoral and territorial particularities, results allow to identify several causes and consequences, both of cooperation and innovation activities.
O54|What is the potential of natural resource based industrialisation in Latin America? An Input-Output analysis of the extractive sectors|Several case studies have analysed the potential of natural resource (NR) based industrialisation, a process based on diversification towards high value-added products, in the Latin American region. However, there is limited evidence on how the development of productive linkages - a key aspect of this strategy - behave at the country level. Based on input-output analysis, this paper provides a clearer picture of the extent and evolution of productive linkages of NR sectors across a sample of middle- and high-income countries in Latin America as well as in other developing and developed regions. The paper focuses on the degree to which extractive industries, i.e. oil, gas, and mining, are connected to the rest of the economy by studying both backward and forward linkages using OECD IO data. It also makes a distinction between local and foreign inputs to account for the level of integration that these sectors have into global value chains and/or import dependence. Furthermore, it tries to identify whether the importance of the extractive sectors in exports and total economic output is related to the level of intersectoral linkages. We find that in most countries intersectoral linkages have become smaller despite the expansion of the extractive sector suggesting a higher level of enclaveness as predicted by the resource curse literature.
O54|Mortalidad neonatal en el Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia: desigualdades territoriales en el acceso a los servicios de salud|A pesar de los esfuerzos realizados para reducir la mortalidad neonatal en el Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, y de la implementación del Seguro Universal Materno Infantil (SUMI), los datos revelan que el progreso ha sido más lento que lo logrado en cuanto a la reducción de la mortalidad infantil en general. En ese contexto, el interés principal de esta investigación es definir las características de la mortalidad neonatal en el país. El estudio parte del análisis econométrico de los datos de la Encuesta Nacional de Demografía y Salud (ENDSA) de 2008. El objetivo es visualizar cómo el lugar de procedencia incide en el riesgo de muerte del recién nacido. Los hallazgos revelan que, en el Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia, el riesgo de muerte neonatal está condicionado por el acceso a los servicios de salud, debido a las disparidades territoriales a nivel urbano y rural. Estas disparidades se traducen en barreras de acceso económicas, geográficas y de exclusión que disminuyen la equidad en el acceso y la utilización de los servicios de salud, refuerzan los determinantes sociales que inciden en la muerte del recién nacido y limitan el acceso a intervenciones oportunas y adecuadas en la atención materno-neonatal.
O54|The Role of Industry, Occupation, and Location-Specific Knowledge in the Survival of New Firms|How do regions acquire the knowledge they need to diversify their economic activities? How does the migration of workers among firms and industries contribute to the diffusion of that knowledge? Here we measure the industry, occupation, and location specific knowledge carried by workers from one establishment to the next using a dataset summarizing the individual work history for an entire country. We study pioneer firms–firms operating in an industry that was not present in a region–because the success of pioneers is the basic unit of regional economic diversification. We find that the growth and survival of pioneers increase significantly when their first hires are workers with experience in a related industry, and with work experience in the same location, but not with past experience in a related occupation. We compare these results with new firms that are not pioneers and find that industry specific knowledge is significantly more important for pioneer than non-pioneer firms. To address endogeneity we use Bartik instruments, which leverage national fluctuations in the demand for an activity as shocks for local labor supply. The instrumental variable estimates support the finding that industry related knowledge is a predictor of the survival and growth of pioneer firms. These findings expand our understanding of the micro-mechanisms underlying regional economic diversification events.
O54|Policy priorities to promote financial development in the context of Middle Income Trap|This paper analyses the development of financial markets in Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Peru in the context of the middle-income trap.

O54|Impact Assessment of Scenarios of Interregional Transfers in Colombia|En este trabajo se evalúan los efectos económicos de diferentes escenarios de asignación regional empleados en el esquema actual de transferencias interregionales en Colombia, destacando los posibles compromisos entre la eficiencia y la equidad regional. Las simulaciones realizadas en el trabajo, utilizando un modelo de equilibrio general computable interregional, contribuyen al análisis del impacto del crecimiento relacionado con algunos de los objetivos generales que persiguen los gobiernos centrales al asignar transferencias subnacionales a los gobiernos locales. En este sentido, se simulan escenarios contra factuales en los que las políticas redistributivas están diseñadas para evaluar los posibles resultados del Producto Bruto Regional. Los resultados muestran que cuando la distribución se lleva a cabo sobre la base del tamaño de la población regional, hay ganancias potenciales en el crecimiento nacional junto con un aumento en las disparidades regionales. Sin embargo, cuando la distribución se lleva a cabo de acuerdo con otros criterios redistributivos, como el número de personas en condición de pobreza o las brechas horizontales de equidad fiscal, existen mejoras potenciales en la desigualdad regional, a pesar de estar acompañadas de efectos negativos del crecimiento. En este sentido, si se prioriza el criterio redistributivo para compensar la reducción del crecimiento, las regiones que enfrentan un aumento neto en las transferencias deben asignar los recursos adicionales para mejorar en términos de Productividad Total de los Factores (PTF), específicamente, priorizando en inversiones que mejoran la PTF en el largo plazo, tales como aquellas en capital humano enfocadas a la educación y la salud. **** ABSTRACT: We assess the economic effects of different scenarios of regional allocation of the current interregional transfers’ scheme in Colombia, highlighting potential tradeoffs between regional equity and efficiency. The simulations conducted in this work, using an interregional computable general equilibrium model, contribute to the analysis of the growth impact related to some of the broad objectives that central governments pursue when allocating subnational transfers to local governments. We simulate counterfactual scenarios in which redistributive policies are designed to assess potential Gross Regional Product (GRP) outcomes had they been applied to the Colombian economy. The results show that when the distribution is carried out based on regional population shares, there are potential gains in national growth together with an increase in regional disparities. However, when the distribution is carried out according to other redistributive criteria, such as the number of people impoverished or the horizontal equity gaps, there is a potential improvement in regional inequality despite negative growth effects. In this sense, if we prioritize the redistributive criterion in order to offset the reduction of growth, regions that face a net increase in transfers should allocate the additional resources to improve in terms of Total Factor Productivity (TFP), specifically, in long-term TFP-enhancing investments, such as human capital in the form of education and health outcomes.
O54|Is Hard Brexit Detrimental to EU Integration? Theory and Evidence|In the struggle between the forces of free trade and the restrictive influence of insularism the latter recently seems to have the upper hand. This is illustrated by the referendum of June 23, 2016 where the United Kingdom (UK) voted to leave the European Union (EU). In this paper we evaluate the consequences of this event for EU integration. In particular, we analyze how the extent of EU economic integration would change once the UK leaves the Union. To that end we develop an integration benchmark that consists of the steady state production equilibrium characterized by arbitrage pricing and perfect factor mobility. We apply metrics to measure the distance between this benchmark and the data. We find that the integration in the EU is incomplete and its trend is non-linear while Brexit would not bring negative consequences to its development..
O54|Firms and Labor in Times of Violence: Evidence from the Mexican Drug War|I study urban violence due to drug trafficking and how it affects the industrial development in an emerging economy. Employing rich longitudinal plant-level data over 2005-2010 that covers all of Mexico, and exploiting plausibly exogenous spatiotemporal variation in homicide rates during the outbreak of violence in Mexico commonly referred to as the Mexican Drug War, I show that a violent environment has significant negative impact on manufacturing plants’ output, product scope, employment and capacity utilization. Violence generates a negative blue-collar labor supply shock, leading to significant increase in skill-intensity within firms. It also deters internal, but not international, trade. The effect of the violence shock on firms is very heterogeneous: the output effect of violence increases with reliance on local demand and sourcing, and the employment effect of violence is stronger on plants with higher shares of lower-wage and female workers. The results reveal significant distortive effects of the rise of violence on domestic industrial development in Mexico and suggest that the Mexican Drug War accounted for the majority of the aggregate decline in manufacturing employment in Mexico over the sample period.
O54|Paraguay: Is Good Macro Policy Enough to Ensure Adequate Resilience to Adverse External Shocks? How Does It Compare to Other Emerging Markets?|This paper assesses the resilience of Paraguay’s economic and financial stability to external shocks. To this end, the paper expands on previous work by Rojas-Suarez (2015) and constructs a resilience indicator that has two dimensions: the first refers to the capacity of an economy to withstand the impact of a shock while the second signals the capacity of national authorities to quickly respond to its adverse effects. By applying the methodology of the resilience indicator to 22 emerging market economies, this paper reaches two main conclusions for Paraguay. The first is that the authorities’ efforts to improve the country’s macroeconomic stance since 2003 have paid off and will continue to do so if a new adverse external shock hits the economy. From the perspective of the second dimension of resilience, just as in the pre-global crisis period, Paraguay is now one of the most resilient countries among emerging markets. The second conclusion is that the first dimension of resilience, the economy’s capacity to withstand the impact of a shock, was not very strong in the pre-global financial crisis period and, relative to other emerging markets, has not improved since then. In the absence of reforms, Paraguay’s relatively weaker performance in structural variables (export concentration, national savings ratio, tax revenue collection, and financial depth) will severely limit the benefits of a strong macroeconomic stance to deal with the adverse effects of external shocks.
O54|Fighting Fire with Aid: Development Assistance as Counterinsurency Tool. Evidence for Colombia|I study the causal effect of the foreign aid for development assistance —implemented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)— on the intensity of municipality-level armed conflict in Colombia, for the period 2009-2013. To address potential endogeneity biases, I use a Bartik-like instrument which exploits the spatial persistence of aid from USAID in Colombia. Specifically, I instrument foreign aid with the interaction between the United States GDP and municipality-level intent-to-treat indicators for the Malaria Eradication Campaigns (circa 1957). The results point out that foreign aid reduces the insurgency associated with left-wing guerrillas, especially FARC. However, foreign aid does not affect the violence associated with criminal gangs from right-wing paramilitary origins (BACRIM). I provide both quantitative and anecdotic evidence on two potential mechanisms behind my results: (i) Development programs raise the opportunity cost of fighting and; (ii) foreign aid improves the trust, and the information flows between civilians and the government. Finally, I provide empirical evidence that casts doubt on two alternative channels whose predictions cannot be reconciled with the results: (i) that foreign aid increases the potentially- looted rents by the insurgents and; (ii) that development programs rise targeted assassinations committed by insurgents to sabotage and reestablish bargaining power.
O54|¿Cómo nos reconciliamos? El papel de la violencia, la participación social y política, y el Estado en las actitudes frente a la reconciliación|La firma del acuerdo de paz colombiano resultó en la desmovilización y reincorporación a la vida civil de más de 12.000 excombatientes de las FARC. El conflicto, que estuvo activo casi 60 años, causó más de ocho millones de víctimas y una sociedad dividida. No abordar estos legados sociales y psicológicos puede derivar en el resurgimiento de nuevos ciclos de violencia. Entender la disposición de la población civil a compartir la vida cotidiana con los excombatientes y su actitud hacia la reconciliación es crucial para diseñar políticas públicas que promuevan un posconflicto sostenible. Este artículo analiza las actitudes de la población colombiana hacia las interacciones cotidianas con los excombatientes de las FARC y sus percepciones sobre la importancia y viabilidad del proceso de reconciliación. Para esto, usamos una encuesta a una muestra de 4.497 hogares, representativa de los municipios más afectados por el conflicto. Nuestro análisis explora cómo estas actitudes y percepciones se relacionan con tres dimensiones: (i) las experiencias de violencia vividas durante el conflicto; (ii) la confianza hacia el sistema judicial, la policía y el ejército; y (iii) las conexiones con redes políticas y comunitarias. Los resultados indican que los legados de violencia están asociados con actitudes pesimistas hacia la reconciliación. Sin embargo, las personas que viven en territorios altamente afectados por la violencia parecen estar dispuestas a compartir las actividades cotidianas con los excombatientes. Mayores niveles de confianza en instituciones como el sistema judicial, la policía y el ejército, así como la participación en organizaciones comunitarias y las conexiones con redes políticas, están correlacionadas con actitudes más favorables hacia la reconciliación. Estos resultados indican que las intervenciones para promover la reconciliación durante el posconflicto deben tener en cuenta la heterogeneidad en las experiencias de violencia, las necesidades y las posiciones políticas en estos municipios.

O54|Lucha integral contra la corrupción en Colombia: reflexiones y propuestas|Aunque parezca atractivo tratar de medir los efectos negativos de la corrupción, lo cierto es que el impacto que ésta tiene sobre el desarrollo de los países es incalculable. La corrupción afecta la provisión de bienes públicos, la legitimidad del Estado y la efectividad de éste para exigir legalidad a los ciudadanos, la eficiencia del mercado, la innovación, la competitividad y la priorización del bien público en la formulación de políticas. En otras palabras, la corrupción constituye un factor común subyacente a los problemas de un país, no sólo un problema adicional. Esta problemática se ha reflejado en las prioridades de investigación de Fedesarrollo, dando como resultado este libro, donde se recogen varios estudios encaminados a mejorar el diagnóstico sobre la corrupción en Colombia y el diseño integrado de políticas públicas para prevenirla y combatirla. Al abordar el problema de la corrupción desde distintos ángulos, el libro busca contribuir al debate de ideas, el cual estamos convencidos permitirá avanzar hacia mejores políticas públicas. Fedesarrollo, en su papel de centro de investigación económica y social, aporta de esta manera a la compleja construcción de consensos y a la búsqueda de decisiones que puedan mejorar la calidad de vida de los colombianos.
O54|The role of FDI in structural change: Evidence from Mexico|Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to Mexico are substantial and play an important role in the Mexican economy since the mid-1990s. These investments reflect the activities of multinational firms that shape to some extent the economic landscape and sectoral structure in this host country. We illustrate that there is considerable variation in the amounts of FDI and structural change within the country and across time. Based on this, the paper's main purpose is to analyze whether there is a significant impact of FDI on structural change. We conduct an empirical analysis covering the period 2006-2016. We use the fixed-effects estimator where the unit of observation is a Mexican state for which we calculate structural change from the reallocation of labor between sectors. The results suggest that (if any) there is a positive effect from FDI on growth-enhancing structural change. This effect depends critically on the lag structure of FDI. Moreover, there is some evidence that the positive effect (i) arises from FDI flows in the industry sector and (ii) is present for medium- and low-skilled labor reallocation.
O54|The Nature and Magnitude of the Effects of Asymmetric Regulation of Mobile Termination Rates on the Mexican Retail Prices|"In theory, network profits are independent of the reciprocal termination rates when operators charge nondiscriminatory call prices (Laffont, Rey and Tirole, 1998). Additionally, termination rates can be used to subsidize subscriber acquisition cost. This issue is typically known as a ""waterbed effect"", where a reduction (increase) in termination rates leads to corresponding increase (reduction) in subscription fees to consumers. We are using a practical case for testing the effects in the final prices for regulatory policy with several changes in mobile termination rates based on an asymmetric price access regulation. In our example, the termination rates have been part of a vertical restriction strategy. The observed network-base price discrimination implemented by the major network (Telcel) resulted in deadweight efficiencies lost and created barriers to new entrance and blocked growth for the small networks OECD (2012). Historically, profits margins and mobile prices comes down whenever regulator have reduced termination rates; following the income effects in subscription (Tangeras, 2014). Having in mind this fact, regulators would diminish termination rates in order to pushdown mobile prices and stimulate competition, rest on a cost-based asymmetric price regulation. The further research allows a statistical assessment of the asymmetric price regulation implemented by the Mexican regulatory authority during January 2013 to June 2017. This paper evaluates if asymmetric regulation brings a better impact in the Mexican consumer welfare, driving the retail prices of mobile services down, also the effectivity of this policy for the next years, taking in to account that there is not significant change in the market share among all mobile networks."

O54|Negociación y preferencias económicas por género: evidencia experimental en México|Background: In Mexico, women obtain a lower wage than men on average. A potential cause of this gender pay gap is discrimination, but, in this paper, we show there are other channels that contribute to such gap. Methodology: We implement a laboratory experiment with 404 individuals in which they play the ultimatum game and a wage bargaining game. The experiment contains three stages: an anonymous stage, a stage where we reveal the opponent’s photograph, and a final face-to-face phase. We estimate gender differences in bargaining preferences. Results: First, we find no gender differences in the amount proposers send to respondents in both types of games. Second, gender matters in the bargaining process. When participants know their opponent’s gender, women show “solidarity” to other women in terms of higher wage proposals. Third, women reject less offers than men, especially in the ultimatum game. Lastly, in the wage bargaining game, women counteroffer less than men, and men are more aggressive in terms of counteroffers against firms headed by women. Conclusions: Gender stereotyping can explain our results. Such stereotypes may define how each gender should behave in different social situations, or, for instance, how we perceive women in positions of power. Hence, results are relevant for public policies that enhance social norms related to gender equity.// Antecedentes: en México, las mujeres obtienen un menor salario en promedio que los hombres. Si bien la discriminación explica parte de esta brecha, en este artículo mostramos que existen otras causales que contribuyen a ella. Metodología: implementamos un experimento de laboratorio controlado con 404 personas en el que se aplican los juegos del ultimátum y la negociación salarial. El experimento consta de tres etapas: primero se realiza una negociación anónima, después se revela al contrincante con una fotografía y finalmente se realiza la negociación frente a frente. Se desea estimar si existen diferencias en preferencias por negociación entre hombres y mujeres. Resultados: primero, no se observan diferencias por género en el monto que el proponente envía al respondente en ambos tipos de juegos. Segundo, la composición de género del juego resulta relevante para estudiar el proceso de negociación. Cuando se conoce el sexo del respondente, las mujeres muestran “solidaridad” al ofrecer un mejor salario a mujeres que a hombres trabajadores. Tercero, las mujeres rechazan menos ofertas que los hombres, especialmente en el juego del ultimátum. Por último, en el juego de negociación salarial, las mujeres contraofertan menos que los hombres, además de que los hombres trabajadores negocian de manera más agresiva en contra de empresas mujeres. Conclusiones: los estereotipos de género pueden explicar estos resultados. Dichos estereotipos determinan cómo debe comportarse cada género ante diferentes situaciones sociales o asumir atributos negativos en contra de mujeres en posiciones de poder. En este sentido, cabe mencionar que los resultados son relevantes para la elaboración de políticas públicas que resalten normas sociales sobre la importancia de la equidad de género.
O54|Argentina’s “Missing Capital” Puzzle and Limited Commitment Constraints|Capital accumulation in Argentina was slow in the 1990s, despite high total factor productivity (TFP) growth and low international interest rates. A possible explanation for the “missing capital” is that foreign investors were reluctant to take advantage of the high returns to investment seemingly offered by that small open economy under such favorable conditions, on the grounds that previous historical developments had led them to perceive Argentina as a country prone to external debt “opportunistic defaults.” The paper examines this conjecture from the perspective of an optimal contract between foreign lenders and a small open economy subject to limited commitment constraints. Numerical experiments for a deterministic version of that analytical framework show that limited commitment constraints introduce an asymmetry to the capital accumulation process of small open economies: the responses of investment to positive TFP shocks are muted and shortlived, while those to negative TFP shocks are large and persistent. Furthermore, under some circumstances, a lower international interest rate environment can magnify the asymmetry. A quantitative implementation of the model economy to data from Argentina accounts, in line with asymmetry just described, for the rapid decline that that country’s capital stock experienced, along with a falling TFP during the 1980s, as well as for the lack of any visible recovery of that stock during the significant surges of TFP observed between 1992-1998 and 2002-2008. In the absence of the limited commitment constraint, Argentina’s capital stock in 2008 would have been 50% higher than it actually was.
O54|Agglomeration externalities in Ecuador: do urbanization and tertiarization matter?| The paper investigates whether the tertiarization and rapid urbanization faced by developing countries favour agglomeration economies. Focusing on Ecuadorian cantons, a productivity equation is estimated using the generalized method of moments model with instruments controlling for endogeneity. The varying impact of industrial concentration, diversity, competition and density across industries is investigated and, for the first time, the implication of the level of urbanization on agglomeration externalities is studied. Stronger effects are found for services. The threshold of urbanization at which diversity, density and competition agglomeration externalities all generate positive effects was 33%, while they seem challenged by congestion in highly urbanized cantons.
O54|The Hausmann-Gorky Effect|For over a century, legal scholars have debated the question of what to do about the debts incurred by despotic governments; asking whether successor non-despotic governments should have to pay them. That debate has gone nowhere. This paper examines whether an Op Ed written by Harvard economist, Ricardo Hausmann, in May 2017, may have shown an alternative path to the goal of increasing the cost of borrowing for despotic governments. Hausmann, in his Op Ed, had sought to produce a pricing penalty on the entire Venezuelan debt stock by trying to shame JPMorgan into removing Venezuelan bonds from its emerging market index. JPMorgan did not comply, but there was a pricing penalty. Intriguingly, the penalty hit only one bond; an issue by Venezuela’s state-owned oil company that went on the market two days prior to the Hausmann’s piece. That bond then began to carry the name in the market of “Hunger Bond.” Using quantitative data and interviews with investors, we try to understand the causes of the Hunger Bond penalty and ask whether there are lessons for policy makers.
O54|Investment Gaps in IDB Borrowing Countries|TWe estimate public investment gaps in a sample of developing countries using a public investment demand function. We then use GDP per capita projections, forecasts of structural transformation, and three SDG targets (poverty, infant mortality and lower secondary school completion) to predict public investment needs in 2030 among IDB borrowing countries. Our estimates suggest that in 2014 the total public investment gap of IDB borrowers was close to $170 billion (3.1 percent of the Region’s GDP) and that the gap is expected to surpass $717 billion (6.3 percent of the Region’s GDP) by 2030 if the SDGs were to be reached.
O54|Maduro Bonds|For multiple decades, activists have sought to institute an international legal regime that limits the ability of despotic governments to borrow money and then shift those obligations onto more democratic successor governments. Our goal in this article is to raise the possibility of an alternate legal path to raising the costs of borrowing for despotic regimes. All countries have systems of domestic laws that regulate agency relationships and try to deter corruption; otherwise the domestic economy would not function. Despotic governments, we conjecture, are especially likely to engage in transactions that are legally problematic. The reason being that despotic governments, by definition, lack the support of the populace; meaning that there is a high likelihood that actions that they take on behalf of the populace can be challenged as unrepresentative and contrary to the interests of the true principals. The foregoing conditions, if one translates them into the context of an ordinary principal-agent relationship, would constitute a voidable transaction in most modern legal systems. That means that if opposition parties in countries with despotic governments today were to monitor and make public the potential problems with debt issuances by their despotic rulers under their own local laws, it would raise the cost of capital for those despots. To support our argument, we use both the concrete example of the debt issuance shenanigans of the Maduro government in Venezuela and a more general analysis of the relationship between corruption, democracy and a nation’s borrowing costs.
O54|Multi-dimensional poverty among adults in Central America and gender differences in the three I’s of poverty: Applying inequality sensitive poverty measures with ordinal variables|The Alkire and Foster (2011) methodology, as the mainstream approach to the measurement of multi-dimensional poverty in the developing world, is insensitive to inequality among the multi-dimensionally poor individuals and does not consider simultaneously the concepts of efficiency and distributive justice. Moreover, the vast majority of empirical indices of multi-dimensional poverty in the literature overlook intra-household inequalities, an issue that is crucial to a better understanding of gender inequalities, because they equate the poverty status of the household with the poverty status of all individuals in the household. Consequently, using the general framework proposed by Silber and Yalonetzky (2013) and Rippin’s ideas on multi-dimensional poverty measurement (2013, 2017), we propose in this paper to depart somehow from the mainstream approach and take an individual-based and inequality sensitive view of multi-dimensional poverty when only ordinal (dichotomized) variables are available. We use such an approach to estimate multi-dimensional poverty among individuals aged 18 and 59 years living in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, shedding thus some light on gender differences in poverty and inequality in those countries. Overall, we find that individuals living in Guatemala have the highest probability of being multi-dimensionally poor, followed by the ones from Nicaragua; people living in Costa Rica, by contrast, have by far the lowest probability of being poor. In the middle appears Honduras and El Salvador, Hondurans having a larger probability of being multi-dimensionally poor than the Salvadorians. Regarding the gender gaps, the overall estimates suggest that the incidence and the intensity of multi-dimensional poverty in Central America are higher among females; inequality, however, is somewhat higher among males.
O54|The Brazilian Amazon: a resource curse or renewed colonialism?|The aim of this paper is to highlight the effect of the endowment of resources on development through the analysis of the impact of national strategy, both at a regional and local level. The research focuses on the Legal Amazon, through the georeferenced analysis of socio-economic data from the last three censuses (1991, 2000 and 2010), in order to demonstrate how the Brazilian national energy strategy is contributing to the perpetuation of the phenomenon of the endowment trap at a regional level. Despite boosting the national growth, the concentration of sector-based projects in resource-abundant areas is unable to eradicate inequalities, which in turn perpetuates the path dependence.
O54|Brazilian Foreign Direct Investment in ECE - host country determinants|Outward Foreign Direct Investments (OFDI) from Emerging Multinational Enterprises (EMNEs) is a rather recent phenomenon that has significantly changed the patterns of the international capital markets, with important consequences also for the host countries’ economies. On the global scene Brazil was among the new significant emerging foreign investors, that has shown impressive investment growth in the 2000s. This paper investigates the host country determinants of Brazilian OFDI, with mainly (though not exclusively) focusing on the East Central European (ECE) region. Besides empirical interest on the main locational determinants of Brazilian FDI, we are also interested in the more theoretically oriented question whether Brazilian foreign investments follow the patterns of the established theories on FDI motivations.
O54|Globalization and Income Inequality in Latin America: A Review of Theoretical Developments and Recent Evidence|Although Latin American countries (LACs) experienced an increase in income inequality after their integration into global economy in the1980s and 1990s, they experienced a decrease in income inequality in the 2000s. This study attempts to identify the channels through which globalization has affected the increase and decrease in income inequality in LACs, based on a review of theoretical developments and empirical evidence. This study finds that the Stolper–Samuelson effects, within-industry skill-biased technological change, offshoring from developed countries, and technology or quality upgrading of high-productivity firms are the major channels for the increasing income inequality. This study also finds that the reduction in inequality in the 2000s can be mainly explained by an increase in the relative supply of skilled workers in Mexico, while it can be explained by the Stolper–Samuelson effect in South American countries such as Brazil and Chile.
O54|¿Realmente bajan los precios durante el Buen Fin?|Background. The Buen Fin is a commercial annual event consisting of four days of promotions and sales of products and services during the third week of November in Mexico. The event has gradually increased in relevance since its first edition in 2011. However, there is no formal analysis that assess the effect of the event on prices, mainly because of the lack of relevant information. Methods. This article analyzes the pricing policy during the Buen Fin in Mexico for a sample of urban establishments in the country. Using the database “Who’s Who in prices?” of the Federal Consumer Protection Agency, an unbalanced panel of weekly prices for electronic products in 525 establishments during 2010-2015 is built. An event study design is further implemented in order to analyze the effects of the Buen Fin over average and specific prices of products and establishments and over the strategic pricing policies from participating companies. Results. The Buen Fin reduces the average prices of electronics items in 7% when compared with the prices observed in September before the event. Only 52% of the products in the sample effectively reduced their prices during the event. Accounting only for discounted products, an average discount of 15% is observed. There is also evidence of a systematic increase in electronic prices weeks before the event, on average, 2%; some establishments have adopted practices to make discounts more salient for consumers. Conclusions. The Buen Fin cannot be considered as an event of widespread sales and discounts. The discounts offered by different chains have significant differences. In some cases, several establishments have taken strategic practices to make more evident the deals offered during the event.// Antecedentes. El Buen Fin es un evento comercial de periodicidad anual que consiste en cuatro días de promoción y rebajas de productos y servicios durante la tercera semana del mes de noviembre en México. El evento ha incrementado su relevancia desde su primera edición en 2011. Sin embargo, no existe un análisis formal que evalúe el efecto del Buen Fin sobre los precios y las políticas de fijación de precios de las empresas, principalmente debido a la falta de información relevante. Métodos. Este artículo analiza la fijación de precios durante el Buen Fin para una muestra de establecimientos ubicados en áreas urbanas del país. Empleando la base de datos ¿Quién es quién en los precios? de la Procuraduría Federal del Consumidor (Profeco) se construye un panel no balanceado de precios semanales de productos electrónicos para 525 establecimientos durante 2010-2015. Posteriormente, se utiliza la metodología de estudio de eventos para analizar los efectos del Buen Fin en el nivel de precios promedio y en los precios específicos por producto y por cadena. Adicionalmente, se analizan las políticas de fijación estratégica de precios para las empresas participantes. Resultados. El Buen Fin reduce en promedio 7% los precios con respecto al precio observado en septiembre antes del evento. Sólo 52% de los productos analizados reduce efectivamente su precio en el Buen Fin. Restringiendo el análisis a productos descontados, se obtiene un descuento promedio de 15%. El aumento promedio de precios antes del evento es de 2%, evidencia de que algunos establecimientos han adoptado prácticas para hacer más evidentes las ofertas del Buen Fin. Conclusión. El Buen Fin no puede ser considerado como un evento de baja generalizada de precios. Los descuentos ofrecidos por distintas cadenas tienen diferencias considerables. En algunos casos, diversos establecimientos han adoptado prácticas estratégicas que permiten hacer más evidentes las ofertas ofrecidas durante el evento.
O54|Identidad social y estereotipos por color de piel. Aspiraciones y desempeño en jóvenes mexicanos|Background. Recent literature shows that, in Mexico, skin color is relevant for life outcomes and for social mobility. A possible transmission channel is explicit discrimination. Another possible channel is that the effort and aspirations may be affected by negative stereotypes attributed to dark-skinned individuals. Since society values certain physical traits (social identity), affected individuals can modify their behavior and expectations. Methods. We conducted a field experiment with middle school students in Mexico City. Each student solved a cognitive test and a questionnaire about future aspirations. The experimental design consisted of randomly revealing information before performing the test. The control group did not receive any information. Treatment 1 received twelve images of public characters with light or white skin prior taking the test, treatment 2 received a color palette to self-assess skin color and treatment 3 received both the mosaic of images and the palette of colors. Results. Results presented in here indicate that social identity and skin color stereotypes affect the aspirations and performance of young people in Mexico. The group that received the intervention invoking social identification by skin tone and its possible relation with life results, presented a lower level of aspirations towards the future (0.26 standard deviations), compared with the students in the control group. These effects come from women, suggesting that they are more sensitive to the negative effect of stereotypes. Conclusions. These results imply that cultural aspects in Mexico affect how young people behave and make decisions. Therefore, differences in life outcomes and social mobility for individuals with different skin color, but otherwise equal, could also be explained by the existence of negative stereotypes against dark-skinned people.// Antecedentes. Investigaciones recientes muestran que en México el color de piel es relevante para resultados de vida y para la movilidad social. Un canal de transmisión es la discriminación explícita. Otro posible canal supone que sean menores el esfuerzo y las aspiraciones de personas sujetas a estereotipos negativos por su color de piel. Ya que la sociedad valora ciertos rasgos físicos (identidad social), los individuos afectados pueden modificar su conducta y ajustar sus expectativas. Método. Realizamos un experimento de campo con estudiantes en secundarias de la Ciudad de México. Cada estudiante resolvió una prueba para medir habilidades cognitivas y un cuestionario sobre aspiraciones futuras. El diseño experimental consistió en revelar información de manera aleatoria antes de realizar la prueba. El grupo de control no recibió ninguna información. El tratamiento 1 recibió 12 imágenes de personajes públicos con tez clara antes de la prueba, el tratamiento 2 recibió una paleta de colores para autoevaluar el tono de piel, y el tratamiento 3 recibió ambas, el mosaico de imágenes y la paleta de colores. Resultados. Los resultados señalan que la identidad social y los estereotipos de color de piel afectan las aspiraciones y el desempeño de los jóvenes en México. El grupo que recibió la intervención, invocando la identificación social por tono de piel y su posible relación con resultados de vida, presentó un menor nivel de aspiraciones hacia el futuro (0.26 desviaciones estándar), comparado con los estudiantes en el grupo de control. Estos efectos provienen de las mujeres, lo que sugiere que son más sensibles al efecto negativo de los estereotipos. Conclusiones. Los resultados implican que aspectos culturales en la sociedad mexicana afectan el modo en que los jóvenes se comportan y toman decisiones. Por tanto, diferencias en resultados de vida y movilidad social en México para individuos similares, pero con tonos de piel distintos, también podrían explicarse por la existencia de estereotipos de color de piel.
O54|Gender and multidimensional poverty in Nicaragua: An individual based approach|Most existing multidimensional poverty measures, such as the global-MPI and the MPI-LA, use the household as the unit of analysis, which means that the multidimensional poverty condition of the household is equated with the multidimensional poverty condition of all its members; accordingly, these measures ignore the intra-household inequalities and are gender-insensitive. Gender equality is, however, at the center of the sustainable development, as emphasized by Goal 5 of the SDGs; therefore, individual-based measures are indispensable to track progress in reaching this Goal. We contribute to the literature on multidimensional poverty and gender inequality by proposing an individual-based multidimensional poverty measure for Nicaragua and estimate the gender gaps in the three I’s of multidimensional poverty (incidence, intensity, and inequality). Overall, we find that in Nicaragua, the gender gaps in multidimensional poverty are lower than 5%, and poverty does not seem to be feminized. However, the inequality among the multidimensionally poor is clearly feminized, especially among adults, and women are living in very intense poverty when compared to men. We also find that adding a dimension (employment, domestic work, and social protection) under which women face higher deprivation into the analysis leads to larger estimates of the incidence, intensity, and inequality of women’s poverty. Finally, we find evidence that supports earlier studies that challenge the notion that female-headed households are worse off than those led by males in terms of poverty.
O54|What difference does it make? Revue de littérature et analyse empirique des déterminants de la Trappe à Revenu Intermédiaire|Middle-Income Trap (MIT) is a growing concern for developing countries\' governments and development banks. This paper uses a mixed approach to identify episodes of MIT in a panel of 132 countries over 1970-2010 and tests empirically three groups of explaining factors advanced by the recent literature on this issue: growth and accumulation regimes, transformation of trade and productive structures and distributional conflicts. We find that the demographic dividend, the patterns of productive change and diversification, skill misallocation, and conflicts help explain why some middle countries underwent persistent growth slowdowns. On the contrary, such frequently evoked explanations as physical and human capital accumulation, democracy, inequality and redistribution did not help differentiating between the middle-income countries caught in the trap and the others. Cumulative effects are also identified since the weakness of employment and innovation capacities dampens the positive effect of human capital and workforce on medium-run growth.
O54|Human Capital Acquisition and Occupational Choice: Implications for Economic Development|Using household-level data from Mexico we document patterns among schooling, entrepreneurial decisions and household characteristics such as assets, talent of household members and age of the household head. Motivated by our findings, we develop a heterogeneous-agent, incomplete- markets, overlapping-generations dynasty model. Households jointly decide over their life cycle on (i) kids' human capital investments (schooling) and (ii) parents' entry, exit and investment into alternative entrepreneurial modes (subsistence and modern). With financial constraints all of these are co-determined. A calibrated version of our model can account for the broad correlation patterns uncovered in the data within and across generations, e.g., a non-monotonic relationship between educational choices and assets across occupations, growth in profits and employment for modern firms only, and dynastic persistence across generations in education and wealth. Endogenous human capital acquisition is a key driver of inequality and intergenerational persistence. Eliminating this channel would decrease the top 10% income share by 47%. Eliminating within-period borrowing constraints would increase average household expenditure by 7.1% and benefit the middle class, reducing top and bottom expenditure shares. It would also reduce by 28% the correlation between household assets and kids' schooling levels. (Copyright: Elsevier)
O54|Wealthier, Happier and More Self-Sufficient: When Anti-Poverty Programs Improve Economic and Subjective Wellbeing at a Reduced Cost to Taxpayers|We document how an anti-poverty program improves economic and subjective wellbeing, and self-sufficiency. Familias en Accion Urbano, a conditional cash transfer program implemented at scale in the country of Colombia, uses a means-test cutoff score selection rule that provides exogenous variation in program participation. We reproduce the score assignment rule in a nationally representative living standards household survey that measures multiple dimensions of economic and evaluative wellbeing. Three years into the program, beneficiary households at the margin report greater income, consumption and formal employment participation for both the household head and partner. Household income increased by ten times the amount of the government transfer, likely because of gains in formal employment. Beneficiary households at the margin also report greater overall satisfaction with life, greater happiness and greater satisfaction with food. These results support the hypothesis that among households with basic unmet needs, policies that have a permanent impact on income and consumption may also have a lasting impact on subjective wellbeing and self-sufficiency. Moreover, relatively small subsidies, further offset by additional government tax receipt, may generate substantial benefits to poor families at a reduced cost to taxpayers.
O54|Active labour market programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean: Evicence from a meta analysis|We present a systematic collection and assessment of impact evaluations of active labour market programmes (ALMP) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The paper delineates the strategy to compile a novel meta database and provides a narrative review of 51 studies. Based on these studies, the quantitative analysis extracts a sample of 296 impact estimates, and uses meta regression models to analyse systematic patterns in the data. In addition to analysing earnings and employment outcomes as in previous meta analyses, we also code and investigate measures of job quality, such as the effects on hours worked and formality. We find that ALMPs in LAC are particularly effective in increasing the probability of having a formal job, compared to other outcomes. Our results also show that training programmes are slightly more effective than other types of interventions. Moreover, when looking at the sample of training programmes alone, we observe that formal employment is also the outcome category that is most likely to be impacted positively by these programmes. In terms of targeting, we find that ALMPs in the region work better for women than for men, and for youth compared to prime-age workers. Finally, medium-run estimates are not more likely to be positive than short-run estimates, while programmes of short duration (4 months or less) are significantly less likely to produce positive effects compared to longer interventions.
O54|You Can(’t) Always Get the Job You Want: Stated versus Revealed Employment Preferences in the Peruvian Agro-industry| Employment in high-value agro-export sectors has been recognized to entail the potential to contribute to poverty reduction in rural areas of developing countries. Concerns have yet been raised about the quality of the created employment and worker preferences have often been overlooked in the literature. We use a discrete choice experiment, in which we relate stated and revealed employment preference of agro-industrial export workers in Peru. We explain employment (mis)matches as a function of personal and employer characteristics. Results suggest that employment preferences are heterogeneous, but that labor market frictions are smaller than what is commonly expected in developing country contexts.
O54|Smart Specialisation in EU and Chile, challenges and opportunities. Towards a transcontinental policy learning dialogue methodology|The Smart Specialisation approach is being an inspiratory driver of regional innovation not only within the European Union but beyond. This paper elaborates on the Policy Learning Dialogue: Smart Specialisation in EU and Chile which took place at the Joint Research Centre, Seville (21st November 2016). The article showcases policy reflections and outcomes derived from a fruitful discussion between practitioners of regional innovation strategies in EU and Chile, smart specialisation platform staff and experts. This policy dialogue was part of the activities carried out by the smart specialisation platform aiming at providing evidence-based support to policy makers and stakeholders of smart specialisation through common reflections focused on cooperation dynamics and joint learning.
O54|Peripherality, Inequality, and Economic Development in Latin American Countries|In this study, we analyse new peripheral features of Latin American Countries (LACs), conceptualized by neo-structuralism and the triangular relation between peripherality, inequality, and economic development. We analyse the following as peripheral features: primary commodity dependence, low level of technological progress, poor formation of global value chains (GVCs). On the basis of this triangular relation, we empirically analyse how and to what extent peripherality and inequality affect the income levels in LACs during 1995 to 2014. We find that LACs exhibit a virtuous cycle between a decrease in inequality and an increase in income levels. We also find that although primary commodity dependence, technological progress, and GVC integration directly increase the income levels, they also indirectly decrease the income levels through increasing inequality. Additionally, the increasing effects on inequality is mitigated if a country is integrated into GVCs with higher levels of technological progress.
O54|Granger causality between exports, economic growth and electricity production: empirical evidence for Latin America|This paper examines the causal short-run and long-run relationship between economic growth, export composition and electricity production using panel cointegration techniques for 14 Latin American countries in the period 1971-2010. The analysis is performed considering first aggregate exports, and then breaking down into 12 industrial sectors to finally take account of the intensive use of technology. The results indicate that long-term economic growth depends on non-technology exports and that policies adversely affecting electricity production do not impact GDP in the short term, but they do in the long run.
O54|Knowledge spillovers from clean and dirty technologies|How much should governments subsidize the development of new clean technologies? We use patent citation data to investigate the relative intensity of knowledge spillovers in clean and dirty technologies in two technological fields: energy production and transportation. We introduce a new methodology that takes into account the whole history of patent citations to capture the indirect knowledge spillovers generated by patents. We find that conditional on a wide range of potential confounding factors clean patents receive on average 43% more citations than dirty patents. Knowledge spillovers from clean technologies are comparable in scale to those observed in the IT sector. The radical novelty of clean technologies relative to more incremental dirty inventions seems to account for their superiority. Our results can support public support for clean R&D. They also suggest that green policies might be able to boost economic growth through induced knowledge spillovers.

O54|The Rise and Fall (?) of a New Developmental State in Brazil|We investigate the most recent experiment of the state-led development approach in Brazil, and reveal some of its merits and shortcomings in the light of the current difficulties of the country. Using institutional and political economy approach we argue that under the Lula administration (2003–2010) a special economic policy mix has emerged, which although maintained some continuity with both the old Brazilian developmental state and the neoliberal reform period, can be regarded as a new model of developmental state (DS) in Brazil. The way how Brazil has achieved pro-poor and inclusive growth since the Millennium offers useful lessons for other emerging and developing countries. At the same time, economic and social processes of the last 4-5 years have highlighted the fragility of the new Brazilian developmental state model and finally led to its dismantling (while even raising questions whether it can be regarded as a DS at all).
O54|Economic mobility along the business cycle. The case of Peru| The performance of Latin American countries in reducing poverty and expanding the middle class has been remarkable. By taking a close look at the Peruvian experience, we examine how this aggregate behavior relates to business cycle conditions and whether different population groups share this behavior. We find that social mobility is cyclical; it decreases in recessions but increases with strong economic growth. The reduction in poverty in Peru appears to be the result of a sustained increase in the poverty exit rate together with a prolonged decrease in the poverty entry rate. These results hold among heterogeneous groups and are particularly marked for households regarded as initially disadvantaged.
O54|Internet and enterprise productivity: evidence from Latin America|This paper tests three hypotheses regarding the link between internet and firm productivity: i) internet adoption and use constitute a source of productivity growth for firms in Latin America, ii) the intensity of its use also matters, and iii) the link between the new technologies and productivity levels is not uniform over the whole productivity distribution. The evidence in this paper fills the gap of scarce and fragmented literature focused on Latin America, and is aligned with previous research for more developed regions which has generally recognized that Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have radically changed how modern business are conducted, benefitting firm performances through several channels, such as increasing the efficiency of internal processes, expanding market reach or increasing innovation. Our findings suggest that low-medium productive firms benefit more from an expansion in internet adoption and use, in comparison with the most productive ones. If this evidence is supposed to reflect long-term effects, then public policies oriented to massify internet adoption and promote internet use intensively will surely contribute to reduce inequalities of enterprise’s productivity levels, promoting a level playing field among Latin American firms, something especially relevant for the most unequal region of the world.
O54|Does Foreign Trade Facilitation Improve Firms’ Export Performance? A Microeconomic Analysis of Chilean Manufacturing Plants|This paper constructs sector-level measures of trade facilitation in foreign countries to examine the effect of reducing the costs required to import abroad on export activity of Chilean plants. The results show that decreases in the number of documents required to import and in the number of days required to import in international markets significantly increase the probability of exporting of Chilean plants, while a decrease in the number of documents required to import increases plants’ export intensity. The estimates also show that the effect of improved foreign trade facilitation is larger in sectors with relatively low foreign tariffs.
O54|Fondo de Tierras del Acuerdo Agrario de la Habana: Estimaciones y propuestas alternativas|El primer punto del Acuerdo de La Habana [y del Teatro Colón], “Hacia un nuevo campo colombiano: una reforma rural integral”, promueve la asignación de tierras a familias campesinas que carecen de tierra o tienen tierra insuficiente. Para esto, propone la creación de un Fondo de Tierras, que será destinado a la adjudicación de tierras, y la formalización de la propiedad. Tres son los objetivos de este documento. Primero, el documento realiza un análisis histórico de los procesos de adjudicación de tierras emprendidos por el Estado colombiano desde finales del siglo XIX hasta hoy. Segundo, estima la oferta de tierras disponible para alcanzar los objetivos del Acuerdo Agrario. Tercero, hace una exploración tentativa de la demanda potencial de tierras. El total de hectáreas potencialmente disponibles para el Fondo de Tierras es 2.7 millones. Tras añadir los baldíos y otras tierras de dominio estatal adjudicables, la oferta de tierras podría incrementar entre 3.9 y 5.3 millones hectáreas. La formalización de predios restituidos a la población desplazada podría alcanzar 4.6 millones de hectáreas. Al añadir las tres fuentes, la asignación de tierras en el marco del acuerdo agrario podría ascender entre 11.2 y 12.6 millones de hectáreas.
O54|Concentración económica y comercio internacional. La condición Marshall-Lerner en la Argentina (1993-2013)|El presente artículo estudia los efectos de la concentración económica en la pérdida de sensibilidad de la balanza comercial a las variaciones del tipo de cambio real (TCR). Para esto se analizan los flujos comerciales de la Argentina (1993-2013), con el doble objetivo de, por un lado, identificar el cumplimiento de la condición Marshall-Lerner (CML) y, por otro, determinar la influencia de la concentración económica sobre la misma. Los resultados alcanzados muestran que los movimientos del TCR no generan cambios significativos en la balanza comercial. Sin embargo, cuando se aíslan los efectos directos e indirectos de la concentración económica, la balanza comercial aumenta su sensibilidad al TCR y se cumple la CML. ***** This paper analyses the effects that economic concentration on trade balance sensitivity has on changes in the Real Exchange Rate (RER). It uses Argentinian trade flows statistical data over the 1993-2013 period, with the dual purpose of identifying whether the Marshall- Lerner Condition (MLC) is met as well as the impacts of economic concentration on it. The evidence showed that RER movements do not generate significant changes in the trade balance; however, when the direct and indirect effects of the economic concentration are isolated, the sensitivity to RER increases and the MLC is met.
O54|De los rendimientos crecientes a la teoría de los sectores líderes: una relación entre los trabajos del profesor L. Currie y A. Young|Este artículo presenta una revisión comparativa de la teoría del crecimiento propuesta por Allyn Young en la que se destacan los rendimientos crecientes y la teoría del crecimiento sobre los sectores líderes propuesta por Lauchlin Currie. El artículo busca encontrar la relación entre ambos planteamientos teóricos para mostrar cómo uno depende del otro. Adicionalmente, se presenta una aplicación de la teoría del sector líder a Colombia y se concluye elucidando la fuerte relación teórica entre los autores. Se recalca la importancia histórica que tuvo la aplicación de las teorías del profesor Currie en Colombia.
O54|Parental depressive symptoms and the child labor-schooling nexus: evidence from Mexico|Research in psychology has suggested that parental depression translates into bad parenting and worsened behavioral outcomes for children. In this article, I look at the e ect of depression on child education and labor outcomes in Mexico. Using a rich panel data set and making use of violent assault as a source of exogenous variation in depressive symptoms, I estimate the impact of a shock to parents' mental health on a series of child outcomes. The ndings suggest that worsened parental mental health increases the probability of grade repetition and market work for children. The e ects are not driven by those children whose parents had the worst mental health status at the onset of the survey, and are robust to alternative speci - cations. Given the documented extensive underutilization of mental health services in Mexico, public interventions in this domain have the potential to come with positive externalities and be cost-ecient.
O54|Sex, violence, and drugs among Latin American and Caribbean adolescents: Do engaged parents make a difference?|This paper uses data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey to investigate the prevalence of health risk behaviors—in particular, substance use, risky sexual behavior, and violence—among adolescents in 15 Latin American and Caribbean countries. Using logit regressions and meta-analysis, we find that having parents engaged in raising their children is associated with significantly reduced problem behaviors in adolescents. That said, in the Caribbean the prevalence of health risk behaviors in adolescents is higher and engaged parents is lower than in Latin America, and the correlation between engaged parenting and reduced risk behaviors is generally weaker. Nonetheless, for both subgroups of countries, engaged parents do appear to make a difference.
O54|Financial literacy among Mexican high school teenagers|Financial literacy has become an increasingly important ability in today’s complex world. Young people are among the least financially literate demographic groups. In this paper we present the results of a financial literacy survey conducted among high school students in Mexico City, the first effort to measure financial literacy among teenagers in Mexico. The survey is based upon the instruments developed by OECD and Lusardi and Mitchell’s approach. Our results show low levels of financial literacy: 60% of the students surveyed understood the concept of inflation, 34.1% correctly answered the question about risk diversification, and only 31.7% correctly answered the question about compound interest. The OECD questions showed that less than 1 in 5 students understands basic financial concepts, around 57% get high scores on financial behavior, and about 70% have positive financial attitudes. We did not find generalized gender differences, though women score a bit higher on the OECD measure mostly due to a better financial behavior. We also did not find differences between private and public schools, or by household income.
O54|International spillovers from Euro area and US credit and demand shocks: A focus on emerging Europe|In this paper, we examine the international effects of contractions in loan supply, loan demand and aggregate demand in the euro area and the USA. All three shocks have been at the forefront in spreading stress during the period of the global financial crisis and in particular so to countries that are strongly integrated with the euro area. We find that these shocks decrease international output and total credit to a varying degree. Loan demand and aggregate demand shocks in the euro area trigger significant negative spillovers on output in most other regions. Evidence for global negative output effects of euro area loan supply shocks is fraught with considerable estimation uncertainty. When these three types of shocks emanate from the USA, we find significant negative spillovers on output also for loan supply shocks. In general, international effects on total credit are an order of magnitude larger than those on output, with again more evidence that is significant for US than euro area shocks. Last, and taking a regional stance, our results indicate that economies from emerging Europe are most vulnerable to all shocks considered. Through their strong economic integration with the euro area, these economies are likewise exposed to euro area and US shocks, and spillover effects are often larger than the domestic response in the country of shock-origin.
O54|The Performance of VAT in DGD-partner countries|This study presents a case study on the value added-tax (VAT) with the objective to design appropriate policies aiming to improve domestic-resource mobilization in developing countries. Data from 18 DGD-partner countries (past and present) over the 1990-2012 period show that, although the performance of VAT has inproved in recent years, many of these countries can close their resource gap by implementing reforms that improve the efficiency of their VAT system. We present an in-depth analysis on Bolivia to illustrate how such reforms could be designed. Bolivia is also an interesting case since the country was one of the first developing countries to adopt VAT in a context characterized by socio-economic and political challenges. We argue that the credibility of the Bolivian government as well as the institutional design of its tax system were very important for the success of their tax reforms. Moreover, we show that the improvement of both the policy and compliance gaps have contributed to the reduction of Bolivia’s VAT gap in recent years, but improvements in compliance gap are the main deriver.
O54|Targeted Remedial Education: Experimental Evidence from Peru|An outstanding challenge in education is improving learning among low-achieving students. We present results from the first randomized experiment of an inquiry-based remedial science-education program for low-performing elementary students in the setting of a developing country. At 48 low-income public elementary schools in Lima, Peru and surrounding areas, third-grade students scoring in the bottom half of their science classes were selected at random to receive up to 16 remedial sessions of 90 minutes each during the school year. Control-group compliance with assignment (no extra tutoring) was close to perfect. Treatment-group compliance was roughly 40 percent, or five to six remedial sessions—a 4 to 5 percent increase in total science instruction time over the school year. Despite the low-intensity treatment, students assigned to the remedial sessions scored 0.12 standard deviations higher on a science endline test. But all improvements were concentrated among boys, for whom gains were 0.22 standard deviations. Remedial education does not produce within-student spillovers to math, or spillovers on other students.
O54|Vulnerability and Clientelism|Political clientelism is often deemed to undermine democratic accountability and representation. This study argues that economic vulnerability causes citizens to participate in clientelism. We test this hypothesis with a randomized control trial that reduced household vulnerability through a development intervention: constructing residential water cisterns in drought-prone areas of Northeast Brazil. This exogenous reduction in vulnerability significantly decreased requests for private benefits from local politicians, especially by citizens likely to be involved in clientelist relationships. We also link program beneficiaries to granular voting outcomes, and show that this reduction in vulnerability decreased votes for incumbent mayors, who typically have more resources to engage in clientelism. Our evidence points to a persistent reduction in clientelism, given that findings are observed not only during an election campaign, but also a full year later.
O54|The Social Implications of Sugar: Living Costs, Real Incomes and Inequality in Jamaica c1774|This paper provides the first quantitative assessment of Jamaican standards of living and income inequality around 1774. To this purpose we compute welfare ratios for a range of occupations and build a social table. We find that the slave colony had extremely high living costs, which rose steeply during the American War of Independence, and low standards of living, particularly for its enslaved population. Our results also show that due to its extreme poverty surrounding extreme wealth Jamaica was the most unequal place in the pre-modern world. Furthermore, all of these characteristics applied to the free population alone.
O54|Wealthier, Happier and More Self-Sufficient: When Anti-Poverty Programs Improve Economic and Subjective Wellbeing at a Reduced Cost to Taxpayers|We document how an anti-poverty program improves economic and subjective wellbeing, and self-sufficiency. Familias en Accion Urbano, a conditional cash transfer program implemented at scale in the country of Colombia, uses a means-test cutoff score selection rule that provides exogenous variation in program participation. We reproduce the score assignment rule in a nationally representative living standards household survey that measures multiple dimensions of economic and evaluative wellbeing. Three years into the program, beneficiary households at the margin report greater income, consumption and formal employment participation for both the household head and partner. Household income increased by ten times the amount of the government transfer, likely because of gains in formal employment. Beneficiary households at the margin also report greater overall satisfaction with life, greater happiness and greater satisfaction with food. These results support the hypothesis that among households with basic unmet needs, policies that have a permanent impact on income and consumption may also have a lasting impact on subjective wellbeing and self-sufficiency. Moreover, relatively small subsidies, further offset by additional government tax receipt, may generate substantial benefits to poor families at a reduced cost to taxpayers.
O54|Macroeconomic impacts of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti|Abstract In this paper, we use the synthetic control method to estimate the macroeconomic losses from the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, one of the most severe natural disasters in the modern era. The macroeconomic effects of the earthquake were equal to an average loss of up to 12% of gross domestic product over the period 2010–2015. While surges in imports and foreign aid supported a temporary increase in aggregate consumption, aggregate investment and services sector output experienced large contractions. The road transport sector was severely affected. Impacts on electricity use have been less pronounced. The data suggest that macroeconomic losses may be permanent. The earthquake is thus a case of an extreme natural disaster contributing to divergence in development outcomes.
O54| Crecimiento y desindustrialización prematura en Perú. Un análisis kaldoriano| El objetivo de este estudio es mostrar si la industria manufacturera peruana mantiene su liderazgo en el proceso de crecimiento económico y en el aumento de la productividad del trabajo, después de veinticinco años de reformas y política neoliberales. El enfoque del trabajo es Kaldoriano-Keynesiano, según el cual el crecimiento económico está determinado fundamentalmente por factores de demanda. Se evalúan estadística y econométricamente las leyes de Kaldor, según las cuales el crecimiento de la manufactura impulsa el crecimiento del PBI, el crecimiento de la productividad laboral en la propia manufactura y en la economía en su conjunto. El período de análisis cubre 65 años de 1950 a 2015, que incorpora tanto el periodo de industrialización dirigida por el Estado como los veinticinco años de neoliberalismo también dirigido por el Estado.

O54|Using your ties to get a worse job? The differential effects of social networks on quality of employment: Evidence from Colombia|This article examines the effect of social networks through the use of family, friends or relatives ties on quality of employment (QoE). Drawing from the socioeconomic literature on social networks and labor market, we propose an original and multidimensional measure of QoE, and a fruitful estimation approach of the effect of social networks on QoE that allows to deal with complex inter-groups heterogeneity. Using the Great Integrated Houshold Survey (GIHS) and a sample on Bogota's workers in 2013, we find evidence proving that the use of ties has high negative effects on QoE index for those who are in the lower quality of employment range. Likewise, the use of social networks has very low negative effects on QoE index for individuals who are in the better quality of employment range. Complemented by focus groups interviews, these empirical results raise questions about the difference prevailing in relational practices between necessity networks for precarious workers and opportunity networks for protected workers.
O54|Forecasting inflation in Latin America with core measures|We explore the ability of core inflation to predict headline CPI annual inflation for a sample of eight developing economies in Latin America over the period January 1995–May 2017. Our in-sample and out-of-sample results are roughly consistent in providing robust evidence of predictability in four of the countries in our sample. Mixed evidence is found for the other four countries. The bulk of the out-of-sample evidence of predictability concentrates on the short horizons of one and six months. In contrast, at the longest horizon of 24 months, we only find out-of-sample evidence of predictability for two countries: Chile and Colombia, with robust results only for the latter. This is both important and challenging, given that the monetary authorities in our sample of developing countries are currently implementing or are taking steps toward the future implementation of inflation targeting regimes, which are based heavily on long-run inflation forecasts.
O54|Are Democratic Regimes Antithetical to Globalization?|In this study we have made an attempt to investigate into the relationship between political regime type (that ranges from authoritarian to democratic) and the extent of globalization, which of late has been considered as a path to development. We have made use of the Democracy index (and its constituent indicators) provided by the Economist Intelligence Unit and the globalization index (and its constituent indicators) of the KOF. Applying canonical correlation analysis on the data we have made an attempt to look into the response of globalization to the quantitative measures of democratic (versus authoritarian) practices of the governments in 116 countries distributed over Asia, Africa, Australia/Oceania, Europe and the Americas. We have also tested the Lee thesis in the context of globalization as a path to development. Our findings indicate that the empirical support to Lee’s thesis if extended to globalization as a path to development is superficial and does not withstand critical analysis. Contrary to Lee’s thesis, democracy promotes globalization. In African countries political discordance (at the national as well as international level) is not much favourable while in the Asian countries, political will, irrespective of regime type, is more or less in concordance with globalization. Therefore, rather illusively, it so appears that democracies thwart development as well as globalization as a means to development by implication, while the reality is very different.
O54|Aggregate Consequences of Dynamic Credit Relationships|I investigate the aggregate consequences of canonical financial frictions in the supply of credit to firms: private information and limited enforcement. I propose a general equilibrium model in which entrepreneurs finance their firm through a long-term contract with a financial intermediary. The contract is inefficient because firm cash flow is costly to monitor and borrowers that repudiate cannot be excluded from capital markets. By investing in enforcement capacity, an intermediary can delay debt repayment and maintain incentive compatibility. Reforms that seek to decrease the cost of monitoring or enforcing contracts, or both, affect firm dynamics and can generate complementaries. Estimating the model with data on Colombian manufacturing firms in the 1980s and 1990s, I find that financial frictions are responsible for a significant aggregate output loss. Most of this distortion can be attributed to private information. Reforms that only reduce private information create significant economic growth and welfare gains, while those that only improve enforcement do not. There are significant complementarities between different types of reforms, as moral hazard is less significant when contracts are more enforceable. (Copyright: Elsevier)
O54|Small and medium cities and development of Mexican rural areas|Like the rest of Latin America, Mexico is a highly-urbanized country. Yet rural populations, geographies and economic activities continue to play a significant role in national development, while there are persistent and large rural-urban inequalities in well-being and opportunities. Promoting rural-urban linkages has been proposed as a strategy to reduce spatial inequalities, but there is much academic and policy debate about whether urban development has positive (spread) or negative (backwash) effects on rural development. This could translate into synergistic or predatory urban-rural linkages. This study examines how proximity to cities, and population and per capita income in cities, affect population growth and welfare in rural places in Mexico. Using data for 2000 and 2010, our findings include: (a) 75% of rural people live within 90 min of an urban area, and 60% within 60 min; (b) proximity to a city increases rural population growth and welfare; (c) adverse (backwash) effects on rural areas due to increases in urban per capita income are very small and of no economic significance; (d) cities with populations in the 350,000–500,000 range appear to have more positive effects on rural areas than smaller or larger cities; (e) rural localities interact with multiple urban places simultaneously.
O54|The rise and fall of the Brazilian economy (2004-2015): the economic antimiracle|The aim of this paper is to interpret the recent trajectory of the Brazilian economy, from around 2004 to 2015, focusing on the interaction between demand, income distribution, and the productive structure. An interpretative hypothesis is formulated within a framework that combines an effective demand schedule from the Kaleckian growth and distribution literature and a distributive schedule of Goodwin heritage (following Taylor, 2004, and Barbosa-Filho and Taylor, 2006). Such hypothesis indicates the determinants of the growth acceleration and of the increase of the wage share on income that started around 2004, as well as the determinants of their later reversal. Then, the framework is modified to incorporate sectoral heterogeneity, as suggested by Rugitsky (2016), and a modified hypothesis points out that a cumulative process involving reductions of wage inequality and changes of the productive structure may explain part of the recent Brazilian trajectory. Both hypotheses are examined empirically. The contrast of the cumulative process suggested with the one that seems to have taken place during Brazil’s “economic miracle” (1968-1973) allows it to be called an economic antimiracle.
O54|Do Good Job Conditions Matter for Wages and Productivity? Theory and Evidence from Latin America|Abstract Based on Akerlof and Kranton (2005) In Journal of Economic Perspectives, 19(1), 9–32, who argue that group identity and social norms influence individual preferences towards work effort, a model is developed to understand why firms create good job conditions, taking into account the cost of implementing them and their impact on wages and productivity. Then, using individual-level data from the Gallup World Poll for 18 Latin American countries, the main predictions of the model are tested using propensity score matching. We find a positive link between good job conditions and wages when there are several simultaneous signals of a good work environment. We conclude that there is a positive payoff of investing in good job conditions for both workers and firms.
O54|Changes in rural poverty in Perú 2004–2012|Abstract This paper disaggregates the various sources of rural income growth in Peru between 2004 and 2012 and shows that about 80% of the increase came from rising earnings and only 15% from transfer programs. This increase in rural earnings was not led by agriculture. It was mainly because of a general rise in wages across industrial and services activities within the rural population, coupled with a massive movement of the better educated from the rural to the urban areas of the Sierra and Selva. Rapid overall growth rate of the economy permitted an increase in average wages both in the urban receiving areas and for the smaller labor force left behind in the rural sector. In analyzing changes in poverty over time, it is important to distinguish what happens to a given age cohort from changes in the income of different deciles of the distribution. The paper creates a quasi-panel by equivalent cohort. The panel shows that first, there was tremendous progress made in rural poverty reduction among those who were poor in 2004. That is true in both the rural and urban sectors. There were 6.3 million rural poor in 2004. 46% of them or almost three million got out of poverty over the period. Second, it is instructive that 62% of the group that got out of poverty stayed in the rural sector. In other words, almost two thirds of rural poverty reduction was due to increases in rural family income not rural–urban migration. Third, among the rural poor, it was the young who migrated—64% of total rural–urban migration of the poor came from the 0–25 cohort even though it comprised less than 60% of the rural poverty population in 2004.
O54|Defence expenditure and economic growth in Latin American countries: evidence from linear and nonlinear causality tests|Abstract Using SIPRI’s new consistent database on military expenditures, the paper examines the economic effects of such spending in the case of the 13 Latin American countries. Employing both linear and nonlinear tests, the nexus between defence spending, economic growth, and investment is investigated for the period 1961–2014. Findings reported herein are not uniformed across all countries included in the sample. However, as a broad tentative generalization, they seem to be pointing to the absence of a strong and robust nexus between the variables examined.
O54|The relationship between Ecuador and China: a dangerous alliance?|The aim of this paper is to outline the relationship between Ecuador and China by highlighting the main threats for the development of the Ecuadorian Republic, in particular how it will affect the implementation of the buen vivir, the new economic paradigm experimented in the Latin American State, if it does not change the terms of affair with the Asian giant. The paper is structured as follows: in the introduction, we will present an overview on the historical framework of the relationships of China with Ecuador. Later there will be an analysis supported by data on the commercial situation between the two countries, and its implication over the development of the Latin American state. Finally, some final remarks will present the possible paths that Ecuador can follow to secure its way to development. With this, we will highlight under which conditions Ecuador and China can cooperate while avoiding a state of dependency.
O54|Green-oriented Knowledge Transfers in global markets: technologies, capabilities, institutions|The development of green technologies represents a key driver in the transition towards environmentally sustainable societies. Among environmental challenges, the implementation of national climate policies and international efforts to face the threat of climate change has been particularly effective at triggering the production of climate-friendly innovation in developed countries. This effectiveness has been acknowledged by several studies which observed that, for example, the production of patents related to renewable energy technologies has sharply increased over the last decades. However, the battle against climate change is far from being over. As the share of greenhouse gases emissions in developing countries is sharply growing, how to promote the transfer of available green technologies to these countries is one of the main challenges that policymakers are facing in recent years. Understanding the mechanisms behind technology transfer of “environmental” knowledge and how such transfer happens among countries with heterogeneous economic conditions and different capabilities is a complex exercise. In this report we provide an overview of the literature on green knowledge transfer and, more importantly, on how such literature can be strengthened to deepen the understanding of the interactions that are at stake. The conceptual analysis is aimed at offering a platform to set in-field projects with stakeholders (research/business oriented), to concretely implement the elaboration and general best practice identification for knowledge and technology transfers in the green economy transition.
O54|Vulnerability and Clientelism|This study argues that economic vulnerability causes citizens to participate in clientelism, a phenomenon with various pernicious consequences. We employ a randomized control trial that reduced household vulnerability through a development intervention: constructing residential water cisterns in drought-prone areas of Brazil. This intervention significantly decreased requests for private goods from politicians, especially among citizens likely to be in clientelist relationships. We also link program beneficiaries to electronic voting machines, and show the intervention decreased votes for incumbent mayors, who typically have more resources for clientelism. Findings are observed not only during the election campaign, but also a full year later.
O54|Labour income inequality in Mexico: Puzzles solved and unsolved|We analyse the evolution and proximate determinants of labour income inequality in Mexico between 1989 and 2017. Labour income inequality increased between 1989 and 1994 and declined between 1994 and 2006. What happened after 2006 is subject to uncertainty. The national labour force survey shows a steady decline and the income expenditure survey suggests that inequality increased. We correct for high and rising item (labour income) non-response and underrepresentation of high-wage earners through a ‘hot deck’ imputation method and post-survey weight adjustments. We obtain the new weights for formal workers from tabulations recently released by the Mexican social security administration. For informal workers, we correct using the hot deck imputation method. With corrected data, inequality no longer declines between 2006 and 2017.
O54|Is There Gender Bias Among Voters ?Evidence from the Chilean Congressional Elections|I exploit the unique institution of gender-segregated voting booths in Chile, allowingthe use of actual voting data, instead of self-reported surveys, to test for genderbias among voters. Overall I find evidence of a small but significant negative genderbias: women overall are less likely than men to vote for female candidates. The effect ismainly driven by center-right voters. Selection, candidates’ quality and districts’ characteristicsdo not explain away the results. This evidence does not question whetherfemale leaders have an effect on economic outcomes, but rather the mechanism throughwhich this effect takes place.
O54|Socio-Economic Determinants of Hunger in Latin American Countries|This paper studies the influence of socio-economic variables on hunger prevalence in 18 Latin American countries using the database of Latinobarometro survey, developed by Latinobarometro Corporation. With this objective we estimate an ordered probit model. The results show that on average, only 52% of respondents indicated that they had never experienced lack of enough food in the last 12 months, which suggests that hunger is still a relevant problem in the region. Large heterogeneity across countries was found. Although the percentage of people who often experienced lack of food only corresponded to 2% for the countries in the southern part of Latin America (Uruguay, Chile, Argentina and Brazil), it reached values higher than 10% for several countries in Central and North America (Honduras, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Mexico). These results indicate the need to implement public policies aimed at improving access to enough food in Latin America in order to achieve the goal of eradicating hunger by 2025 (FAO, 2015b).
O54|Opening and linking up: Firms, global value chains and productivity in Latin America|This work explores the relationship between exports, Global Value Chains' (GVCs) participation and position, and firms' productivity. To this aim, we combine the most recent World Bank Enterprise Survey in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries with the OECD-WTO trade in value added data. To explore the above relationship we adopt an extended version of the standard Cobb-Douglas output function including indicators of export performance and GVCs. We control for heterogeneity among firms (by country, region, and industry), sample selection, firms' characteristics and reverse causality. Our empirical outcomes confirm the presence of a positive relationship between participation in international activities and firm performance. They also show that both participation in GVCs and position within GVCs matter. These findings have strong policy implications and may help policymakers in choosing the best policy options to enhance the link between GVCs integration and firms' productivity.
O54|Financial mechanism to invest in knowledge from natural resource revenues: Experiences from Bolivia, Chile, Colombia and Peru|In resource-rich emerging countries, management of revenues from natural resources (NR) plays a critical role in transforming their economies. In this paper, a conceptual framework is constructed for an institution to promote the economic diversification through investing in knowledge, based on the literature from management of natural resources, industrial policy and public management. Existing financial mechanisms in Bolivia, Chile, Colombia and Peru, where NR revenues are invested in knowledge to enhance productivity (natural resources for knowledge, or NR4K funds), are examined applying the framework. The analysis identified that NR4K in these countries currently fall short of achieving their intended purpose of transitioning their economies toward increased diversification. These require complementary public policies to enhance capabilities, coordinate between stakeholders and initiate experimental investments.
O54|Labour income inequality in Mexico: Puzzles solved and unsolved|We analyze the evolution and proximate determinants of labour income inequality in Mexico between 1989 and 2017. Labour income inequality increased between 1989 and 1994 and declined between 1994 and 2006. What happened after 2006 is subject to uncertainty. The national labour force survey shows a steady decline and the income expenditure survey suggests that inequality increased. We correct for high and rising item (labour income) non-response and under-representation of high-wage earners through a 'hot deck' imputation method and post-survey weight adjustments. We obtain the new weights for formal workers from tabulations recently released by the Mexican social security administration. For informal workers, we correct using the hot deck imputation method. With corrected data, inequality no longer declines between 2006 and 2017.
O54|Global and domestic inequalities and the political economy of the midde-income trap|Some middle-income economies, many of which Latin American, have not achieved to make the transition into high-income status for long years and are allegedly trapped in middle-income status. While there is considerable consensus on the proximate causes of this phenomenon, we present a global political economy perspective to the discussion, arguing that global and domestic inequalities, both political and economic, are key to understand the issue. We subject our argument to empirical scrutiny, using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on data spanning the years 1976-2009. Both domestic economic equality and political independence from the influence of an external power turn out to be robust characteristics supporting growth convergence of middle-income countries.
O54|Active Labour Market Programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean: Evidence from a Meta Analysis|We present a systematic collection and assessment of impact evaluations of active labour market programmes (ALMP) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The paper delineates the strategy to compile a novel meta database and provides a narrative review of 51 studies. Based on these studies, the quantitative analysis extracts a sample of 296 impact estimates, and uses meta regression models to analyse systematic patterns in the data. In addition to analysing earnings and employment outcomes as in previous meta analyses, we also code and investigate measures of job quality, such as the effects on hours worked and formality. We find that ALMPs in LAC are particularly effective in increasing the probability of having a formal job, compared to other outcomes. Our results also show that training programmes are slightly more effective than other types of interventions. Moreover, when looking at the sample of training programmes alone, we observe that formal employment is also the outcome category that is most likely to be impacted positively by these programmes. In terms of targeting, we find that ALMPs in the region work better for women than for men, and for youth compared to prime-age workers. Finally, medium-run estimates are not more likely to be positive than short-run estimates, while programmes of short duration (4 months or less) are significantly less likely to produce positive effects compared to longer interventions.
O54|Inflation and hyperinflation in Venezuela (1970s-2016): A post-Keynesian interpretation|This paper aims to explain the causes of rapidly increasing prices in Venezuela and establish whether the current episode can be considered to be of hyperinflationary nature from the post-Keynesian theoretical approach. The chosen approach highlights the role of distributive conflict, indexation mechanism, balance of payments constraint, devaluation expectations and gradual rejection of national currency in favour of foreign currency. We argue that the root cause of the precarious economic situation in Venezuela lies in the long term failure to implement structural changes, ensuring industrial diversification and lessening the dependency on oil exports. The symptoms of the Dutch disease are observed in the prolonged currency overvaluation during the high oil revenue periods. In the face of a growing external constraint, the authorities introduce severe foreign currency rationing. This in turn ignites inflation due to external bottlenecks since many sectors face supply constraints as they depend on imports of inputs of production. This leads to a regressive distribution of income, which contributes to the growing distributive conflict and fuels inflation further, as workers oppose to the lowering of real wages. Moreover, the currency rationing puts pressure on the black market for exchange as the devaluation expectations increase, leading to a parallel market devaluation-inflation spiral, which threatens to turn into hyperinflation. Nevertheless, we argue that hyperinflation, according to the proposed post-Keynesian framework (the flight to foreign currency), does not materialise despite skyrocketing prices because of the particular institutional setting - the exchange controls, which have been in place since 2003, prevent full currency substitution.
O54|Decentralization and poverty reduction in Bolivia: Challenges and opportunities|This paper presents an analysis of the decentralization process that has been taking place in Bolivia over the last couple of decades. It starts with a review of the legal framework that determines the distribution of responsibilities and financial resources to the sub-national governments (9 departments and 339 municipalities), and continues with an analysis of the evolution and distribution of financing to these entities between 2001 and 2013. It then proceeds to describe the resulting progress in social indicators between 2001 and 2012 at the municipal level, and identifies the main remaining gaps in basic services by 2012. Finally, the paper offers an analysis of the factors that are most closely associated with progress in the main social indicator used by the Bolivian government – the Unsatisfied Basic Needs index. This provides the basis for a final section on recommendations for public investment in Bolivia.
O54|Strategic Interactions in Migration Decisions in Rural Mexico| Given the economic significance of migration and its relevance for policy, it is important to understand the factors that cause people to migrate. We add to the literature on the determinants of migration by examining whether strategic interactions matter for migration decisions. There are several reasons why a household's migration decisions may depend on the migration decisions of its neighbors, including migration networks and information externalities. Using instrumental variables to address the endogeneity of neighbors' decisions, we empirically examine whether strategic interactions in migration decisions actually take place in rural Mexico, whether the interactions depend on the size of the village, and whether there are nonlinearities in the strategic interactions. Our results show that there is a significant and positive own migration strategic effect. In our base case specification, an increase of 0.1 in the fraction of neighbors with new migration to the US increases a household's probability of new migration to the US by around 13 percentage points, while an increase of 0.1 in the fraction of neighbors with new migration to other states within Mexico increases a household's probability of migration to other states within Mexico by around 9.5 percentage points. We also find that strategic interactions vary non-linearly with village size.
O54|Decomposing the Gender Wealth Gap in Ecuador|Unlike the gender earnings gap that has been amply studied, the gender wealth gap has only recently begun to receive attention. Studies of the gender wealth gap have been concentrated on developed countries and have been limited by the use of household-level data. Using individual-level and sex-disaggregated wealth data for Ecuador, this paper examines the pattern of wealth inequality across genders, at different points of the wealth distribution, for sole and then partnered household heads. We use a new Oaxaca-Blinder-type decomposition method based on unconditional quantile regression to investigate the sources of the gap at different quantiles. Our results show that among sole heads the gap favors men across the distribution and is largest at the lower tail. Among partnered heads, the gap is much less pronounced throughout the distribution, actually reverting at the lower tail. For both sole and partnered heads, at the lower tail of the distribution, the gender gap is primarily associated with differing returns to covariates. At the median and upper quantiles, gender differences in endowments (ownership of savings accounts, education, and age) drive the gap. Gender bias in inheritance plays a significant role only at lower and median wealth levels. Overall, our results show stark contrasts with results for developed countries and important differences between sole versus partnered heads. Our study also adds evidence to the long-standing debate over whether female household heads are poorer than male heads and calls for the pursuit of wealth-differentiated policies and social programs to increase women’s participation in the formal economy, as well as the returns to their participation.
O54|Produtividade Agrícola nos Países da América Latina| This article studies the total factor productivity (TFP) in agriculture from 19 countries in Latin America in the period from 1961 to 2010. In the analysis of the countries’ economic performance, the parametric approach to stochastic frontier production is used. It is observed that all countries had positive TFP change in the period from 1961 to 2010, which showed product growth as well as positive technical progress.

O54|The costs of resource-led development. An analysis of the economic impact of the oil extraction boom in Colombia|Oil-rich countries often face negative consequences of natural resources-led development on their overall economic performance. One of the reasons is that a country’s rising extraction rates frequently lead to various changes in its public policy and revenue management. Colombia has spectacularly increased its oil production by almost 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in ten years, which was the effect principally of the implementation of strongly market-oriented petroleum policies in 2003. It is now the fourth largest crude producer in Latin America, registering nearly ten times more export sales than at the end of the 20th century. The economic effects of the oil-boom are already visible, which has created many new challenges the government must face in order to ensure sustainable development in the country, and to be able to mitigate the impact of the recently dropping world oil prices. The purpose of the article is to present the latest findings on the impact of the oil sector development on the Colombian economy in the 21st century, focusing especially on the current situation.
O54|Restructuring the Economic Policy Framework in Brazil: Genuine or Gattopardo change?|We analyzed Brazil’s development since World War II and especially Presidents Lula and Rousseff’s economic policy by integrating historical and political economy approaches using the concept of “development convention”. Two development conventions have been struggling for hegemony: a pro-growth – state led and a pro-stability – free market convention. Until the 1970s, the “developmentalist” convention was dominant. During the 1980s, a stability convention started to ascend; the rise of neoliberalism reinforced the precedence of stability over growth. In 1999, the macroeconomic tripod – inflation targeting; floating exchange rate; and budget surplus targeting – aligned with the New Consensus on Macroeconomics was adopted. As we argued, it locked economy into a trap: low growth; high interest rates; relatively high inflation; and overvalued currency. Since the 2008 Great Crisis, economic policy has been changing in an attempt to foster growth. For orthodox economists, the tripod was marred or dropped and replaced by a Keynesian policy. For Keynesians, it was hold; it is as if the change had just been a Gattopardo change, a “change that keeps things the same”.

Actualmente no existe un consenso respecto a la relación entre crecimiento y desigualdad. Sin embargo, sí existe evidencia que el crecimiento reduce la desigualdad de oportunidades. Por ello, el objetivo de la investigación es determinar si la reducción de la desigualdad de oportunidades ha sido mayor que la reducción de la desigualdad. La metodología también permite identificar los grupos más perjudicados por sus circunstancias y si el perjuicio se reduce con el tiempo o los ingresos. Se encuentra evidencia que la desigualdad de oportunidades se redujo más que la desigualdad observada, es decir, las circunstancias de los individuos explican una menor proporción de la variabilidad de sus ingresos. Este resultado se debe principalmente a la reducción de las brechas de ingresos según género y lengua materna. Sin embargo, otras circunstancias como educación de la madre y lugar de nacimiento han mantenido su importancia. Inclusive, a medida que los ingresos se incrementan la brecha según educación de la madre se amplia.

This is because it combines mobile growth factors due to regional reallocation of economic activity and, on the other hand, the fact that factors that are considered immobile in the literature such as education, infrastructure and specialization were initially localised in Central Mexico. We show that, throughout this period, in the Northern Border the accumulation of immobile factors and the efficiency in its advantage have been determining factors in its economic growth.******En este artículo analizamos la dinámica y los determinantes del desempeño de la productividad laboral de los estados de la Frontera Norte después de 20 años de liberalización comercial de México con Estados Unidos a fin de contribuir a la identificación de los hechos estilizados de este proceso en la literatura de crecimiento económico regional. El análisis del desempeño productivo en la Frontera Norte mexicana ofrece un interesante caso para ese objetivo mientras combina los factores de crecimiento móviles debido a la reasignación de actividad económica y, por otro lado, el hecho de los factores que en la literatura se consideran relativamente inmóviles, tales como educación, infraestructura y especialización, que inicialmente se localizaban en el centro del país. Como conclusión, mostramos que a lo largo del periodo, en la Frontera Norte, la acumulación de factores relativamente inmóviles de crecimiento y la eficiencia en su aprovechamiento han sido determinantes en su crecimiento económico.

Nonetheless, this correlation could be conditioned by other variables such as state presence. This article uses a quasiexperimental approach allowed by the delineation of collective land tenure in the Colombian Pacific and tries to capture how the tenure differences that this delineation creates can affect the economic activity. Private tenure does not have a significant effect, as it is commonly assumed. However, this non-significant effect does not hold when observations are near to a state or colonial capital, suggesting an equilibrium between historical persistence and discontinuity.
O54|The Evolution of Gender and Racial Occupational Segregation Across Formal and Non‐Formal Labor Markets in Brazil, 1987 to 2006|This study provides a unique analysis of the evolution of gender and racial occupational segregation in Brazil covering the period from 1987 to 2006. Employing a newly harmonized occupational classification, it provides new insights into the nature and evolution of occupational segregation and on the forces driving these changes over this period of time. Three major findings emerge. First, gender segregation is always greater than racial segregation, but the latter has been more persistent over time. Second, segregation has declined mainly in the formal labor market. Third, this decline has been mainly driven by changes in gender and racial composition within occupations.

Their insertion into the international division of labour for 15 years is from a reprimarisation of their economies (except Mexico and Central America). That favors a premature deindustrialization, a lethargy of their growth (except for Andean countries). In other words, while the number of Asian economies is towards more industrial density per capita and more industry in GDP (except India) and a strong growth, Latin American countries remain confined to a situation where industrial density increases little and the weight of their industry in GDP has declined. Strange return of history of success and failures, this regression could explain the crisis that these countries are going through today? Classification JEL: F14, F62, F63, O10, O54.

We focus on the seven largest economies of the region. We find that TOT shocks are an important driver of business cycles in the region, explaining on average about 30 percent of cyclical fluctuations in the sample. We also find evidence of a long-run relationship between TOT and aggregate output which, in most countries, also affects the short-run dynamics of output growth. Results vary across countries, suggestive of the heterogeneity of the region in terms of exposure to external shocks and domestic policy frameworks. Classification JEL: E32, F14, O54.
O54|L'Amérique latine dans la globalisation financière : a-t-on appris des crises passées ?|This paper discusses the monetary and exchange policies followed by Latin American countries during the financial crises that have appeared each decade since the beginning of the 1980s. We examine the implications of a phenomenon defined by Reinhart as ?this time is different?. In particular, we report errors in the diagnosis of the structural causes of past financial crises, and the damages caused by the choice of fixed exchange rates. The article also looks at the problems facing the countries today: the resource curse, the dilemma between currency appreciation and financial bubbles, inflation targeting policy. We suggest that governments have learned from past crises, by further anchoring their financial policies to the reality of their economies: the exchange rate regime is no longer the guiding element of inflation policy, loans in local currency have increased due to the rise in domestic bond markets, monetary policies have remained accommodative during the 2008 financial crisis, and central banks have used swap agreements to meet their needs of international currencies.

O54|Panorama des régimes de change en Amérique latine : l’attrait croissant pour les régimes de change flexibles|Most Latin American countries now have floating exchange rates. However, central banks still have the possibility to intervene in the forex market, either directly or through regulations that influence this market. Floating rates have not always been the standard for forex policies. On the contrary, until the early 90s, exchange rates were among the main ?anchors? to fight against inflation, then at very high levels in some countries. These strategies had at best mixed performance; quite often, they induced unbearable external deficits. Then, many central banks, whose independence was established or reinforced, progressively shifted towards ?inflation targeting? strategies, reducing the role of exchange rates and allowing them to float, at least in most large Latin American countries. However, raw material prices fluctuations (first appreciating, then falling) have led many central banks to intervene, sometimes actively, in their foreign exchange market.

The federal spending cap proposal and discussion on social security reform go in the right direction but tax hikes will be probably required. The road to rebalance fiscal accounts will not be easy given the necessity to adopt unpopular measures without growth by a government that was not elected.

O54|Le Mexique à l’heure des réformes structurelles|In 2013, Mexico implemented a comprehensive set of structural reforms aimed at removing the obstacles hindering the economy to renew with growth, in fields as diverse as education, public finance, financial sector, energy and telecommunication. It became therefore one of the few countries to have succeeded in voting such a large number of structural reforms in such a short period of time and accompanied by a broad political support. The reduction of monopolies and oligopolistic organizations that generated inefficiencies and the increase in low-cost access to credit for households and businesses could lead to a rise in Mexico?s potential growth by almost one percentage point. If some of the reforms begin to show their effectiveness, the global positive effects on growth are taking time to appear. This delay is especially long given that reforms did not deal with several roots of the fragility of the Mexican growth model. Paradoxically, the Mexican economy shows strong and sound macroeconomic fundamentals, resilience, and great trade openness but remains poorly inclusive, largely informal with endemic corruption and generates strong geographical and income inequalities.

O54|L’Argentine après le défaut : conditions d’accès aux marchés internationaux de capitaux et choix de politiques économiques « non conventionnelles »|The sovereign default in 2001 has brought about in Argentina an era of convoluted relationships with the international financial markets, characterized by large swings in the orientation of macroeconomic policy-making. Focusing on the determinants of supply and demand for external borrowing, this article shows that the country did have access to international capital markets during some periods, particularly after the debt restructuring agreement of 2005. Furthermore, certain episodes of decline in net capital inflows did not arise from constraints on the supply side, but were the consequence of policy choices: a commitment to reducing outstanding sovereign debt, and the imposition of foreign capital entry regulations. The strengthening of certain ?unconventional? policies since 2011 is certainly explained by foreign currency shortages ? in particular the monetization of fiscal deficits and the imposition of strict foreign exchange controls. Yet, some structural factors have also underlined the domestic authorities? motivations: a quest for autonomy in economic policy through financial autarky, and the ?fear of floating? ? a reluctance to devaluate driven by the potential impact on domestic inflation.

O54|Les économies de l’arc andin face à la faiblesse des cours des matières premières|Since 2012, the economies of the ?Andean arc? (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia) seem to experience a paradigm shift in their economic growth model. Indeed, as a result of the upward momentum in commodity prices in the 2000s, these economies have enjoyed a remarkable cycle of economic growth and, at the same time, a primarization of their external sector. The downward trend in mineral commodity prices starting in 2012, reflecting the onset of the downturn in China, followed by the decline in oil prices since 2014, deteriorated the terms of trade of these economies and thus, affected their economic growth path. However, the resilience of these economies to this shock depends on their intrinsic characteristics. Peru and Colombia appear more resilient, while activity in Bolivia and in particular in Ecuador contracts. These economies are gradually using a policy to change their growth patterns to reduce their dependence on the primary sector. Beyond the voluntariness of the various national authorities, the process of diversification of the growth model remains attached to the comparative advantages of each country and, secondly, to the potential productivity gains.

This paper first examines the distortions and economic imbalances underlying this economy, including hyperinflation, and then assesses the country?s capacity to face the risk of default. To this end, we build two scenarios of financing needs and resources, highly dependent on oil prices and support from China. We thus show that in the absence of a major rebound in oil prices, the default appears inevitable.

China?s appetite for natural resource has been the engine of Latin American growth in the 2000, while Chinese slowing down has contributed to the recent crisis of several Latin American countries. This article begins by an assessment of Chinese economic footprint on Latin American economies: while it is strong in the case of trade and it is rapidly increasing in the case of direct investment as well as in the case of credit with the exception of Venezuela and Ecuador. A second part analyses more thoroughly the impact of the Chinese economy on Brazil. While the surge of exports to China lifted the external constraint on Brazil, the country was unable to make use this lever to transform the production structure. Thus the financial boon provided by Chinese exports was at the root of the crisis Brazilian governments were unable or unwilling to fight.

Accordingly, (consequently?), the development of local currency bond markets stopped in 2012 in Latin America but kept pace in emerging Asia.

We show that even though social security system?s budget was balanced and provisioned by a buffer fund (the FGS) equal to 13% of GDP, the federal government maintained disputes with retirees whose pensions were incorrectly adjusted to inflation between 2002 and 2006. This balanced budget was also attained to the detriment of the provinces, which were deprived of some of their fiscal resources. This reform offers a compensation payment to wronged retirees and gradually gives the provinces back the aforementioned fiscal resources. Its financing relies however on the higher transfers from the Treasury and the FGS that will probably be emptied to fund this reform. Since on top of that a structural reform is meant to take place three years from now, Argentina?s pay-as-you-go pension scheme?s future is today uncertain. Classification JEL: J26, H55, H62, O54.
O54|L’apport des monnaies sociales à la microfinance : le cas des banques communautaires de développement brésiliennes|Since its widespread diffusion in the mid-1990s, microfinance became an important part of poverty reduction strategies. However, the impacts of its main financial technique, microcredit, have been more and more questioned during the last decade. Several limits of this tool have appeared, which even happened to be harmful to those supposed to benefit from it. After an overview of the state of microfinance in Brazil and a review of the limits of the microcredit tool, we focus on a particular adaptation of the microfinance model: the one implemented by the Brazilian community development banks, which are today more than a hundred on the whole Brazilian territory. One of the main innovations of these civil society organizations is to link microcredit to the issuance of a social currency, the use of which - in addition to the Brazilian Real - is confined to the local territory. We highlight the benefits of these currencies and see to which extent they respond to some of the limits of microcredit, through the example of the Palmas Bank, which founded this model of solidarity finance. Not only economic tools but also social constructions, these currencies participate in endogenous development and can be the vehicle for the co-construction of poverty reduction policies.

O54|Long-run determinants of economic growth in South America|Based on an annual historical database for South American countries from 1960 to 2008, we develop an empirical study to gain insight into the long-run determinants of economic growth using a two-equation framework. A system of two panel data models is estimated to identify the growth determinants and their connection with foreign direct investment. We find that economic growth is driven most strongly by physical and human capital accumulation, as well as by sectorial exports, and that institutions and policy have a substantial impact on economic growth and investment. Macroeconomic disturbances have a significant detrimental effect on long-run growth. Trade openness correlates positively with foreign investment, indicating that relatively closed countries stand to benefit most from opening up their economies. Our division of the sample into two sub-periods, 1960–1980 and 1981–2008, indicates a structural change.

O54|La miseria en Colombia|Durante la mayor parte de la historia del país, la mayoría de los colombianos han vivido en pobreza absoluta y han estado atestados de violencia e inseguridad. Mi argumento es que el alcance y la persistencia de la pobreza y la violencia en Colombia son una consecuencia de las facetas extractivas de las instituciones políticas. Estas tienen dos dimensiones principales: la baja calidad de la “democracia que en realidad existe” y la naturaleza “de doble cara” del débil e inefectivo Estado colombiano. Proporciono un análisis de la lógica política que mantiene en su lugar los aspectos extractivos de estas instituciones y cómo estos interactúan como los aspectos incluyentes de las instituciones colombianas. Argumento que las instituciones colombianas lentamente se han tornado menos extractivas con el paso del tiempo, debido a los intentos de las élites por contrarrestar algunas de las contradicciones internas de la coexistencia de las instituciones extractivas e incluyentes. Esto ha resultado en disminuciones de la pobreza y violencia, así como en una modernización gradual del país. Sin embargo, las poderosas fuerzas que han hecho que Colombia siga siendo un país pobre y violento siguen funcionando y reproduciéndose. Planteo cómo podría ser la solución de estos problemas en Colombia.

Results show a convergence process for the 1999-2006 period and statistical evidence for the existence of spatial error dependence. For these years, random shocks determine the movement of the economies and their interaction are not defined by administrative boundaries. A growth process for the Andean and Caribbean region is observed, contrary to what happens in Orinoquia and Amazon region. That convergence process occurred due to a process of unobservable spatial factors which gave a transition to the growth of the Caribbean and the Andean region. Besides, over time departments with high and low GDP pc remain constant. The main contribution of this work is the analysis on convergence that includes space and time factors simultaneously, as well as validation of the existence of convergence.

Siguiendo el análisis propuesto por Mankiw, Romer y Weil (1992), se estiman las ecuaciones de convergencia aumentadas con capital humano. Se sigue la propuesta de Ertur y Koch (2006, 2007), quienes incluyen las externalidades tecnológicas en el análisis del modelo que considera solamente el capital físico (Solow 1956), y en el modelo aumentado con el capital humano. Los resultados indican que cuando no se tienen en cuenta los efectos de los spillovers, existe evidencia de convergencia. Esta, sin embargo, desaparece cuando dichos efectos son añadidos al modelo.
O54|Causalidad de Granger entre composición de las exportaciones, crecimiento económico y producción de energía eléctrica: evidencia empírica para Latinoamérica|Resumen: El presente trabajo examina la relación causal de corto y largo plazo entre el crecimiento económico, la composición de las exportaciones y la producción de energía eléctrica, utilizando el enfoque de cointegración de datos de panel para 14 países latinoamericanos entre los años 1971 y 2010. El análisis considera en primera instancia las exportaciones de forma agregada para luego desagregar en 12 sectores industriales y, finalmente, según el uso intensivo de tecnología. Los resultados indican que el crecimiento económico de largo plazo de la región depende de las exportaciones no tecnológicas; asimismo, las políticas que afectan negativamente la producción de energía eléctrica no impactan el PIB en el corto plazo, pero sí en el largo plazo.
O54|Efecto de la inversión en capital tecnológico sobre la productividad de las empresas en el departamento de Bolívar|Este trabajo mide el efecto económico de la inversión en capital tecnológico sobre la productividad de las firmas de los sectores priorizados del departamento de Bolívar de acuerdo con el Plan Regional de Competitividad de Cartagena y Bolívar. Para ello se aplica la técnica de modelos Panel Multivariado que propone realizar una medida de la inversión en Capital Tecnológico (CT) utilizando como fuente de información los estados financieros de empresas del departamento de Bolívar —en el período 1995 – 2014— agrupadas en 16 ramas de actividad económica con registro en la Superintendencia de Sociedades. Las estimaciones del modelo econométrico indican que la inversión en Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación refleja un aumento de la rentabilidad general de la empresa que la realiza.
O54|International Trade and Economic Growth: Causality Relations Within NAFTA|This research explores empirically the causal link between international trade and economic growth within a free trade area. In particular, we use data from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to estimate the causal relationship between economic growth and trade flows, but isolating trade within the bloc from trade with the rest of the world. The period considered is 1960-2014. Our analysis follows three strategies: we investigate Granger causality on a one-country and two-countries basis and then we include the three countries in the same framework, following the identification strategy proposed by Arellano and Bover (1995). We find that both exports cause growth and growth drives exports. This goes in the same direction as that one followed in the literature. However, under the third strategy, we do not find conclusive evidence that supports the idea that trade within a trade bloc is more important for growth than trade with the rest of the world. Moreover, the long run effect is more significant for growth during the whole period than when NAFTA has been active. Regarding the impact of growth on exports, we find that production is important for enhancing exports within NAFTA in both short- and long-run but when the whole period is considered.
O54|Reciprocity and Willingness to Pay Taxes: Evidence from a Survey Experiment in Latin America|Are citizens more willing to pay taxes when the government’s performance improves? We review the tax morale literature, disentangling its different components, and provide empirical evidence exploiting a novel survey conducted in seventeen Latin American cities and an experi- mental attempt at measuring reciprocity in tax collection in developing countries. The evidence suggests that governments interested in increasing tax revenues should not focus solely on esca- lating the coercive power of the state (that is, more audits and nes). Rather, providing better public services to society can be an effective (albeit limited) tool to raise revenues.
O54|On shock symmetry in South America: New evidence from intra-Brazilian real exchange rates|I analyze the symmetry of economic shocks in South America by comparing the volatility of unexpected changes in bilateral real exchange rates within an existing monetary union, the intra-Brazilian currency area, with the volatility found in real exchange rates between Brazilian regions and nine South American countries for the 1994-2013 time period. My results show that shocks across South America are substantially less symmetric than shocks within Brazil, indicating potentially high costs if a continent-wide monetary union should eliminate nominal exchange rate exibility between countries.
O54|¿Hay discriminación en contra de las mujeres en el mercado laboral ecuatoriano?|La mayoría de los estudios sobre la desigualdad de género abordan exclusivamente las diferencias salariales. Este trabajo tiene como objetivo corregir este sesgo utilizando factores como el empleo, la formalidad de empleo y el subempleo. Ecuador es elegido como el escenario de este estudio, ya que goza de una estructura laboral relativamente única en América Latina. Utilizando datos de encuesta a nivel de hogar, este estudio encuentra evidencia de discriminación en el mercado laboral en contra de las mujeres en la forma de salarios más bajos y disparidades en materia de empleo, subempleo y formalidad. Se argumenta que legislaciones de igualdad de remuneración podrían comenzar a reducir estas brechas. También se recomiendan políticas dirigidas a promover la igualdad en el hogar mediante, por ejemplo, la enseñanza de los beneficios del empleo formal.
O54|The growth-employment-poverty nexus in Latin America in the 2000s: Cross-country analysis|In the great majority of Latin American countries in the 2000s, economic growth took place and brought about improvements in almost all labour market indicators and consequent reductions in poverty rates. Across countries, economic growth was not all that mattered; external factors were particularly important for changes in labour market conditions, while reductions in poverty were strongly related to improvements in earnings and employmentindicators. Although the 2008 crisis affected some countries differently from others, nearly all labour market indicators were at least as high or higher by 2012 than immediately before the crisis in all countries but one.
O54|El sector turístico y su relevancia económica en Ecuador y los países de UNASUR(1995 – 2013)|UNASUR es un espacio de integración regional, tanto desde el punto de vista económico como social y por ende también en el ámbito turístico. Ecuador, miembro de UNASUR,es un país con una estructura productiva dependiente del sector primario, que en los últimos años ha impulsado planes y programas en el ámbito turístico con el fin de buscar estrategias que contribuyan al desarrollo económico del país.Siguiendo la línea de investigación de trabajos anteriores para el turismo ecuatoriano, en este trabajo se analiza el impacto económico del turismo receptivo en el contexto de la UNASUR y Ecuador.A pesar de las limitaciones en la información estadística disponible, se realiza un análisis econométrico cuyos resultados constatan la relevancia que el sector turismo tiene en las economías de UNASUR, para el período 1995 a 2013.
O54|Brazil: self-inflicted pain|The Brazilian economy grew 7.5% in 2010, when Mr. Lula finished his second mandate as president with a popularity rate of 85%. Six years later, his successor, Ms. Rousseff, is suspended from the presidency under an impeachment trial, while the economy endures a recession of 3.8% of the GDP for the second consecutive year. In this article I argue that the current economic crisis is the result of ill-advised economic policies. Ms. Rousseff’s government altered each one of the tripod of policies implemented by Mr. Cardoso in the 1990s, which had been successful in maintaining macroeconomic stability (namely, the inflation targeting regime, the floating exchange rate and the fiscal austerity). Also, Ms. Rousseff’s government greatly expanded the improperly designed industrial policies that were reintroduced in Brazil during the second mandate of Mr. Lula, which created distortions in the economy and a large fiscal burden for the government. The acting president, Mr. Temer faces great difficulties to put the economy back in order, since unpopular measures are required that are very hard to be implemented in the midst of the current political turmoil.
O54|Relationship Between Economic Growth and Environmental Degradation: Is there an Environmental Evidence of Kuznets Curve for Brazil?|This study investigates the relationship between CO2 emissions, economic growth, energy use and electricity production by hydroelectric sources in Brazil. To verify the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis we use time-series data for the period 1971-2011. The autoregressive distributed lag methodology was used to test for cointegration in the long run. Additionally, the vector error correction model Granger causality test was applied to verify the predictive value of independent variables. Empirical results find that there is a quadratic long run relationship between CO2emissions and economic growth, confirming the existence of an EKC for Brazil. Furthermore, energy use shows increasing effects on emissions, while electricity production by hydropower sources has an inverse relationship with environmental degradation. The short run model does not provide evidence for the EKC theory. The differences between the results in the long and short run models can be considered for establishing environmental policies. This suggests that special attention to both variables-energy use and the electricity production by hydroelectric sources- could be an effective way to mitigate CO2 emissions in Brazil
O54|Propuesta de un indicador de bienestar multidimensional de uso del tiempo y condiciones de vida aplicado a Colombia, el Ecuador, México y el Uruguay|En el presente artículo se invita a discutir el marco conceptual y metodológico de un indicador de bienestar multidimensional, que incluye una dimensión de uso del tiempo junto con dimensiones de condiciones de vida usualmente incorporadas en este tipo de análisis. Las carencias identificadas mediante los componentes de este indicador se entienden como un obstáculo para el desarrollo de las capacidades humanas. El objetivo último es mirar más allá de las métricas monetarias e identificar los indicadores que mejor explican cómo la población, en lugar de las economías, se está desarrollando. En este análisis se emplea la metodología de identificación y agregación de Alkire y Foster (2007 y 2013) y se muestran los resultados para cuatro países de la región (Colombia, Ecuador, México y Uruguay) utilizando encuestas sobre el uso del tiempo y distinguiendo, además, por tipo de hogar.
O54|A multidimensional time use and well-being index: a proposal for Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Uruguay|This article aims to develop a multidimensional index by integrating time use and well-being dimensions and proposes a conceptual framework based on the assets and the human capabilities approaches. The components of the index identify deprivations, which are understood to be barriers to the development of human capabilities and social justice. The optimum objective is to look beyond monetary metrics when identifying indicators that can better explain how the population, rather than the economy, is progressing and being guided by the principles of distributive justice. This study implements the Alkire-Foster identification and aggregation method (2007 and 2013) and shows the results for four Latin American countries (Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Uruguay), using time-use surveys and distinguishing by household type.
O54|Income inequality and violent crime: Evidence from Mexico's drug war|The goal of this paper is to examine the effect of inequality on crime rates in a unique context, Mexico's drug war. The analysis exploits an original dataset containing inequality and crime statistics on more than 2000 Mexican municipalities over a 20-year period. To uncover the causal effect of inequality on crime, we use an instrumental variable for the Gini coefficient that combines the initial income distribution at the municipality level with national trends. Our estimates indicate that a one-point increment in the Gini coefficient between 2007 and 2010 translates into an increase of more that 36% in the number of drug-related homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. The fact that the effect found during the drug war is substantially greater is likely caused by the rise in rents to be extracted through crime and an expansion in the employment opportunities in the illegal sector through the proliferation of drug trafficking organizations (DTOs), accompanied by a decline in legal job opportunities and a reduction in the probability of being caught given the resource constraints faced by the law enforcement system. Combined, the latter factors made the expected benefits of criminal activity shift in a socially undesirable direction after 2007.
O54|Does the microsimulation approach used in macro–micro modelling matter? An application to the distributional effects of capital outflows during Argentina's Currency Board regime|We provide a novel comparison between the behavioural and the non-parametric microsimulation approach. Coupled with a CGE model, we consider the distributional effects of the significant capital outflows faced by the Argentinean economy at the end of its Currency Board, in a context with significant macroeconomic similarities to the present crisis in Greece. Both the relatively straightforward ‘non-parametric’ approach and the more complex behavioural approach lead to distributional results that are consistent with the data, suggesting that both are viable alternatives. Looking forward, it would be desirable for researchers to look for additional evidence regarding the distributional effects that these microsimulation models can illuminate for given macroeconomic shocks.
O54|Baseline projections for Latin America: base-year assumptions, key drivers and greenhouse emissions|This paper provides an overview of the base-year assumptions and baseline projections for the set of models participating in the LAMP and CLIMACAP projects. We present the range in baseline projections for Latin America, and identify key differences between model projections including how these projections compare to historic trends. We find relatively large differences across models in base year assumptions related to population, GDP, energy and CO2 emissions due to the use of different data sources, but also conclude that this does not influence the range of projections. We find that population and GDP projections across models span a broad range, comparable to the range represented by the set of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Kaya-factor decomposition indicates that the set of baseline scenarios mirrors trends experienced over the past decades. Emissions in Latin America are projected to rise as a result of GDP and population growth and a minor shift in the energy mix toward fossil fuels. Most scenarios assume a somewhat higher GDP growth than historically observed and continued decline of population growth. Minor changes in energy intensity or energy mix are projected over the next few decades.
O54|Macroeconomic impacts of climate change mitigation in Latin America: A cross-model comparison|In this paper we analyse macroeconomic consequences of greenhouse gas emission mitigation in Latin America up to 2050 through a multi-model comparison approach undertaken in the context of the CLIMACAP–LAMP research project. We compare two carbon tax scenarios with a business-as-usual scenario of anticipated future energy demand. In the short term, with carbon prices reaching around $15/tCO2 by 2030, most models agree that the reduction in consumer spending, as a proxy for welfare, is limited to about 0.3%. By 2050, at carbon prices of $165/tCO2, there is much more divergence in the estimated impact on consumer spending as well as GDP across models and regions, which reflects uncertainties about technology costs and substitution opportunities between technologies. We observe that the consequences of increasingly higher carbon prices, in terms of reduced consumer spending and GDP, tend to be fairly linear with the carbon price in our CGE models. However, the consequences are divergent and nonlinear in our econometric model, that is linked to an energy system model that simulates step-changes in technology substitution. The results of one model show that climate policy measures can have positive effects on consumer spending and GDP, which results from an investment stimulus and the redistribution of carbon price revenues to consumers.
O54|Measuring the relative pay of school teachers in Latin America 1997–2007|How much are teachers paid in comparison to those in other professions in Latin America? How have these differences evolved in recent years? Is teachers’ underpayment more pronounced in certain segments of the labor markets? This paper documents answers for those questions using data for thirteen Latin-American countries circa 1997 and circa 2007. After controlling the earnings differentials by observable characteristics we find that teachers are underpaid vis-à-vis other professionals and technicians in Latin America both, circa 1997 and circa 2007; and both, at their main and secondary jobs. We document a decrease in the earnings gap during the decade of analysis, mostly attributed to a general trend in gap reduction rather than as a result of teachers’ improvements on their observable characteristics. The earnings gap shows important heterogeneities, across countries and along the earnings distributions. Additionally, using information from the main and secondary jobs we find that individual penalties for teachers go beyond their observable characteristics.
O54|Economic growth and energy consumption: The Energy-Environmental Kuznets Curve for Latin America and the Caribbean|This paper investigates the relationship between economic growth and energy consumption using the hypothesis postulated for the Energy-Environmental Kuznets Curve, which assumes an inverted-U shape relationship between income and energy consumption. Panel data for 22 Latin American and Caribbean countries for the period 1990–2011 were used. Absolute energy consumption was chosen as an environmental pressure indicator, because energy consumption is the major contributor of emissions pollutants. The results obtained in the estimations show that the hypothesis postulated for the Energy-Environmental Kuznets Curve is not supported for the region. On the contrary, the results show an exponential growth as Gross Value Added grows. Also, notable differences are shown between the analyzed economies.
O54|Mirror trade statistics between China and Latin America|Purpose - This paper aims to examine the accuracy of the trade statistics between the People’s Republic of China and 20 Latin American countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. Design/methodology/approach - This paper contrasts the mirror trade statistics between China and 20 Latin American countries during 2009-2014, after adding to the Chinese side the trade figures corresponding to Hong Kong and adjusting for some valuation issues. Using the resulting panel data, the paper then explores some of the possible explanatory variables, in the case of Latin America, which can account for the significant trade misinvoicing that is found among most of the countries involved. Findings - Trade misinvoicing, be that from the part of China or of its partners, varies substantially across Latin America. It is quite large in the case of some countries such as Bolivia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama and Paraguay, and, on the opposite side, relatively small in the case of other countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Guatemala and Venezuela. It is found that, from a Latin American perspective, trade misinvoicing is positively related to the countries’ lack of statistical capacity and their degree of financial openness. Originality/value - This is the first empirical paper that examines the mirror trade statistics between China and Latin American.
O54|La economía argentina y su conflicto distributivo estructural (1930-2015)|We provide an interpretation of the macroeconomic performance of Argentina between 1930 and 2015, in which distributive conflict plays a central role. Following a tradition in the Argentine social sciences, we see a structural inconsistency between the income aspirations rooted in society and the productive capacity of the economy. We give this inconsistency a precise definition: as a gap between two equilibrium levels of the real exchange rate (RER). The macroeconomic equilibrium RER is the one that allows the economy to simultaneously attain full employment and balance of payments sustainability. The social equilibrium RER occurs when fully employed workers obtain the real wage that they bargain/claim. These two levels of RER may not coincide. There is a structural distributive conflict when the macroeconomic equilibrium RER is significantly higher than social equilibrium RER. We build a model to provide a stylized characterization of Argentina’s economy and precise definitions of the two levels of RER. We then use the model to characterize macroeconomic policy and performance during the 1930-2015 period.// En este artículo brindamos una interpretación del desempeño económico argentino entre 1930 y 2015, en la que el conflicto distributivo desempeña un papel protagónico. Nuestro argumento sostiene que el conflicto surge de la inconsistencia entre las aspiraciones económicas arraigadas en la sociedad y las posibilidades productivas de la economía. Presentamos dicha inconsistencia de un modo preciso: como una divergencia entre dos niveles de equilibrio del tipo de cambio real. El tipo de cambio real de equilibrio macroeconómico es aquel que permite a la economía mantener simultáneamente el pleno empleo y un balance de pagos sostenible. El tipo de cambio real de equilibrio social es aquel que emerge cuando los trabajadores plenamente ocupados alcanzan el salario real al que aspiran. Estos niveles de tipo de cambio real pueden no coincidir. De esta manera, existe un conflicto distributivo estructural cuando el tipo de cambio real de equilibrio macroeconómico es significativamente mayor al de equilibrio social. Asimismo, desarrollamos un modelo formal que representa de modo estilizado la estructura de la economía argentina y que permite brindar una definición precisa de los dos niveles de equilibrio del tipo de cambio real y del conflicto estructural. Posteriormente, utilizamos el modelo para caracterizar sintéticamente el performance y la política económica en el periodo 1930-2015
O54|Los efectos distributivos del poder de mercado.

O54|¿Más escolaridad, menos informalidad? Un análisis de cohortes para México y América Latina|What is the relation between schooling progress and informal employment? Using household surveys from Mexico and 17 other Latin American countries, we separate the trend in the rate of informal employment into three effects: i) differences in years of education of successive generations of workers; ii) transitions between formality and informality during the working life of each generation; and iii) labor market characteristics. We find that in Latin America there has been a slight reduction in labor informality, associated mainly with the first effect: recent generations of workers with more schooling have lower informality rates than previous ones. In the case of Mexico we also observe that younger generations of workers have more years of schooling than previous ones; however, this has not translated into lower informal employment due to adverse labor market characteristics. Thus, even though Mexico has experienced faster educational progress than the average of the region, its progress in reducing informality has been nil.// ¿Cuál es la relación entre escolaridad e informalidad laboral? Con las encuestas de hogares de México y otros 17 países de América Latina, separamos la evolución de la tasa de informalidad laboral en tres efectos: i) diferencias en los años de escolaridad de sucesivas generaciones de trabajadores, ii) tránsitos entre formalidad e informalidad durante el ciclo de vida laboral de cada generación, y iii) características del mercado de trabajo. Encontramos que en América Latina se ha observado una ligera reducción de la informalidad, asociada fundamentalmente al primer efecto: generaciones más recientes de trabajadores con más escolaridad experimentan menores tasas de informalidad que las anteriores. En el caso de México, también observamos que generaciones más recientes de trabajadores tienen más años de escolaridad que las previas; sin embargo, este efecto ha sido contrarrestado por el mercado laboral. Así, a pesar de que en México se han observado mayores avances en años de escolaridad que en el promedio de América Latina, el progreso para reducir la informalidad laboral ha sido nulo.
O54|Externalidades del capital humano en México|This paper estimates human capital externalities in Mexico using the traditional approaches in the literature. We control the potential endogenenity of individual and average schooling with instrumental variables techniques. We use as instruments, the educational reform of 1993 of compulsory secondary education and the proportion of graduates from upper secondary and higher education and the structure of the population of the states in a previous period. The results show that there is a strong positive and statistically significant relationship between experience, individual education and average education with individual wages. Also we confirmed by the implementation of the various approaches through the coincidence of the results that there are significant human capital externalities at state level in Mexico for the period 2000-2010.// El presente trabajo estima las externalidades del capital humano en México empleando los enfoques más utilizados en la literatura. Con el propósito de reducir el potencial sesgo de endogenedidad de la escolaridad individual y promedio realizamos estimaciones con variables instrumentales. Para lo cual empleamos como instrumento de la primera la reforma educativa de 1993 que promulgó la obligatoriedad de la educación secundaria. Para la segunda utilizamos la proporción de egresados de educación media superior y superior y la estructura de la población de los estados en un periodo previo. Los resultados muestran que existe una fuerte relación positiva y estadísticamente significativa entre experiencia, educación individual y educación promedio estatal con los salarios individuales. Asimismo, confirmamos por medio de la aplicación de los diversos enfoques a través de la coincidencia en los resultados encontrados que existen externalidades significativas del capital humano a nivel estatal en México para el periodo 2000-2010.
O54|Remesas, crecimiento y convergencia regional en México: aproximación con un modelo panel-espacial|Mexico receive flow of remittances similar to those depicted by the flow of foreign direct investment. The central purpose of this paper is to discuss weather remittances are a significant factor to promote regional economic growth. This research shows that remittances contribute to the growth of GDP per capita when heterogeneity and spatial dependence are taking into account. These two spatial components are introduced in the analysis by implementing a standard convergence growth model under spatial econometric methods of panel data at state level for the 2001-2010 period.
O54|Patrones de co-localización espacial de la industria aeroespacial en México|Mexico's aerospace industry (IA) is considered strategic due to the possibilities offered to national business to be inserted into supply chain; by its productive characteristics involves the development of suppliers by externalities, which requires business co-location. This document applies the Co-location Quotient (CLQ) statistic in five Mexican entities in order to detect spatial co-location patterns in clusters related to the IA. The results indicate its spatial attraction to aerospace business, as well as electronics, machinery and equipment. Additionally, it can be identified differences in regards co-location patters with respect to the productive capacities by entity; this suggests inputs for the design of industrial policy.
O54|Análisis de diferencias en puntajes en la prueba ENLACE entre niños y niñas en el sistema escolar mexicano|This paper analyzes the gender gap in standardized test scores in Mexico. The data used comes from the ENLACE test for primary, junior high and high school. In primary and junior high school, girls perform better than boys in both spanish and math across the test score distribution, but in the top part of the math score distribution. In high school, across the test score distribution, girls perform better than boys in spanish and the opposite occurs in math.
O54|Una red económica norteamericana|Las estructuras económicas pueden entenderse como redes de ramas, vinculadas entre sí mediante el intercambio de bienes producidos. El modelo de Insumo-Producto analiza la interdependencia sectorial en tales estructuras. En este trabajo, identificamos una red económica en una tabla IP trilateral norteamericana. Utilizamos una medida de densidad como indicador de la integración regional. Nuestros resultados muestran que la economía de los Estados Unidos determina el perfil de la estructura de Norteamérica. Canadá y México mantienen escasas relaciones directas y su pertenencia a la región ayuda a entender sus economías.
O54|Disadvantaged? Informal Female Entrepreneurs Operating “Tienditas” in Nicaragua|I explore the business and (household) income outcomes of base of the pyramid (BoP) in-home convenience store entrepreneurs through a census-like business survey in Nicaragua. Throughout Latin America and in Nicaragua, tienditas are typically operated by female entrepreneurs in an informal regulatory environment out of the home and at the periphery of developing economies. Some authors have characterized this sector as disadvantaged because of its inherent reliance on female ownership, on a home-based location, and on operating within an informal context (Nichter and Goldmark, 2009). Others have argued that such enterprises may serve as a link toward poverty reduction at the BoP (Pisani and Yoskowitz, 2012). Utilizing a 2012 cross-sectional and nationally representative business focused survey, 400 Nicaraguan tenderas are examined. Findings indicate heterogeneity exists across the tiendita retail sector; where failing, ailing, stable and healthy tienditas are segmented, analyzed, and discussed.
O54|Do Government Audits Reduce Corruption? Estimating the Impacts of Exposing Corrupt Politicians|This paper examines the extent to which government audits of public resources can reduce corruption by enhancing political and judiciary accountability. We do so in the context of Brazil’s anticorruption program, which randomly audits municipalities for their use of federal funds. We find that being audited in the past reduces future corruption by 8 percent, while also increasing the likelihood of experiencing a subsequent legal action by 20 percent. We interpret these reduced-form findings through a political agency model, which we structurally estimate. Our results suggest that the reduction in corruption comes mostly from the audits increasing the perceived nonelectoral costs of engaging in corruption.
O54|Revisión de la hipótesis de convergencia mediante cointegración en panel: el caso de América Latina|Este trabajo reexamina la hipótesis de la convergencia del PIB per cápita en una muestra de países de América Latina con respecto a dos referentes: el promedio de la región y el de Estados Unidos. A diferencia de Rodríguez, Perrotini y Venegas (2012) y de Rodríguez, Perrotini y Mendoza (2014), se emplean pruebas de raíces unitarias y de estacionariedad, así como de cointegración en panel con rupturas estructurales. Los resultados de éstas no corroboran la hipótesis de convergencia que brindan las de raíces unitarias y de estacionariedad en panel con rupturas aplicadas a la versión restricta, lo que se confirma con las estimaciones del parámetro de convergencia en la versión irrestricta de la prueba.
O54|Growth agglomeration effects in spatially interdependent Latin American regions|We investigate the effect of agglomeration on regional growth in Latin America, using panel data and spatial panel data techniques. By exploring the role of development in the agglomeration-growth relationship, we find evidence of the Williamson’s hypothesis : agglomeration growth effects are magnified in less-developed regions. Moreover, we measure the spatial effects of agglomeration. They have a large geographical scope. International connections of Latin American regions are beneficial to obtain positive spatial effects of agglomeration. Nevertheless, spatial effects are stronger within countries. This finding points out the strong border effects in Latin America.
O54|Urban labor market revisited: Why quality of employment matters in Bogota (In French)|The urban labor market in Latin America has been assessed through a set of traditional typologies: formal-informal and wage labor-self-employed. In recent decades these approaches seem extensively criticized and overstretched by the successive waves of deregulation, incapable of analyzing the mutation of social practices. In this context, the quality of employment concept (QoE) appears as a multidimensional instrument that can break these representations. In this paper we offer an adapted methodology to construct a QoE index with the MCA method. This indicator shows its relevance by demonstrating that quality is not necessarily where you would expect on the Bogota’s urban labor market in 2013. Indeed, more than 25% and 41% of very low quality jobs are respectively formal and employees, and some social differences appear between workers in the different levels of QoE.
O54|Fighting Past Economic Wars: Crisis and Austerity in Latin America|Political economy theory expects that changes in macroeconomic governance are often catalyzed by institutional factors, such as partisanship or elections. I challenge and contextualize this view by incorporating the role of technocratic advisors into a domestic policymaking framework. I contend that structural and elite-level explanations are also important to understanding ideational shifts, particularly in regions like Latin America that suffer from severe economic volatility. Presidents tend to govern from the lens of their crisis past, appointing economic hawks (or mainstream economists) who embrace austerity in the shadow of inflation crises, and economic doves (heterodox economists) who drift from budget discipline following unemployment shocks. Employing an originally constructed data index, the Index of Economic Advisors, I conduct a statistical test of 16 Latin American countries from 1960 to 2011, finding support for sustained idological shifts in technocratic composition and fiscal governance, based on the nature of past shocks.
O54|Situation Processes Qualifications In Hospitality And Tourism Activity, Guayaquil, Ecuador ,Brecha Entre La Actividad Turísticohotelera, Y Los Procesos De Formación Universitaria En Guayaquil, Ecuador|This research describes a condition of major players in the tourism-hotel business, in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Specifically, we examine those responsible for senior and middle management. In both cases, there is extremely little education or training. This is somewhat surprising as Higher Education Institutes (IES) offer targeted careers as tour guides and other professions in tourism. All this occurs because of rotating schedules, which has created a gap between service industry and academia. This is based on surveys conducted on a sample of 150 employees of four and five star hotels from May to July 2015. The results show a low level of educated professionals in tourist hotels. IES can not satisfy this need in the short term to the extent that is required.
O54|Evidence from a Natural Experiment on the Development Impact of Windfall Gains: The Camisea Fund in Peru|This document studies the economic effect of windfall gains by examining a Peruvian natural experiment. The Camisea Fund for Socioeconomic Development (FOCAM) is an inter-governmental fiscal transfer scheme that allocates natural gas royalties generated by the Camisea Gas Project to eligible subnational governments. We exploit the rules governing FOCAM allocation to identify the effect of the transfers on municipal accounts, local infrastructure, and economic development. Using a newly constructed district- level dataset for the years 2005 and 2012, we find evidence of positive impacts on municipal capital expenditures and local infrastructure. However, we also find evidence of a negative impact on municipal current expenditures. More specifically, we find that municipalities with low absorptive capacity coped with the increased administrative burden of FOCAM transfers by reallocating administrative effort toward (away from) executing capital (current) expenditures.
O54|Healthy to Work: The Impact of Free Public Healthcare on Health Status and Labor Supply in Jamaica|"This study examines whether Jamaica's free public healthcare policy affectedhealth status and labor supply of adult individuals. It compares outcomes of adults without health insurance versus their insured counterparts, before and after policy implementation. The study finds that the policy reduced both the likelihood of suffering illnesses with associated lost work days and the number of lost days due to illnesses by 28.6 percent and 34 percent, respectively. Consistent with the absence of ""employment lock"", no effects are found on employment at the extensive margin. However, consistent with a reduced number of days lost due to illnesses, there is a positive effect of 2.15 additional weekly labor hours. This is primarily a labor supply effect as the study shows that both reported and imputed hourly wages decreased by 0.15 and 0.06 log-points respectively. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the policy added a yearly average of US$PPP 26.6 million worth of net real production to the economy during the period 2008-12."
