G19|Style consistency and mutual fund returns: the case of Russia|This paper carries out style analysis for Russian mutual funds using monthly data from the National Managers’ Association over the period January 2008-December 2017; specifically, it applies the RSBA method developed by Sharpe (1992) for evaluating the impact of style on returns, and uses the Style Drift Score (SDS) introduced by Idzorek (2004) as a measure of a fund’s style drifting activity. The main findings can be summarised as follows. In the Russian case there is a significant positive relationship between style consistency and profitability of funds. Further, Russian funds are characterised by a high level of style drift, namely deviations from the investment strategy declared at the time of registration as required by Russian law.
G19|The Long and Short of It: The Post-Crisis Corporate CDS Market|We establish key stylized facts about the post-crisis evolution of trading and pricing of credit default swaps. Using supervisory contract-level data, we document that dealers become net buyers of credit protection starting in the second half of 2014, both through reducing the amount of protection they sell in the single-name market and through switching to buying protection in the index market. More generally, we argue that considering simultaneous positions in different types of credit derivatives is crucial for understanding institutions’ participation decisions and how these decisions affect prices in these markets.
G19|Costs of Natural Disasters in Public Financing|We document the dynamics of primary municipal bond (muni) markets after severe natural disasters. We find that yields of muni issuance increase significantly in the first three months after disasters. Disasters have little effect on issuersâ€™ credit risk but can temporarily reduce investorsâ€™ demand, which is consistent with the salience theory of choice (Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer, 2012). Natural disasters significantly increase the proceeds from muni issuances. Reacting to the larger financing costs, muni issuers use shorter maturity and a less complex structure to offset the larger financing costs. The higher yields after disasters provide speculation opportunities.
G19|Dependence Structure of Volatility and Illiquidity on Vienna and Warsaw Stock Exchanges|In this paper, the results of an investigation into the relationship between the illiquidity and realized volatility of the time series of stocks listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) and Vienna Stock Exchange (VSE) are presented. The first measure of illiquidity is the well-known Amihud ratio (Amihud, 2002) called AMI, and the second is a transformation of the Liquidity Index (Danyliv et al., 2014) called ILLIX. In the study, the results of the detection of the structural breaks (and their removal), the calculation of long memory, and finally the dependence structure of the illiquidity and realized volatility by the copulas are also demonstrated. Both types of series exhibit structural breaks and long-memory properties. Despite the similarities in the illiquidity measures, their associations with the realized volatility is different. The dependence structures described by the copulas for the AMI-realized volatility pairs show a dependence in the upper tails; i.e., the high values of illiquidity are related to the high volatility. However, in the case of the ILLIX-realized volatility pairs, the dependence was detected in the lower tail; i.e., the low ILLIX is accompanied by the low realized volatility.
G19|The Long and Short of It: The Post-Crisis Corporate CDS Market|The 2007-2009 financial crisis highlighted the vulnerability of financial institutions linked by a complex web of credit default swap (CDS) contracts, sparking a wave of regulatory changes to the structure of the market. In this paper, we provide broad evidence on the evolution of the CDS market in the post-crisis period, document the properties of participants' exposures to corporate CDS over time, and study the differential pricing of transactions between different types of counterparties.
G19|Tranched Value Securities|Structured financial products and derivatives were one of the major financial innovations since 18th century, which improve market completeness by transforming risk-sharing mechanisms. Since then, thousands of derivative types were created, and its market has grown to over six-times greater than global GDP, but capital markets still exhibit efficiency only to a limited extent. This paper assesses the potential performance of Tranched Value Securities (patent pending) – a new financial instrument that transforms a single underlying to asymmetrically paying derivative, and has a potential to further improve capital markets by facilitating risk sharing, and satisfy a wide range of investment objectives.
G19|The extended Friday the 13th Effect in the US stock returns|The classical Friday the 13th Effect refers to a calendar anomaly of financial markets which is generated by the fear of bad luck shared by the superstitious investors. As a result of their behavior, the returns from the supposed unlucky day of Friday the 13th are significant lower than those from the other Fridays. The superstition could also affect the returns from the trading days there are adjacent to Friday the 13th. In order to avoid the bad luck, some investors sell their stocks a trading day before and their transactions lead to a fall of the prices. Those who are reluctant to buy stocks on Friday the 13th delay such transactions to the next trading day causing prices to rise. In time, the knowledge about this pattern could induce significant changes in investors’ behavior, even to those that are not superstitious. Once become aware that one trading day before Friday the 13th the stock prices are usually low, many investors would prefer to sell two or three trading days before. There also were investors that would buy stocks not one trading day after Friday the 13th, when the prices are expected to be high, but two or three trading days after. Other investors could exploit the opportunities to buy cheap on Friday the 13th or one trading day before or to sell high one trading day after and their transactions could attenuate the abnormal returns from these days. In such ways the classical form of Friday the 13th Effect could be replaced by an extended form which consists in abnormal returns for a specific time interval that starts some trading days before the supposed unlucky day and ends some trading days after. This paper explores the behavior of the stock returns of 42 companies, from seven sectors of the United States economy, in the period January 2010 – March 2019, for a time interval that starts three trading days before Friday the 13th and ends three trading days after. The results indicate, for many of them, significant low returns in some trading days before Friday the 13th and/or significant high returns some trading days after. We also found some particularities of the extended Friday the 13th Effect among the seven sectors.
G19|Debt Capital Markets As A Funding Source For Listed Property Funds In South Africa|Purpose of paperProperty finance in South Africa has traditionally been a market dominated by bank lend-ing. However in the context of the Basel III Accord creating cost and other regulatory impli-cations for bank lending, as well a maturing listed property market adopting international best practice in the form of REIT legislation, debt capital markets funding is becoming a significant component of REITs? capital structure. The study seeks to determine the merits and impact of this nascent funding source for REITs in South Africa. MethodologyFollowing a review of applicable literature, interviews with senior management of nine listed property funds and other debt capital markets stakeholders were undertaken. Cer-tain advantages and disadvantages of debt capital markets funding, in comparison to other lending sources, were presented as hypotheses to the interviewees. FindingsThe responses show support from a significant majority of the interviewees for four partic-ular advantages and two disadvantages. The study also found support for these ad-vantages and disadvantages to be transient. Value of paperIt is advised that REITs periodically reassess the respective advantages and disadvantages of this funding source for their business.
G19|Quasi-dark trading: The effects of banning dark pools in a world of many alternatives|"We show that ""quasi-dark"" trading venues, i.e., markets with somewhat non-transparent trading mechanisms, are important parts of modern equity market structure alongside lit markets and dark pools. Using the European MiFID II regulation as a quasi-natural experiment, we find that dark pool bans lead to (i) volume spill-overs into quasi-dark trading mechanisms including periodic auctions and order internalization systems; (ii) little volume returning to transparent public markets; and consequently, (iii) a negligible impact on market liquidity and short-term price efficiency. These results show that quasi-dark markets serve as close substitutes for dark pools and consequently mitigate the effectiveness of dark pool regulation. Our findings highlight the need for a broader approach to transparency regulation in modern markets that takes into consideration the many alternative forms of quasi-dark trading."
G19|Assessing the importance of the choice threshold in quantifying market risk under the POT method (EVT)|The conditional extreme value theory has been proven to be one of the most successful in estimating market risk. The implementation of this method in the framework of the Peaks Over Threshold (POT) model requires one to choose a threshold for fitting the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). In this paper, we investigate whether the selection of the threshold is important for the quantification of market risk. For measuring risk, we use the value at risk (VaR) measure and the expected shortfall (ES) measure. The study has been done for a large set of assets. The results obtained indicate that the quantification of the market risk through the VaR and ES measures does not depend on the threshold selected. This result is also found in a smaller sample.
G19|Trust and shareholder voting|We test the hypothesis whether a specific aspect of culture – trust in others – affects shareholder voting behavior by substituting for costly monitoring. We find consistent evidence that the percentage of votes cast at shareholder meetings is lower in high-trust countries while the percentage of votes in support of management proposals is higher. Shocks to trust and IV regressions confirm these results. We also find that shareholder voting is more valuable in lowtrust countries, as reflected by a more positive effect on future firm performance, which suggests that managers do not exploit lower levels of monitoring when trust is high.
G19|A research note on entrepreneurs’ financial commitment and crowdfunding success| Established early stage investors decide to invest in new ventures after evaluating the propensity of success and the risk of failure. Consequently, it is of considerable importance that the founders invest substantial own financial means and are thus highly committed to business success. Despite its key role in practice, the entrepreneurs’ own financial commitment has not yet been discussed in an equity crowdfunding context. Applying a signalling approach, our empirical findings show that entrepreneurs with comparatively more ex ante financial commitment in their venture achieve significantly higher funding success. Moreover, our results suggest that financial commitment is the single most important variable determining funding success.
G19|Restricción de crédito y probabilidad de no pago de los hogares uruguayos|This document identifies the households that face credit restrictions in Uruguay and analyzes the relationship that exists between the credit restriction of a household and its level of risk, measured as the unconditional probability of default of it non-mortgage debt. According to the results obtained, 76% of households report being in a situation of credit restriction. Additionally we find evidence that households with credit restrictions have, on average, a higher probability of not paying their nonmortgage debt than unrestricted households.
G19|Sensibilidad de la deuda de los hogares uruguayos ante un choque en el ingreso|Este documento de trabajo analiza las vulnerabilidades financieras de los hogares uruguayos a partir de datos microeconómicos. Se realiza un ejercicio de sensibilidad sobre la deuda y el atraso en el pago del crédito no hipotecario por parte de los hogares uruguayos ante un choque en el ingreso similar al observado en el 2002. Como resultado del ejercicio, se estima un aumento de la proporción de créditos no hipotecarios de un 8% a un 15% luego del choque. Si bien, el aumento se produce en todas las instituciones el impacto es mayor para los bancos privados y las cosas financieras, cooperativas de ahorro y crédito y cosas comerciales.
G19|Does The Stock of Indonesian Provider Tower Industry Have a Fair Value?|Objective - The objective of this study is to evaluate the stock intrinsic value of companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. The evaluation is carried out by using a DCF method of Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) approach, and a relative method of Price to Earnings Ratio (PER) and Price to Book Value (PBV) approaches. Each approach uses three scenarios of optimism, moderation and pessimism. Methodology/Technique - The historical data of the companies between 2014 and 2017 was used to predict their performance in the period between 2018 and 2021. Findings - The results of this study indicate that by comparing the stock prices to their intrinsic value of the stock valuation of the DCF-FCFF, the stock market prices as of 1 January 2018 according to the optimistic scenario show that TBIG and SUPR were undervalued, while TOWR and IBST were overvalued. In the moderate scenario, TBIG and SUPR were undervalued, while TOWR and IBST were overvalued. Novelty - Meanwhile, TBIG, TOWR and IBST were overvalued and only SUPR was undervalued in the pessimistic scenario. Relative valuation using a PER approach in all scenarios indicates that TBIG, TOWR and IBST were overvalued and SUPR was undervalued. Finally, through a PBV approach, the relative valuation of TOWR, SUPR and IBST were overvalued and TBIG was undervalued in all scenarios.
G19|Conceptual Framework for the Determinants of Mutual Fund Performance in Malaysia|Objective - The aim of the study is to identify the determinants of mutual fund performance. Mutual funds have grown in the global financial scene since the 1890s. Past studies have examined various issues associated with mutual funds. However, in Malaysia, mutual fund related studies are rather limited. While most global researches observe the determinants of conventional mutual fund performance, the literature in Malaysia focuses only on a comparison of the performance of mutual funds. Hence, this study aims to fill that gap by providing a framework to assess the determinants of mutual fund performance. More specifically, the study proposes a conceptual framework to determine the effect of historical return, fund governance, timing and selection skills on mutual fund performance. The advancement of the study can be found through the use of theory of performance and mutual fund fees as a mediator in determining the performance of mutual fund fees. Methodology/Technique - A quantitative approach based on secondary data will be used in this study. Multivariate regression analysis and structural equation modelling is also used to evaluate the relationship between the variables. Findings - A conceptual framework is proposed based on the Theory of Performance. The model fit and the mediating role of mutual fund fees will be confirmed after the collection of the research data. It is expected that historical return, fund governance, timing and selection skills will affect mutual fund performance and mutual fund fees will mediate the relationship between the two. Novelty – This study will provide a new perspective on mutual fund performance by using the Theory of Performance. In addition, the mediating role of mutual fund fees is further examined in relation to the specified determinants and mutual fund performance.
G19|Non-linear Effect of Debt on the Economic Performance of Trans-Pacific Partnership Countries|Objective - The formation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) without the United States has raised many concerns in terms of the possibility of its success. The economic growth of the remaining 11 partner countries is important for the success of the formation of the TPP. Although economic performance depends on certain crucial indicators including debt, the effect of debt on the economic performance among the TPP partner countries remains ambiguous. Methodology/Technique - As a result, this study investigates the nonlinear effect of debt on the economic performance of these partner countries (excluding Brunei and Vietnam) as a whole. In addition, the optimal level of debt is proposed as a means to control the level of debt for sustainable economic growth. Unbalanced panel data of the annual public debt-to-Gross Domestic Product ratio (measured as a percentage of GDP) and real GDP per capita from 1984 to 2015 was collected. Through panel analysis, this study reports an inverted U-shaped relationship between debt and economic performance. Findings - The threshold debt level was identified at 58.02% of GDP. This non-linear relationship means that increasing debt has a positive impact on economic performance before reaching 58.02% of GDP, and an inverse impact on economic performance occurs after this threshold debt level. However, the average debt reveals that the partnership as a whole experiences the reverse effect of debt on growth during this period. Novelty – This study highlights the need for prudent indebtedness policies to ensure continuing trade integration.
G19|Equity Analysis in Buying Company Shares on the Philippine Stock Exchange|Objective - Less than 1% of the population in the Philippines has invested in the stock market (PSE, 2016). The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) has been in operation since 1927 and is one of the oldest in the Asia Pacific. The primary objective of this research is to examine the investing techniques of online users using technical and fundamental analysis. Methodology/Technique - A chi-square test is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more categories. The research probes the relationship of the demographic profiles of respondents and their investment behavior using the Friedman's test. Findings - The descriptive statistics show the frequency counts of 418 observations and the corresponding chi-square test for the distribution-free data. The analysis of variance by ranks was used to reflect the Friedman test for the hierarchy of perception of the respondents per given variable. The chi-square test (?2 (df = 4, ? = 0.001) = 53.603) shows that actual observations on the relative valuation (86, 48, 130, 99, and 55) is significantly different from a uniform fit of 84 observations at 4 degrees of freedom and 5% level of significance. Novelty – Hence, the study concluded that investors prefer a relative valuation equity selection strategy using fundamental analysis. Furthermore, the study concludes that the moving average (36, 11, 80, 95 and 196) is preferred by investors using technical analysis.
G19|Assessing Banking Profit Efficiency Using Stochastic Frontier Analysis|Objective - The banking sector plays an important role in the Indonesian economy. The sustainability of the Indonesian banking sector will depend on the ability of every banking institution to maintain their competitiveness. Banking competitiveness is reflected in the level of efficiency of the banking system itself. Methodology/Technique - The purpose of this research is to assess the efficiency of 21 banks on the IDX between 2008-2017 using Stochastic Frontier Analysis. Findings - The findings of this research show a maximum efficiency score of 0.69 and the bank's average score among the research sample with the input and output allocation which can generate profits is 0.69 - 0.43 = 0.26. Overall, the banking sector in the Indonesian capital market between 2008 - 2017 recorded an efficiency score of 0.43. With this score, the banking system in the Indonesian capital market is still considered to be inefficient (0.43 = 0,5) and in the second pole, there were 10 banks with low efficiency scores (less than 0.5). Novelty – From the results, it can be concluded that several output variables, such as total loans (Y1) and securities (Y3), and input variables such as prices of labor (W2) and inflation (Z), have a significant effect on banking profits. Meanwhile, input variables such as the price of fund variables or the total funds (W1) and the price of physical capital were reflected in the depreciation of fixed assets (W3), and the output variables of income and interest (Y2) had an insignificant effect on bank profits.
G19|Price momentum and the 1719-20 bubbles: A method to compare and interpret booms and crashes in asset markets|This paper attempts to address one major problem with bubble studies: the difficulty to rigorously compare assets bubbles (that is to say compare them via quantitative data, rather than simply anecdotal evidence). The idea of the paper is to use a metric that is not the level of price itself, but that is connected to it. This metric is price momentum (i.e. the magnitude and speed of price changes). Momentum is measured with a technical indicator: the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI is popular among traders, yet it is not normally used as a tool of comparison. In particular, there appears to be no academic study that has hitherto employed the RSI as a metric to compare different booms and crashes. Likewise, it seems that the RSI was never applied to early modern markets (such as the Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles), or to early 20th century markets (such as the 1929 crash). The paper does all this (based on historical securities prices). Furthermore, it develops news concepts and metrics (such as “strong momentum with low volatility”, “momentum efficiency”, and accumulated RSI readings) that are connected to the notion of momentum. These concepts, in turn, are interpreted through the lens of archival evidence. The result is a new method of analysis – which is not concerned with market forecasting, but only with comparison and historical interpretation – that sheds new light on the 1719 20 bubbles themselves.
G19|A Second Look at Post Crisis Pricing of Derivatives - Part I: A Note on Money Accounts and Collateral|The paper reviews origins of the approach to pricing derivatives post-crisis by following three papers that have received wide acceptance from practitioners as the theoretical foundations for it - [Piterbarg 2010], [Burgard and Kjaer 2010] and [Burgard and Kjaer 2013]. The review reveals several conceptual and technical inconsistencies with the approaches taken in these papers. In particular, a key component of the approach - prescription of cost components to a risk-free money account, generates derivative prices that are not cleared by the markets that trade the derivative and its underlying securities. It also introduces several risk-free positions (accounts) that accrue at persistently non-zero spreads with respect to each other and the risk free rate. In the case of derivatives with counterparty default risk [Burgard and Kjaer 2013] introduces an approach referred to as semi-replication, which through the choice of cost components in the money account results in derivative prices that carry arbitrage opportunities in the form of holding portfolio of counterparty's bonds versus a derivative position with it. This paper derives no-arbitrage expressions for default-risky derivative contracts with and without collateral, avoiding these inconsistencies. It will be followed by a part two paper that deals with the derivation of XVA expressions based on the approach in this paper.
G19|Different Property Sectors of Japanese REIT Market: Comparative Analysis of Determinants under Non-Traditional Monetary Policy Regimes|Stock price has a positive impact on the REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) Property Sector Index Series (Office, Residential, and Retail & Logistics) in all three sample periods. Interest rate has no significant impact on any of the sectors in the REIT Property Sector Index Series under the comprehensive easing policy regime. On the other hand, interest rate has a negative impact on each of the sectors in the REIT Property Sector Index Series under the quantitative and qualitative easing and the negative interest rate policy regimes. The negative impact of interest rate on the REIT market is larger under the quantitative and qualitative policy regime than it is under the negative interest rate policy regime. As regards the sensitivity of the three REIT property sectors to stock price and interest rate, no significant differences are found in any of the samples; the three different sectors are almost equally influenced by stock price and long-term interest rate.
G19|Analysis of Spatial Dependence in Real Estate Prices: Evidence from an Emerging Market|Real estate properties are naturally location-fixed, therefore, a spatial dependence is expected. When location-specific factors persist over time, spatial autocorrelation is likely to exist in a hedonic pricing regression. Spatial autocorrelation causes problems in the interpretation of the regression results due to inefficient estimators or complex models. The focus of this study is to identify and test the determinants of spatial dependence in the real estate market. Using a novel data set, our study contributes to the literature as we identify the specific spatial dependence factors through the analysis of different types of housing markets and extend the literature to an emerging market.
G19|A Counterfactual Valuation of the Stock Index as a Predictor of Crashes|Stock market fundamentals would not seem to meaningfully predict returns over a shorter-term horizon—instead, I shift focus to severe downside risk (i.e., crashes). I use the cointegrating relationship between the log S&P Composite Index and log earnings over 1871 to 2015, combined with smoothed earnings, to first construct a counterfactual valuation benchmark. The price-versus-benchmark residual shows an improved, and economically meaningful, logit estimation of the likelihood of a crash over alternatives such as the dividend yield and price momentum. Rolling out-of-sample estimates highlight the challenges in this task. Nevertheless, the overall results support the common popular belief that a higher stock market valuation in relation to fundamentals entails a higher risk of a crash.
G19|Factores determinantes de la probabilidad de no pago de deuda de los hogares uruguayos|This paper estimates models on the default probability of households in Uruguay in the nonmortgage credit and credit card segment considering sociodemographic and financial characteristics using data obtained from the second edition of the Household Financial Survey and the Continuous Household Survey. Household income, the relation between income and expenditure, and the age of the household head are significant for explaining default probability in all the segments, while the education of the household head is only relevant for the nonmortgage credit segment. Furthermore, we analyze the impact on household debt default by the obligation to pay salaries through electronic media introduced by the Financial Inclusion
G19|Simulating stress across the financial system: the resilience of corporate bond markets and the role of investment funds|This paper provides a first step in developing a system-wide stress simulation. The model incorporates several important features of the financial system. These include several types of institution (including banks and non-banks) and how their actions may propagate and amplify stress. Rather than attempting to predict outcomes of a given stress scenario for financial sector balance sheets, it seeks to explore those conditions under which systemic stress may crystallise.
G19|Scope of Re-hypothecation Regulation (Report of Workshops (3))|"The margin requirements for non-cleared over-the-counter (""OTC"") derivatives transactions are introduced in 2016 (pursuant to an international agreement by the G20 to reduce systemic risk from OTC derivatives) and restrict the re-hypothecation of initial margin collateral. While this restriction is introduced in order to protect client assets, there has been a concern that such restriction may have a negative impact on market liquidity. The Report of the Workshops on ""Contemporary Financial Transactions and Their Regulatory Treatment"" (2016) (the ""Report"") analyzes the appropriate scope of regulation in relation to the re-hypothecation of initial margin collateral. Japan implements this regulation in a manner compatible with the international agreement, and introduces a new trust scheme concept, which allows for the segregated management of collateral assets. The Report also analyzes the potential for the trust scheme, which could provide room for the re-hypothecation of securities and hence, mitigate the unintended negative impact on market liquidity, while ensuring harmonization with the international agreement."
G19|A theory of repurchase agreements, collateral re-use, and repo intermediation|We show that repurchase agreements (repos) arise as the instrument of choice to borrow in a competitive model with limited commitment. The repo contract traded in equilibrium provides insurance against fluctuations in the asset price in states where collateral value is high and maximizes borrowing capacity when it is low. Haircuts increase both with counterparty risk and asset risk. In equilibrium, lenders choose to re-use collateral. This increases the circulation of the asset and generates a â€œcollateral multiplierâ€ effect. Finally, we show that intermediation by dealers may endogenously arise in equilibrium, with chains of repos among traders. (Copyright: Elsevier)
G19|Why is investors'mutual fund market allocation far from the optimum?|In this paper, It is analysed the differences between the optimal portfolio of funds that a fully informed investor might select and the current structure of the mutual fund markets as characterized by the funds’ risk profile (conservative or aggressive) and target investor type (retail or wholesale). It is found that the relationship between fund age, market share and change in total net assets –but not fees- and the optimal portfolio of funds depends on the structure of the mutual fund market.
G19|How does information disclosure affect liquidity? Evidence from an Emerging Market|Cross-sectional models positively relate firm information disclosure with stock liquidity, but dynamic models in news releases days show an opposite relation. We address this puzzle by studying the effects of information arrival on liquidity and its determinants. We use trade and quote data from Colombia for 2015 and 2016, along with the complete database of news releases as reported by companies to the regulator. The results of Panel data and PVAR models suggest that news releases increase both informed and uninformed trading. All in all, the temporal negative effect of news releases on liquidity is explained by increasing asymmetric information.
G19|The demand of energy from an optimal portfolio choice perspective|This paper analyses the demand for energy sector by employing a model form strategic asset allocation literature and quantifying the welfare losses incurred by an investor due to sub-optimal asset allocation. Our sample group includes fifteen major oil producing and consuming countries. We analyze the short-run and long-run desirability of energy sector in the optimal portfolio of an investor with varying level of risk aversion; that is, risk averse and risk tolerant investors. Our results show that the portfolio demand for energy sector is myopic or short-run. For long-run investors, investing in a portfolio of equity market and government bonds is a better proposition. In addition, energy sector is more desirable for risk tolerant investors.
G19|Price disagreements and adjustments in index derivatives markets|We examine whether index futures and options markets disagree with regard to their underlying spot prices and the mechanism whereby futures and options prices adjust to eliminate the price disagreements by comparing the actual and option-implied futures prices. The analysis of the microstructure dataset indicates that the price disagreement rates between the two markets are relatively low and both futures and options prices are adjusted in the case of disagreements.
G19|Range-based and GARCH volatility estimation: Evidence from the French asset market|This paper aims to measure and compare French stock and bond market volatilities using various range-based volatility estimators and conditional heteroskedasticity models. Particularly, we measure volatility for stock returns related to five major companies operating in different sectors and four French bonds with different maturity dates and different reference indices.
G19|Corruption’s impact on foreign portfolio investment|Corruption has significant effects on a nation’s financial markets through its adverse impact on foreign portfolio investment (FPI). Yet, the effects of corruption on FPI are nonlinear and reverse J-shaped, with intermediate levels of corruption yielding the most negative effects. Highly transparent nations, where a “level playing field” exists between foreign and local investors due to lack of information asymmetries related to corruption, attract the most foreign investment. However, at the margin, very corrupt countries attract more investment than moderately corrupt countries because a “perverse level playing field” in the former countries may put foreigners and locals on an even footing in terms of resolving asymmetric information problems. This nonlinear pattern is consistent with foreign investors’ desire to trade in markets where they are not at an informational disadvantage.
G19|Islamic vs conventional equities in a strategic asset allocation framework|This paper extends the existing literature by analysing the performance of Islamic vs conventional equities in a strategic asset allocation framework. I consider two types of investors: a faith-based investor and a conventional investor. The faith-based investor invests in shariah complaint equities only and excludes conventional equities from the asset menu. The conventional investor's asset menu comprises of both Islamic and conventional equities. The findings show that on a standalone basis Islamic equities exhibit both short-run and long-run desirable attributes for the faith-based investor. However, the results for the conventional investor show that the inclusion of conventional equities in the asset menu reduces the desirability of Islamic equities for short-run only. Thus, conventional equities are more desirable for long-run investors. The results are consistent for various levels of risk aversion. Another important finding is that exclusion of conventional equities from the asset menu of faith based investor results in substantial welfare losses.
G19|Liquidity, information, strategic trading in an electronic order book: New insights from the European carbon markets|The electronic limit order book (LOB hereafter) has rapidly become the primary way of trading European carbon assets over the 4 years of the EU ETS programme (2008–2012). In this first attempt of examining the informational content of an electronic order book, we evidence that order flow imbalances have a moderate capacity to predict short term price changes. However, we find that both LOB slope and immediacy costs help to forecast quote improvements and volatility in the next 30min. Further, we explain why informed trading is highly influential and show that it consists in mixing order splitting strategies and posting fleeting orders once the asymmetric information is reduced (Rosu, 2009). Overall, the consolidated status of the order book mirrors a high level of market uncertainty and a low degree of informational efficiency. In this way, strategic trading can in itself explain some of order book properties, independently of the degree of traders’ sophistication and market competition.
G19|The Impact of Minimum Return Guarantees on Management of Mandatory Pension Funds in Croatia|Mandatory pension funds in Croatia are defined contribution funds, meaning the investment risk is transferred to fund members. However, fund members are entitled to a guaranteed relative return: pension companies have to set aside a guarantee deposit that would be activated in case of underperformance. In this article, we quantify the risk of activation of the guarantee scheme and explore the impact of return guarantees on the way pension funds are managed. Findings suggest that the risk of activation of the guarantee scheme is quite low. We also find some evidence of herding among portfolio managers, as pension fund management companies could further reduce the risk of activation of the guarantee scheme by aligning their portfolios with competitors.
G19|Obesity and Household Financial Distress|Obesity provides a potentially informative signal about individualsâ€™ choices and preferences. Using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) data, we estimate that debt delinquency is 20 percent higher among the obese than the non-obese after controlling for an extensive set of financial and economic credit risk factors. The economic significance of obesity for delinquencies is comparable to that of job displacements. Obesity is particularly informative about delinquencies among those with low credit risk. In terms of channels, we find that the conditional obesity effect is partially mediated through health, but is not attributable to individualsâ€™ attitudes, time and risk preferences, or cognitive skills.
G19|Financial reforms and credit growth in Nigeria: empirical insights from ARDL and ECM techniques| In the last 37 years, Nigeria has undergone several stages of financial reforms with different impacts on the economy. This paper analyses the impact of these financial reforms on credit growth in Nigeria using annual data from 1980 to 2016. The research work hinges on the theoretical underpinning of McKinnon-Shaw hypothesis on the relevance of financial reforms in a lagging economy. Analysing the data with autoregressive distributed lag error correction representation and bounds testing techniques, we find evidence supporting this hypothesis, and specifically that at higher real interest rates there is increased financial intermediation evidenced by credit growth. Other findings are that in the long-run, financial system deposits, inflation rate and per capita GDP are strong asymmetrical predictors of credit growth and real interest rates (the financial reform indicator), while the short-run relationships are indicator-specific. We further show that a long-run cointegration relationship exists between domestic credit and other covariates and likewise between the real interest rate and its regressors.
G19|Extreme movements of the Russian stock market and their consequences for management and economic modeling|The article presents the results of testing the degree of heavy-tailedness for Russian companies’ returns distributions. The estimation is based on the robust approach of log-log rank-size regressions with the optimal shift and correct standard errors. The obtained results indicate that the Russian stock market is somewhat more prone to extreme movements when compared to those of the developed as well as some developing countries. In certain cases such behavior may lead to unreliability of standard statistical methods based on variance and correlations, to negative value of portfolio diversification as well as to unreliability of some popular risk-management techniques. The obtained results may be also relevant for macroeconomic forecasting.
G19|The Risk-Taking Channel in the US: A GVAR Approach|Employing data from thirty large banks in the US, we examine banks' risk-taking behaviour in response to monetary policy shocks. Our investigation provides support for the presence of a risk-taking channel: banks' nonperforming loans increase in medium to long run following an expansionary monetary policy shock. We also find that banks' capital structure plays an important role in explaining bank's risk-taking appetite. Impulse response analysis shows that shocks emanating from larger banks spillover to the rest of the sector but no such effect is observed for smaller banks. The results are confirmed for banks' Z-score.
G19|Quantile relationships between standard, diffusion and jump betas across Japanese banks|The ability of the banking sector to absorb unexpected news is critical to its ability to disseminate relevant information to the financial markets and real economy. Using high frequency financial data and quantile regression techniques we characterise some stylised facts about standard betas, diffusion betas and jump betas and the relationships between them for Japanese bank stocks and portfolios. Data are for the period 2001–2012 at 5-min frequency. We find that jump betas, which relate to the arrival of unexpected news, are on average higher and more dispersed than the diffusion betas across Japanese banks. While the standard beta is a weighted average of the diffusion and jump betas, the magnitudes of the weights differ significantly across quantiles (the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th), indicating a non-linearity in how jump information is incorporated across the quantiles. On average, small bank stocks and portfolios have smaller diffusion betas and smaller jump betas than large bank stocks and portfolios. While there are no significant differences between the jump-diffusion beta ratios when conditioned by market capitalisation, during times of financial crisis small banks have significantly higher jump beta-diffusion beta ratios than large banks on average, indicating that during time of financial crisis smaller Japanese banks face much higher relative jump risks than larger Japanese banks.
G19|The Evaluation of Working Capital in Airline Companies Which Proceed in Bist|The working capital like cash and liquid assets runs the facilities and supports daily activities of firms. This kind of capital is essential to continuity of activities, increase of volume, maintain credibility, reduce impacts of risks and to overcome with extraordinary situation. The working capital management is very important for making profits from activities, especially for dynamic sectors like aviation. The aviation industry which airline companies operate is a very dynamic sector. In this sector working capital has to be managed very professionally and carefully by airline companies. This study aims to assess the airline companiesâ€™ working capital in terms of effectiveness. Airline companies which shares traded on BIST will be sample of this study.
G19|Gauging financial conditions in South Africa|This paper investigates the relevance of financial conditions indices (FCIs) as an additional gauge of South Africa’s economic metabolism. As a starting point, a background is provided on FCIs in terms of evolution, methodologies and uses. In general, FCIs were found to have a very broad definition, are used for different purposes and can be calculated with different statistical techniques. The first step in developing an FCI for South Africa was to identify a purpose for it. From the purpose followed the data selection, sourced from regular updated financial data since 2003. The selection was differentiated from other South Afri-can FCIs by including commodity prices, as well as BER financial survey data. The final selection of indicators was tested for unit roots. The second process was the calculation of weights, in which case the principle components method was used. However, to avoid revising the historical data of the FCI each new month, a real-time principle component series was constructed. This method implies that the weights are recalculated every month, based on a rolling window of 60 months historical data, starting from 2005 onwards. In the third and final step, the real-time principle component series was purged from the real-time nominal GDP growth rate (capturing both output and inflation). The purged real-time principle component series was taken as the final FCI. The impact of the global financial crisis and the drastic monetary policy that followed is clearly visible in the FCI. The periodical divergence between the FCI and the real economy also served as an indication on the effectiveness of monetary policy. This FCI was found, over shorter horizons, to lead economic growth by nine months, and it improved on a naive forecast of GDP growth.
G19|Instrumentos alternativos de financiación para las cooperativas españolas<BR>[Alternative financing instruments for spanish cooperative]|La búsqueda de financiación constituye un quehacer permanente de la empresa, que se agudiza, particularmente, en los momentos de crisis económica y afecta, también, a las cooperativas. La legislación cooperativa pone a disposición de estas entidades diversos instrumentos de financiación externa a través de la emisión de valores (obligaciones; títulos participativos; participaciones especiales), a ellos se añaden las cuentas en participación, aunque sin mucho detalle en los textos legales. En el trabajo indagamos sus posibilidades, fijándonos, especialmente, en esas últimas; buscamos clarificar su régimen jurídico y contrastar sus potencialidades como un instrumento técnico, alternativo, para la financiación en el ámbito de las sociedades cooperativas. En fin, vemos también la incidencia de la reciente Ley 5/2015, de fomento de la financiación empresarial, en el sector del cooperativo y terminamos proponiendo algunas adaptaciones normativas.
G19|Is Governance Related to Investment Performance and Asset Allocation? Empirical Evidence from Swiss Pension Funds|This study investigates the relationship between governance, investment performance and asset allocation of pension funds in Switzerland. Our sample includes survey data from 139 Swiss occupational pension plans for which we develop a governance metric comprising attributes of organisational design, management incentives, target setting, investment strategy, investment processes, risk management, monitoring, and transparency. We find empirical evidence that pension fund governance is positively related to excess returns, benchmark outperformance and Sharpe ratios. Pension funds in the top governance quartile outperform those in the bottom quartile by approximately 1% in terms of average excess returns and benchmark deviation. Furthermore, our study results indicate that asset allocation decisions are not related to governance, but rather to institutional factors.
G19|Squeezing the bears: Cornering risk and limits on arbitrage during the 'British Bicycle Mania', 1896-1898|"Can limits to arbitrage explain historical asset price reversals? During the ""British Bicycle Mania"" of 1896-1898, cycle share prices rose by 200 per cent before falling 76 per cent from their peak value. This paper argues that arbitrage during this episode was limited by the risk of being cornered after short selling shares. Three corners in cycle company shares occurred during the ""mania"", two of which resulted in substantial losses for short-sellers. The first corner corresponded with a structural break in cycle share prices, and crosssectional analysis reveals that companies for which cornering risk was greater experienced more pronounced mispricing."
G19|Technological revolutions and speculative finance: Evidence from the British Bicycle Mania|"Technological revolutions are often accompanied by substantial stock price reversals, but previous literature has produced competing explanations for why this is the case. This paper brings new evidence to this debate using data from the innovation-driven British Bicycle Mania of 1895-1900, in which cycle share prices rose by over 200 per cent before collapsing by more than 75 per cent. These price patterns are not fully explained by fundamentals or by changes in the nature of risk associated with cycle shares. Instead, the evidence from the Bicycle Mania supports the hypothesis of Perez (2009), who argues that new technology, high short-term profits, and loose monetary conditions increase the level of speculative investment, ""decoupling"" share prices from fundamentals."
G19|Is the Exchange Rate a Factor of Bank Liquidity Changes? Study of the Czech Republic|The effect of the exchange rate is often discussed in connection with economic performance, net export and inflation rate. Within the context of current discussions, we aim to examine the influence of the CZK/EUR exchange rate on changes in liquid assets in the Czech banking sector. The scope of our examination also covers the effects of GDP, CPI, one-month PRIBOR rate and the effects of ten-year government bond yield. The selected period is 2003–2014; monthly data taken from the CNB ARAD database is used. To verify the effect of the monitored variables on liquid assets in the Czech banking sector, we employed the regression analysis methods applied on financial and economic time series. The results show the effect of the CZK/EUR exchange rate and PRIBOR on changes in the liquid assets of Czech banks. The paper analyzes the identified causes and connections, and discusses possible consequences.
G19|An empirical analysis of Eurozone government bonds liquidity: Determinants, predictability and implications for the new bank prudential rules|Based on a large and representative data set we investigate the liquidity of Eurozone government bonds in ordinary times as well as in periods of market turmoil looking at the behavior of several liquidity indicators from 2005 to 2012. We find that the effect of adverse market conditions on liquidity strongly depends on individual bond’s characteristics. We then analyze the relative performance of different liquidity metrics. This allows us to discuss the appropriateness of the inclusion criteria for liquid assets used by the Basel Committee and the European Union. Our evidence argues for rules on HQLAs that should constrain the eligibility of government bonds depending on their characteristics (primarily, duration and rating). We also study the persistence of liquidity measures over time to assess which indicators might be used to anticipate future bond liquidity, especially ahead of market-wide crises. Based on rank correlation analysis we find that a wide array of liquidity metrics can provide stable indications over time.
G19|To Share or Not to Share? Uncovered Losses in a Derivatives Clearinghouse|This paper studies how the allocation of residual losses affects trading and welfare in a central counterparty. I compare loss sharing under two loss-allocation mechanisms – variation margin haircutting and cash calls – and study the privately and socially optimal degree of loss sharing. For losses allocated using variation margin haircuts, I find that trading volume is sensitive to the degree of loss sharing and to the risk sensitivity of skin-in-the-game capital. By contrast, for cash calls, the degree of loss sharing does not affect trading volume but instead affects the chance that a cash call is honoured, which can constrain the recovery of funds. A welfare analysis characterizes the market outcome and compares it with the social optimum.
G19|An Analysis of the Impact of External Financial Risks on the Sovereign Risk Premium of Latin American Economies|This article presents a quantification of the response of the sovereign risk premium (EMBI) of a group of Latin American countries, to unexpected changes (shocks) in external financial variables. The main contribution of the paper is to use the estimated parameters of a vector autoregression (VAR) model using a special Cholesky variance-covariance decomposition as a tool for risk scenario’s assessment. The proposed interpretation of the estimated matrix allows for the quantification of the impact of more than one shock and also to quantify spillovers. A VAR is estimated for each country (Colombia, Chile, Mexico, and Peru) in monthly frequency that includes China’s and Brazil’s EMBI, the global volatility index (VIX), plus the value of the dollar against a basket of currencies (Broad Index) and a proxy of the slope of the US Treasury yield curve (Spread US). The VIX and Broad Index shocks turn out to have a relatively homogenous effect on each country’s EMBI, while shocks to the China and Brazil EMBI are more heterogeneous. For the case of Chile, we further study three alternative risk scenarios, incorporating the copper price as an additional variable. The most disruptive scenario at the time when the shock hits is the “Volatility driven” one. Nevertheless, it is the “Emerging markets” scenario (namely one with simultaneous shocks to China’ and Brazil’s EMBI) the one with the most harmful dynamics, as it dyes out slower. Finally, a “Copper price bust” scenario, in which the price of copper drops significantly in addition to a shock to the EMBI China, is the one with the least effect as the price of copper is relatively less affected by shocks to other variables, displaying lower spillovers.
G19|A Bayesian Estimate of the Pricing Kernel|The focus of this article is the Pricing Kernel (PK), the building-block of asset pricing theory. In the classical framework the shape of the PK is monotonically decreasing in the stock price, nevertheless empirical evidence suggests that the PK is locally increasing in the interval around the 0% return and has an irregular behaviour in the tails of the distribution. We argue that these deviations, known as pricing kernel puzzle, derive from a dis-homogeneity between the physical and the risk neutral (RN) measure and can be corrected by embedding some forward looking information into the physical measure. Our proposed methodology combines the information from historical returns with that coming from the RN measure through a non-parametric Poisson-Dirichlet process. As a result the irregular behaviour of the PK in the tails of the distribution is reduced and the monotonicity is ensured in almost all cases.
G19|An Empirical Test of the Validity of the Capital Asset Pricing Model on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange|We test the empirical validity of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) using cross-sectional stock returns on 31 stocks listed on the ZSE between March 2009 and February 2014. We conclude that, although the explanatory power of beta tends to fall rapidly for prediction horizons >6 months, beta significantly explains average monthly stock returns on the ZSE. Tests to validate the CAPM reject its validity for the ZSE however, primarily due to liquidity and skewness anomalies. We nevertheless fail to detect any size effects. There is encouraging evidence to suggest that the CAPM performs reasonably well in predicting average monthly returns over prediction horizons of between 3 and 6 months. We recommend that investors and analysts must exercise extreme caution in applying the CAPM. Furthermore, we discourage strategies based on the existence of a size premium on the ZSE. Instead, investors may consider neglected and negatively skewed stocks, albeit over appropriate horizons. Further research on other African Stock Markets will help verify if the optimal performance range of the CAPM is indeed 3-6 months. Development of standard continental proxy market portfolios will also improve the estimation of betas and enhance results of cross-country tests of the CAPM.
G19|Exploring the Relationship between Liquidity Ratios and Indicators of Financial Performance: An Analytical Study on Food Industrial Companies Listed in Amman Bursa|The study aims to examine the relationship between liquidity ratios and indicators of financial performance (profitability ratios) in the food industrial companies listed in Amman Bursa during the period (2012-2014). The study sample included (8) industrial companies which operate in the field of food listed in Amman bursa. The results showed no relationship between all liquidity ratios and the gross profit margin, while there is a weak positive relationship between the current ratio and each of the operating profit margins and the net profit margin, as the study pointed to the existence of a positive relationship between (quick ratios, defensive interval ratio) and operating cash flow margin. There is a positive relationship between liquidity ratios (current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio) and return on assets
G19|An Examination of the Month-of-the-year Effect at Damascus Securities Exchange|This paper explores the existence of the month-of-the-year effect in a newly established exchange of Damascus securities exchange. It employs ordinary least squares estimates and dummy variables for the whole working period of the exchange from 2010 to 2015. This paper confirms the existence of positive and significant returns during May compared to remaining months. Average returns in May are six percent higher than average returns during the rest of the year. A possible explanation for May effect is dividend month premium suggested by Hartzmark and Solomon (2013)
G19|Pricing of foreign exchange risk and market segmentation: Evidence from Pakistan's equity market|This paper undertakes empirical analysis to investigate whether foreign exchange rate risk is priced, and the extent to which the Pakistani equity market is integrated into world equity markets. For the period January 1993–January 2013, we investigate unconditional pricing using the iterated generalized method of moments, employing industry and size portfolios formed from 180 firms traded on the Karachi Stock Exchange. Using the multi beta asset pricing model, we find that exchange risk is priced into the Pakistani equity market over the full sample period. Moreover, we find strong evidence that the Pakistani equity market is segmented from world markets, especially in the post 9/11 period.
G19|Herding among local individual investors: Evidence from online and offline trading|We examine the hypothesis of whether an investor’s decision, such as buying or selling a stock in a given day or month, correlates with the decisions of his or her neighbors. Using the LSV (1992) herding measure, we find that local offline investors show stronger herding than investors across the country.
G19|Considering all microstructure effects: The extension of a trade indicator model|By considering various market microstructure effects, this letter proposes a comprehensive trade indicator model incorporating trade duration, order sizes, bid–ask spreads, and market depth into a unified framework. Examining the intraday price behavior of the KOSPI200 futures market, we find that (i) fast trading indicates informed trading, (ii) stealth trading does not prevail, (iii) order-processing costs reach economies of scale, and (iv) liquidity significantly affects investors’ order submission decisions in the highly liquid market.
G19|Liquidation discount—a novel application of ARFIMA–GARCH|Urgent liquidation of a large stock portfolio entails a liquidity cost—i.e., a “liquidation discount”. This is the market impact discount in value yielded by the immediate sale of the portfolio relative to its in-hand market value calculated from prevailing market prices. For any portfolio, the day-to-day liquidation discount “at risk” (i.e., the liquidation discount that would be suffered if liquidation were undertaken) is variable. This liquidation discount risk is additional to price risk and will be of concern to portfolio managers that may, at short notice, wish to convert substantial stockholdings to cash. We obtain daily time series of instantaneous log liquidation discount for variously sized portfolios of Australian stocks and determine that these time series are best modeled with an Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARFIMA–GARCH) process. We then formulate a liquidation discount-at-risk measure with which portfolio managers can budget for the future cost of portfolio liquidity for a chosen liquidation horizon and confidence level.
G19|Futures trading with information asymmetry and OTC predominance: Another look at the volume/volatility relations in the European carbon markets|This paper constitutes the first exercise of analysing the European carbon market efficiency from a double perspective combining both nature of execution venues (screen vs. OTC trading) and their volatility/liquidity relations. Using a bivariate asymmetric GJR-GARCH model, we first document that OTC (exchange traded) trading volume shows consistent bi-(uni) directional Granger causality to our volatility estimates, consistent with greater responsiveness of the OTC (exchange traded) market to changes in market-wide (idiosyncratic) risks. Second, we report significant contemporaneous and lagged positive causality of OTC derivatives volume on spot/futures volatility confirming that the Sequential Information Arrival Hypothesis (SIAH) applies. Third, we find that the one-way causality from OTC to futures volumes is mainly driven by heterogeneous investor beliefs: trading volume provides an indication on how (private) information is dispersed and held at different levels rather than proxying information signal itself. After rejecting execution venues' substitutability, we advocate for systematic clearing and netting of OTC positions through a unique clearing house and reporting rules to identify speculation in line with Mifid (Art. 59) proposals.
G19|Risk spillovers across the energy and carbon markets and hedging strategies for carbon risk|This study examines the risk spillovers between energy futures prices and Europe-based carbon futures contracts. We use a Markov regime-switching dynamic correlation, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (MS-DCC-GARCH) model in order to capture the time variations and structural breaks in the spillovers. We further evaluate the optimal weights, hedging effectiveness, and dynamic hedging strategies for the MS-DCC-GARCH model based on both the regime-dependent and regime-independent optimal hedge ratios. We finally complement our analysis by examining the in- and out-of sample hedging performances for alternative strategies. Our results mainly show significant volatility and time-varying risk transmission from energy markets to carbon market. We also find that spot and futures segments of the emission markets exhibit time-varying correlations and volatile hedging effectiveness. The subsample estimates show significant changes in the hedge effectiveness over the different phases of the European carbon market. These results have important investment and policy implications.
G19|A consistent two-factor model for pricing temperature derivatives|In the past decade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange began to trade weather derivatives to hedge weather risk. The pricing of weather derivatives is challenging since the underlying is not tradable and thus classical arbitrage approaches have to be used with caution. In typical pricing approaches all information available to the market is assumed to be incorporated in the underlying and thus forward-looking information about non-tradable assets such as meteorological forecasts is often ignored. In this article, we analyze a new pricing methodology for temperature derivatives that accounts for forward-looking information. More precisely, we provide an empirical back-up for the theoretical framework of so-called consistent factor models for temperature forecast curves introduced previously in the literature and put this pricing approach into practice. First, we perform a thorough statistical analysis of meteorological forecast curve data. Second, based on this analysis we propose a specific consistent two-factor model, derive explicit temperature derivative prices, and calibrate the market price of risk (MPR). The power of the model is demonstrated against alternative pricing models. This confirms that at least parts of the irregularity of the MPR observed in earlier studies are not due to irregular risk perception but rather due to information misspecification.
G19|Analyzing hedging strategies for fixed income portfolios: A Bayesian approach for model selection|During the recent European sovereign debt crisis, returns on EMU government bond portfolios experienced substantial volatility clustering, leptokurtosis and skewed returns as well as correlation spikes. Asset managers invested in European government bonds had to derive new hedging strategies to deal with changing return properties and higher levels of uncertainty. In this environment, conditional time series approaches such as GARCH models might be better suited to achieve a superior hedging performance relative to unconditional hedging approaches such as OLS. The aim of this study is to test innovative hedging strategies for EMU bond portfolios for non-crisis and crisis periods. We analyze single and composite hedges with the German Bund and the Italian BTP futures contracts and evaluate the hedging effectiveness in an out-of-sample setting. The empirical analysis includes OLS, constant conditional correlation (CCC), and dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) multivariate GARCH models. We also introduce a Bayesian composite hedging strategy, attempting to combine the strengths of OLS and GARCH models, thereby endogenizing the dilemma of selecting the best estimation model. Our empirical results demonstrate that the Bayesian composite hedging strategy achieves the highest hedging effectiveness and compares particularly favorable to OLS during the recent sovereign debt crisis. However, capturing these benefits requires low transactions cost and efficiently functioning futures markets.
G19|A note on the relationship between high-frequency trading and latency arbitrage|We develop three artificial stock markets populated with two types of market participants — HFT scalpers and aggressive high frequency traders (HFTrs). We simulate real-life trading at the millisecond interval by applying Strongly Typed Genetic Programming (STGP) to real-time data from Cisco Systems, Intel and Microsoft. We observe that HFT scalpers are able to calculate NASDAQ NBBO (National Best Bid and Offer) at least 1.5ms ahead of the NASDAQ SIP (Security Information Processor), resulting in a large number of latency arbitrage opportunities. We also demonstrate that market efficiency is negatively affected by the latency arbitrage activity of HFT scalpers, with no countervailing benefit in volatility or any other measured variable. To improve market quality, and eliminate the socially wasteful arms race for speed, we propose batch auctions in every 70ms of trading.
G19|Overseas market shocks and VKOSPI dynamics: A Markov-switching approach|Using a three-regime Markov-switching framework, with time-varying transition probabilities and exogenous state variables, we find that overseas (US) market factors are more significant than domestic (Korean) factors in explaining VKOSPI dynamics. US financial variables are also more important than domestic variables in modeling time-varying transition probabilities, particularly during crisis periods.
G19|Weekday variation in the leverage effect: A puzzle|There is large variation in the leverage effect on each weekday. In the past 15 years, the average difference between the impact of negative and positive stock return innovations on future volatility in the S&P 500 Index is 45% on Monday, 14% on Tuesday, 60% on Wednesday, 6% on Thursday, and 28% on Friday. This variation is not predicted by any prevailing hypothesis on why there is a leverage effect.
G19|Trading activities of short-sellers around index deletions: Evidence from the Nikkei 225|Focusing on index deletions, which are events strongly associated with temporal liquidity shocks, we analyze the trading activities of short sellers around these events. Using daily short selling data from Japan, we find that short sellers show trading patterns consistent with the predatory trading in Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2005). Short sellers appear to earn profits by selling short immediately after the announcement and buying back close to the effective day. We also find that intense short selling around the announcement date results in larger subsequent return reversals. The results suggest that short selling disturbs price efficiency around the index deletions.
G19|Pricing and hedging basket options with exact moment matching|Theoretical models applied to option pricing should take into account the empirical characteristics of financial time series. In this paper, we show how to price basket options when the underlying asset prices follow a displaced log-normal process with jumps, capable of accommodating negative skewness and excess kurtosis. Our technique involves Hermite polynomial expansion that can match exactly the first m moments of the model-implied basket return. This method is shown to provide superior results for basket options not only with respect to pricing but also for hedging.
G19|Polynomial diffusion models for life insurance liabilities|In this paper we study the pricing and hedging problem of a portfolio of life insurance products under the benchmark approach, where the reference market is modelled as driven by a state variable following a polynomial diffusion on a compact state space. Such a model can be used to guarantee not only the positivity of the OIS short rate and the mortality intensity, but also the possibility of approximating both pricing formula and hedging strategy of a large class of life insurance products by explicit formulas.
G19|Shorting at close range: A tale of two types|We examine returns, order flow, and market conditions in the minutes before, during, and after NYSE and Nasdaq short sales. We find two distinct types of short sales: those that provide liquidity, and those that demand it. Liquidity-supplying shorts are strongly contrarian at intraday horizons. They trade when spreads are unusually wide, facing greater adverse selection. Liquidity-demanding shorts trade when spreads are narrow and tend to follow short-term price declines. These results support a competitive rational expectations model where both market-makers and informed traders short, indicating that these two shorting types are integral to both price discovery and liquidity provision.
G19|Sin stock returns and investor sentiment|This paper studies the impact of investor sentiment on a portfolio formed of sin stocks—publicly traded companies in the alcohol, tobacco, and gaming industries. Using a variety of sentiments-augmented asset pricing models, this research examines whether investor sentiment is a risk factor for sin stock returns. It also studies if the abnormal returns – found in the literature – for sin stocks persist after controlling for investor sentiment. Furthermore, we utilize a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity-in-mean (GARCH) model to study the relationship between investor sentiment and the sin portfolio's conditional volatility. Our findings show that both individual and institutional investor sentiment are priced factors in sin stock returns. Furthermore, after controlling for the role of investor sentiment, the asset-pricing results suggest that the abnormal returns for sin stocks found in previous studies disappear. The results from the GARCH models indicate that investor sentiment has a significant impact on sin stocks’ conditional volatility.
G19|Growing pains: The evolution of new stock index futures in emerging markets|Analyzing the first seven years of trading in Turkish stock index futures (BIST 30) and contrasting that to the progress of Korean (KOSPI 200) and Taiwanese (TAIEX) markets, we find that BIST 30 initially experiences a persistent mispricing and speculative trading similar to KOSPI 200 but it also experiences the largest increase in hedge effectiveness, becoming hedger-dominated similar to TAIEX. Most significantly, we demonstrate that spot market short-sell quote volume is a good measure of short-sale constraints and a significant determinant of mispricing in BIST 30. A methodological contribution of this paper is a four-equation multivariate VAR framework to analyze the volatility impact of futures.
G19|Liquidity Stress Testing with Second-Round Effects: Application to the Czech Banking Sector|We build a macro stress-testing model for banks’ market and funding liquidity risks with a survival period of one month. The model takes into account the impact of both bank-specific and market-wide scenarios and includes second-round effects of shocks due to banks’ feedback reactions. The model has three phases: (i) the formation of a balance-sheet liquidity shortfall, (ii) the reaction of banks on financial markets, and (iii) the feedback effects of shocks, such as secondary deposit outflows for reacting banks and additional haircuts on securities. During each phase, we recount the liquidity buffer and examine whether banks hold a sufficiently large amount of liquid assets to be able to survive the liquidity tension in their balance sheets. The framework is applied to the Czech banking sector to illustrate typical calibrations and the impact on banks.
G19|Identity, Identification and Identifiers : The Global Legal Entity Identifier System|Identity is a critical concept in the rational interactions of any set of objects involving subject-object relationships. The objects must be distinguished according to some framework in order for such relationships to have meaning. In the world of economic systems, relationships such as ownership and responsibility require specific parties to be fixed with a high degree of certainty. This need is particularly strong in financial markets, where transactions can take place in nanoseconds. This paper discusses a particular framework for defining economic actors, the Global Legal Entity Identifier System (GLEIS), which was initiated for the purpose of creating greater transparency about participants in financial markets and transactions.
G19|Funding Liquidity Risk and the Cross-section of MBS Returns|"This paper shows that funding liquidity risk is priced in the cross-section of excess returns on agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). We derive a measure of funding liquidity risk from dollar-roll implied financing rates (IFRs), which reflect security-level costs of financing positions in the MBS market. We show that factors representing higher net MBS supply are generally associated with higher IFRs, or higher funding costs. In addition, we find that exposure to systematic funding liquidity shocks embedded in the IFRs is compensated in the cross-section of expected excess returns| agency MBS that are better hedges to funding liquidity shocks on average deliver lower excess returns-and that these premiums are separate from the premiums associated with prepayment risks."
G19|Assessment of Real Estate Units as Mortgage Subjects in Agricultural Sector of the Economy|The article investigates methodological and practical bases of assessment of real estate units â€“ integral property complexes in credit financing of agricultural sector of Ukraine's economy. Implemented expert assessment of buildings and agricultural enterprises as integral property complexes with a view to their subsequent use as collateral. It was revealed that the existing regulations, the provisions of which are indispensable for the implementation of the expert monetary evaluation of land plots, namely the Law of Ukraine 'About the evaluation of land', National standards of evaluation and Methodology of expert monetary evaluation of land, need to be improved in terms of determining the precise requirements for assessment to ensure its objectivity. As evidenced by the results of research, expert monetary assessment of structures is carried out using the same methods as for the land plots (income capitalization method, comparing the sale prices, cost plus method), but with one essential feature. Unlike land plots the buildings have a certain period of its economic life, what on a mandatory basis should be considered when applying the income capitalization method.
G19|Stock exchanges’ development in selected Danube Region EU member states: The way ahead|The research paper will analyze the current state of development of the capital markets of selected Danube Region EU member states and will evaluate quantitative and qualitative economic indicators on these stock markets, as well as factors promoting their development. Neighboring countries have similar cultures and well-developed business relations. The expected positive external effects from deepened intra-regional cooperation processes are along the lines of economies of scale, diminishing market uncertainties, boosted liquidity and improved depth of capital markets.
G19|Can negative interest rates really affect option pricing? Empirical evidence from an explicitly solvable stochastic volatility model| The profound financial crisis generated by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the European sovereign debt crisis in 2011 have caused negative values of government bond yields both in the USA and in the EURO area. This paper investigates whether the use of models which allow for negative interest rates can improve option pricing and implied volatility forecasting. This is done with special attention to foreign exchange and index options. To this end, we carried out an empirical analysis on the prices of call and put options on the US S&P 500 index and Eurodollar futures using a generalization of the Heston model in the stochastic interest rate framework. Specifically, the dynamics of the option’s underlying asset is described by two factors: a stochastic variance and a stochastic interest rate. The volatility is not allowed to be negative, but the interest rate is. Explicit formulas for the transition probability density function and moments are derived. These formulas are used to estimate the model parameters efficiently. Three empirical analyses are illustrated. The first two show that the use of models which allow for negative interest rates can efficiently reproduce implied volatility and forecast option prices (i.e. S&P index and foreign exchange options). The last studies how the US three-month government bond yield affects the US S&P 500 index.
G19|Assessing financial distress dependencies in OTC markets: a new approach using trade repositories data|Abstract In this paper, we study the relationships among financial market sub-segments as a way to identify potential financial distress through increased co-movements among them. To study how sub-markets are mutually co-dependent, we combine granular data on over-the-counter derivatives by trade repositories and the joint probability of distress (JPoD) approach introduced by the International Monetary Fund. We define an indicator that combines several distress drivers and observe that results on co-dependencies are similar to those that would be expected: similarities between financial and contractual terms seem to be responsible for stronger co-movements among sub-markets. However, high values for JPoD even in correspondence of quite dissimilar sub-markets suggest the presence of other drivers that should be investigated in future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study on systemic risk assessment based on micro-founded trade repositories’ data on interest rate swaps.
G19|The Role of Investor Type in the Fee Structures of Pension Plans|Abstract We examine the role of the investor type in the fee structure of pension plans. Our examination uses a data set of employer-sponsored and individual private pension funds in Spain. We find different determinants of the fees between these two pension plans. We find evidence of market penetration strategies in individual plans but none in employer-sponsored plans. In these plans, the fees are negatively related to their financial groups’ market share, whereas in individual plans this relation is negative for management fees but positive for custodian fees. Further, except in the case of custodian fees in individual plans, we find that all fees diminish when the custodian and management firms belong to different financial groups.
G19|REITs and market friction|We examine differences in price delay for a sample of real estate investment trust (REIT) and non-REIT matched pairs. Results suggest an economically and statistically higher level of price delay for REIT securities, which implies heightened frictions that increase the time needed for new information to be impounded into the prices of REIT shares. The primary drivers for the observed delay differential include differences in idiosyncratic volatility, market risk, and the number of days traded. Within-REIT determinants of delay confirm findings for the pooled sample of matched pairs. Importantly, we infer find that REIT investors are not compensated for restricted information flow, as excess returns are unrelated to the price delay.

G19|Abnormal real operations, real earnings management, and subsequent crashes in stock prices|We study the impact of firms’ abnormal business operations on their future crash risk in stock prices. Computed based on real earnings management (REM) models, firms’ deviation in real operations (DROs) from industry norms is shown to be positively associated with their future crash risk. This association is incremental to that between discretionary accruals (DAs) and crash risk found by prior studies. Moreover, after Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002, DRO’s predictive power for crash risk strengthens substantially, while DA’s predictive power essentially dissipates. These results are consistent with the prior finding that managers shift from accrual earnings management to REM after SOX. We further develop a suspect-firm approach to capture firms’ use of DRO for REM purposes. This analysis shows that REM-firms experience a significant increase in crash risk in the following year. These findings suggest that the impact of DRO on crash risk is at least partially through REM. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016
G19|Decimalization, IPO aftermath, and liquidity|Abstract We investigate the effect of decimalization on the aftermarket trading of NYSE-listed IPOs. We find that the relation between bid–ask spread and underpricing becomes negative post-decimalization, suggesting that benefits from the increased price competition accrue more to hot IPOs. The quoted depth is generally smaller post-decimalization due to a higher probability of front running, which aggravates the cost of adverse selection and limit order submission. We show that underwriters continue to provide price support but are only willing to cover the initial short position, if profitable to do so. Decimal pricing does not affect the flipping strategy of institutions for cold IPOs as they are likely bound by the underwriter’s price support and their share allocation. Institutions, however, tend to flip more hot IPOs during the post- than in the pre-decimalization period, suggesting that the cost of flipping is lower for shares with a substantial price run-up during aftermarket trading.
G19|Measuring and profiling financial literacy in South Africa|Microeconomic theories of financial behaviour tend to assume that consumers possess financial skills necessary to undertake related financial decisions. We investigate this assumption by exploring the distribution of financial literacy among South Africans. In the absence of a standard measure, a financial literacy index is constructed for the country using data collected on attitudes (towards), access to and use of financial services over the period 2005 – 2009. We use the index to examine the extent to which differences in financial literacy correlate with demographic and economic characteristics. The Index reveals substantial variation in financial literacy by age, education, province and race. Overall, demographic characteristics contribute up to 10% of the financial literacy differences among individuals in South Africa. These results can be used to guide policy makers where to place more emphasis in terms of financial education for South Africans.
G19|Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading Strategies: A Literature Review|The advances in computer and communication technologies have created new opportunities for improving, extending the application of or even developing new trading strategies. Transformations have been observed both at the level of investment decisions, as well as at the order execution layer. This review paper describes how traditional market participants, such as market-makers and order anticipators, have been reshaped and how new trading techniques relying on ultra-low-latency competitive advantage, such as electronic “front running”, function. Also, the natural conflict between liquidity-consumers and liquidity-suppliers has been taken to another level, due to the proliferation of algorithmic trading and electronic liquidity provision strategies.
G19|Social Media and Capital Markets â€“ an Overview|A growing body of research and practical applications employ social media data as the proxy for a complex behavior of a society. This paper provides an overview of academic research related to a link between social media and capital markets. The theoretical rationale of this relationship is predominantly defined by behavioral finance. Behavioral finance augments the standard model of efficient markets and considers less rational factors like investorsâ€™ sentiment or public mood as influential for asset pricing and capital market volatility. In this context, social media is a novel tool enabling the collection of data about such less rational factors at the level of a society. The paper introduces social media data from a technical and economic point of view. In addition, it contributes to the theoretical construction of the transmission mechanism between social media and capital markets currently missing in the literature. Subsequently, the paper summarizes the main findings in this field and outlines future challenges in this research.
G19|How to set listing criteria for small and medium-sized enterprises in Hungary?|Since the onset of the crisis, several studies have demonstrated that the positive effect of bank lending on economic growth is limited. After a certain level, financial deepening has no positive effect on the real economy, and moreover the financial sector may actually have a negative effect on growth. Therefore, providing more diversified financing opportunities for the corporate sector is of key importance, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE) is taking a step in this direction now, by establishing a new stock exchange strategy for the next five years, i.e. it intends to actively open towards the SME segment as well. The objective of the study is to create a scoring system that may assist in finding those companies ? primarily in the SME sector ? for which it may be worth considering going public. We develop and test a quantitative scoring and ranking method on a database containing Hungarian corporate balance sheet and profit and loss account data. We present that there are companies in the SME sector for which it may be worth considering going public; moreover, the group of the top companies based on the ranking had better performance in the past than the companies currently appearing in the T and standard categories of the BSE.
G19|No More Weekend Effect|Before 1975, the mean weekend rate of return on the equal-weight (value-weight) stock market portfolio is significant -18bp (-19bp). After 1975, it is insignificant -5bp (-1bp). This break date is determined by a structural break test with unknown break date. The weekend effect is no longer an anomaly.
G19|New Directions in Crowdfunding|The fundraising campaigns realised through popular online crowdfunding platforms seem to be exhibiting unstoppable expansion, with the phenomenon reaching an increasing number of people and doubling its turnover year after year. Crowdfunding is one of the most dynamically growing segments of fintech but at the same time, the academic world is voicing justified scepticism in respect of the sustainability and operating background of the original model. For the time being, the position of banks is protected by the legislative and regulatory background, but digitally advanced users are seeking out wallet-friendly and convenient solutions for the administration of their financial affairs as well. According to certain estimates, bank revenues could drop by as much as 20% by 2023 due to the rise of the fintech sector, and one third of bank employees could lose their jobs in ten years. Equity-based crowdfunding has the potential to become an alternative to traditional corporate and project-financing techniques. The communityforming power of online fundraising platforms is strong, and certain campaigns may also serve market communication purposes.
G19|Statistica descriptivă a seriilor de timp financiare<BR>[Descriptive statistics of the financial time series]|Descriptive statistics facilitates the revealing of some important features of the financial variables evolutions. In this paper we present some indicators of the central tendency and the dispersion. We approach, also, the skewness and kurtosis of the financial variables.
G19|Forecast in Capital Markets|In the Schumpeterian technical and social innovations disruption age, we firmly believe that a big number of unlimited opportunities toward a new era of the ultra high frequency electronic trading in the foreign currencies exchange markets is being created due to an increasing application of the computations processing in the range of ultra high frequencies in the modern finances. In this book, we would like to focus on the capital markets in the finances, discussing a number of scientific methods for an accurate forecast of the foreign currencies exchange rates oscillations dynamics during the ultra high frequency electronic trading in the foreign currencies exchange markets in the short and long time periods. More specifically, we would like to precisely characterize the foreign currencies exchange rates at the ultra high frequencies electronic trading in the foreign currencies exchange markets in the short and long time periods, using the mathematical, financial, electronic and quantum analysis methods. In addition, we would like to propose the quantum winning virtuous strategies creation algorithm with the inductive, deductive, abductive and quantum logics to earn an increasing return premium during the ultra high frequencies electronic trading in the foreign currencies exchange markets in the short and long time periods.
G19|Particularitǎţi ale evoluţiei variabilelor financiare<BR>[Some particularities of the financial variables evolution]|This paper approaches some particularities of the financial variables evolution such as: the financial markets behaviors during bubbles or crisis, the systematic risks and the linkages among the international financial markets. It also presents some factors with significant influence on the financial variables evolution: the speculation and arbitrage, investors’ expectations and the monetary policy effects.
G19|The impact of the Great Lent and of the Nativity Fast on the Bucharest Stock Exchange|This paper explores the behavior of the Romanian capital market during the two period of fasting: the Great Lent and of the Nativity Fast. In this investigation we employ closing values of five indexes from Bucharest Stock Exchange for the period January 2007 - August 2016. The sample of data is divided into two sub-samples: the first sub-sample, from January 2007 to June 2012 is associated to a turbulent period on the financial markets, while the second sub-sample, from July 2012 to June 2016, corresponds to a rather quiet period of Romanian capital market. For the first sub-sample we found, only for one index, an increase of the mean returns during the Great Lent and a decline of volatility during the Nativity Fast. For the second sub-sample, the results indicate, for four indexes, the decrease of the mean returns during the Great Lent. We conclude that such evolutions could be associated to the practices of fasting but also to the impact of other factors such as the holiday spirit, the seasonal affective disorder or the year-end stock market behavior.
G19|When Financial Derivatives can be Applied to the Real Economy – The Case of Exotic Options in Corporate Finance|Product complexity of financial derivatives makes them little accessible to most investors. To help investors better understand these instruments, it is important to show how these sophisticated products work in a “real economy” context by focusing on the economic rationale rather than on quantitative skills. Exotic options are tailor-made derivatives known for their flexibility and accuracy. The present article aims to illustrate how these complex products can be used in corporate finance. Our work may present a three-fold interest. First, it provides an overview on the most common applications of exotic options in corporate finance, more precisely in long-term investment decisions, long-term financing decisions, capital structure analysis, and executive incentive compensations. Second, by putting emphasis on the economic rationale, it seems to be relatively accessible for non-sophisticated investors. Finally, it shows corporate managers how to benefit from technical advances made in financial markets through the application of these techniques in corporate finance.
G19|Asymmetric Effects of the Limit Order Book on Price Dynamics|We analyze whether the information in different parts of the limit order book affect prices differently. We distinguish between slopes of lower and higher levels of the bid and ask sides and include these four slope measures as well as midquote return and trade direction in a vector autoregressive model. Slope measures of the same side based on different levels affect both short- and long-run price dynamics quite differently, in line with the predictions based on recent theoretical models such as Foucault, Kadan, and Kandel (2005) and Rosu (2009). In a high frequency day trading exercise, we show that ignoring these asymmetries costs a trader approximately 25 basis points in daily profits, suggesting that the asymmetries are important not only statistically but also economically. Our statistical results are robust to using alternative definitions of slope measures and sample periods while our economic results are robust to trading under alternative assumptions such as trading slower speeds.
G19|Comparative Analysis of Corporate Distress Prediction Models: A Dynamic Performance Evaluation Framework|In practice, investors, portfolio managers, and regulators continuously assess and monitor the performance of corporations. Such assessment and monitoring exercise is typically performed using a variety of tools including prediction models of distress. With the enormous number of prediction models, a strand of literature has focused on comparing the performance of alternative distress prediction models. In this research, we explore dynamic modelling and prediction frameworks of corporate distress and propose new ones. A dynamic evaluation framework is also proposed to assess the relative performance of these dynamic models in predicting corporate distress using a sample of UK firms listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).
G19|Does gender diversity in the boardroom influence Tobin?s Q of Croatian listed firms?|Gender diversity has attracted attention of scientists and practitioners of different fields. Despite the efforts and progress that has been made towards achieving gender equality in the workplace this has remained the weak point especially in the context of management and supervisory board positions. Therefore, the authors wanted to investigate whether this is true for Croatian listed companies. The hypotheses that women in leading positions has a positive impact on performance Croatian listed companies is tested using Tobin?s Q indicator for the year 2014 whereas explanatory variables comprise different corporate governance variables such as Shannon index, Blau index, gender of the president of the management and supervisory board, share of women etc. The analysis is performed by using different empirical research methods including linear regression. The main findings are that women acting as the presidents of the management board positively influence performance. Moreover, having more women in the management board also has beneficial effects on financial success of the firm.
G19|Alternative Securities Markets in Poland and the United Kingdom (Alternatywne rynki obrotu papierami wartosciowymi w Polsce i Wielkiej Brytanii)|Designed for smaller, dynamically growing and innovative companies, the NewConnect market offers not only an opportunity to raise capital for development, but also prospects for a company to emerge on the public market. In terms of the number of listed companies, it is the second largest European alternative market, just after the UK AIM. Considering its total capitalization, however, it ranks ninth. This article attempts to present the development of both markets, comparing the initial nine years of operation of each of them in order to show the position and determine the future development of the Polish capital market, in particular NewConnect, established for small and medium-sized enterprises, the number of which in Poland corresponds to half the EU average.
G19|Bucharest Stock Exchange Development Between 1995 And 2015| At the end of November 2015, Bucharest Stock Exchange reached the 20th anniversary since re-opening. The present paper is a survey of Bucharest Stock Exchange evolution along the past two decades. It highlights the main milestones that marked the evolution of the main Romanian capital market. The paper also offers a detailed presentation of the main market and of the alternative trading system evolution within Bucharest Stock Exchange. It briefly discusses BVB’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats and concludes that through its capacity and willingness to change, adapt, and face new challenges, one can look with confidence at the Bucharest Stock Exchange’s future development.
G19|Modelos e indicadores de la situación de estabilidad financiera. Metodología y aplicación|This paper develops a methodology that provides an image of the macroeconomic, the external and financial environment that enables the identification of potential risks to financial system stability. As a further result of the application of the proposed methodology a synthetic indicator of financial stability is derived using principal component techniques and a proper weighting of the different dimensions. The methodology is applied to the case of Uruguay and evaluated in the context of the last financial crisis. The use of this methodology improves the anticipation of financial instability events, reduces false alarms and is more stable than the methodology that is used to monitoring financial stability in Uruguay.
G19|Study Regarding The Analysis Of The Financial Situation Of The Societies From The Pharmaceutical Industry In Terms Of The Correlation Between The Liquidity And The Profitability|The relationship between different rates of liquidity and profitability, is one of the most popular topics of research in the financial management field. In order to demonstrate the correlation between these variables, we used the statistical program SPSS. The analyzed societies are: Zentiva, Biofarm and Antibiotice Iasi, listed at the Bucharest Stock Exchange. The research leads to the conclusion that all the societies have sufficient liquidity to cover the payment obligations. Also, using the Pearson correlation coefficient, we demonstrated the fact that the liquidity is one of the indicators that determine the profitability of the analyzed societies.
G19|Do news improve liquidity through improved information or visibility? Evidence from Emerging Markets|Abstract: Market microstructure models imply that informed trading reduces liquidity. We test for the effect of the frequency of new releases, as a proxy of information arrival, on liquidity in the Chilean stock market. We find that news release frequency is strongly related to improved liquidity. Those results appear for both negative a positive news days and are robust using four different measures of liquidity: bid-ask spread, Amihud measure and two versions of the Zero trading variable. We also find evidence consistent with visibility and information arrival interacting for enhancing liquidity.
G19|Are the KOSPI 200 implied volatilities useful in value-at-risk models?|In terms of quantifying market risk, this study examines the information and indication embedded in implied volatilities extracted from the KOSPI 200 options and proposes a modified value-at-risk (VaR) framework utilizing the implied volatilities. Our empirical results indicate that the model-free implied volatility index of the KOSPI 200 (VKOSPI) does not greatly enhance the performance of suggested VaR models, compared with other volatility forecasting models, especially during and after the recent financial crisis. Furthermore, under the VaR framework, the VKOSPI does not perform better than Black–Scholes (BS) implied volatilities in measuring market risk. We also find that before the financial crisis, the BS implied volatility of out-of-the-money (OTM) options yields a better performance of the VaR models than the BS implied volatility of at-the-money (ATM) options. However, during and after the crisis, the VaR models incorporating the BS ATM implied volatility outperform the VaR models incorporating the BS OTM implied volatility. Our additional analyses show that combining with an extended GJR–GARCH model, which captures the asymmetric volatility effect, improves the overall performance of VaR models.
G19|Impact of changes in the CSI 300 Index constituents|We investigate the price and trading volume effects of CSI 300 Index reconstitutions. In contrast to the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index, whose reconstitutions are carried out irregularly, as required, CSI 300 Index reconstitutions are scheduled semi-annually and performed based on predetermined rules. We find that, on average, prices increase (decrease) significantly for CSI 300 Index additions (deletions) followed by significant post-event price reversals; however, these price changes are less in magnitude than evidenced in extant research for the S&P 500 Index. The trading volume increases significantly for both CSI 300 Index additions and deletions in the short run. The trading volume subsequently reverts to normal levels for index additions but remains higher for index deletions. The findings are consistent with the price pressure hypothesis.
G19|Adverse selection and the presence of informed trading|We combine two concepts of informed trading – contrarian trades and stealth trading – to develop proxies for the probability of informed trading. These proxies are used to test the link between informed trading and adverse selection as measured by bid–ask spreads and stock illiquidity. The estimation results show that these proxies, which are based on the probability of contrarian trading (PC) and progressively refined thereon, are all highly significantly positive in various empirical specifications of the cross-sectional determinants of spreads and illiquidity across stocks, and after controlling for important firm characteristics and trading factors. The robustness of our PC-based proxies for informed trading in these analyses, especially for the further refined measures, suggests that they successfully capture the adverse selection component of bid–ask spreads and illiquidity due to information asymmetry.
G19|Common risk factors of infrastructure investments|The risk of infrastructure investments is driven by unique factors that cannot be well described by standard asset class factor models. We thus create a nine-factor model based on infrastructure-specific risk exposure, i.e., market risk, size, value, momentum, cash flow volatility, leverage, investment growth, term risk, and default risk. We empirically test our model on a large dataset of U.S. infrastructure stocks in different subsectors (utility, telecommunication, and transportation) and over a long period of time (1983 to 2011). The new factor model is able to capture the variation of infrastructure returns better than the Fama/French three-factor, the Carhart four-factor or the extended Fung/Hsieh eight-factor models. Thus, our model helps to improve the evaluation of infrastructure funds and to better determine the cost of capital of infrastructure firms, something that is increasingly relevant in light of the growing need for privately financed infrastructure projects.
G19|Weakening the Gain–Loss-Ratio measure to make it stronger|The Gain–Loss-Ratio, proposed by Bernardo and Ledoit (2000), can either be used as a performance measure on a market with known prices or to derive price intervals in incomplete markets. For both applications, there is a considerable theoretical drawback: it reaches infinity for nontrivial cases in many standard models with continuous probability space. In this paper, a more general ratio is proposed, which includes the original Gain–Loss-Ratio as a limit case. This “Substantial Gain–Loss-Ratio” is applicable in case of continuous probabilities. Additionally, in its function as a performance measure it helps illuminate the source of out-performance that a portfolio reveals.
G19|Player absence and betting lines in the NBA|We examine the efficiency of betting lines in the NBA when players are absent. We show that the betting line tends to move away from the team with absences, particularly when a meaningful player is absent. We show that opening lines set by bookmakers have significant errors in games when a player is absent. No profitable betting strategy exists in wagering at the closing line, however, as biases are removed by either the sportsbook responding to new information or the sportsbook responding to the actions of bettors.
G19|Modelling default risk with occupation times|This paper develops a semi-analytic pricing formula, easily implemented via quadrature, for a structural model based on occupation times that contains both the Merton and Black–Cox models as limiting cases. In the model liquidation is triggered as soon as the firm’s asset value has spent a prespecified amount of time below the default barrier. Surprisingly, we find that the value of the firm’s debt (i) need not be monotone in the length of the grace period and (ii) need not lie between the limiting Merton and Black–Cox values.
G19|State price densities implied from weather derivatives|A State Price Density (SPD) is the density function of a risk neutral equivalent martingale measure for option pricing, and is indispensable for exotic option pricing and portfolio risk management. Many approaches have been proposed in the last two decades to calibrate a SPD using financial options from the bond and equity markets. Among these, non and semiparametric methods were preferred because they can avoid model mis-specification of the underlying. However, these methods usually require a large data set to achieve desired convergence properties. One faces the problem in estimation by e.g., kernel techniques that there are not enough observations locally available. For this situation, we employ a Bayesian quadrature method because it allows us to incorporate prior assumptions on the model parameters and hence avoids problems with data sparsity. It is able to compute the SPD of both call and put options simultaneously, and is particularly robust when the market faces the data sparsity issue. As illustration, we calibrate the SPD for weather derivatives, a classical example of incomplete markets with financial contracts payoffs linked to non-tradable assets, namely, weather indices. Finally, we study related weather derivatives data and the dynamics of the implied SPDs.
G19|The price of liquidity: CD rates charged by money market funds|We examine the cost of liquidity in rates on CDs purchased by money market funds (MMFs). We find no evidence that rates vary directly with the size of CDs. However, we do find that large MMFs receive higher rates on large CDs than small MMFs. This suggests banks pay for (potential) liquidity.
G19|Trading strategies with implied forward credit default swap spreads|Credit default risk for an obligor can be hedged with either a credit default swap (CDS) or a constant maturity credit default swap (CMCDS). We find strong evidence of persistent differences in the hedging cost associated with the two comparable contracts. Between 2001 and 2006, it would have been more profitable to sell CDS and buy CMCDS while after the crisis between 2008 and 2013 the opposite strategy was profitable. Panel data tests indicate that for our sample period the implied forward CDS rates are unbiased estimates of future spot CDS rates. The changes in the company implied volatility is the main determinant of trading inefficiencies, followed by the changes in GDP and in the interest rates before the crisis, and the changes in sentiment index and in the VIX after the crisis.
G19|Social learning and corporate peer effects|We find that firms are more likely to split their stock if their peer firms have recently done so. The effect is comparable to an increase of 40–50% in the share price. Splitting probability is also increasing in the announcement returns of peer splits. These results are consistent with social learning from peers’ actions and outcomes. The unique features of the setting and various further tests render alternative explanations unlikely. We find no clear benefit in following successful peer splitters. Firms are sometimes suspected to succumb to imitation, and the effect we show could be a case in point.
G19|Empirical tests on the liquidity-adjusted capital asset pricing model|This study examines the effects of systematic liquidity risk on stock returns in the Australian market. We find that liquidity risk, in the form of (i) the co-movement between individual stock liquidity and market liquidity, (ii) the co-movement between stock returns and market liquidity, and (iii) the co-movement between stock liquidity and market returns, is priced individually and jointly in Australian equities. The results are robust to the use of alternative liquidity proxies and after controlling for other factors known to affect stock returns. The analysis across different market conditions shows that the net liquidity risk is approximately eight times higher in bearish markets than in bullish markets. Our overall results support the importance of liquidity risk in the generation of stock returns, particularly during market downturns.
G19|Can a path-dependent strategy outperform a path-independent strategy?|The question of whether a path-independent strategy can outperform a path-dependent one has given rise to an interesting debate within the finance literature. This paper uses a protective put as an example and shows that by embedding a cost-down method into our approach, a path-dependent strategy may well outperform a path-independent one. The simulation results illustrate that our proposed protective put outperforms a classical protective put, exhibiting superior capabilities in terms of capturing upside potential, leading to higher Sharpe ratios and Sortino ratios, and avoiding insolvency. The results obtained from our sensitivity analysis provide further confirmation of the robustness of our simulation findings.
G19|Does PIN measure information? Informed trading effects on returns and liquidity in six emerging markets|Market microstructure models imply that informed trading reduces liquidity and moves prices in the direction of the information. We test this implication using the dynamic PIN model (Easley, Engle, O'Hara and Wu 2008) as a time-varying measure of informed trading in the six largest Latin America stock markets. Under alternative specifications and robustness tests, the results suggest that signed dynamic PIN is related to returns, as a proxy for information asymmetry rather than just liquidity effects. These results contribute to the ongoing discussion on whether PIN is a valid informed trading measure, and to a better understanding of price formation in emerging markets.
G19|Performance appraisal of Croatian mandatory pension funds|The goal of this paper is to determine whether managers of Croatian mandatory pension funds have displayed investment skill on a risk-adjusted basis during the 2005-2014 period. We have calculated various risk-adjusted investment performance measures and have then used a number of statistical tools to test the significance of the results. Evidence from our analysis suggests that Croatian mandatory pension funds have reached their investment targets in terms of risk-free rates or benchmarks. Evidence of investment skill was found in some of the funds analysed.

G19|Comonotonic Approximations of Risk Measures for Variable Annuity Guaranteed Benefits with Dynamic Policyholder Behavior|The computation of various risk metrics is essential to the quantitative risk management of variable annuity guaranteed bene ts. The current market practice of Monte Carlo simulation often requires intensive computations, which can be very costly for insurance companies to implement and take so much time that they cannot obtain information and take actions in a timely manner. In an attempt to nd low-cost and ecient alternatives, we explore the techniques of comonotonic bounds to produce closed-form approximation of the risk measures for variable annuity guaranteed bene ts. The techniques are further developed in this paper to address in a systematic way risk measures for death bene ts with the consideration of dynamic policyholder behavior.
G19|Tail Mutual Exclusivity and Tail-Var Lower Bounds|In this paper, we extend the concept of mutual exclusivity proposed by Dhaene and Denuit (1999) to its tail counterpart and baptise this new dependency structure as tail mutual exclusivity. Probability levels are first specified for each component of the random vector. Under this dependency structure, at most one exceedance over the corresponding VaRs is possible, the other components being zero in such a case. No condition is imposed when all components stay below the VaRs. Several properties of this new negative dependence concept are derived. We show that this dependence structure gives rise to the smallest value of Tail-VaR of a sum of risks within a given Fréchet space, provided that the probability level of the Tail-VaR is close enough to one.
G19|Financialisation of built environments:A literature review|This paper provides a review of research into financialisation of built environments, especially in relation to urban politics, social geographies and sustainability. Focus is limited here to the theoretical and conceptual substance of selected literature. Financialisation is conceptualised as a profoundly spatial process, forging social relations that form conditions for urban governance, social geographic change and urban sustainability. The paper frames financialisation of built environments as a process enmeshed with related processes of commodification, privatisation, neoliberalisation, and accumulation by dispossession, associated with the creation and appropriation of rent gaps. Land rent and rent gaps are highlighted as central to understanding financialisation of built environments. We then review research into relations between financialisation of built environments and urban governance, i.e. how financialisation impacts upon, while being facilitated or deterred by, urban politics. This sets the stage for reviewing research into relations between financialisation of built environments and observed patterns of change in the social geographies of cities, and research into the sustainability implications of financialisation of built environments. Conclusions reconsider the nature of the relationship between financialisation and urbanisation, and the challenges of bringing financial systems into the service of achieving social and natural sustainability.
G19|Financialisation of the built environment in Stockholm and Copenhagen|This paper investigates financialisation of built environments in Stockholm and Copenhagen, especially within the sphere of housing. It presents empirical analyses of processes of financialisation of built environments in the two cities, and how these processes relate to urban politics and governance. The case studies include analyses of how financialisation of built environments and associated shifts in urban politics have impacted on the social geographies of these two capital cities. The Stockholm and Copenhagen cases are presented as individual case studies. A comparative analysis including broader conclusions from these studies and a related case study (of Ankara, in a separate working paper) will be the subject of a sequel working paper.
G19|Assessing financial distress dependencies in OTC markets: a new approach by Trade Repositories data|"After the recent financial crisis, it is undoubtedly recognized the importance of assessing not only the risk of distress for a single \financial entity"", but also the distress dependencies between the different \entities"", where by \entities"" we mean in a broad sense any relevant cluster of products, risk factors, counterparties. In this paper, we focus on the Interest Rate Swap (IRS) segment as a significant fraction of the OTC market. We define a distress indicator by combining some distress drivers, such as averaged volumes, liquidity, volatility and bid-ask proxies. Hence, we analyse the distress dependencies among sub-markets identified by the segmentation of the IRS market according to contractual and financial features. We try to combine in an innovative way some new ingredients, namely the more granular data on OTC derivatives available from the trade repositories along with the classical JPoD approach introduced in the recent years by the IMF for studying the distress interdependence structure among financial institutions. The proposed technique seems to be quite promising. Indeed, the results are quite close to the practical intuition. At the best of our knowledge, this work is the first empirical study based on trade repositories' data for assessing systemic risk."
G19|Is there Asymmetric Information About Systematic Factors? Evidence from Commonality in Liquidity|This paper provides an empirical investigation of the hypothesis that there exists information asymmetry about systematic factors. Using a sample of 112 exchange traded funds (ETF) we provide evidence in support of this hypothesis. Furthermore, through the analysis of the the adverse selection component of the bid-ask spreads (lambdas) of these ETFs and all common stocks trading on the NYSE and the NASDAQ from January 1999 to December 2003, we provide strong evidence of commonality in the adverse selection component of liquidity. We use the estimated lambda of Standard and Poorâ€™s Depository Receipts (SPDRs) as a measure of information asymmetry about the U.S. equity market and find that these are (i) positively correlated with the lambdas of other exchange traded funds (ii) related to the lambdas on individual equity securities and (iii) they can be explained by measures of uncertainty about the aggregate market.
G19|Risk analysis of the proxy life-cycle investments in the second pillar pension scheme in Croatia|In this article we analyze the expected risk of pension funds with different risk profiles in the proxy life-cycle model of investments for the 2nd pillar pension scheme in Croatia. The benefits of implementing proxy life-cycle investments, compared to the previous model of mandatory pension funds investments, are clearly visible in the total expected amount of accumulated savings from the risk/return perspective. However, those benefits are partially diminished by the fact that the expected risk of a pension fund with the lowest risk profile is not substantially different from the expected risk of a pension fund with a medium risk profile, due to the lack of diversification. Additionally, we analyze the robustness of the proxy life-cycle model to a sudden and severe market shock, where we determine the presence of risk for those members who choose to switch to a pension fund with a lower risk profile at an unfavorable moment.
G19|Is active management of mandatory pension funds in Croatia creating value for second pillar fund members?|This paper analyses Croatian mandatory pension fundsâ€™ investment returns during the 2005-2014 period using performance attribution methodology. Results from active investment management are compared to a long-term policy return. Such analysis is essential to shed light on the contribution of active portfolio management in the second pillar pension scheme. Evidence suggests that in the period analysed portfolio managers have added value through active management decisions. In addition, we determined the sources of portfolio return by breaking down active return into policy, tactical asset allocation and security selection effect.
G19|Short Selling and Price Pressure Around Merger Announcements|Prior research argues that short selling by merger arbitrageurs adds downward pressure to the stock prices of acquiring firms, particularly for firms that use stock financing. We test this hypothesis by examining daily short sale data surrounding merger announcements. Our initial results show that short selling activity surges in response to merger announcements and that abnormal post-announcement short selling is driven by those mergers that use stock financing. This result is consistent, in part, with the presence of merger arbitrage. However, additional tests show that the negative post-announcement stock returns to acquiring firms are orthogonal to the level of post-announcement short selling activity. These findings extend the current literature by showing that, while post-announcement short selling is abnormally high, this short selling does not put undue pressure on acquiring firms’ stock prices.

G19|A Comparative Returns Performance Review of Islamic Equity Funds with Socially Responsible Equity Funds and the Broader Market Indices|Islamic mutual funds and socially responsible mutual funds are two similar asset classes that incorporate negative screens in their portfolio selection process to filter out stocks that fail to meet certain ethical, social, environmental, and/or religious standards. This study uses a single-factor capital asset pricing model and an adjusted sample consisting of 224 Islamic funds and 573 socially responsible funds to examine their excess risk-adjusted returns, market volatility, and systematic risk. It also gauges the market-timing abilities of the fund managers concerned in relation to both Islamic/socially responsible and conventional market indices. While there are some differences in the risk factors of Islamic funds and socially responsible funds, both are associated with lower risks and have the same market-timing ability.
G19|Sentiment and blue-chip returns. Firm level evidence from a dynamic threshold model|The higher impact of sentiment on small and young companies due to higher transaction and information costs is a generally agreed notion. In contrast, the paper is focused on the relationship between sentiment and blue-chip stocks. The author contributes with the proposal of theoretical background that blue-chip stocks can reflect sentiment in periods of occasional excessive social activity despite the existence of smart-money investors. The author employs the appropriate empirical methods, specifically dynamic threshold model, to analyze such a relationship because standard regression is not appropriate. In addition, the paper contribution is the employment of unique data of Facebook activity as a sentiment gauge. Overall, the author finds the high level of social activity connected with negative sentiment with inverse but occasional influence at stock price returns.
G19|Sentiment of a society and large-cap stock liquidity|The impact of sentiment in the sample of small and young companies due to higher transaction and information costs is a generally agreed notion. On the contrary, such impact is less likely in the sample of large-cap stock companies. However, this paper goes beyond this notion and shows that we can study the influence of sentiment even at the level of large-cap companies due to the following reasons. Firstly, the paper is unique by employment of social media Facebook data as a proxy for the sentiment of a society related to the individual corporation. Such data have a potential to provide deeper insights in a society's behavior. Secondly, the author proposes the volume of trade or liquidity as a variable which incorporates sentiment in a society better than stock returns. Empirical results confirm this prediction. Overall, the paper shows the existence of the negative link between sentiment in the society and volume of trade at the level of large-cap corporations.
G19|Strategy Change and Wealth Accumulation: An Analysis of S&P 500 Data|This paper studies investors' strategy change frequency and their wealth accumulation by financial investments. Artificial investors are put into a real stock market. They trade S&P 500 following common strategies in practice. Fundamental analysis generally surpasses technical analysis in all market situa- tions except boom periods. Though investors' strategy change behavior, which is driven by the past performance of strategies, seems reasonable, a faster strat- egy change does not guarantee a higher final wealth. Active strategy change hurts investor' wealth in bear markets and in markets with major trend rever- sals. In bull markets, both fast and slow strategy change behaviors work better than a moderate speed of strategy change. A detailed decomposition of wealth accumulation via financial investment shows the dependence of wealth on in- vestors' past transactions. This may explain the relation between investors' strategy change frequency and their wealth.
G19|The relation between sovereign credit default swap premium and banking sector risk in Poland|We investigate causality between returns on sovereign CDSs and bank equities for Poland between 2004 and 2014 to provide evidence on contagion between sovereign and banking sector risk pricing. We find some evidence of contagion from Polish sovereign CDS returns to bank equity returns during the crisis period. We benchmark the results for Poland against a sample ofWestern European countries. We document strong negative correlation between sovereign CDS and bank equity returns for individual countries as well as strong commonality of both sovereign and banking sector risks across different countries. We do not however find a clear pattern of contagion between these two markets across European countries. To further investigate drivers of CDS and bank equity returns, we conduct principal component analysis and we find that first three principal components explain as much as 97% of variation with the third principal component mostly associated with Polandspecific risk.

G19|Trust, happiness, and households’ financial decisions|A recent line of research highlights trust as an important element guiding the decision of households to invest into risky financial assets and insurance products. This paper contributes to this literature by identifying happiness as another key driver of the same decision. Using detailed survey data from a sample of Dutch households, we show that the impact of happiness on households’ financial decisions works in the opposite direction and is more economically important compared to trust. Specifically, happiness leads to a lower probability of investing into risky financial assets and having insurance, while trust has the usual positive effect found in the literature. Furthermore, the negative effect of happiness on the ownership of risky financial assets is about 6% higher compared to the positive equivalent of trust. Similarly, the negative effect of happiness on the ownership of insurance is 3% higher than the positive effect of trust.
G19|Informational Content of Open-to-Close Stock Returns|In the present study, I explore interday correlations between open-to-close and opening stock returns. Employing intraday price data on all the stocks that were S&P 500 Index constituents during the period from 1993 to 2013, I find that stock returns in opening trading sessions systematically tend to be higher following days with relatively low (either negative, or lower than the same day's market) open-to-close returns. Moreover, I explicitly document the tendency of opening stock returns to be reversed (to change their sign) following previous day's open-to-close returns. This kind of price behaviour seems to contradict stock market efficiency, and may be potentially interpreted as stock price ‘corrections’ following their ‘deviations’ from the underlying values caused by noise trading during the continuous trading sessions. Based on this finding, for the sampling period, I construct two different daily-adjusted investment portfolios based on the opening trading sessions and involving a long position in the stocks on the days when their opening returns are expected to be high and a short position in the stocks on the days when their opening returns are expected to be low. Both portfolios are found to yield significantly positive returns, even after accounting for trading commissions, providing an evidence for practical applicability of the documented pattern in opening stock prices.
G19|Counterparty risk in material supply contracts|This paper explores the sources of counterparty risk in material supply relationships. Using long-term supply contracts collected from SEC filings, we test whether three sources of counterparty risk—financial exposure, product quality risk, and redeployability risk—are priced in the equity returns of linked firms. Our results show that equity holders require compensation for exposure to all three sources of risk. Specifically, offering trade credit to counterparties and investing in relationship-specific assets increase the firm’s exposure to counterparty risk. Further, we show that contracts with protective financial covenants and product warranties mitigate the transmission of risk. Overall, we provide evidence on the channels of supply-chain risk, and we show that shareholders recognize the role of contractual features in mitigating counterparty risk.
G19|Comparison of Consumption Based Capital Asset Pricing (CCAPM) and Housing CCAPM (HCCAPM) Model in Explaining Stock Returns in Iran|One of the most important issues in financial economics is the capital asset pricing since in this context various models have been introduced and tested in different economies. One of these models is consumption-based capital asset pricing model (CCAPM) which in this model changes in stock returns related to changes in consumption. Housing CCAPM (HCCAPM) is a derivative of CCAPM model that was introduced in 2007 by Piazzesi et al (2007). In this model representative agent’s utility is function of aggregate of non-housing consumption and housing service consumption while in the model CCAPM, total consumer expenditure considered as a macroeconomic variable. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate effect of housing services and a non-housing consumption good on stock returns. In this paper HCCAPM and CCAPM model is estimated for quarterly data 1367 to 1391 period of the Iran with generalized method of moments (GMM). The results show that all parameters are significant. Estimation of parameters in both models indicates economic factors are patient and very risk-averse. Comparison of these models using log-linear reduced form and Hansen and Jagannathan (HJ)-distance function indicate that CCAPM model explains stock returns better than HCCAPM model.
G19|The Diagnosis of the Insider Trading During the Conflict of Shareholders of “VimpelCom” in 2005-2013<BR>[Диагностирование Инсайдерской Торговли В Период Конфликта Акционеров Оао «Вымпелком» В 2005—2013 Годах]|This article presents the results of a study of insider trading during the corporate conflict of shareholders of OJSC “VimpelCom”. The study is based on an analysis of cumulative abnormal returns during the period prior to the publication of a news. In the study we analyzed 80 news about the conflict of shareholders of OJSC “VimpelCom” in 2005-2013 years. We found insider trading prior to the public statements made by “Alfa Group” representatives but not by Telenor officials. We have found the presence of a large-scale insider trading prior to the publication of the news about the courts verdicts of the Russian courts and news about government pressure.
G19|Return Linkages and Volatility Spillover Effect Between Stock Markets and Currency Markets|This article undertakes the analysis of volatility and volatility spillover between stock market and currency market in India. Daily closing levels of the benchmark indices are taken for the period 1 April 2003â€“31 December 2013. The data are analysed through unit root tests, Autoregressive Conditionally Heteroskedastic (ARCH) family models, Johansenâ€™s cointergation test, vector error correction model and diagonal Vector Error Correction Heteroskedastic (VECH) model. The results indicate a bidirectional volatility spillover between the Indian stock market and a currency market. The findings of the study also suggest that both the markets move in tandem with each other and there is a long-run relationship between these two markets.
G19|Does the Fisher Hypothesis Hold in Sweden? An Analysis of Long-Term Interest Rates under the Regime of Inflation Targeting?|This paper examines the validity of the Fisher hypothesis in Sweden by analyzing inflation expectations and long-term interest rates from January 1993 to February 2015 under a regime of inflation targeting. The Fisher hypothesis holds for the maturities of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 but not 10 years. The results show that changes in inflation expectations move in the same direction and degree as nominal long-term interest rates for the maturities of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 years. This can primarily be attributed to the credibility of the inflation-targeting framework in Sweden for the last 20 years and the success it has achieved in locking inflation expectations into the target range within these maturities. In the maturity of 10 years, this credibility has never been as certain.
G19|Fundamental Analysis Models in Financial Markets ? Review Study|The purpose of this paper is an attempt to reach a better stock valuation model of the Fundamental Analysis Approach, by reviewing the theoretical foundations and literature reviews.By reviewing the theoretical foundations for each model of the fundamental analysis models, and sequentially beginning of the Discounted Dividend Model (DDM), through a Multiplier Models, and finally the Discounted Cash Flow Model (DCFM), we find that all these models have strengths, despite the lack of accuracy, because it is required financial efficiency market. Recently Ohlson (1995) stated the simulated benefit in the formulation of the Residual Income Model (RIM). The Ohlson Model identifies the relationship between stock values and accounting variables.By reviewing the literature reviews, in financial markets, we conclude that the best model that can be relied upon to predict stock value, that proved credibility in both emerging and developed markets, is Residual Income Model (RIM), which doesn't require financial efficiency for its application.
G19|The war puzzle: contradictory effects of international conflicts on stock markets|We study stock market reactions to large international military conflicts since World War II. Using a news analysis proxy for the estimated likelihood that a conflict will result in a war, we find that an increase in the war likelihood tends to decrease stock prices, but the ultimate outbreak of a war increases them. In cases when a war starts surprisingly, however, the outbreak of a war decreases stock prices. We show that this puzzle cannot be explained by risk or ambiguity aversion or by expectations about a quick end of the war. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015
G19|Informed trading, institutional trading, and spread|We use transactions data from TORQ and present empirical evidence on the cross sectional relation between institutional trading and effective spread after controlling for trading volume denoting inventory and order processing costs and probability of informed trading (PIN) denoting risk of informed trading. We find that volume, information risk premium denoted by PIN times price, and institutional trading are significant determinants of bid ask spreads for a sample of 65 NYSE listed securities. We also find that institutional trading increases the adverse selection component but does not have a significant effect on order processing costs. The net effect of institutional trading on spread depends on the dominant effect, information increasing adverse selection costs or liquidity decreasing order processing costs. In our sample the increase in adverse selection costs trumps the decrease in order processing costs and as a consequence spread increases as institutional trading rises.

G19|The linkage between the U.S. “fear index” and ADR premiums under non-frictionless stock markets|This paper examines the effects of the U.S. investor sentiment on American depository receipts (ADR) premiums by using daily prices of Latin American ADRs from 1995 to 2009. The volatility index (VIX) is used as a proxy for investor expectations about the stock market. High levels in the VIX indicate that investors are fearful about future performance of the U.S. stock market. We estimate a GARCH-M in the framework of an ADR pricing model. We control for liquidity, transaction costs, and domestic and U.S. stock exchange returns. We find that deviations from the law of one price in ADRs can be partially explained by the lag of the smoothed volatility index. There is a structural break in the sample period before and after the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This paper has important implications for portfolio diversification on emerging economies as investment managers can improve hedging strategies by incorporating known values of the volatility index.

G19|Estimating quality adjusted commercial property price indexes using Japanese REIT data| We propose a new method to estimate quality adjusted commercial property price indexes using real estate investment trust (REIT) data. Our method is based on the present value approach, but the way the denominator (i.e. the discount rate) and the numerator (i.e. cash flows from properties) are estimated differs from the traditional method. We run a hedonic regression to estimate the quality adjusted discount rate based on the share prices of REITs, which can be regarded as the stock market's valuation of the set of properties owned by the REITs. As for the numerator, we use rental prices associated with all existing contracts, as well as rental prices associated with new rental contracts, which may contain more information on future cash flows from properties. Using a data-set with prices and cash flows for about 400 commercial properties included in Japanese REITs for the period 2001-2013, we find that our price index signals turning points much earlier than an appraisal-based price index; specifically, our index peaks in the second quarter of 2007, while the appraisal-based price index exhibits a turnaround only in the third quarter of 2008. Our results suggest that the share prices of REITs provide useful information in constructing commercial property price indexes.
G19| Comonotonic approximations of risk measures for variable annuity guaranteed benefits with dynamic policyholder behavior| The computation of various risk metrics is essential to the quantitative risk management of variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The current market practice of Monte Carlo simulation often requires intensive computations, which can be very costly for insurance companies to implement and take so much time that they cannot obtain information and take actions in a timely manner. In an attempt to find low-cost and efficient alternatives, we explore the techniques of comonotonic bounds to produce closed-form approximation of the risk measures for variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The techniques are further developed in this paper to address in a systematic way risk measures for death benefits with the consideration of dynamic policyholder behavior.
G19|Tail mutual exclusivity and tail-var lower bounds| In this paper, we extend the concept of mutual exclusivity proposed by Dhaene and Denuit(1999) to its tail counterpart and baptise this new dependency structure as tail mutual exclusivity. Probability levels are first specified for each component of the random vector. Under this dependency structure, at most one exceedance over the corresponding VaRs is possible, the other components being zero in such a case. No condition is imposed when all components stay below the VaRs. Several properties of this new negative dependence concept are derived. We show that this dependence structure gives rise to the smallest value of Tail-VaR of a sum of risks within a given Fréchet space, provided that the probability level of the Tail-VaR is close enough to one.
G19|Global Derivative Debacles:From Theory to Malpractice|"This book analyzes in depth all major derivatives debacles of the last half century including the multi-billion losses and/or bankruptcy of Metallgesellschaft (1994), Barings Bank (1995), Long Term Capital Management (1998), Amaranth (2006), Société Générale (2008) , AIG (2008) and JP Morgan-Chase (2012). It unlocks the secrets of derivatives by telling the stories of institutions which played in the derivative market and lost big. For some of these unfortunate organizations it was daring but flawed financial engineering which brought them havoc. For others it was unbridled speculation perpetrated by rogue traders whose unchecked fraud brought their house down. Should derivatives be feared ""as financial weapons of mass destruction"" or hailed as financial innovations which through efficient risk transfer are truly adding to the Wealth of Nations? By presenting a factual analysis of how the malpractice of derivatives played havoc with derivative end-user and dealer institutions, a case is made for vigilance not only to market and counter-party risk but also operational risk in their use for risk management and proprietary trading. Clear and recurring lessons across the different stories in this volume call not only for a tighter but also ""smarter"" control system of derivatives trading and should be of immediate interest to financial managers, bankers, traders, auditors and regulators who are directly or indirectly exposed to financial derivatives. The book groups cases by derivative category, starting with the simplest and building up to the most complex — namely, Forwards, Futures, Options and Swaps in that order, with applications in commodities, foreign exchange, stock indices and interest rates. Each chapter deals with one derivative debacle, providing a rigorous and comprehensive but non-technical elucidation of what happened. What is new in the second edition? A new chapter on JP Morgan-Chase's London Whale, an in-depth discussion of credit-default swaps, and an update of the revamped regulatory framework with Basel 2.5 and Basel III against the backdrop of the Euro crisis, along with a revised and expanded discussion of the AIG debacle."
G19|Model Risk in Financial Markets:From Financial Engineering to Risk Management|The financial systems in most developed countries today build up a large amount of model risk on a daily basis. However, this is not particularly visible as the financial risk management agenda is still dominated by the subprime-liquidity crisis, the sovereign crises, and other major political events. Losses caused by model risk are hard to identify and even when they are internally identified, as such, they are most likely to be classified as normal losses due to market evolution. Model Risk in Financial Markets: From Financial Engineering to Risk Management seeks to change the current perspective on model innovation, implementation and validation. This book presents a wide perspective on model risk related to financial markets, running the gamut from financial engineering to risk management, from financial mathematics to financial statistics. It combines theory and practice, both the classical and modern concepts being introduced for financial modelling. Quantitative finance is a relatively new area of research and much has been written on various directions of research and industry applications. In this book the reader gradually learns to develop a critical view on the fundamental theories and new models being proposed.
G19|Personal bankruptcy and wage garnishment|Bankruptcy legislation has important welfare effects on the aggregate economy through effects on prices of and access to credit. Policy makers face a trade-off between insuring individuals against adverse shocks and providing incentives to repay debt. While the U.S. regime has a strong insurance component, many European systems are stricter in that they force delinquent households to repay (parts of) the outstanding debt through wage garnishment. This paper examines labor supply effects of the German garnishment regime and their effect on credit prices. I find that the income cap at 3, 200 EUR net income per month depresses high wage workers labor supply during bankruptcy by about 20%. Three policy experiments are conducted to reduce the burden of income garnishment. In all cases, the amount of credit in the economy declines and default rates drop by 46% to 56%. This comes from a strong increase in credit prices since banks expect lower repayment. It is shown that removing the income cap and lowering garnishment rates significantly reduces adverse labor supply effects. When reducing the garnishment rate from 70% to 30%, disposable income of highly productive households with 60, 000 EUR gross labor income increases by nearly 2/3 under garnishment. On average, the economy would highly profit from abolishing wage garnishment. Removing garnishment would be equivalent to permanently increasing consumption by 1.5% each year. While these gains are quite substantial, young households suffer from restricted access to credit while households in their prime age enjoy better insurance against adverse events.
G19|Predicting US bank failures with internet search volume data|This study investigates how well weekly Google search volumes track and predict bank failures in the United States between 2007 and 2012, contributing to the expanding literature that exploits internet data for the prediction of events. Different duration models with time-varying covariates are estimated. Higher Google search volumes go hand in hand with higher failure rates, and the coefficients for the Google volume growth index are highly significant. However, Google’s predictive power quickly dissipates for future failure rates.
G19|Item response models to measure corporate social responsibility| Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a multidimensional concept that involves several aspects, ranging from environment to social and governance. Companies aiming to comply with CSR standards have to face challenges that vary from one aspect to the other and from one industry to the other. Latent variable models may be usefully employed to provide a unidimensional measure of the grade of compliance of a firm with CSR standards, which is both understandable and theoretically solid. A methodology based on item response theory has been implemented on the multidimensional sustainability rating as expressed by KLD data-set from 1991 to 2007. Results suggest that companies in the oil and gas industry together with firms in industrials, basic materials and telecommunications have a higher difficulty to meet the CSR standards. Criteria based on human rights, environment, community and product quality have a large capacity to select the best performing firms, as they are very discriminant, while governance does not exhibit similar behaviour. A stock selection based on the ranking of the firms according to the proposed CSR measure supports the hypothesis of a positive relationship between CSR and financial performance.
G19|Capital Structure Arbitrage revisited|We study risk and return properties of capital structure arbitrage strategies aiming to profit from temporal mispricing between equity and credit default swaps (CDSs) of companies. We find that capital structure arbitrage provides an attractive annualized return of 24.35% on invested capital. The arbitrage returns are higher for lower rated companies and surprisingly they are also higher for more liquid companies with larger CDS trading volumes. We find that the number of arbitrage trade opportunities can at times cluster and in our sample the concentration of trades occurs when they are most profitable, which highlights the issue of capital allocation. Constructing weekly return indices of capital structure arbitrage, we find that no more than 15% of the returns is explained by common risk factors.
G19|The Determinants of CDS Bid-ask Spreads|We investigate the determinants of bid-ask spreads on corporate credit default swaps (CDSs). We find that proxies for dealer inventory costs such as variability of CDS premia and CDS trading volume explain as much as 80% of variation in CDS bid-ask spreads. We also analyze the influence of variables capturing systematic risk of reference entities, market-implied volatility, dealer funding costs and competition between dealers. Several of these variables are significant, but their explanatory power is moderate. Finally, we demonstrate that CDS bid-ask spreads do not widen preceding earnings announcement surprises, which suggests that private information does not hinder CDS liquidity.
G19|Automated liquidity provision|Over the last decade, the task of liquidity provision in many markets has shifted from traditional market makers to autonomous, computerized trading systems. These automated systems collect, process, and react to market-wide information quicker and more comprehensively than the humans they have replaced. Here, we update the model of Glosten and Milgrom (1985) to analyze how the automation of liquidity provision affects market quality, the transaction costs of market participants, and volatility. To Glosten and Milgrom's original model, we add multiple securities and introduce an automated market maker who prices order flow for all securities contemporaneously. We find that the automated market maker transacts the majority of orders, sets prices that are more efficient, increases informed and decreases uninformed traders' transaction costs, and has no effect on volatility. The model's predictions match very well with recent empirical findings and are difficult to replicate with alternative models.
G19|Stock Exchanges Development: The Case Of Bulgaria And Romania|The main objective of the research paper is to analyze the development of the stock markets of Bulgaria and Romania. The research will aim at identifying the factors that influence the stock market development process in the two EC member-states following seven years of full EU membership, to outline the existing barriers at micro- and macro levels and draw conclusions. The Bulgarian capital market remains financially underdeveloped as compared to the Romanian one. The alternative for the stock market development in Bulgaria is to follow an evolutionary path similar to the Romanian stock market. The research methodology will include comparative and economic analysis on the basis of European financial integration theory and drawing of conclusions regarding stock market development tendencies.
G19|The Analysis Of The Correlation Between Financialautonomy And Financial Equilibrium Of Thepharmaceutical Companies Listed On The Buchareststock Exchange|In the last years, the phenomena of instability and economic uncertainty haveoccurred more and more frequently in a society undergoing major changes. This aspect has beenparticularly prominent since 2008. With the advent of the economic and financial crisis,unexpected phenomena occurring within organizations have strengthened the idea of a moredetailed analysis of the financial position so as to be able to determine the actual financialstrategies needed by the companies within the analyzed industry. The aim of this article is tohighlight the importance of balance and financial autonomy in the economic entities belonging tothe pharmaceutical industry and listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange. Our research is basedon an analysis in time of the indicators of balance and financial stability over a period of six years,from 2008 until 2013, in order to draw a correlation between these two types of indicators withthe help of Pearson‘s correlation coefficient.

G19|Optimal Margining and Margin Relief in Centrally Cleared Derivatives Markets|A major policy challenge posed by derivatives clearinghouses is that their collateral requirements can rise sharply in times of stress, reducing market liquidity and further exacerbating downturns. Smoothing sharp changes in collateral requirements - an approach known as through-the-cycle margining - however, has its own disadvantages, one of which is increased risk sharing among clearinghouse members when financial risk is high. This can give rise to undesirable side effects, including distorted incentives, which can reverse the conventional knowledge about collateral policy. In contrast to the existing literature, I show that through-the-cycle margining can increase as well as reduce trading in volatile markets. Due to increased risk sharing, clearinghouse members may prefer to overcollateralize transactions, leading to lower than socially optimal trading. This creates a challenge for policy-makers, since it may be challenging to push for lower collateral standards than deemed proper by the industry. For such cases, I propose an alternative policy tool - increasing default penalties - to align private and social incentives.
G19|The Brazilian Stock Market in the Pre-Ibovespa Era|The paper reports the availability of equity market and government bond indices for the 1950-1967 in Brazil, before the introduction of the Bovespa index. Nominal monthly returns are computed, and the historical market risk premium is determined. A 1.86% monthly average is obtained, which compares to 1.69% per month for the period from January, 1968 to October, 2013. The rates of return of both market segments are then adjusted for the change in the General Price Index – Domestic Availability (IGP-DI). It is observed that neither stocks nor government bonds provided sufficient protection against inflation. The paper’s main contribution to the literature, however, is the creation of the two index series, adding over 17 years of data to the information commonly used in the analysis of Brazilian capital markets.
G19|Risk Measures Theory: a comprehensive survey|A fundamental aspect of proper risk management is the measurement, especially forecasting of risk measures. Measures such as variance, volatility and Value at Risk had been considered valid because of their practical intuition. However, a solid theoretical framework it is important to ensure better properties for risk measures. Such background is the risk measures theory. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on risk measures theory, focusing in basic theory and extensions to this fundamental outline. The paper is structured in order to cover the main risk measures classes from literature, which are coherent risk measures, convex risk measures, spectral and distortion risk measures and generalized deviation measures.
G19|Market quality and structural changes in the trading system: The case of X-Stream on the Colombian stock exchange|Abstract: We study the effect of X-Stream, the new trading platform of the Colombian Stock Exchange since February 2009, on the quality of the stock market. Contributing to the literature on market quality, this paper provides novel evidence of the effect of reforms on market design, trading rules and operational capabilities on a small and low liquidity emerging stock market. Starting from a proprietary database of transactional and order data from BVC, we use several econometric models to measure the effect of the new platform on daily and intraday volatility, liquidity (proportional bid-ask spread and price impact), and trading activity. The evidence suggests that X-Stream improved the liquidity and reduced the volatility of the overall market, especially of the most liquid stocks. These results support the investment on more sophisticated trading systems in Emerging Markets.

G19|The EURPLN, DAX and WIG20: the Granger causality tests before and during the crisis|In this paper the possible interdependence between bilateral exchange rate behavior and the corresponding stock indices is checked, with application to the EURPLN rate and the DAX and WIG20 stock indices. Methods and results are similar to previous study of USDPLN exchange rate, and SP500 and WIG20 indices. The linear (including instantaneous) causality test and the Diks-Panchenko test are applied to logarithmic returns and to the daily measure of volatility r_t=lnâ ¡(P_(max,t)/P_(min,t) ). Differences between before- and during-crisis period results are less vivid than in case of the U.S. and the Polish instruments. But there is a substantial difference between linear (and Diks-Panchenko) test results and the instantaneous Granger-causality test results, on the other hand â€“ between returns and daily volatility.
G19|Impact of Migrant Remittances on Economic Empowerment of Women: A Macroeconomic Investigation|The present research has the ambition to contribute to the literature by providing a better visibility on the impact that remittances can generate in the level of women remained in the country, both in terms of economic activity and the status of women in households. To this end, this work mobilizes macroeconomic aggregate data to verify the impact of remittances on women activity at the international level. This work involves the macroeconomic data of a sample of 58 countries observed from 1999 to 2010. The results of the macroeconomic approach are substantially different when going from one region to another. In particular, the presented estimates show that the effect of transfers on female labor supply depends on the studied area. The complexity of the studied phenomenon shows the existence of contradictory effects, in which case the local and regionalcharacteristics may play an important role.
G19|Individual Fund Manager Sentiment, Fund Performance and Performance Persistence|This study contributes to the literature by examining the relation among fund performance, performance persistence and individual fund manager sentiment, rather than the fund industry sentitment. This study employs the turnover rate as the proxy of individual fund manager sentiment. Using the one and two-way sorting methods and the panel data regression analysis, this study finds that the equity funds in Taiwan have performance persistence in the both short and long run. We find the funds with a higher turnover rate (i.e., higher fund managers'sentiment) perform better no matter they are in the winner or loser groups. This phenomenon persists both in the short inverstors should choose winner funds due to their persistence and choose those whose turnover rate is in top 40% of the winners.
G19|How much informal credit lending responded to monetary policy in China? The case of Wenzhou|This study investigates empirically what the major factors are which have driven Wenzhou's informal credit market and how much that market is responsive to monetary policies and the formal banking conditions nationwide. A number of relatively stable factors have been identified from this volatile market through a careful exploration of a monthly survey data set for the period of 2003–2011. The main findings are: (i) Wenzhou's informal credit lending rates are highly receptive to monetary policies; (ii) Wenzhou's market is dominantly demand driven; (iii) Wenzhou's informal lending is substitutive to bank savings in the short run but complementary to banking lending in the long run; and (iv) Wenzhou's market is complementary to excessive investments in the local real estate market.
G19|Do markets anticipate capital structure decisions? — Feedback effects in equity liquidity|We analyze the impact of expected (targeted) capital structure decisions on information asymmetries. We measure information asymmetry from equity liquidity through the use of an information asymmetry index that is based on six measures that capture trading activity, trading costs, and the price impact of order flow. Modeling the joint determination of leverage and liquidity, the data indicate that expected increases in leverage (target leverage changes) decrease the information asymmetry index. This is consistent with the signaling hypothesis of Ross (1977), and is equivalent to increases in equity liquidity.
G19|Explaining the Czech interbank market risk premium|This paper focuses on the development of the interbank market risk premium in the Czech Republic during the global financial crisis. We explain the significant departure of interbank interest rates from the key monetary policy rate by a combination of different factors, including liquidity risk, counterparty risk, foreign influence, interbank relations, and strategic behavior. The results suggest a relevant role of market factors and some importance of counterparty risk.
G19|Firm opacity and financial market information asymmetry|Information asymmetry could exist between the firm and the investors as well as among investors. If the information asymmetry between the firm and the investors is very high, all investors are largely uninformed, so information asymmetry between investors should be low. At the other extreme, if all investors are fully informed about the firm, again the information asymmetry between investors should be low. This paper finds evidence supporting such a nonlinear relationship between firm-to-investor and investor-to-investor information asymmetry. The inter-investor information asymmetry increases, and then declines, as the information asymmetry between the firm and the investor increases.
G19|Risk-free rate effects on conditional variances and conditional correlations of stock returns|This paper investigates whether the risk-free rate may explain the movements observed in the conditional second moments of asset returns. Original results are derived, within the C-CAPM framework, that attest the existence of a channel connecting these seemingly unrelated quantities. The empirical results, involving 165 time series of stock returns quoted at the NYSE, show that the risk-free rate does contain information that is relevant in predicting the 165 conditional variances and 13,530 conditional correlations. These findings are particularly pronounced at lower frequencies where the persistence of the conditional second moments is significantly weaker.
G19|A dynamic intraday measure of the probability of informed trading and firm-specific return variation|A central question in financial economics is how private information is incorporated into asset prices. A common method of measuring private information is the PIN measure, which uses statistical estimation of a sequential trade model of the trading process to estimate the probability of informed trading. A notable limiting feature of PIN is that one must aggregate very fine intraday data over very long macro horizons in order to estimate it. In this paper, our aim is to develop and implement a dynamic intraday measure of the probability of informed trading that circumvents this aggregation issue and allows for the measurement of information based trading activity at much higher frequencies. We then apply our dynamic intraday measure of the probability of informed trading to examine the relationship between private information and firm-specific return variation.
G19|Forward–futures price differences in the UK commercial property market: Arbitrage and marking-to-model explanations|In this paper the differences between forward and futures prices for the UK commercial property market are analyzed, using both time series and panel data. A first battery of tests establishes that the observed differences are statistically significant over the study period. Further analysis considers the modeling of this difference using mean-reverting models. The proposed models are then estimated with a number of alternative estimation methods and second stage statistical tests are implemented in order to decide which model and estimation method best represent the data.
G19|A microstructure analysis of the carbon finance market|The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme is the key policy instrument of the European Commission's Climate Change Program aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 8% below 1990 levels by 2012. The key asset traded under the scheme is the European Union allowance (EUA). This article examines ultra high frequency data to assess the extent of the development in the futures market of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Our results indicate significant developments consistent with sequential information arrival. They also indicate a negative contemporaneous relationship between volume and volatility for all contracts. The implication is that liquidity traders dominate any role played by informed traders. Incorporating the duration between trades in our analysis has significant impact suggesting that any empirical investigation of the intra-day volume–volatility relationship needs to actively account for the impact of time elapse between trades.
G19|Forecasting option smile dynamics|Practitioners have long tried to exploit the predictability of the option implied volatility smile. Motivated by the recent developments in the literature focusing on market-based option pricing arguments, this paper proposes the introduction of trading volume into a vector autoregressive (VAR) model to improve forecasts of the smile dynamics. The augmented VAR-volume model produces quality forecasts of the smile surface and explains its dynamic changes over time relatively well. Our results suggest that the incorporation of trading volume leads to it outperforming other alternative forecast approaches, as well as being robust to a variety of perturbations of the data and offers scope for investors to more accurately predict option implied volatility in the future.
G19|Investors’ aspirations and portfolio performance|Based on a large database of individual investors, I analyze the impact of personal financial goals on portfolio performance. I stress the role played by latent investor aspirations as defined in the Behavioral Portfolio Theory framework. I identify two opposite profiles of investors. High-aspirations investors trade more and hold riskier portfolios than the average investor. By contrast, low-aspirations investors are more diversified than the average investor. I find that when controlling for diversification, turnover and usual risk factors, high-aspiration investors underperform their peers, whereas low-aspirations investors outperform them.
G19|Impact of macroeconomic announcements on implied volatility slope of SPX options and VIX|This paper examines the impact of macroeconomic announcements on the high-frequency behavior of the observed implied volatility skew of S&P 500 index options and VIX. We document that macroeconomic announcements affect VIX significantly and slope at a lesser extent. We also find evidence that good and bad announcements significantly and asymmetrically change implied volatility slope and VIX.
G19|Religious holidays, investor distraction, and earnings announcement effects|We examine price reactions to U.S. firms’ earnings announcements during Easter week in order to analyze whether and how the religious holiday calendar impacts investors’ information processing. We find that there is an asymmetric pattern of immediate and delayed responses to earnings surprises experienced during Easter, entailing similar immediate reactions to both good and bad news and a stronger delayed response to bad news. Moreover, local religious characteristics affect investor’s response to firm news. The results are consistent with a religion-induced distraction effect on investors’ information processing ability. We also show that this effect can form the basis for a profitable trading strategy. The findings highlight the importance of religion for firms’ information environment and for the local component of stock prices.
G19|A dynamic limit order market with fast and slow traders|This paper considers the role of high-frequency trading in a dynamic limit order market. Fast traders׳ ability to revise their quotes quickly after news arrivals helps to reduce the inefficiency that is rooted in the risk of being picked off, which increases trade. However, their presence induces slow traders to strategically submit limit orders with a lower execution probability, thereby reducing trade. Because speed is a source of market power, it enables fast traders to extract rents from other market participants and triggers a costly arms race that reduces social welfare. The model generates a number of testable implications concerning the effects of high-frequency trading in limit order markets.
G19|Measuring liquidity in emerging markets|We propose a modified version of the Amihud illiquidity measure, AdjILLIQ, which performs well in different types of emerging markets. Our AdjILLIQ measure combines the virtues of the original Amihud ratio and the non-trading-frequency measure. It exhibits higher correlation with spread and price impact than other existing low-frequency liquidity measures in most of our sample markets. The improvement gained from using our AdjILLIQ measure is particularly significant in inactively-traded markets and low-turnover stocks. We find that the liquidity in emerging markets, as measured by AdjILLIQ, can be improved by better disclosure and less information asymmetry. Furthermore, the liquidity dry-up during market downturns can also be alleviated by better information environment.
G19|Opaque financial reports and R2: Revisited|In this study, we revisit the link between R2 (synchronicity) and earnings management (opacity) because of the importance of the ongoing debate on the relation between idiosyncratic risk and earnings management in the finance and accounting literatures. Hutton et al. (J. Financial Economics, 2009) provide evidence of a positive link between opacity and R2. They interpret their finding to imply that firms with high R2 (high synchronicity) have less firm-specific information impounded in their stock price. Our results for this relationship fail to unequivocally support the results reported in Hutton et al. (2009). We show that their results are not only time variant but also not robust to the alternative empirical technique recommended for panel data by Petersen (2009) and alternative estimation of discretionary accruals adjusted for firm performance prescribed by Kothari et al. (2005). We also find no support for a convex relation between idiosyncratic risk and opacity. The findings documented in this study substantially revise some of Hutton et al.'s findings in this important and growing area of research.
G19|On the characteristics of dynamic correlations between asset pairs|Recent research provides considerable evidence that correlations between assets change significantly over time and diversification benefits of correlations may vary substantially based on the time-varying measure of correlation used for different asset types. Our study evaluates and compares alternative time-series correlation modeling techniques according to both statistical and economic metrics, focusing specifically on individual asset pairs. We identify the moving correlation structure that best tracks the dynamic conditional correlation estimates using a large set of different financial time series encompassing 467 asset pairs in nine different asset classes. Results from our direct, statistical loss function based, and indirect, portfolio mean-variance based, forecast evaluations provide optimal window-length ranges for 36 asset-class pairs which should help in portfolio construction as well as risk management. Furthermore for robustness tests, we implement the model confidence set approach which, without a benchmark specification, produces a set of models constructed to contain the best models with a given level of confidence among competing forecast evaluations.
G19|Financial Autonomy Of Local Government And Its Survival In Modern Constitutional System|"In modern political systems, in which increasingly speaks of the alienation of power from the people, ""local government undoubtedly plays a major role in the participation of citizens in public affairs, thus making an important corrective to direct democracy and factual inability of citizens to directly participate in making important decisions of general interest. The importance of local self-government evidenced by the fact that she's in almost all the states a constitutional category, as well as the laws in detail, and the Constitution in general, guaranteed its financial autonomy, in the broadest sense. But it is necessary to analyze how the financial autonomy of reality and realize how the sufficiency or insufficiency of the received income from autonomous and guaranteed sources affect the position and the survival of local government."
G19|Bank-based versus market-based financial systems: a critique of the dichotomy|The paper sets out different perspectives on the bank-based vs market-based typology of financial systems. It presents a general critique of the typology, paying particular attention to the ways in which the typology reflects a loanable funds approach, ignoring the roles of banks in the credit money creation process, and the neglect of different types of banks. It is argued that banks should be viewed as institutions engaged in market transactions and the equity markets as also institutions involved in markets.
G19|The Scarcity Value of Treasury Collateral: Repo Market Effects of Security-Specific Supply and Demand Factors|In the repo market, forward agreements are security-specific (i.e., there are no deliverable substitutes), which makes it an ideal place to measure the value of fluctuations in a security's available supply. In this study, we quantify the scarcity value of Treasury collateral by estimating the impact of security-specific demand and supply factors on the repo rates of all the outstanding U.S. Treasury securities. Our results indicate the existence of an economically and statistically significant scarcity premium, especially for shorter-term securities. The estimated scarcity effect is quite persistent, seems to be reflected in the Treasury market prices, and could in part explain the flow-effects of the Fed's asset purchase programs. More generally, it provides additional evidence in favor of the scarcity channel of quantitative easing. These findings also suggest that, through the same mechanism, the Fed's reverse repo operations could help alleviate potential shortages of high-quality collateral.
G19|Case studies on disruptions during the crisis|The 2007-09 financial crisis saw many funding mechanisms challenged by a drastic reduction in market liquidity, a sharp increase in the cost of transactions, and, in some cases, a drying-up in financing. This article presents case studies of several key financial markets and intermediaries under significant distress at this time. For each case, the author discusses the size and evolution of the funding mechanism, the sources of the disruptions, and the policy responses aimed at mitigating distress and making markets more liquid. The review serves as a reference on the vulnerabilities of funding structures and is useful for those considering the scope and design of reform efforts.
G19|Predicting Stock Price Volatility by Analyzing Semantic Content in Media|Current models for predicting volatility do not incorporate information flow and are solely based on historical volatilities. We suggest a method to quantify the semantic content of words in news articles about a company and use this as a predictor of its stock volatility. The results show that future stock volatility is better predicted by our method than the conventional models. We also analyze the functional role of text in media either as a passive documentation of past information flow or as an active source for new information influencing future volatility. Our data suggest that semantic content may take both roles.
G19|Money management with optimal stopping of losses for maximizing the returns of futures trading|By using money management, an investor may determine the optimal leverage factor to apply on each trade, for maximizing the profitability of investing. Research suggests that the stopping of losses may increase the profitability of a trading strategy when returns follow momentum. This paper contributes to the literature by proposing the first money management criterion that incorporates optimal stopping of losses. In an empirical trading study, we are able to substantially improve the profitability when using this criterion, relative to the existing criteria. We conclude that money management should incorporate stopping of losses when returns follow momentum.
G19|How Are Property Investment Returns Determined? : Estimating the Micro-Structure of Asset Prices, Property Income, and Discount Rates|How exactly should one estimate property investment returns? Investors in property aim to maximize capital gains from price increases and income generated by the property. How are the returns on investment in property determined based on its characteristics, and what kind of market characteristics does it have? Focusing on the Tokyo commercial property market and residential property market, the purpose of this paper was to break down and measure the micro-structure of property investment returns in as much detail as possible. In Japan, the characteristics of property suitable for investment are dubbed “kin-shin-dai” (close, new, and large). That is, investors believe that investment returns are high for properties that are very convenient in terms of transportation (close to the city center), new buildings (relatively new properties), and large-scale real estate (large design or floor space). Therefore, this paper first measured how the asset prices, income, and asset price-income ratios (discount rate) that comprise property investment returns change based on differences in these property characteristics. Second, the reliability/distortion of information that can be observed on the property investment market was measured. Much of the information available on the property investment market is property price information determined by property appraisers. However, it is known that property appraisal prices are unable to appropriately reflect actual property market trends. Therefore, using enterprise value data for REIT investment management companies comprised of REIT investment unit prices (share prices) available on capital markets, this paper proposed a method of estimating property investment returns corresponding to changes in capital markets, as well as clarifying the distortion in property investment returns that are formed based on property appraisal prices. Looking at the results obtained, for commercial property, as building floor space increased, it had the effect of raising both the income and price while lowering the discount rate. In particular, compared to residential property, the results showed that a higher investment return can be obtained from commercial property by investing in larger-scale properties. Building age lowered the asset price and income for both commercial and residential property, but the effect was especially strong for residential property. Furthermore, there was a significant divergence between discount rates and risk premiums formed by asset markets and those formed by capital markets, and the results showed that a greater difference was generated while the market was shrinking. This finding suggests that looking at property investment returns that are estimated based on asset market information alone could lead to erroneous investment decisions.
G19|Forecasting Generalized Quantiles of Electricity Demand: A Functional Data Approach| Electricity load forecasts are an integral part of many decision-making processes in the electricity market. However, most literature on electricity load forecasting concentrates on deterministic forecasts, neglecting possibly important information about uncertainty. A more complete picture of future demand can be obtained by using distributional forecasts, allowing for more efficient decision-making. A predictive density can be fully characterized by tail measures such as quantiles and expectiles. Furthermore, interest often lies in the accurate estimation of tail events rather than in the mean or median. We propose a new methodology to obtain probabilistic forecasts of electricity load that is based on functional data analysis of generalized quantile curves. The core of the methodology is dimension reduction based on functional principal components of tail curves with dependence structure. The approach has several advantages, such as flexible inclusion of explanatory variables like meteorological forecasts and no distributional assumptions. The methodology is applied to load data from a transmission system operator (TSO) and a balancing unit in Germany. Our forecast method is evaluated against other models including the TSO forecast model. It outperforms them in terms of mean absolute percentage error and mean squared error. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.
G19|The Effect of Regulation Fair Disclosure on Market Integration|The recent market crises have focused interest on methods to improve the functioning of financial markets. Before implementing new regulations, it is necessary to evaluate the effects of previous regulations. Regulatory changes such as Fair Disclosure have an effect on information dissemination and price discovery. This paper uses the information share of individual markets, to measure changes in the information contribution of markets before and after implementation of Regulation Fair Disclosure. Most of the existing studies focus on the price discovery process and the information contribution or share of the individual markets. This paper uses this information share as a metric to test the effect of a particular regulation. Employing cointegration analysis, this study measures the changes in the information share, impulse response functions, and tests whether Regulation Fair Disclosure has achieved its intended goal of greater informational parity and market integration. Results show that Fair Disclosure has increased the information share of satellite markets and achieved greater market integration.
G19|The analysis of volatility transmission mechanism among carry trade currencies|Investors take the advantage of disequilibrium in spot and forward exchange markets by investing in higher yield currency on a covered basis. An alternative of covered interest arbitrage is uncovered interest arbitrage (UIA) in which investors choose to remain uncovered accepting the currency risk. The “yen carry trade” is known as a Longstanding application of UIA. Owing to Japanese low interest rates, yen carry trade has been a highly profitable strategy which involves borrowing in yen to buy higher yielding assets. Employing multivariate GARCH modeling, we examine the volatility transmission mechanism between the exchange rates involved in “yen carry trade”. Due to high impact of Lehman Brothers’ collapse on world financial markets, we rather do the analysis for both before and after the default. Results reveal that interactions between the exchange rates increase considerably in response to negative market shocks. Our findings present new cross-hedging opportunities for investors.
G19|A Survey of Systemic Risk Measures: Methodology and Application to the Japanese Market|The recent financial crisis has prompted academia, country authorities, and international bodies to study quantitative tools to monitor the financial system, especially systemic risk measures. This paper aims to outline these measures and apply them to Japan fs financial system. The paper demonstrates that they are effective tools for monitoring the robustness of financial system on a real-time basis, although there are some caveats.
G19|Abnormal investor response to the index effect for daily and intraday data|Events that directly affect stock indices are of considerable importance to various index instruments such as ETFs and index funds. One of the most important of such events involves updating the index, which takes place once or twice per year. The effect this has on the capital markets is known as the “index effect”, and it is one of the strongest and most influential long-term effects. Using two different methods, I examine how the index effect impacts the Israeli capital markets. I examine the three leading market indices—the Tel-Aviv 25, the Tel-Aviv 75, and the Tel-Tech 15—for firms whose stocks enter and exit their respective index for both daily and intraday data. In the first examination, I divide the sample based on firms entering/exiting each of these three market indices and examine the index effect using daily data. This analysis shows that the market responds differently for firms entering and exiting the Tel-Aviv 25 than it does for the two other indices. For the second examination, the sample is divided based on each stock’s volatility during the period prior to the event using intraday data. This analysis shows that more volatile stocks respond more strongly to the indexing event. Copyright Swiss Society for Financial Market Research 2014
G19|The information content of disaggregated accounting profitability: operating activities versus financing activities|This paper reports three empirical findings on the differential information content of the components of accounting profitability. First, the paper finds that the shareholder profitability driven by operating activities has a stronger association with annual stock returns than the shareholder profitability driven by financing activities. The finding provides empirical support for the FASB Financial Statement Presentation project, and the project suggests disaggregating accounting profitability into operating and financing activities. Second, the paper finds that the sustainable portion of operating profitability has a stronger association with annual stock returns than the unsustainable portion. This finding contributes to the literature by extending the two popular methods of breaking down operating profitability (DuPont analysis and operating liability leverage) into sustainable versus unsustainable operating income. Penman (Financial statement analysis and security valuation. McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, 2010 ) suggests disaggregating operating income into sustainable versus unsustainable operating income. Finally, the paper identifies the conditional persistence in Amir et al. (Rev Acc Stud 16:302–327, 2011 ) as one of the empirical attributes that affects the valuation usefulness of disaggregated accounting profitability. The conditional persistence measures the marginal contribution of disaggregated profitability to the persistence of aggregate profitability. This paper reports that the disaggregation is more useful in firms with significant differences in the conditional persistence of disaggregated components than in other firms. Test results are robust to controls for cross-sectional and time-series dependence in error terms. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
