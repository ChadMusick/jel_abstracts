Z00|An empirical study of Instagram addiction among university students in Japan|Various problems have been pointed out in the many researchers conducted in relation to internet addiction and social networking service (SNS) addiction. However, few studies have focused on Instagram addiction despite the increasing number of Instagram users in recent years. This study seeks to clarify the relationship between Instagram addiction among university students in Japan and the psychology of internet behaviour. In this study, a questionnaire was conducted with 93 Japanese university students, assuming that psychological status and behaviour in communication on the internet affect Instagram addiction. Young?s 20-item Internet Addiction Test was used to measure the degree of Instagram addiction. The scale was modified for application to Instagram addiction: the psychological scale of communication on the internet was previously used in the study of addiction to SNS other than Instagram. As a result of the survey, it became clear that Instagram addiction is correlated to emotional reaction to the internet, consideration for posting expression and a sense of belonging. In addition, it was revealed that use time of Instagram, number of followers and number of followings are correlated with Instagram addiction. Instagram addiction is not correlated with a skill for not caring . In conclusion, the present study suggests that the amount of use of Instagram, the size of Instagram connections, the emotional connection with others and approval desire are related to Instagram addiction.
Z00|Location of Co-Working Spaces in the city| The present paper investigates the location patterns and the effects co-working spaces (CWS) generate on the urban context. The focus is on Barcelona, one of the most important creative hubs in Europe in terms of knowledge-based, creative, digital, and sharing economy, and the city hosting the largest number of co-working spaces in Spain. The paper addresses three main questions: 1) Which are the location patterns of co-working spaces in Barcelona? 2) Do CWS agglomerate in the same areas? And, 3) Do CWS coagglomerate with specific firm activities? To do that, this paper uses open data on Barcelona neighbourhoodsâ€™ socioeconomic composition provided by the Statistics Department of the Council of Barcelona and micro-geographic data of private CWS and creative labs in Barcelona. By using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Kd functions of agglomeration and coagglomeration, results show that CWS are highly concentrated in central areas of Barcelona where there are greater chances to meet customers and suppliers, the proximity to urban amenities and the fact of being associated to an specific place-image. Moreover, they coagglomerate with specific kinds of firms and to those most related to creative industries. These results are relevant when assessing what it should be the actual goal of urban policies in Barcelona. Keywords: co-working spaces, distance-based methods, agglomeration, coagglomeration, Barcelona. JEL: R00, R39, Z00
Z00|Twelve Eyes See More Than Eight. Referee Bias and the Introduction of Additional Assistant Referees in Soccer|We are the first to investigate whether the introduction of additional assistant referees in the UEFA Europa League (in season 2009-2010) and the UEFA Champions League (in season 2010-2011) was associated with lower referee bias. To this end, we analyse a unique database with pre- and within-game characteristics of all games in seven recent seasons in these leagues by means of bivariate probit regression models. We find evidence for substantial referee bias before the introduction of additional referees, while no such evidence is found after the introduction. Furthermore, additional assistants go hand in hand with more yellow cards for both home and away teams. We show that these findings are robust to multiple operationalisations of referee bias and that they are not just picking up a general time evolution towards less referee bias or the effect of parallel reforms.
Z00|Home Advantage in European International Soccer: Which Dimension of Distance Matters?|We investigate whether the home advantage in soccer differs by various dimensions of distance between the (regions of the) home and away teams: geographical distance, climatic differences, cultural distance, and disparities in economic prosperity. To this end, we analyse 2,012 recent matches played in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. We find that when the home team plays at a higher altitude, they benefit substantially more from their home advantage. Every 100 meters of altitude difference is associated with an increase in expected probability to win the match, as the home team, by 1.1 percentage points.

Z00|Security Analysis of Machine Learning Systems for the Financial Sector|The use of artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML), is being extensively discussed in the financial sector. ML systems, however, tend to have specific vulnerabilities as well as those common to all information technology systems. To effectively deploy secure ML systems, it is critical to consider in advance how to address potential attacks targeting the vulnerabilities. In this paper, we classify ML systems into 12 types on the basis of the relationships among entities involved in the system and discuss the vulnerabilities and threats, as well as the corresponding countermeasures for each type. We then focus on typical use cases of ML systems in the financial sector, and discuss possible attacks and security measures.

Z00|Player Dismissal and Full Time Results in the UEFA Champions League and Europa League|This study is the first to estimate the effects of the sending-off of a player on the full time results in international club soccer. To this end, we analyse data of more than 2,000 recent games in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. We find that when home teams receive a red card, it harms their goal scoring and victory probabilities. By contrast, a red card for away teams can have a positive, negative, or neutral effect for them, depending on the timing of the player dismissal.
Z00|Chiang Kai-shek’s vision for returning to China in the 1950s|This paper investigates Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi, the First President of the Republic of China)’s vision for returning to mainland China during the period of the two Taiwan Strait Crises in the 1950s through the analysis of Taiwanese archival documents. Some conclusions can be drawn from the analysis presented here. First, Taiwanese archival documents show that the United States was more actively encouraging the Republic of China [ROC] to hold and even take advantage of the offshore islands, the Da-chen Islands in particular. The U.S.’s attitude may have maintained or strengthened Chiang Kai-shek’s hope that he would be able to return to the mainland of China. Second, Chiang had paid enormous attention to the People’s Republic of China [PRC]-Soviet relations, and when he discussed the subject with allied U.S. officials, he emphasized that the Soviet Union would not intervene even if the ROC conducted a counter-offensive against the Chinese mainland. While it is difficult to judge whether Chiang’s analysis of Soviet intentions concerning the defense of the PRC was motivated by his desire to entrap the United States or if it was the outcome of more cool-headed logical thinking, his observances of the signs of the split between Beijing and Moscow after the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958 was remarkably accurate. It is possible that Chiang may have thought that his chance of returning to mainland China would be greater in the late 1950s and the early 1960s. The critical piece that he needed to realize his dream, however, was support from the United States who ironically became more reluctant as time went on.
Z00|Determinants of early marriage and model of maturing marriage age policy: a case in Jambi Province, Indonesia|This study aims to analyze factors affecting early marriages and to formulate a model of maturing marriage age policy in Jambi Province, Indonesia. Using binary logistic model and interpretive structural modeling, we found that: firstly, factors affecting women’s decision to get married early could come from both individual and their parents charateristics. Secondly, the appropriate model for maturing marriage age policy involved six main elements of the system. Those are objectives, institutions, needs, constraints, community involvement, and assessment benchmarks. We come to the conclusion that maturing marriage age is not only determined by individual characteristics, but also other factors

Z00|Bitcoin: Future transaction currency?|Bitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency that has attracted substantial interest in recent years from the general people, profit seekers, risk takers, academic practitioners and last but not the least, from economists. Most recently, particularly, after 2015, it has succeeded to gain even more attention for increase in value and volume of exchange. The Bitcoin system maintains a global, distributed cryptographic ledger of transactions, or blockchain, through a consensus algorithm running on hardware scattered across the world. This paper basically discusses on the nature of cryptocurrency & blockchain, how it works and present status of bitcoin blockchain in different countries around the world. The various aspects this technology in detail is yet to be revealed. The authors hope that this simple, basic and narrative paper will be helpful for those seeking the basic references regarding this newest issue.
Z00|The Decommissioning of the Middle Class|": The euro crisis has threatened the balance of social structures, through the impoverishment of the middle class, in almost all countries of the Old Continent. This trend has not only posed a threat to social cohesion, but it also threats the very nature of the so-called Western-style Democracy. The reason for this is that there is a class that has always been a ""cushion"" that absorbs both the vibrations of competition and the confrontation of the social elite with the socially weak, offering the latter the ability to overcome their misery. In most capitalist economies, the middle class label is based on an economic definition that is largely based on a lifestyle that is based on a certain economic robustness and endurance. With the deepening of the crisis, however, the diversity of the middle class not only has it been jeopardized, but rather, it has gradually been replaced by a new demographic category called the prekariat. This new category consists of a group of people once in the middle class and currently marginalized. All of this leads to generalized uncertainty and totally unstable political attitudes, with intense mobility at the extremes. The rapid rise of right and left-wing populism is an aspect of the threatened subjugation of the middle class strata. The consequences for societies when their layered center is lost are obvious and significant."
Z00|Mitigating externalities of terrorism on tourism: global evidence from police, security officers and armed service personnel|In this paper, we investigate the role of security officers, the police and armed service personnel in dampening the effect of terrorism externalities on tourist arrivals. The temporal and geographic scopes are respectively 2010-2015 and 163 countries. Four terrorism measurements are used. They include the number of: incidents, injuries, fatalities and property damages. The main findings indicate that armed service personnel can effectively be used to modulate the damaging influence of all four terrorism externalities in order to achieve a positive net effect on tourist arrivals. Conversely, the corresponding moderating role of security officers and the police is not statistically significant. Moreover, violent demonstrations and homicides have a harmful effect on tourist arrivals while the number of incarcerations displays the opposite effect. Policy implications are discussed.
Z00|Tourism and social media in the world: An empirical investigation|The study examines the relationship between tourism and social media from a cross section of 138 countries with data for the year 2012.The empirical evidence is based on Ordinary Least Squares, Negative Binomial and Quantile regressions. Two main findings are established. First, there is a positive relationship between Facebook penetration and the number of tourist arrivals. Second, Facebook penetration is more relevant in promoting tourist arrivals in countries where initial levels in tourist arrivals are the highest and low. The established positive relationship can be elucidated from four principal angles: the transformation of travel research, the rise in social sharing, improvements in customer service and the reshaping of travel agencies. This study explores a new dataset on social media. There are very few empirical studies on the relevance of social media in development outcomes.

Abstract In Colombia, there have been several mechanisms to adapt the pedagogical and didactic tendencies to the different university training programs. Policies such as the accreditation of universities have allowed the design of substantial changes in institutions, as well as the implementation of standards that make it comparable internationally. This work is based on the reflection on the basic principles about teaching economy in an environment like the Colombian and its constant concern for the improvement of teaching. Keyword: education, economy, emotions, university. JEL Codes: Z00. 1. CONTEXTUALIZACIÓN Comenzar a ser docente de economía en Colombia requería, en la década de los noventa, como requisito fundamental haber culminado con algún dominio un programa de Economía en una de las universidades reconocidas a nivel nacional. No se necesitaba entonces ni título de maestría ni formación en alguna licenciatura o corriente especial de pedagogía o docencia. Esto revelaba las preferencias de la educación en ese momento: el contenido de la enseñanza y la búsqueda de ser competitivo marcaban el criterio de selección del docente. Y realmente algunas de estas consideraciones no han cambiado. A lo largo de la década de los noventa en Colombia y como parte del contexto internacional, se profundiza la noción de la educación basada en competencias. El contenido pierde protagonismo, sin ser totalmente eliminado; de acuerdo con un informe de la Unesco, en la conferencia de 1998 acerca de la educación superior, se expresa: (…) es necesario propiciar el aprendizaje permanente y la construcción de las competencias adecuadas para contribuir al desarrollo cultural, social y económico de la sociedad. Asimismo, se señaló que las principales tareas de la educación superior han estado y seguirán estando ligadas a cuatro de sus funciones principales: • Una generación con nuevos conocimientos (las funciones de la investigación). • El entrenamiento de personas altamente calificadas (la función de la educación). • Proporcionar servicios a la sociedad (la función social). • La crítica social (que implica la función ética): Hacia las sociedades del conocimiento (Argudín, 2001, p. 2). Esta visión fue asumida internacionalmente y, para el caso particular, también por Colombia, dada la necesidad de estandarización dentro de los procesos de integración económicos. Este cambio de paradigma conlleva ante todo un cambio en la manera como se asume la educación. En Unesco (2005), se encuentra que: como con la rapidez de los progresos técnicos, las competencias pierden rápidamente actualidad, es conveniente fomentar en los distintos ámbitos del conocimiento la adquisición de mecanismos de aprendizaje flexibles, en vez de imponer un conjunto de conocimientos muy definido. Aprender a aprender significa aprender a reflexionar, dudar, adaptarse con la mayor rapidez posible y saber cuestionar el legado cultural propio respetando los consensos. Estos son los pilares en los que deben descansar las sociedades del conocimiento. Luego, la educación en Colombia debía acomodarse a esta perspectiva y se hizo necesario adquirir nuevos títulos (maestrías y doctorados con respecto al contenido). Y si era posible, aún en un nivel básico, de diplomados, de formación pedagógica. Para Maldonado (2006): La educación superior en América Latina ha experimentado desde finales del milenio tanto en Colombia como América Latina, transformaciones de fondo que aún continúan. Sus cambios se produjeron, especialmente, por el influjo de informes, recomendaciones y políticas emanados de organismos multilaterales (…) Entre los documentos más importantes pueden citarse el Consenso de Washington, los informes PREAL, publicados por la Comisión Internacional sobre Educación, Equidad y Competitividad Económicas en América Latina y el Caribe; el Banco Mundial, el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo, el Fondo Monetario internacional y la Organización de Estados Americanos, entre otras entidades. Adicionalmente, en el entorno de la acreditación institucional regulado por el artículo 53 de la ley 30 de 1992, se hace necesario ser competitivo, pues una señal muy importante dentro de los mercados con información asimétrica son las acreditaciones, las cuales a su vez pueden justificar los diferenciales tarifarios. Asimismo, nace el Sistema Nacional de Evaluación de la Calidad de la Educación Superior que impone, inicialmente, los Ecaes y, posteriormente, la Prueba Saber Pro; esta última, aún vigente, es un examen de Estado cuyo objetivo básico es evaluar la calidad de la educación; está regulado por la ley 1324 de 2009, el decreto 3963 de 2009 y el decreto 4216 que reglamenta el decreto 3963. Una importante consideración es que estos cambios toman su tiempo. A la vez que las universidades debían comenzar sus procesos, se dan algunas reticencias por parte de los docentes; pero también aparecen en el mercado las primeras maestrías en educación, que buscan preparar a los docentes y mostrar fortalezas teóricas alrededor de los desarrollos de la pedagogía y la didáctica, desconocidos para muchos en el entorno universitario. Por áreas de conocimiento, a 2015 y de acuerdo con las estadísticas del Consejo Nacional de Acreditación —CNA—, existen seis programas de posgrado acreditados en el área de educación. Dentro de este proceso, asimismo, la pedagogía recibe la influencia de ciencias como la neuropsicología, que comienza a estudiar el tema que será uno de los pilares, desde la pedagogía y la didáctica, que se utilizarán como línea argumentativa en este artículo. Como resultado de las discusiones, existen varios elementos para tener en cuenta: las universidades poseen una autonomía que debe ser respetada, a pesar de la necesidad de la evaluación profesional. Es por ello que la calidad de la enseñanza, su pertinencia y el nivel de calificación profesional deben estar acordes con la diferenciación propia de cada una de las instituciones. Adicionalmente, y en el campo de estudio de este artículo, debe tenerse en cuenta criterios como los expresados por Misas (2007), respecto del campo de la economía: En la segunda posguerra, el campo de la economía sufrió una profunda mutación (Coats, 1996); el rápido proceso de internacionalización de la economía tomó la forma de un proceso de universalización de las prácticas y percepciones de la academia norteamericana. La tradición de las escuelas nacionales —austriaca, sueca, alemana, francesa, inglesa, japonesa, india o latinoamericana— que, a partir de elementos generales de la economía clásica, desarrolló teorías completas para pensar e interpretar sus patrones de acumulación (o su evolución económica) y que fue muy sólida durante casi cien años (1850—1940), desapareció con la universalización de la teoría económica estándar, convertida por la academia estadounidense en la ciencia económica. Academia que logró “el monopolio de la autoridad científica, definida inseparablemente como capacidad técnica y poder social” (Bourdieu, 1976, p. 12). Es decir que el panorama sería como sigue. En el campo de la educación, una serie de cambios relacionados con la calidad y con la necesidad de entrar en procesos relacionados con los exámenes estatales, la acreditación de la calidad; y, desde el punto de vista de cuerpo teórico, con el fin de inscribirse en las tendencias internacionales, la necesidad de enseñar economía marginalista, que además es deseable a partir de los mismos manuales internacionales. Y he acá una de las ideas que se pretende sea la base de este esfuerzo. Uno de los aspectos más importantes de la manera como se ha enseñado la economía, y que genera una profunda insatisfacción de los estudiantes, está relacionado con la ignorancia del campo de estudio aplicado a la vida real, basado en el menosprecio por el entorno económico nacional para alinearse ante una metodología económica del Centro, como lo decía la Cepal. No se pretende decir que la economía pierda su carácter científico que busca en todo caso ser generalizable. Se pretende en este trabajo establecer que, al realizar los diferentes estudios, deben introducirse condiciones reales para cada uno de los estudios, bajo una reflexión regional a fin de asimilarse verdaderamente como campo de estudio. Si algo se ha aprendido de ciencias como la antropología, es la necesidad de estudios de campo que representen las variables reales para cada uno de los contextos, dado que muchas son las políticas que fracasan en su aplicación, no por el diseño mismo de ellas, sino por el desconocimiento del entorno en el cual deben aplicarse; a tal punto que desde este campo antropológico se pregunta un educador: ¿Por qué en economía no se enseña economía, sino solo fundamentos de mercado bajo la forma de Capitalismo? La respuesta está sujeta a la deliberación del mercado mismo. 2. JUSTIFICACIÓN A nivel mundial, los estudiantes enviaron en 2014 una carta a Mankiw acerca de la enseñanza de la economía en situaciones como la crisis de 2008. Joan Robinson (1988) postulaba una de las inquietudes que es común a quienes de manera responsable hacen parte de este sistema de formación de economistas: Llevo muchos años trabajando como profesora de economía teórica. Quisiera creer que me gano honradamente la vida, pero con frecuencia me asaltan dudas. Me preocupa particularmente el caso de la India y otros países en vías de desarrollo, la mayor parte de cuyas doctrinas económicas les llegan de Inglaterra y en inglés. ¿Lo que les damos es útil para su desarrollo? Además, hace evidente uno de los temas que más interesa en este documento: la motivación. Se cuestiona Robinson (1988): En los momentos de depresión, pienso en el perjuicio del que podemos ser responsables. Como es lógico, la mayor parte de los estudiantes estudian con el solo objeto de pasar un examen y obtener un diploma. (…) Aquellos cuyo único interés reside en superar los exámenes, aprenden pronto que el truco consiste en decir lo que de ellos se espera; en no preguntarse qué significa lo que están diciendo (porque tal cosa resulta desconcertante y arriesgada y puede restar puntos); en repetir la fórmula particular que parece convenir a cada problema particular. Esto cuestiona las raíces de la pedagogía que busca trascender los resultados de las evaluaciones. Adicionalmente, aparece la necesidad de que, en la formación de los economistas, se favorezca el criterio y el pensamiento crítico. Robinson (1988) propone: ¿Cómo me gustaría reformar la enseñanza? Ante todo, prescindamos de los que solo desean aprobar. Reducirán a eslóganes cualquier cosa que les enseñemos y los nuevos eslóganes no pueden resultar más engañosos que los viejos. Incluso es posible que los nuevos lo sean algo menos, si resulta difícil desligarlos de la realidad. (…) Pensando en el estudiante consciente, tomaría el toro por los cuernos y comenzaría por comentar diversos tipos de sistema económico. Toda sociedad (excepto Robinson Crusoe) debe tener algunas reglas de juego destinadas a organizar la producción y la distribución del producto. El capitalismo de laissez faire es tan solo uno de los posibles conjuntos de reglas y, de hecho, es imposible jugar según el reglamento en su forma pura. Siempre debe ir unido a ciertas medidas de control colectivo. 3. PROBLEMA Se percibe la educación como un bien deseable para toda la sociedad, puesto que la economía es una ciencia que se encarga de la asignación de los recursos y está relacionada con el bienestar de los individuos en la sociedad, y su enseñanza puede permitir generar las estructuras para unas mejores condiciones de vida para la mayoría de los habitantes del planeta. En los últimos años, se ha reducido el campo de la economía a entender el funcionamiento del mercado, desconociendo que es solo una de las posibles respuestas al problema de la asignación de los recursos, y con una falla superior: desconociendo las variables sociales, políticas y culturales que determinan algunos de los análisis que deberían realizarse. Para este artículo, se busca resolver la siguiente pregunta: ¿Cómo debe enseñarse la economía en un contexto como el colombiano? El presente artículo es fruto de las reflexiones acerca de la enseñanza de la economía, en su quehacer práctico y como parte del esfuerzo que se considera necesario en la mejora continua no solo a nivel individual como docente, sino como aporte al sistema de formación de economistas en el país. El objetivo es presentar algunas de las discusiones que se consideran dentro de los criterios formadores de la ciencia económica, para integrarlos con las discusiones propias de la pedagogía y la didáctica de la cual se partirá, haciendo énfasis en los modelos que pretendan reseñar una idea clara asociada a la relación entre emociones y aprendizaje. En una segunda instancia, se presentan discusiones acerca de la enseñanza de la economía y sus características vigentes sobre todo a nivel nacional. Para finalizar, si bien no se cerrarán las conclusiones, se espera realizar una aproximación evaluativa del pénsum en algunos de los programas actuales de economía en Colombia y presentar algunas propuestas de actualización. 4. MARCO TEÓRICO 4.1. Primera Parte: La emoción dentro del aprendizaje Uno de los desafíos que se tienen al escribir el artículo, es establecer que la discusión acerca de las emociones y el aprendizaje ha dejado de ser una cuestión de “me gustan las matemáticas” o “no me gusta el profesor”. Las emociones no son un tema nuevo de estudio en las diferentes ciencias, desde la psicología, la neurociencia hasta la antropología, han establecido aportes a tal estudio. Siguiendo a Chóliz (1995): “Los tres principios fundamentales de la explicación de las emociones, que tienen una relación tangencial con el principio de selección natural son los siguientes: —Hábitos útiles asociados. —Antítesis. —Acción directa del sistema nervioso”. Y el análisis de las emociones puede estar por fuera del campo de la economía; pero dentro del estudio de la manera como escoge el individuo, es innegable que debería incorporarse una especial consideración a las emociones como parte del proceso de decisión. Si bien Darwin es conocido por sus aportes en el evolucionismo, buena parte de sus estudios estuvieron asociados a las emociones como uno de los elementos de adaptación de las especies a su entorno. Y logra aclarar algunas de las preguntas que surgen a medida que un individuo se acerca al objeto de estudio: ¿Las emociones son naturales? ¿Se aprenden? De acuerdo con Chóliz (1995): Según Darwin, las tres acciones más importantes son los reflejos, hábitos e instintos. Los más importantes en la expresión de las emociones son los reflejos y los instintos, que son innatos y se heredan de nuestros antepasados, manifestando una clara continuidad filogenética en la expresión de las emociones, del mismo modo que existe continuidad en la evolución biológica. Así, tanto la expresión de las emociones propias, como el reconocimiento de las de los demás, se realizan de forma principalmente involuntaria y no aprendida. Los hábitos, producto de asociación de reflejos, que tengan como función las expresiones emocionales pueden modificarse e ir desapareciendo. Chóliz (2005) propone que: “Habitualmente se entiende por emoción una experiencia multidimensional con al menos tres sistemas de respuesta: cognitivo/subjetivo; conductual/expresivo y fisiológico/adaptativo”. Este planteamiento coincide con el modelo tridimensional de la ansiedad propuesto por Lang (1968). Desde esta perspectiva, en el caso de la ansiedad, esta se manifiesta por una respuesta que incluye aspectos en diferentes niveles del sujeto, asociados además a repuestas estructuradas diferenciadamente, siendo estas: el nivel cognitivo, el nivel fisiológico y, por último, el sistema conductual. En el primer nivel, se encuentra relacionada con pensamientos basados en el temor, en la racionalización de las amenazas e incluso desórdenes asociados al pánico; por otra parte, las respuestas fisiológicas están relacionadas con aumentos de las actividades del sistema cardiovascular. Para terminar, en el aspecto conductual, se incluye la posible aparición de tics, temblores e imposibilidad de aquietarse, entre otros aspectos. Ahora bien, la existencia de las emociones podría estar justificada por ser fruto de un funcionamiento fisiológico concreto. Pero adicionalmente, y dentro de la visión funcionalista, se sabe que las emociones poseen tres tipos de funciones: adaptativas, sociales y motivacionales. Chóliz (2005) anota: “La relevancia de las emociones como mecanismo adaptativo ya fue puesta de manifiesto por Darwin (1872/1984), quien argumentó que la emoción sirve para facilitar la conducta apropiada, lo cual le confiere un papel de extraordinaria relevancia en la adaptación”. Con respecto a la función social de las emociones, se sabe de nuevo con Chóliz (2005) que: La propia represión de las emociones también tiene una evidente función social. En un principio se trata de un proceso claramente adaptativo, por cuanto que es socialmente necesaria la inhibición de ciertas reacciones emocionales que podrían alterar las relaciones sociales y afectar incluso a la propia estructura y funcionamiento de grupos y cualquier otro sistema de organización social. No obstante, en algunos casos, la expresión de las emociones puede inducir en los demás altruismo y conducta prosocial, mientras que la inhibición de otras puede producir malos entendidos y reacciones indeseables que no se hubieran producido en el caso de que los demás hubieran conocido el estado emocional en el que se encontraba (Pennebaker, 1993). Para finalizar, dentro de las funciones motivacionales: La relación entre emoción y motivación es íntima, ya que se trata de una experiencia presente en cualquier tipo de actividad que posee las dos principales características de la conducta motivada, dirección e intensidad. La emoción energiza la conducta motivada. Una conducta “cargada” emocionalmente se realiza de forma más vigorosa. Como hemos comentado, la emoción tiene la función adaptativa de facilitar la ejecución eficaz de la conducta necesaria en cada exigencia. Así, la cólera facilita las reacciones defensivas, la alegría la atracción interpersonal, la sorpresa la atención ante estímulos novedosos, etc. Por otro, dirige la conducta, en el sentido que facilita el acercamiento o la evitación del objetivo de la conducta motivada en función de las características alguedónicas de la emoción (Chóliz, 2005). A modo de una primera conclusión y siguiendo a Tokuhama—Espinosa (2005), existen cinco conceptos que la ciencia de la mente—cerebro y la educación han establecido, y de los cuales se puede partir al pretender incorporar desarrollos de pedagogía y didáctica coherentes con las nuevas realidades. Dichos principios son: 1. Los cerebros son tan únicos como los rostros, dentro de la organización del cerebro puede depender de las experiencias dentro de la gestación. 2. El contexto y la habilidad influyen en la manera como se realiza el aprendizaje. 3. El cerebro cambia a medida que se vive, pues las experiencias lo modifican aun cuando sean de un día y apenas perceptibles; y cuando los estímulos se repiten de manera constante, los cambios ocurridos en el cerebro son permanentes. Para Tokuhama—Espinosa (2005), “Las áreas del cerebro que normalmente se utilizan en conjunto tienden a reforzarse, mientras que las áreas que no se estimulan se atrofian. Esta verdad da lugar al concepto hebbiano de la sinapsis (Hebb, 1949) mediante el cual las neuronas que se activan entre sí se conectan entre sí)”. 4. Una de las características más permanentes del cerebro es su plasticidad, con lo cual siempre es posible el aprendizaje. Según Tokuhama—Espinosa (2005): Se ha documentado ahora que la neuroplasticidad puede explicar por qué algunas personas han sido capaces de recuperar destrezas que se pensaban perdidas por culpa de una lesión o un accidente. La gente que nace con un solo hemisferio del cerebro, que aun así logra vivir su vida normalmente, es un ejemplo extremo de dicha plasticidad. (…) bajo condiciones normales, las habilidades que identifican las etapas normales de desarrollo deberían ser vistas como puntos de referencia, no como obstáculos en la vía, puesto que los seres humanos pueden aprender a lo largo de toda su vida. 1. El cerebro conecta nueva y vieja información, es decir que el aprendizaje puede basarse en experiencias previas, con lo cual esta puede ser una importante herramienta en el continuo de las tareas dentro del aula. Como parte de la investigación para este documento, se pretende agregar a estas valiosas conclusiones una adicional: la importancia de las emociones. Pero, hasta el momento solo se ha mostrado un componente relativamente teórico acerca de uno de los elementos que más puede suscitar cambios en la manera como se enseña la economía dentro del aula, pues el sentirse cómodo en el salón de clases resulta entonces decisivo en el proceso de aprendizaje. Sin embargo, ya existen sucesivos informes de la Fundación Botín, que desde 2007 ha venido realizando investigaciones con más de 500.000 estudiantes y que propone en su informe 2015: Por último, consideramos que la docencia emocionalmente inteligente es una cuestión de actitud del profesor para validar las emociones en el aula. Las escuelas saldrían enormemente beneficiadas si consideraran las emociones como un aspecto relevante del proceso educativo y no como un obstáculo. Para mostrar una actitud emocional positiva, el profesor debe controlar sus reacciones automáticas ante las situaciones cotidianas del aula y sentirse cómodo a la hora de expresar sus sentimientos, permitiendo al mismo tiempo que sus alumnos identifiquen, regulen y expresen sus sentimientos, con el objetivo común de nutrir un ambiente emocional saludable que apoye el desarrollo y el aprendizaje. La propuesta que este artículo tiene es en el tema de las emociones: de doble vía, por un lado, la emoción básica de la formación asociada a la conciencia social, la cual se ha perdido tras un falso mito de deteriorar la capacidad técnica de los economistas; ahora bien, la segunda emoción radica en la didáctica y tiene que ver con la disminución de una sensación de frustración por la no aplicabilidad de la economía. Es por ello que se presenta una alternativa hacia los semestres más altos: la incorporación de los estudios de caso, no desde la perspectiva administrativa y de gerencia, sino más bien desde la visión histórica, social y antropológica de los procesos. 5. ENSEÑANZA DE LA ECONOMÍA EN COLOMBIA Uno de los primeros artículos en estudiar la enseñanza de la economía en Colombia es escrito por Currie (s.f.), y propone: La economía es una de las ciencias sociales o de comportamiento, que intenta formular generalizaciones válidas sobre aquellos aspectos de la conducta humana que se refieren primariamente a la producción y distribución de los bienes y servicios. Puesto que la naturaleza no ha creado compartimientos completamente aislados, la economía limita con las otras ciencias sociales, por una parte, y con una variedad de campos técnicos y prácticos, como las técnicas contables y estadísticas, por otra parte. Es un texto de 10 páginas donde el escritor muestra no solo su conocimiento de la ciencia, sino de la sociedad colombiana en general. Propone como conclusiones los siguientes aspectos (el resumen es de los autores): Hemos sugerido aquí no solamente la importancia de la economía, sino la necesidad, como cuestión de supervivencia, de que la clase ilustrada de Colombia posea alguna comprensión respecto al funcionamiento del sistema económico. Esto sugiere lo deseable que sería una organización que permitiera ofrecer cursos elementales en teoría económica al mayor número posible de estudiantes universitarios. De alguna manera, con las reformas de la década de los noventa, que incluyó una asignatura con componentes económicos en la educación media, se dotó al estudiante promedio de los conocimientos básicos del funcionamiento del mercado. Sin embargo, la profesión de economista sigue circunscrita a programas a nivel nacional. De acuerdo con el Snies, 29 programas se encuentran, a mayo de 2017, acreditados (ver anexo 1). Ahora bien, Currie (s.f.) prosigue con algunos elementos que se deben tener en cuenta: Se recalcó la distinción entre la economía como una ciencia, de la planeación como un arte y de la administración de negocios como una ocupación, y se hizo énfasis sobre los peligros involucrados en el intento de combinar estos campos diferentes. Para los relativamente pocos economistas profesionales bien preparados que el país requiere en la actualidad se encarece que pocas universidades debieran actuar en este campo, y que el curso debiera ser general y relativamente corto, para estudiantes maduros, enfatizando nuevamente en la teoría, seguido de una especialización por el individuo de acuerdo a sus capacidades, con énfasis sobre la investigación y la enseñanza. Una insistencia temprana y excesiva sobre las matemáticas, desde el punto de vista de este ensayo, debilitará el campo y reducirá la contribución que puede aportar la economía al país. Debido a la naturaleza típica del tema el estudio de la economía, para ser fructuoso, requiere participación activa de parte de los estudiantes. Esto deja poco lugar para conferencias y requiere mucha discusión y trabajos escritos. (…) Es obvio que una aceptación general de estos puntos de vista implicaría modificaciones profundas en la actual organización y métodos de enseñanza de la economía en Colombia. La mayor parte de las facultades de economía existentes deberían combinarse con otras facultades de ciencias sociales o de humanidades, acortando sus cursos en un año. O algunos de ellos podrían convertirse en un nuevo tipo de escuela de negocios. Para el futuro economista una o dos escuelas nacionales para graduados podrían ofrecer un curso de dos años en teoría básica y estadística, bastante diferente del programa que se ofrece en la actualidad por nuestra única escuela para graduados. Con números grandemente reducidos sería de poco costo y habría mucho que ganar con un año de especialización en el exterior. Tanto la enseñanza como la investigación deberían exigirse para conceder el título final de posgraduado, llámese este como sea. La duración del programa oscila entre 8 y 10 semestres, dependiendo básicamente de la institución, y en general uno de los factores que se tiene en cuenta es que en Colombia, para 2017, está en vigencia el decreto 0940 de 2002, donde se establece que, para el logro de la formación integral del economista, el plan de estudios básico comprenderá, como mínimo, las siguientes áreas y componentes fundamentales del saber y de la práctica, los cuales no deben entenderse como un listado de asignaturas: Área de formación básica: Contempla el componente económico, que hace referencia a los principios, las teorías y políticas económicas; así como a su aplicación, componente en el que la investigación tiene especial importancia. Componente económico: Cubre el campo microeconómico, temas de opciones y decisiones microeconómicas, la producción e intercambio de bienes, la interdependencia de mercados y el bienestar económico, y el campo macroeconómicos relacionado con el empleo, los ingresos nacionales, la balanza de pagos y la distribución de los ingresos, la inflación, los ciclos económicos, el crecimiento, el dinero y las finanzas, el desarrollo, la historia económica, las políticas económicas, tanto en el nivel microeconómico como en el nivel macroeconómico. El manejo de estos principios exige la comprensión de métodos analíticos y argumentos basados en modelos. Área de formación profesional: Incluye conocimientos y prácticas relacionadas con los siguientes componentes. Componente instrumental, hace referencia a aquellas herramientas, cuantitativas y cualitativas, que hacen viable la comprensión, interpretación, proyección y aplicación de las teorías y políticas económicas y su integración con las demás áreas del saber. Componente de énfasis, permite a cada institución imprimir una característica específica en su programa y responder a las aspiraciones, vocaciones y competencias individuales de los estudiantes en campos en los cuales la disciplina desarrolla nuevas aplicaciones para el ejercicio profesional. Área de formación socio—humanística: Comprende aquellos saberes y prácticas que complementan la formación integral del economista y facilitan el diálogo interdisciplinario en el desarrollo de soluciones a problemas socioeconómicos. 6. LA PREOCUPACIÓN POR LA CALIDAD Fruto de la coyuntura que se esbozó al inicio del artículo, donde concurrían factores como el cambio en el ordenamiento internacional y la aparición de las competencias, la necesidad de acreditación y la preocupación constante por la calidad de la educación, y se realizan diagnósticos como el de Misas (1994): La calidad en educación superior se relaciona estrechamente con: i. La cantidad y calidad de los recursos que la sociedad y el Estado destinan a este nivel de educación. 42 elementos para la formulación de una estrategia para el desarrollo de la educación superior. ii. La eficiencia en el uso de esos recursos por parte de los establecimientos educativos. iii. El desarrollo institucional logrado, la acumulación de competencias en el tiempo y la cimentación de una cultura académica. Adicionalmente, es importante señalar, como lo encontraron los miembros de la Comisión Attali, que un buen sistema universitario y el éxito de los estudios universitarios depende del nivel cultural de los padres de los estudiantes y de la calidad de los estudiantes que recibe. Entonces, en buena medida la calidad está dependiendo del capital cultural heredado por parte de los estudiantes que acceden a la universidad y de la calidad de las instituciones de educación media. Aparecen entonces los exámenes de calidad de la educación superior —Ecaes—, reglamentada por el decreto 1781 de 2003. Fruto de la interacción de los programas que hasta ese momento pertenecían a la Asociación de Facultades de Economía —Afadeco—, se propone un Ecaes con la siguiente estructura: El énfasis que se ha hecho en esta estructura se debe a que representa un consenso de las diferentes facultades acerca del cuerpo de la economía. Este consenso se verá reflejado en el contenido temático de cada uno de los componentes y, en últimas, en la estructura homogénea y casi estandarizada del pénsum de las diferentes facultades. Ahora bien, dentro de las preocupaciones de este artículo, se pretende establecer una reflexión acerca de la pedagogía en economía. Una vez establecido un relativo acuerdo en torno a qué se debe dictar, debe hacerse una reflexión acerca de si solo debe presentarse el mecanismo de mercado; es decir, si la formación de los economistas debe limitarse a entender el capitalismo como forma de ordenamiento social, basada en entender las existentes leyes del mercado. La respuesta, en corto, es no. Aparece la necesidad de contextualizar las nociones básicas de economía; se pueden extrapolar las nociones que se tiene acerca de la economía de la India para cada uno de los países, esto sí, sabiendo que cada una de las realidades está compuesta por elementos sociales, históricos y culturales diferenciadores tanto en sus estructuras, como en sus prácticas. Robinson (1998) propone: El panorama indio es un complejo de elementos precapitalistas, capitalistas y socialistas que se dan simultáneamente. Los estudiantes familiarizados con el Viejo Mundo en vías de rápida desaparición pueden contribuir a desentrañar el análisis económico de su funcionamiento y a poner a prueba el significado de conceptos tales como salarios y capital en contextos no capitalistas. (…) Adam Smith, Ricardo, Marx, Marshall y Keynes serían considerados términos del modelo de sistema económico en que cada uno pensaba al escribir y de los problemas que de hecho intentaron resolver (…) Hay algunas consideraciones que deben replantearse, como parte de la formación básica de un economista, y es hacer evidente la existencia de teorías del valor, privilegiando además de la teoría necesaria, los casos en los cuales se puede aplicar cada uno de los preceptos. Y este es, creo, uno de los aportes que deben replantearse: la teoría económica, en ninguna de las escuelas, debe evitarse, pero debe enseñarse dentro del pensamiento crítico necesario, con pluralidad de autores y mostrando con evidencia histórica las alternativas pertinentes. Robinson (1988) propone: Desplazaría de su lugar de privilegio la teoría de los precios relativos y sustituiría por la producción, la acumulación y la distribución, desde perspectiva de una economía considerada en su conjunto. La teoría general de Keynes queda bien situada entonces como sección a corto plazo de una teoría verdaderamente general. (…) No solo trataría los mercados y las leyes de la oferta y la demanda en términos de un equilibrio ideal ya alcanzado, sino también en términos de tráfico real de mercancías, con su tendencia a desarrollar ciclos en ‘telaraña’, y las violentas sacudidas que reciban de vez en cuando las comunidades dependientes del mismo. (…) Aparece en Robinson (1988) un tema que, además, ha sido retomado por escuelas y autores como Amartya Sen y Manfred Max—Neef, y que es una de las ideas que se pretende incorporar en la propuesta de este documento: Trataría la previsión social en términos humanos y enseñaría a los alumnos a basarse en estudios objetivos de los niveles de nutrición y de sanidad en vez de preocuparse de las ‘superficies de preferencia’. (…) En cada caso, dejaría claro que la teoría económica no enseña doctrinas y no puede establecer leyes universalmente válidas. Es un método para organizar las ideas y formularse preguntas. Por este motivo prestaría mucha atención a la cuestión de método. Insistiría en la distinción entre una identidad aritmética, una representación de condiciones de equilibrio y un compendio de datos econométricos. Y = C + S (siendo Y el valor neto de la renta nacional durante un período, C el valor de las adquisiciones de bienes de consumo y S el ahorro neto) es una identidad. La palabra ‘neto’ cubre un factor compensador (amortización de capital preexistente) que iguala ambos términos por definición. S = sY (siendo s la proporción de la renta nacional que normalmente se ahorra) es una representación de condiciones de equilibrio; toda su significación depende del sentido que se dé normalmente. (…) En ninguno de los tres casos obtenemos información sobre el proceso de causalidad; los modelos construidos con estos ladrillos nunca se tendrán en pie. A fin de hallar relaciones causales debemos conocer el comportamiento de los individuos y la forma en que se interacciona el comportamiento de diversos grupos. Creo que debería intentarse destruir el respeto que imponen las fórmulas, no a fin de inducir un deslizamiento escéptico hacia el nihilismo intelectual, sino a fin de crear el hábito de desmembrarlas y recomponerlas de nuevo eliminando las ambigüedades y de mantenerlas firmemente en su lugar como útiles complementos del sentido común, no como sustitutivos de este. Adicional a esta perspectiva aparece hacia finales del siglo XX la economía experimental, basada en elementos de la teoría de juegos y que abre la perspectiva de experimentar en la economía. Aparece no solo una nueva metodología de investigación, sino también de aprendizaje. Este reconocimiento es sin duda alguna uno de los logros del fin de milenio; a pesar de que la academia colombiana ha tardado en incorporar este tipo de temáticas en sus mallas curriculares 7. ESTRUCTURA PEDAGÓGICA DE LA PROPUESTA Consistente con lo mostrado en el desarrollo del presente artículo, debe partirse de un conocimiento profundo disciplinar, y puede basarse en el conocimiento de las áreas disciplinares planteadas por la asociación de economistas. Microeconomía, Macroeconomía, Pensamiento e Historia Económica y Estadística y Econometría. En segunda instancia, la formación, desde los desarrollos pedagógicos, debe incluir no solo el estudio de las teorías del mercado, sino que deben incorporarse los desarrollos de las diversas escuelas de pensamiento económico, los componentes institucionales como esbozo del papel del Estado y, para dar mejor claridad a la toma de decisiones, la teoría de la elección. Es decir, la naturaleza del conocimiento en economía se mantiene en cuatro pilares fundamentales; los cuales ahora serán introducidos con un criterio basado en el pensamiento crítico y la comunicación con otras ciencias y disciplinas. Es importante, por ejemplo, la contextualización histórica de las diferentes sociedades, así como el conocimiento de elementos políticos y culturales. Básicamente, y luego de una revisión de algunos de los programas de economía, se considera que la propuesta podría ser la siguiente, con algunos cambios propios de la autonomía universitaria: Fundamentación básica Este componente buscaría proponer las áreas básicas que se requieren para la formación de un economista. Reconoce que un denominador común en la mayoría de los programas son las escasas bases específicas con las que llegan los estudiantes. Es así como se propone reforzar las competencias en lecto—escritura, contexto y matemáticas básicas. • Fundamentos de economía. • Fundamentos de sociología. • Fundamentos de antropología. • Fundamentos de administración, gerencia y finanzas. • Fundamentos de contabilidad y análisis financiero. • Metodología historiográfica. • Competencias en comunicación oral y escrita. • Matemáticas básicas y álgebra lineal. • Cálculo. • Fundamentos de estadística y probabilidad. • Inferencia estadística. • Modelación estática y dinámica. Formación profesional Este componente busca la formación que ha sido reconocida como los pilares de la economía; que busca ir más allá de los fundamentos que se requieren en el conocimiento disciplinar, y que el estudiante logre desarrollar sus criterios disciplinares. • Teoría de la elección en condiciones de competencia perfecta. • Teoría de la elección en neuroeconomía. • Competencia imperfecta y decisiones estratégicas. • Teoría de la elección intertemporal. • Instituciones y Estado. • Teorías del pensamiento económico y economía política. • Economía cerrada clásica y keynesiana, y decisiones de política monetaria y fiscal. • Economía abierta y desarrollos contemporáneos de comercio exterior. • Historia económica mundial: un enfoque historiográfico. • Crisis económicas, orígenes y mecanismos de intervención estatal. • Historia y contexto sociocultural. • Elementos de economía estática. • Elementos de economía dinámica. • Historia y establecimiento del desarrollo económico. • Instrumentos econométricos de corte clásico, y modelos de corte transversal. • Series de tiempo y modelación dinámica. • Desempeño económico aplicado y cambios en los modelos de desarrollo. Componente de énfasis Incluye todas las asignaturas particulares de cada una de las instituciones, así como de los diferentes programas, respetando la independencia de las diferentes universidades. Ahora bien, el aporte fundamental desde la pedagogía en el presente artículo está relacionado con las emociones. Pero no se trata del tema de cómo hay que motivar al estudiante, o ayudarle a encontrar el gusto. Tiene que ver con un concepto que se ha denominado en este entorno consciencia social. Se parte de un par de conceptos adicionales. Siguiendo a Bisquerra (2016): Las habilidades sociales son las que facilitan las relaciones interpersonales, sabiendo que estas están entretejidas de emociones. La escucha y la capacidad de empatía abren la puerta a actitudes prosociales, que se sitúan en las antípodas de actitudes racistas, xenófobas o machistas, que tantos problemas sociales ocasionan. Estas competencias sociales predisponen a la constitución de un clima social favorable al trabajo en grupo productivo y satisfactorio. Las emociones interculturales son aquellas que experimentamos cuando estamos con personas de otra etnia, color, cultura, lengua, religión, etc., y que según se regulen de forma apropiada o no, pueden facilitar o dificultar la convivencia. Las competencias para la vida y el bienestar son un conjunto de habilidades, actitudes y valores que promueven la construcción del bienestar personal y social. El bienestar emocional es lo más parecido a la felicidad, entendida como la experiencia de emociones positivas. No podemos esperar a que nos vengan dados los estados emocionales positivos, sino que hay que construirlos conscientemente, con voluntad y actitud positiva. Esto es posible y deseable. Y más adelante: Conviene subrayar que tanto la educación emocional, la tutoría como la educación para la ciudadanía comparten objetivos comunes: el desarrollo personal y social, que haga posible la convivencia en democracia y la construcción del bienestar personal y social. Esto, que es fácil de decir, pero difícil de poner en práctica de forma efectiva, requiere tiempo, cambio de actitudes y entrenamiento para el desarrollo de competencias. También se pueden introducir elementos de educación emocional en todas las áreas académicas. La cuestión no es qué enseñamos, sino cómo lo enseñamos. Lo importante, probablemente, no es tanto llenar cabezas de contenidos como encender la llama de la ilusión para continuar aprendiendo durante toda la vida. Esto significa motivar para desear continuar aprendiendo, lo cual es una forma de educación emocional. Entonces aparece acá la raíz de la presente propuesta, dado que la educación emocional posee un reflejo en las conductas sociales. Es la consciencia del propio entorno social, positivo desde la experiencia, y normativo desde lo deseable, uno de los elementos que pueden incorporarse. La consciencia de los efectos en la calidad de vida de las decisiones financieras de la bolsa y sus posibles implicaciones deben ser evidenciadas en la formación de los economistas. Por eso, uno de los pilares de la formación de los economistas debe ser el estudio de casos, dividido en dos grandes maneras: Por un lado, los estudiosos teóricos, donde se realizan simulaciones de condiciones hipotéticas pero plausibles. Pueden ser a nivel de modelos de equilibrio computacionales o de experimentos realizados en el aula. Por otra parte, están los análisis de situaciones históricas de las cuales quedan lecciones acerca, por ejemplo, de la inconveniencia de adaptación de las normas específicas o la ausencia de estas. Por otro lado, evidencia histórica acerca de los diferentes eventos sociales. La importancia del populismo en el sistema económico no necesita simularse: puede analizarse en las diferentes condiciones y bajo la instrumentalización propia de la economía. 8. DIDÁCTICA Una de las lecciones que en la vida del docente deben aprenderse tarde o temprano, tiene que ver con la conveniencia específica de las clases magistrales y el malestar que se debe expresar en las reuniones acerca de su generalización, así la práctica que se ha aprendido esté limitada a ellas. No se pretende en este artículo su eliminación; de hecho y por el contexto de la educación en Colombia, es posible que en los primeros años de formación sea necesario dotar al estudiante de los principios básicos, así como de las herramientas que se requieren en el análisis económico a través de las diferentes clases, siendo la magistralidad una manera adecuada a estos primeros intereses. Se trata de asignaturas donde es necesario desarrollar habilidades básicas de análisis pedagógico, si se quiere de los niveles 1, 2 y 3 de la taxonomía de Bloom. De acuerdo con Krutakova (2014), la clase magistral: Es muy útil cuando la bibliografía es escasa y permite al alumno acceder a la información selectiva que está transmitiendo el profesor. Es adecuada en la explicación de contenidos complejos. Cuando se trata de grupos grandes se convierte en uno de los métodos más viables. Se puede combinar con cualquier otra estrategia docente para lograr mayor eficacia en la transmisión de los contenidos. Ayuda a desarrollar los conceptos del tema dentro de un esquema global del temario. El profesor puede corregir al momento los errores en la transmisión oral de la materia. Permite al docente ir cambiando el lenguaje académico según el nivel de conocimientos del alumnado. Sin embargo, y gracias a las teorías de la pedagogía y la didáctica, es posible, de acuerdo con ciertas condiciones, implementar discursos y técnicas diversas, según los diferentes grupos y asignaturas. Una de las ideas que se pretende desarrollar en este aparte es que las emociones juegan un papel muy importante en el aprendizaje, y dentro de ellas se establece que para la economía ha faltado la práctica en la aplicación de los conceptos desde múltiples perspectivas; una de ellas es a partir de emociones como la consciencia social e inculcando dentro de los economistas la responsabilidad y el análisis de las consecuencias de las acciones en el bienestar de seres humanos (ya no vistos solo como agentes). Así como decir que la memoria no es adecuada para el aprendizaje es una idea comúnmente aceptada pero equívoca, pues hace parte de los procesos propios de la mayoría de aprendizajes, establecer que se debe partir de casos se puede intentar a fin de prever las crisis. Anteriores generaciones no poseían los casos y la tecnología para establecer escenarios de infinitas soluciones, que permiten modelar las crisis previéndolas en una ruta crítica para encontrar una solución compleja. La primera didáctica que podría implementarse es un estudio de caso. Con base, por ejemplo, en hechos de la vida real como la Segunda Guerra Mundial, plantear las condiciones en las cuales se toman las diferentes políticas y sus efectos en la sociedad. Pero, al mismo tiempo, pueden realizarse casos hipotéticos, dado que en gran parte de los análisis lo más importante es efectuar el estudio basado en los supuestos realizados para cada situación. En cuanto a las estrategias que deberían premiarse en el desarrollo de los cursos de orden superior, siguiendo a Travé y Pozuelos (2008): La enseñanza basada en la investigación basada en desarrollos de autores como Dewey, Kilpatrick, Decroly, Piaget o Freinet proporcionaron fundamentos psicopedagógicos que han dado lugar a múltiples y diversos desarrollos curriculares y a trabajos sobre el aprendizaje escolar y el desarrollo profesional (…) En el momento actual, la investigación escolar relacionada con problemas sociales relevantes supone una parte importante de la producción científica. Ahora bien, siendo consecuentes con lo expuesto anteriormente, acerca del conocimiento en ocasiones escaso acerca de pedagogía y didáctica para los docentes de economía, cabe decir en este texto que según Travé y Pozuelos (2008): La metodología de investigación se basa en el denominado ‘estudio de caso’, concebido como un análisis exhaustivo de un proceso educativo único, con el objetivo de comprender, describir y explicar las actuaciones de los profesores implicados cuando identifican, diagnostican e intentan resolver problemas importantes que afrontan al enseñar (McKernan, 1999). (…) dicha metodología se encuadra dentro del modelo de investigación—acción de carácter integrado, que pretende la descripción y reflexión de la actividad de clase con la finalidad de comprender y mejorar los procesos educativos incidiendo en los obstáculos detectados. Los instrumentos de investigación están relacionados con declaraciones ya sean estas entrevistas semiestructuradas o grupos de discusión; algunos registros escritos y las observaciones de acuerdo con lo que se va a estudiar. Se realizarán documentos de interpretación y sistematización de datos, de los cuales, por ejemplo, se analizan asuntos como la pertinencia de la información, los indicadores utilizados y la sistematización de estos, así como de las herramientas metodológicas utilizadas. Se pueden utilizar instrumentos propios de desarrollos de la economía experimental. Siguiendo a Salazar (2010): La economía experimental aplica métodos de laboratorio para estudiar las interacciones de los seres humanos en los contextos sociales gobernados por reglas explícitas o implícitas. Las reglas explícitas pueden ser definidas por secuencias controladas por el experimentador y por la información sobre los eventos que ocurren en juegos entre n (>1) personas con pagos (payoffs) definidos. Las reglas explícitas también pueden ser aquellas usadas en una subasta u otra institución de mercado donde las personas compran o venden derechos abstractos (para producir o consumir), información o servicios (e. g. transporte) dentro de un ambiente tecnológico definido. Las reglas implícitas son normas, tradiciones y hábitos que las personas traen consigo al laboratorio como parte de su herencia evolutiva cultural y biológica; normalmente estas reglas no son controladas por el experimentador” (Smith, s.f.). El objetivo se esta propuesta es mostrar el diseño de una estrategia conjunta que incluya al menos los siguientes principios esenciales: Se prima el contenido en las asignaturas; pero no la memoria, de tal manera que debe buscarse que el estudiante sea capaz de llevar a cabo análisis situacionales de acuerdo con los supuestos dados. Sin embargo y dentro de la autonomía de cada uno de los docentes, se sugiere: 1. Cuando los cursos son los relacionados con los tópicos básicos de microeconomía y macroeconomía, debe llevarse a cabo un modelo mixto, de tal manera que se dicten hasta cierto punto los contenidos de la clase; luego, se resuelvan algunos ejercicios y se evalúa el desarrollo de estos por parte del estudiante. Es una resolución basada en la pedagogía activa; pero que tiene en cuenta que no siempre se cuenta con los mejores bachilleres. 2. A partir de los cursos de 4º semestre, equivalentes al 40% de los créditos de la carrera, deberá comenzarse a aplicar un tipo de didáctica donde los estudiantes deban analizar y proponer cambios importantes en diferentes momentos del curso; es decir, partiendo de situaciones reales o realísticas (diseñadas para simular condiciones) deben analizar, evaluar y proponer de acuerdo con el nivel esperado para cada una de las asignaturas. 3. Una de las consideraciones que se han estado solicitando en el mercado laboral y que parece incuestionable, es la necesidad del manejo de una segunda lengua y el manejo de aplicaciones informáticas. Esto debe ser transversal y parte de las políticas de cada una de las universidades; asimismo, se propone la transversalidad de asignaturas relacionadas con, por ejemplo, la Constitución Política y el desarrollo de competencias ciudadanos y de lecto—escritura, aspecto en el cual existen gran cantidad de debates acerca de la pertinencia a desarrollarse en el nivel de la educación superior, cuando puede ser pertinente hacerlo con antelación a esta etapa. 4. Con estas metodologías, además se busca desarrollar competencias acerca del trabajo en grupo y el manejo de herramientas informáticas, así como de formación en principios éticos. 9. CONCLUSIONES La economía debe ser una ciencia investigativa social, fundamentalmente del entorno en que se va a aplicar. Los economistas deben conocer muy bien sus regiones y las características integrales y diferenciales dentro del contexto nacional. Para así hacer una adecuada aplicación de la herramienta estadística, financiera o de modelamiento probada en el exterior; debe tener una habilidad antropológica para entender al ciudadano particular de su entorno. El capitalismo es una de las formas de ordenamiento social, basado en la supremacía del mercado como institución, y dentro de un marco teórico y conceptual que se ha planteado como paradigma de ciencia y enseñanza; pero se debe reconocer que no es el único. Está lleno de costosas crisis para la sociedad y debe ser evaluado por encima de los intereses de ciertos imperios y grupos de poder, que pueden terminar siendo representados por los diferentes grupos directivos de las universidades. Se debe cambiar la concepción “espartana” educativa a la que conduce el principio de competitividad, que se solapa bajo el supuesto criterio de competencias, evidenciada en la significativa crisis de valores de los banqueros y dirigentes económicos bajo graves cargos de corrupción. Esto, además, podría ser reemplazado si se fomenta en lo estudiantes parámetros de consciencia social, de consecuencia de las acciones en el bienestar de los otros, esferas donde la responsabilidad social se ha quedado corta. Las emociones ayudan en el aprendizaje de los estudiantes, creando condiciones de motivación, trabajo constante y aprendizaje significativo. Esta ha sido una propuesta, donde fomentar el aprendizaje de los estudiantes más allá de los contenidos. Basada en la integralidad, permite encontrar soluciones más adecuadas con el contexto colombiano, dentro de las nuevas necesidades de responsabilidad social. BIBLIOGRAFÍA Argudín, Yolanda (2001).

Z00|Putting social rewards and identity salience to the test: Evidence from a field experiment with teachers in Philadelphia|"We partnered with the School District of Philadelphia (SDP) to run a randomized experiment testing interventions to increase teacher participation in an annual feedback survey, an uncompensated task that requires a teacher’s time but helps the educational system overall. Our experiment varied the nature of the incentive scheme used, and the associated messaging. In the experiment, all 8,062 active teachers in the SDP were randomly assigned to receive one of four emails using a 2x2 experimental design; specifically, teachers received a lottery-based financial incentive to complete the survey that was either ""personal"" (a chance to win one of fifteen $100 gift cards for themselves) or ""social"" (a chance to win one of fifteen $100 gift cards for supplies for their students), and also received email messaging that either did or did not make salient their identity as an educator. Despite abundant statistical power, we find no discernible differences across our conditions on survey completion rates. One implication of these null results is that from a public administration perspective, social rewards may be preferable since funds used for this purpose by school districts go directly to students (through increased expenditure on student supplies), and do not seem less efficacious than personal financial incentives for teachers."
Z00|Georgian emigrants? online support groups: exploring self-presentation and social capital on Facebook|There is a clear evidence that emigration is associated with negative psychological outcomes, such as acculturation stress, depression, suicidal feelings, etc. Emigrants use various strategies to solve the psychological problems. Being a member of emigrants? Facebook supportive groups is common among Georgians mostly living in Europe and North America. They use Facebook groups to get acquainted with other Georgian emigrants, share their ideas and important information, get social support from other members and cope with their everyday hassles. This study examines how Facebook group membership experience (frequency of activity and using self-presentation tactics) is associated with accumulating online social capital among Georgian emigrants. 105 Georgian emigrants from 15 Facebook groups participated in the online survey. The results showed that frequent checking of notifications, writing posts, comments, and likes on emigrants? Facebook groups are positively associated with both bridging and bonding social capital. In addition, strategic self-presentation on Facebook groups is also positively related to online social capital variables.
Z00|Between a Combinative Perspective and Self-Contained Practice: A Critical Review of Ethnomethodology|Ethnomethodology (EM) brought a new vision to social studies by putting the construction of social reality through everyday life and practices of the members of society at the center and questioning what is taken granted conventionally in social research. However, it is doubtful if EM possesses a systematic and comprehensive approach to explain the social world extensively as a fully-fledged practice or framework of analysis. Moreover, it shows a very fragmented structure regarding the studies in the field. Based on these aspects, this article problematizes the extent of EM?s contribution to social analysis. The argument of this work is that it is not suitable to be considered a separate framework of social analysis due to the drawbacks mentioned; nevertheless it has a significant potential to contribute to the examination of social reality if it is integrated into the theoretical and/or methodological frameworks of social analyses as a perspective. The argument is defended through critical reading of the primary and secondary sources which deals with EM theoretically and also discussing some studies which can be regarded as its applications in social research.
Z00|The Impact of Solvents on the Properties of Electrospun Nanofibers|Electrospun Polyurethane nanofibrous webs were produced from the solutions prepared with various volume ratios of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and Tetrahydrofuran (THF). Characteristics of the blended solutions were explored in terms of viscosity and conductivity. Morphologies of nanofibrous webs were observed by SEM analysis. Experimental results exhibited that the morphologies of polyurethane nanofiber webs have been changed significantly with the solvent selection and mixing ratios of the solvents during electrospinning. Diameter of the nanofibers was ranged between 277 nm and 556 nm, respectively. Tensile strength and elongation measurements proved that mechanical properties of the nanofibrous webs were remarkably influenced by the fiber morphology and the uniformity.
Z00|Dispersion of CuO nano particles in the lubricant of a vapor compression refrigeration system: An investigation on enhancing coefficient of performance|The cooling performance of a refrigeration system is defined by coefficient of performance (COP) which is directly proportional to the heat removal rate at the evaporator or inversely proportional to the power input to the compressor. In this study, a refrigeration system test rig equipped with pressure and temperature sensors was run with raw oil and nano lubricant separately to compare heat removal rate at the evaporator and a digital energy meter was utilized to determine COP variation. The results suggested that nano particle incorporation was very effective especially in COP by average of 11% due to good tribological features of CuO nano particles in the context of friction reduction in the compressor piston-liner mechanism of the compressor.
Z00|Characteristics of Non-participants in Community Development Activities in Taiwan, a Case Study of a Rural Community in Tainan|Participatory Community Development (PCD) is a method to solve problems in a community by residents who have common concern about their community?s condition. Taiwan has advanced PCD since the comprehensive community development policy was implemented in 1994. This study aims to clarify characteristics of non-participants in PCD activities based on a certain social dimension. Previous studies have improved PCD technologies, such as clarifying success factors for the community revitalization and developing measures to support PCD mainly focusing on the participant-group, although some researchers pointed out a PCD problem of which participants were a segment of the residents. However, it would be difficult to ensure the continuity of PCD activities which is an entrance to construct a sustainable community, if specialists just focus on participants. Thus, it is worth focusing on the non-participant and considering its reasons from the viewpoint of PCD study. The research field is an agricultural village of R district in B division in Tainan-city. The survey was conducted three times from 2011 to 2018. The PCD?s leader is a pastor in R district and the research already found that participants were almost all Christians and non-participants were almost all Tao-people as it was stated earlier. Based on non-participants? narratives, the study roughly highlighted characteristics of their daily lives as follows:1. They revere ancestors as well as Tao?s gods. They have a specific time for worship in their house every day. In contrast, they visit a temple in the district twice a month for regular rites. They attend worship alone or as a family and there is usually no occasion to communicate with other residents. 2. They frankly visit each other, while there are no relationships beyond the chatting level.3. They do not share memories about the family and the temple between generations.4. They tend to frankly join activities in the district regardless of religions or anything else if they can get information. Therefore, a characteristic of non-participants can be summarized as a more individual-lifestyle, which is more individualistic than Christian participants who have more opportunities to gather in the church. The results indicate that the non-participation is caused by those lifestyles rather than a difference in religions which is generally said in the area. Moreover, the importance of the social dimension as an influential factor was suggested. A micro-perspective based on the locality will be required more and more in the PCD study.
Z00|The Situation of English Language Education in the Faculty of Human Sciences in a Japanese University|This study investigates the situation of English language education in a Japanese university in Ishikawa, Japan, and is part of a larger research carried out over a number of years. The data gathered, reported, and analyzed in this paper includes a comparison of two academic years of data, showing results by/for different teachers? classes. The question of educational value for money, fair spread of teacher resources, and positive or negative discrimination is tackled. Findings show there tends to be both positive and negative discrimination within class levels, where students who initially score well on placement tests are assigned ?better? teachers, while lower level students tend to be assigned lower performing teachers, resulting in a ?low skill trap?, despite all students paying the same fees.
Z00|The requirements for the success of political reform in the Arab world|"In this paper, I reviewed the requirements for the success of the political reform process in the Arab world after the crises witnessed by many Arab countries under the so-called ""Arab Spring"", by focusing on the conceptual implications of political reform in these countries and the importance of this at the local, regional and international levels, despite the different characteristics and circumstances of Arab societies in general, the requirements for the success of political reform in them are reflected in two basic means: the first is a legal means, linked to the role of legislator in the enactment of laws and political reform process, the second is a social and cultural means at the same time, related to the role of civil society organizations in changing the concepts, principles and values in the citizen's mind, in the sense of trying to democratize the behavior of citizens. The legislative function of the legislature is easy and does not require much time and great effort, although it is important to change the legal texts. However, social and cultural reform requires much more time, effort and active involvement of the various organizations in society, from the family to the school to the media and political parties. I take this intervention through to address these elements:1 - The concept of political reform in the Arab world2 - The importance of political reform in the Arab world3. Conditions for the success of political reform in the Arab world-Legal reform and the importance of the legislator's role in this.-Cultural reform and the importance of the role of civil society organizations."
Z00|So Ugly! User Experience of LINE?s Ugly e-Stickers|LINE is the most popular and frequently used communication software in Taiwan, and its e-sticker function is a user favorite. In early 2016, a trend of ?ugly e-stickers? suddenly developed on LINE and the Internet. These e-stickers are drawn in the style of children?s graffiti, consisting of simple lines, and present a ?childlike? appearance without any particular design. This particular form resulted in a new style of e-sticker. This kind of e-sticker is different from the commonly pleasing impression of e-stickers and even reaches the point of being considered ?ugly? in traditional visual perception. It has also overturned the idea of ?needing a skillset to submit e-stickers.? To understand this particular phenomenon, this study explored user experience and conducted a questionnaire survey based on the Technology Acceptance Model to understand the users? experience in using ugly e-stickers and explore their motivation and intention behind using ugly e-stickers. The study found that ugly e-stickers are more popular among young and outgoing users, as well as those who frequently use communication software. Factors that affect the attitude of users toward using ugly e-stickers include the general view of ugly e-stickers and whether these e-stickers are user-friendly and practical. Comments made by others about ugly e-stickers and the popularity of such e-stickers are factors that affect the motivations of users to use e-stickers.
Z00|Tourism and Social Media in the World: An Empirical Investigation|The study examines the relationship between tourism and social media from a cross section of 138 countries with data for the year 2012.The empirical evidence is based on Ordinary Least Squares, Negative Binomial and Quantile regressions. Two main findings are established. First, there is a positive relationship between Facebook penetration and the number of tourist arrivals. Second, Facebook penetration is more relevant in promoting tourist arrivals in countries where initial levels in tourist arrivals are the highest and low. The established positive relationship can be elucidated from four principal angles: the transformation of travel research, the rise in social sharing, improvements in customer service and the reshaping of travel agencies. This study explores a new dataset on social media. There are very few empirical studies on the relevance of social media in development outcomes.
Z00|Expiring neighborhood: Architecture as a tool for marketing ?home? in Istanbul/Turkey|Istanbul is one of the metropolitan areas connected to the globe in many ways. Since 1980, Turkey is open to the effects of the consumer culture. TV series, imported goods, brand names, commercials, working practices, etc. changed not only our everyday life, but our values as well. ?Competing?, ?show off? and ?money? are the basic motivation for the society instead of ?solidarity?, ?sensitivity? and ?respect?. Architecture is in use of the economy policy as one of the tools supporting the social change towards a capital oriented mass. The criterion to buy a house is its exchange value instead of its use value as a ?home?. A house is not considered as a ?home ?to enjoy our individual/family life any more. Masses are being manipulated to think the house as an asset for investment on sale. The program and the spatial organization of the houses depend on the rules of marketing, instead of beauty, strength, or use as it used to be in the history of architecture.Considering the percentage of housing in the context of the built environment, and the effect of the space on the human mind/body, it is easy to imagine this consumerist approach of housing will cause a big change on the urban dynamics. The neighborhoods in Istanbul are already under attack of the contractor companies. High-rise residences with some commercial facilities have been constructed and sold for high prices. In a short period, this pattern of production has become a conventional practice of the production of housing. This paper presents a fragment from the current everyday life in Istanbul drifting attention to the contradiction in-between the demands of the housing market and the embedded value of the societal relations at the neighborhoods. The target is showing the upcoming danger of losing the human values, values of architecture and the city as a living organism, and questioning the possibilities for a better future.
Z00|"""The Quality Of The Ecosystem Of Start-Up Companies In Poland As A Factor Of Their Internationalization In The Global Network Economy Environment - Research Project. Goals, Assumptions And Researc Methods ?"|"The aim of the presentation is to submit and put into discussion the research project ""The quality of the ecosystem of start-up companies in Poland as a factor of their internationalization in the global network economy environment? (later on termed ?Project?). The title issue will be put in the perspective of the experience of highly developed countries. The Project is aimed at comprehensive, thorough analysis of the actual state and economic conditions for the internationalization of Polish startups as well as potential future perspectives for their international expansion with special importance attached to the quality of so called ?ecosystems? in Poland as a factor of this expansion. Second, the analysis undertaken in the Project places the title issue, i.e. the internationalization of startups, in a broader context of the ?network economy? (also called ?knowledge based economy? or ?digital economy? and refers to the concept of ?born globals?. The comparative perspective for the studies of the subject issue is the characteristics of the startups, their business environment and particularly the tendencies and dynamics of startups foreign expansion observed in other European countries, boasting good performance and best indicators as to the internationalization of those firms, like among others Germany, the Netherlands, France, Great Britain, Italy and Spain. As supplementary research the Project intention is to present the relevant characteristics of the leading world startup centers (i.e. their ecosystems) in highly developed countries, mainly from the United States, Canada and Israel. Taking up ?internationalization? as the center of the project is valuable not only for scientific and cognitive purposes but also from the point of view of the current priorities of Poland?s economic policy. This project combines, both theoretically and empirically, the research fields of the widely understood quality of state ?ecosystem? as the environment for startup development and work, as well as the conditions of the global economy. The presentation on the Conference will be concentrated mainly on the scientific problem aimed to be solved by the proposed Project, Project's research hypotheses and the proposed methodology. Important argument for the innovative character of the Project is that its empirical part embraces various analytical methods used in micro- and macroeconomics. It applies behavioral methods used in sociological and psychological analyses in economics, such us: variance analysis, multifactorial variance analysis, i.e. ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA and Principal Component Analysis. These will be used along with quantitative methods such as regression (widely-used"
Z00|Historical Tourism : A Case Study of Muang Wiang Sa|The study of historical tourism: a case study of Muang Wiang Sa purposed to study community context, general situations about historical tourism, and historical tourism resources of Muang Wiang Sa, Wiang Sa district, Surat Thani province, Thailand. The method of this research was qualitative research by applying SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats). The key informants were from three groups; namely 1) executives and community leaders, 2) manufacturer and entrepreneur, and 3) representative local people in the community. The research instruments were an in-depth interview, documentaries and focus group. The findings indicated that: Muang Wiang Sa has valuable historical attractions. The existing community sages are ready to convey the knowledge to the young new generation. However, the community does not have high potential in the management of historical tourism and environmental conservation. The cooperation of the community in the management of tourism is at the high level. Basic infrastructure and facilities should be improved. The historical tourism plan should be made. Moreover, the collaboration of young generation in the community must be encouraged.
Z00|Hyper-H-Indices for Multi-Attribute Research Outputs: Characterizations|A multi-attribute research output index assigns a real number to any integer-valued matrix recording the relevant research items and their respective attribute-scores, for any fixed set of m distinct integer-valued attributes. The hyper-h (HH) index assigns to such a multi-attribute research output the maximum number n of output-items having a minimum attribute-score not smaller than n. Thus, HH-indices can also be described by analogy with the h-index as hyper-Durfee numbers, namely as side-sizes of suitable Durfee hypercubes. Two distinct characterizations of HH-indices that generalize well-known characterizations of the h-index are provided. Those characterizations strongly suggest that the standard properties of the h-index can be easily lifted to multi-attribute outputs, provided that distinct attributes are implicitly given an equal 'weight'.
Z00|Predicting norm enforcement: the individual and joint predictive power of economic preferences, personality, and self-control|Abstract This paper explores the individual and joint predictive power of concepts from economics, psychology, and criminology for individual norm enforcement behavior. More specifically, we consider economic preferences (patience and attitudes towards risk), personality traits from psychology (Big Five and locus of control), and a self-control scale from criminology. Using survey data, we show that the various concepts complement each other in predicting self-reported norm enforcement behavior. The most significant predictors stem from all three disciplines: stronger risk aversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism as well as higher levels of self-control increase an individual’s willingness to enforce norms. Taking a broader perspective, our results illustrate that integrating concepts from different disciplines may enhance our understanding of heterogeneity in individual behavior.
Z00|The #nofilter Self: The Contest for Authenticity among Social Networking Sites, 2002–2016|This study traces appeals to authenticity, over time, in the promotional material of leading social-networking sites (SNSs). Using the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, the public-facing websites of major SNS platforms—beginning with Friendster in 2002—were sampled at six-month intervals, with promotional language and visuals examined for authenticity claims. The authors tracked these appeals, with attention to changes in promotional copy, through to July 2016, among the most popular social media services (as determined by English-language web presence and active monthly user figures or, when unavailable, reported network size). The study found that nearly all SNSs invoked authenticity—directly or through language like “real life” and “genuine”—in their promotional materials. What stood out was the profoundly reactive nature of these claims, with new services often defining themselves, openly or implicitly, against legacy services’ inauthenticity. A recurring marketing strategy, in other words, has been to call out competitors’ phoniness by substituting (and touting) some other, differently grounded mode of authenticity. Since the affordances of social sites, even those touting evanescence or anonymity, make them vulnerable to similar charges, the cycle gets replayed with numbing regularity.
Z00|When Care and Concern Are Not Enough: School Personnel’s Development as Allies for Trans and Gender Non-Conforming Students|Trans people—and particularly trans youth—have come to the forefront of political and educational discussions, especially as legislation has aimed to ensure that school personnel act as enforcers of state-level policies targeting trans youth. For this reason, and because research demonstrates that youth in schools form attachments to and receive support from school personnel, our research looks at school personnel’s development as allies. By analyzing focus group data following a training workshop, we explore how participants understand their roles as allies to trans and gender non-conforming youth. We found that trans issues were salient and participants expressed new knowledge about and openness towards transgender youth, as well as care and concern for their wellbeing. Nonetheless, many participants retained frames of understanding that relied on trans people as Other and that situated their roles as allies through the frameworks of protection and care. We argue that these understandings of trans youth and the role of allies reinforces cisnormativity, and we push for a more nuanced understanding of allyship that moves beyond knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and intended behaviors as markers of allyship to ensure that allies do not reproduce cisnormativity even in their support of trans and gender non-conforming youth.
Z00|Queer in STEM Organizations: Workplace Disadvantages for LGBT Employees in STEM Related Federal Agencies|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals in U.S. workplaces often face disadvantages in pay, promotion, and inclusion and emergent research suggests that these disadvantages may be particularly pernicious within science and engineering environments. However, no research has systematically examined whether LGBT employees indeed encounter disadvantages in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) organizations. Using representative data of over 30,000 workers employed in six STEM-related federal agencies (the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Transportation), over 1000 of whom identify as LGBT, we compare the workplace experiences of LGBT employees in STEM-related federal agencies with those of their non-LGBT colleagues. Across numerous measures along two separate dimensions of workplace experiences—perceived treatment as employees and work satisfaction—LGBT employees in STEM agencies report systematically more negative workplace experiences than their non-LGBT colleagues. Exploring how these disadvantages vary by agency, supervisory status, age cohort, and gender, we find that LGBT persons have more positive experiences in regulatory agencies but that supervisory status does not improve LGBT persons’ experiences, nor do the youngest LGBT employees fare better than their older LGBT colleagues. LGBT-identifying men and women report similar workplace disadvantages. We discuss the implications of these findings for STEM organizations and STEM inequality more broadly.
Z00|Promoting Military Cultural Competence among Civilian Care Providers: Learning through Program Development|Military veterans and their families belong to a unique subculture. Several studies have identified the need for helping professionals to attain military cultural competence in order to practice more effectively. In order to address this need, a Midwestern state created a military culture certificate program (MCCP). The process of developing this program is described. Eighty-two participants of the MCCP completed a pretest survey assessing their knowledge, awareness, and self-confidence in working with this population. The majority of the participants had experience working with this population already, and their survey scores indicated moderate knowledge and moderate to high levels of overall self-efficacy. Pre-test scores indicated ten areas (six in knowledge and four in self-efficacy) that may deserve increased focus for programs and trainings on military culture. While the MCCP appeared to be generally effective, findings suggest that convenient adjunctive methods of obtaining information to enhance military cultural competence would also be helpful.
Z00|The Potential Scientist’s Dilemma: How the Masculine Framing of Science Shapes Friendships and Science Job Aspirations|In the United States, girls and boys have similar science achievement, yet fewer girls aspire to science careers than boys. This paradox emerges in middle school, when peers begin to play a stronger role in shaping adolescent identities. We use complete network data from a single middle school and theories of gender, identity, and social distance to explore how friendship patterns might influence this gender and science paradox. Three patterns highlight the social dimensions of gendered science persistence: (1) boys and girls do not differ in self-perceived science potential and science career aspirations; (2) consistent with gender-based norms, both middle school boys and girls report that the majority of their female friends are not science kinds of people; and (3) youth with gender-inconsistent science aspirations are more likely to be friends with each other than youth with gender normative science aspirations. Together, this evidence suggests that friendship dynamics contribute to gendered patterns in science career aspirations.
Z00|Fat People of Color : Emergent Intersectional Discourse Online|Though the general populace has been introduced to the idea of thin privilege, the fat activist movement has been slow in gaining momentum. This is due, in part, to the symbolic annihilation of “fat” people in media. Within the fat activist framework, women of color are often further excluded from the overarching discourse and white privilege is sometimes unacknowledged. Taking an intersectional approach, I examine the Tumblr page, Fat People of Color. I use Critical Technocultural Discourse Analysis (CTDA) to examine the images and conversations posted by users. Findings reveal that Fat People of Color uses an intersectional, communal approach to posit counter-narratives against normative ideas about white thinness. This research contributes to an understudied area of sociological inquiry by presenting an analysis of the experience of “fat” women of color within a feminist framework. Ignoring the variation of experiences strengthens the types of privileges that fat activism and feminism hope to dismantle.
Z00|Se Faire Voir with Jung and the Ethics of Psychoanalysis|This article is an important addition to my previous work of integrating Jungian and Lacanian psychoanalysis (see Complexes Tickling the $ubject). A main focus of this article is to use Zizek’s interpretation of Lacan’s writing on desire and drive in relation to my Heideggerian interpretation of Jung. As a result, this article is an important contribution to the literature because it shows the importance of the transcendent function; complexes and the Rosarium Philosophorum to elucidate the ethics of desire and drive. This article shows how Heidegger’s work in Being and Time and his interpretation of Nietzsche is important to detail the process of Lacanian psychoanalysis. Nietzsche’s books; Human All Too Human and The Gay Science will also be discussed as well as Sartre’s Being and Nothingness and Zizek’s writing on the cunning of reason; Kantian ethics; beyond the pleasure principle; Kierkegaard; Sisyphus; anxiety; Hitchcock; Gelassenheit ; the Gospel of Matthew and error as a fundamental passage to truth.
Z00|Muslim Woman Seeking Work: An English Case Study with a Dutch Comparison, of Discrimination and Achievement|The measurement of discrimination in employment is a key variable in understanding dynamics in the nature of, and change in “race relations”. Measuring such discrimination using ‘situation’ and ‘correspondence’ tests was influenced by John Rex’s sociological analyses, and earlier work, begun in America, was continued in England in the 1960s, and further replicated in Europe and America in later decades. This literature is reviewed, and the methodologies of testing for employment discrimination are discussed. Recent work in Britain and the Netherlands is considered in detail in the light of changing social structures, and the rise of Islamophobia. Manchester, apparently the city manifesting the most discrimination in Britain, is considered for a special case study, with a focus on one individual, a Muslim woman seeking intermediate level accountancy employment. Her vita was matched with that of a manifestly indigenous, white Briton. Submitted vitas (to 1043 potential employers) indicated significant discrimination against the Muslim woman candidate. Results are discussed within the context of Manchester’s micro-sociology, and Muslim women’s employment progress in broader contexts. We conclude with the critical realist comment that the “hidden racism” of employment discrimination shows that modern societies continue, in several ways, to be institutionally racist, and the failure to reward legitimate aspirations of minorities may have the effect of pushing some ethnic minorities into a permanent precariat, with implications for social justice and social control in ways which may deny minority efforts to “integrate” in society’s employment systems.
Z00|Receiving Assistance and Local Food System Participation|A body of literature has noted that local food systems (LFSs) may not involve active participation by individuals with lower incomes. This is, in part, a function of racial and class hegemony, as well as physical and financial accessibility of LFSs. LFS institutions, such as farmers’ markets, have been working to facilitate receipt of food assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Charitable assistance programs, such as food banks, have also been actively working to engage in LFSs, for example, by making local foods available. However, little research has explored the role that receiving public or charitable assistance can play in influencing LFS participation. In this article, I utilize quantitative and qualitative data collected from across the state of Ohio to examine the relationship between receiving assistance and LFS participation for women, who remain predominately responsible for food provisioning in the U.S., including among those who participate in LFSs. Quantitative results suggest that receiving assistance can increase participation in LFSs. Qualitative data provides more nuanced information about the importance of food assistance for women who want to participate in LFSs, and suggest that it is essential that food cooperatives and farmers’ markets are equipped to receive food assistance programs, such as SNAP, in order for women with lower incomes to participate in LFSs.
Z00|Perceptions of the Social Relevance of Science: Exploring the Implications for Gendered Patterns in Expectations of Majoring in STEM Fields|Despite efforts to increase participation in science, technology, engineering and math fields (STEM), the role of students’ perceptions of the social relevance of science in guiding their expectations to major in STEM remains largely unexplored. Though science education scholars predict that perceptions of social relevance likely matter equally for boys and girls, gender scholars suggest that these perceptions should matter more for girls than boys. Using longitudinal data from a large, urban, low-income, and predominantly minority-serving district, this study examines the potentially gendered role of perceptions of social relevance in ninth graders’ expectations to major in STEM. Further, it examines these dynamics with respect to expectations to major in any STEM field as well as expectations to major in specific STEM fields. Findings largely support the perspective of gender scholars; perceptions of the social relevance of science positively and significantly predict female, but not male, students’ intentions to major in STEM (vs. non-STEM fields). Subsequent analyses that look at intentions to major in specific STEM fields reveal a similar pattern, such that perceptions of relevance positively predict female students’ intentions to major in the biological sciences, the physical sciences, and engineering, while male students’ intentions are not similarly impacted. By contrast, positive perceptions of the relevance of science predict a modest increase in interest in computer science for both boys and girls.
Z00|Planning a Career in Engineering: Parental Effects on Sons and Daughters|This paper examines the extent to which prospective engineers follow in their parents’ footsteps. Specifically, we investigate the connection between fathers’ and mothers’ employment in the engineering profession and the career plans of sons and daughters. We develop a number of reasons to expect an occupation-specific intergenerational association in this field, as well as hypotheses regarding gender-specific role-modeling. Data are drawn from the UCLA HERI Freshman Survey data spanning 1971 to 2011. The results point to clear and substantial effects on sons and daughters’ plans to pursue engineering, connections that cannot be explained by typical pathways such as social background, education and values. The evidence points to a pattern of increasing salience of mothers with respect to the career plans of their children, especially their daughters. The implications of these findings for the under-representation of women in engineering and for gender-specific family dynamics are discussed in the conclusion.
Z00|Beyond Depression and Suicide: The Mental Health of Transgender College Students|Research studies examining the mental health of transgender individuals often focus on depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation through the use of clinic samples. However, little is known about the emerging adult (18–26 years old) transgender population and their mental health. The current study seeks to fill that gap by using a national dataset of college students (N = 547,727) to examine how transgender college students (n = 1143) differ from their cisgender peers regarding 12 different mental health conditions. Chi-square and regression analyses were conducted. Results demonstrate that transgender students have approximately twice the risk for most mental health conditions compared to cisgender female students. A notable exception is schizophrenia, in which transgender individuals have about seven times the risk compared to cisgender females. While these were significant findings, regression analyses indicate that being non-heterosexual is a greater predictor for mental health concerns. Implications for mental health practitioners at colleges and universities are discussed.
Z00|Democratic Institutions, Natural Resource Governance, and Ghana’s Oil Wealth|The literature on natural resources is endowed with works on countries that have experienced slow economic performance despite their abundant natural resources (resource curse), with the exception of Norway and other few countries. Strong institutions and good governance practices have been underscored as some of the explanatory factors to the high performance of the outlier countries. Ghana’s oil discovery in the era of its advancing democratic practices has led some to argue that the country might escape the resource curse phenomenon. While recognizing the importance of this argument, this article, however, argues that Ghana’s likelihood of escaping the resource curse could be problematic due to its exclusive emphasis on democratic governance without greater focus on oil sector governance. Drawing on the theory of agenda setting and the existing literature, the article makes the case for agenda shift in the debate on Ghana’s oil wealth and development. It stresses the need for a dualistic governance (the democratic and the oil sector) approach in the broader discourse on how Ghana can escape the resource curse.
Z00|Structural Disadvantage: Evidence of Gender Disparities in the Norwegian Pension System|Norway is a world leader in gender equality according to sustainable development performance indicators. This study goes beyond these indicators to investigate systemic economic disadvantages for women, focusing specifically on the Norwegian pension system. System dynamics modeling is used to understand how gender disparity is built into social systems. A significant contributor to the gender inequality in pensions is the difference in lifetime working hours due to childbearing/rearing. There are childcare policies in place to equalize lifetime working hours between the genders; however, these policies require women to conform to the pension system structure and outsource their childcare. The system dynamics modeling illustrates how social investment strategy requires women to conform to a masculine pension system if they want equivalent financial security when they reach retirement.

Z00|Gender Differences in the Early Employment Outcomes of STEM Doctorates|The representation of women among STEM doctorates has grown over the past decades but the underrepresentation of women in the STEM labor force persists. This paper examines the immediate post-degree employment outcomes of nine cohorts of STEM doctorates who attained their degrees between 1995 and 2013. The results reveal both progress toward gender equity and persistent inequities. Contrary to historical gender disparities, a small female advantage has emerged in the attainment of tenure-track faculty positions, women are increasingly less likely than men to enter postdoctoral positions, and the flow of STEM doctorates into business and industry, which was once male dominated, is now gender neutral. Among the doctorates who do not follow the doctorate-to-faculty career path, women are as likely as men to “stay in STEM,” but less likely to attain research-oriented jobs. Gender segregation in occupational attainment and significant gender gaps in earnings, however, continue to be defining characteristics of the STEM labor force. The results show that the labor market disparities vary across STEM fields but are largely not attributable to the gendered impact of parenthood and dual-career marriage.
Z00|Collaboration and Gender Equity among Academic Scientists|Universities were established as hierarchical bureaucracies that reward individual attainment in evaluating success. Yet collaboration is crucial both to 21st century science and, we argue, to advancing equity for women academic scientists. We draw from research on gender equity and on collaboration in higher education, and report on data collected on one campus. Sixteen focus group meetings were held with 85 faculty members from STEM departments, separated by faculty rank and gender (i.e., assistant professor men, full professor women). Participants were asked structured questions about the role of collaboration in research, career development, and departmental decision-making. Inductive analyses of focus group data led to the development of a theoretical model in which resources, recognition, and relationships create conditions under which collaboration is likely to produce more gender equitable outcomes for STEM faculty. Ensuring women faculty have equal access to resources is central to safeguarding their success; relationships, including mutual mentoring, inclusion and collegiality, facilitate women’s careers in academia; and recognition of collaborative work bolsters women’s professional advancement. We further propose that gender equity will be stronger in STEM where resources, relationships, and recognition intersect—having multiplicative rather than additive effects.
Z00|Black Twitter: A Response to Bias in Mainstream Media|This paper seeks to shed light on the ways people of color, in the United States, are using social media to challenge racial bias. As part of this investigation, this paper draws on Critical Race Theory, Feminist Theory, and Digital New Media studies to examine the extent to which social media, while seen as a place for ‘play’ can also operate as a digital homespace, a space used as a tool for black women and men to (re)construct their bodies and identities, challenging the “controlling images” widespread in mainstream media and society at large. This paper employs the methods of content analysis and participant observation and find that these social media forums are not transformative by themselves but instead have little moments that make for resistance and a digital homespace.
Z00|Dinner and a Conversation: Transgender Integration at West Point and Beyond|In 2016, the United States military lifted the ban on transgender members serving and are expected to begin accessions of transgender service members in 2017. A paucity of research exists on transgender matters in the military, especially on attitudes towards cisgender service members. This study deploys a qualitative methodology, comprised of 21 focus groups of undergraduate cadets and advanced schooled Army officers ( N = 110), at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, using a semi-structured interview protocol. Overall, a diversity of experiences and familiarity with transgender people surfaced among cadets and officers. We distinguish between experiences and familiarity on a spectrum by introducing notions of transgender tourism and cosmopolitanism. Major concerns associated with (un)comfortableness emerged from the focus groups including privacy, physical standards, well-being, and costs. Interventions are offered by the participants based on their major concerns. We recommend education, increased cosmopolitism, privacy considerations, narrowing the civil-military propinquity gap, and more studies of diversity and inclusion issues in the military.
Z00|Active Listening Attitude Scale (ALAS): Reliability and Validity in a Nationwide Sample of Greek Educators|The present study examined the Active Listening Attitude Scale (ALAS) validity and reliability in a sample of 3955 Greek educators. The sample was randomly split and an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted in the even subsample to evaluate the scale’s construct validity. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed in the odd subsample to confirm the three-factor model identified by the EFA. The chi square test (χ 2 ) of the model was significant ( p < 0.05), due to the large sample size. The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the comparative fit index (CFI) and the goodness of fit index (GFI) values were 0.079, 0.969 and 0.960, respectively, further supporting the fit of the three-factor model. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was used to test internal consistency reliability and was satisfactory exceeding 0.72 for ALAS subscales. The intercorrelations of the three subscales were all positive and significant ( p < 0.001), ranging from 0.20 to 0.42. Student’s t -tests and the computation of effect sizes revealed that women scored higher on Listening Skill and Conversation Opportunity, while principals and participants trained on mental health promotion scored higher on all three subscales. The analyses confirmed the three-factor model of ALAS and demonstrated its validity and reliability in measuring Greek teachers’ active listening attitudes.
Z00|Gender in Engineering Departments: Are There Gender Differences in Interruptions of Academic Job Talks?|We use a case study of job talks in five engineering departments to analyze the under-studied area of gendered barriers to finalists for faculty positions. We focus on one segment of the interview day of short-listed candidates invited to campus: the “job talk”, when candidates present their original research to the academic department. We analyze video recordings of 119 job talks across five engineering departments at two Research 1 universities. Specifically, we analyze whether there are differences by gender or by years of post-Ph.D. experience in the number of interruptions, follow-up questions, and total questions that job candidates receive. We find that, compared to men, women receive more follow-up questions and more total questions. Moreover, a higher proportion of women’s talk time is taken up by the audience asking questions. Further, the number of questions is correlated with the job candidate’s statements and actions that reveal he or she is rushing to present their slides and complete the talk. We argue that women candidates face more interruptions and often have less time to bring their talk to a compelling conclusion, which is connected to the phenomenon of “stricter standards” of competence demanded by evaluators of short-listed women applying for a masculine-typed job. We conclude with policy recommendations.
Z00|The Politics of Race, Administrative Appeals, and Medicaid Disenrollment in Tennessee|In 2004, Democratic Governor Philip Bredesen of Tennessee announced a plan to reform TennCare, the state’s Medicaid program. The reform package proposed to remove 323,000 adults from the program, which represented the most drastic cuts to Medicaid since its creation in 1965. The reform measure also allowed beneficiaries disenrolled from the program to appeal the decisions to the state Department of Human Services. This study examines how race and policy backlash—that is the backlash against Medicaid expansion—influenced the appellate process for beneficiaries removed from the program in Tennessee. The main argument is that race—especially the predisposition of African Americans—influenced the outcome of the appellate proceedings. The theoretical framework advanced in this study explains how procedural deliberations (legal decisions, policy disputes, administrative hearings) exacerbate disparities and produce differential outcomes that correspond with racial and other ascriptive hierarchies. The data for this research, comprising more than 60,000 former TennCare beneficiaries, were obtained through Open Records Requests in compliance with Tennessee state law. Using logistic regressions, the findings reveal a relationship between race and appellate proceedings. African Americans were treated unfairly in the early stage of the appellate process and those from racially polarized voting areas were less likely to receive fair rulings by hearing examiners. Additional findings identified age-related disparities between younger and older appellants, as well as a regional disadvantage between rural and urban beneficiaries.
Z00|Smallholder Farmers’ Perceptions on Climate Change and the Use of Sustainable Agricultural Practices in the Chinyanja Triangle, Southern Africa|In developing regions with high levels of poverty and a dependence on climate sensitive agriculture, studies focusing on climate change adaptation, planning, and policy processes, have gained relative importance over the years. This study assesses the impact of farmer perceptions regarding climate change on the use of sustainable agricultural practices as an adaptation strategy in the Chinyanja Triangle, Southern Africa. In this empirical approach, we adopt methods that account for the plausibility that unmeasured characteristics exist, which are correlated with perceptions and the adoption of Sustainable Agricultural Practices. We use a unique and representative dataset collected in December 2012 and June 2013, from smallholder farmers in the Chinyanja Triangle. The results indicate that farmer’s perceptions significantly influence the use of sustainable agricultural practices. Specifically, we established that farmer perceptions considerably impact the use of grain legume rotations, inorganic fertilizers, compost, and farmyard manure. Our results highlight the need for a serious and perhaps equal consideration of farmer perceptions regarding climate change, as important inputs to climate change adaptation policies targeted at enhancing climatic resilience in smallholder farming communities. This is plausible as the adaptation and pliability of farmers to the effects of climate change should be a social process involving the collective efforts from various stakeholders.
Z00|At the Interface of National and Transnational: The Development of Finnish Policies against Domestic Violence in Terms of Gender Equality|Although gender inequalities are the main social mechanisms behind the (re)production of domestic violence, policy responses to domestic violence as a gender-related problem vary at both the national and transnational levels. This article examines the interaction between national and transnational policies against domestic violence, focusing on how domestic violence is constructed as a gender-related problem in Finland, a Nordic welfare state that is often cited as a role model in gender equality. Using the conception of policies as historically changing and culturally specific discourses, this article offers an overview of the ways in which the perspective on domestic violence of the transnational feminist movement has been engaged and transformed in the Finnish context over the five last decades. It is shown that transnational pressure has played a critical role in pushing Finland towards a stronger recognition of domestic violence as a gender issue. However, this transformation has taken place rather within the framework of more neutral “women-friendly” welfare policies than within a feminist framework. The article concludes that the Finnish way of translating transnational norms to the national level is characterized by a tendency to modify the transformative meanings underpinning the transnational feminist discourses to a more gender-neutral form.
Z00|Left Numb and Unengaged. (Re)Conceptualising Risk: What (Seems to) Work for at-Risk Students|This review of current research into ‘at-risk’ programs serves to categorise and characterise existing programs and to evaluate the contribution of these programs to assisting students ‘at-risk’ from marginalised backgrounds. This characterisation questions the (sometimes) implicit assumptions and the consequences of those assumptions inherent in and behind these various accounts. Using as a lens the (various and varied) understandings of social justice and the goals of education, three sometimes overlapping and sometimes contesting standpoints are identified in relation to ‘at-risk’ students; they are characterised as instrumentalist or rational technical, social constructivist or individualist, and critical transformative or empowering. I argue that a critical transformative understanding of ‘at-risk’ may deliver improved outcomes for young people by challenging ‘the school context in which the young people are located’.
Z00|Policy Discourses and Marginal Places: Histories of Environmental Democracy in India and Sweden|Past decades have been marked with grassroots struggles around the use and access to natural resources such as forests, both in the global South and in the global North. On the one hand, we have politicians, bureaucrats and others needing to deal with these issues at the national and global level. On the other, we have the material practices and struggles at the local level as well as a parallel discourse on decentralization to local areas from the past few decades. By tracing the historical changes in policies that touch on forests-peoples relationships in India and Sweden, I contextualize these trends by placing them in a historical context and examine the questions that are central to a critical examination for environmental governance today. I analyze how environmental policy-making shaped forest politics in the two places and what spaces it provided for environmental democracy—especially in relation to possibilities for people’s participation and for gender equality. I bring attention to the imperative to take account of questions of increasing expert dominance in environmental governance and local struggles, the space for local people’s participation in forest and rural politics, the gendering of these spaces and relationships and how that affects environmental politics.
Z00|Forests and Food Security: What’s Gender Got to Do with It?|Hunger remains a key development problem in the 21st century. Within this context, there is renewed attention to the importance of forests and their role in supplementing the food and nutrition needs of rural populations. With a concurrent uptake of “gender mainstreaming” for sustainable development, there is also a call for understanding the gendered dynamics of forest governance and food security. In this paper, we reviewed emerging research (2009–2014) on forests and food security and on the ways gender is said to matter. As with previous work on gender and natural resource management, we found that gender is an important variable; but how, to what degree and why are different in every context. That is, despite the suggestion of clear linkages, the relationships between gender, forests and food security are not generalizable across contexts. Understanding the relationship between forest resources and food security requires attention to gender disparities at the local level, but also to the broader political and economic context in which those disparities are reinforced. We flag the need to guard against ahistorical and technical approaches to gender and suggest some example research questions that use a more relational view of gender—one that examines how political economy and social power structure access to resources at multiple scales.
Z00|Land Access, Agricultural Land Use Changes and Narratives about Land Degradation in the Savannahs of Northeast Ghana during the Pre-Colonial and Colonial Periods|This paper discusses the evolution of socio-cultural and political relations that defined access to, use, and management of land resources in northeast Ghana during the pre-colonial and colonial periods. The aim is to historicise current meta-narratives about degradation of the natural landscape in the rural savannahs of northeast Ghana. Many of those degradation narratives take their root in the past during the colonial era, but the conceptual underpinnings of those narratives have remained essentially a-historical, a-political, and a-cultural. This paper shows that the organisation of space and land uses in pre-colonial communities in northeast Ghana was governed by certain traditional knowledge systems which were ignored by the colonial authorities. While narratives about landscape degradation by natives were propagated by the colonial government to justify a need to preserve the environment, their attempts to control land management matters were essentially for political and economic reasons. The study concludes that current policy frameworks on desertification and land management need to move beyond inherent historical biases. Rather, attention ought to be given to critical historical reflections on the dynamic processes by which variations in socio-economic relations of resource access/use, farming practices, land tenure arrangements, and political agendas interact with changes in the biophysical environment to produce different land cover trajectories over time.
Z00|Malthus and the Philanthropists, 1764–1859: The Cultural Circulation of Political Economy, Botany, and Natural Knowledge|Modernity does not possess a monopoly on mass incarceration, population fears, forced migration, famine, or climatic change. Indeed, contemporary and early modern concerns over these matters have extended interests in Thomas Malthus. Yet, despite extensive research on population issues, little work explicates the genesis of population knowledge production or how the process of intellectual transfer occurred during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. This paper examines the Delessert network’s instrumental role in cultivating, curating, and circulating knowledge that popularized Malthusian population theory, including the theory’s constitutive elements of political economy, philanthropy, industry, agriculture, and botany. I show how deviant, nonconformist groups suffered forced migration for their political philosophy, particularly during the revolutionary 1790s, resulting in their imprisonment and migration to America. A consequence of these social shifts was the diffusion and dissemination of population theory—as a pursuit of scientific knowledge and exploration—across both sides of the Atlantic. By focusing on the Delesserts and their social network, I find that a byproduct of inter and intra continental migration among European elites was a knowledge exchange that stimulated Malthus’s thesis on population and Genevan Augustin Pyramus Candolle’s research on botany, ultimately culminating in Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection and human evolution.
Z00|The Influence of Religiosity on Moral Judgment in Sport|The creation of a much clearer view on religiosity-morality relations was the basic goal of the present study. Another goal was to examine the impact of factors (gender, type of sports) that possibly effect the formation of moral content judgment and parts of religiosity within a sport environment. The participants were 258 athletes of the Christian Orthodox faith (180 males and 78 females). All participants were involved in the fourteen sports. They filled out the Moral Content Judgment in Sport Questionnaire (MCJSQ), the Santa Clara Strength of Religious Faith Questionnaire (SCSRFQ), and the Religious Schema Scale (RSS). Results showed an effect of gender and type of sports on moral judgment and religiosity, respectively. Results also revealed the predicting ability of religiosity on moral judgment with religious schemas presenting more intense participation than that of religious faith.

Z00|Prisons as Panacea or Pariah? The Countervailing Consequences of the Prison Boom on the Political Economy of Rural Towns|The nascent literature on prison proliferation in the United States typically reveals negative impacts for communities of color. Given that Southern rural communities were the most likely to build during the prison boom (1970–2010), however, a more nuanced understanding of prison impact is warranted. Using a dataset matching and geocoding all 1663 U.S. prisons with their Census-appointed place, this study explores the countervailing consequences of the prison boom on rural towns across multiple periods. For example, locales that adopted prisons at earlier stages of the prison boom era received a short-term boom compared to those that did not, but these effects were not lasting. Furthermore, later in the boom, prison-building protected towns against additional economic decline. Thus, neither entirely pariah nor panacea, the prison functions as a state-sponsored public works program for disadvantaged rural communities but also supports perverse economic incentives for prison proliferation. Methodological, substantive, theoretical, and policy implications regarding the intersection of race and punishment are explored.
Z00|Transnationalism and Financial Crisis: The Hampered Migration Projects of Female Domestic Workers in Spain|The importance of transnational migration projects for international development has been increasingly recognized over the past decades. Migrants who move from the Global South or East to work in low-wage sectors such as construction, agriculture or domestic services in wealthier countries may contribute both to growth in the receiving countries and socio-economic development in their countries of origin. Parallel to scholarship on migration and development, research on the transnationalization of domestic work generally assumes that growing care needs and increasing demand for private household services in Western societies imply a continuing demand for migrant labour. However, since the global financial crisis broke out in 2008, unemployment among migrant workers has increased dramatically in many immigrant-receiving countries, Spain being among the most severely affected. Job destruction has so far been lower in the domestic sector than in other sectors occupying large numbers of migrant workers. Yet, we find that migrant domestic workers in Spain are affected by the recession both in terms of unemployment or underemployment and deteriorating job conditions, with transnational consequences such as loss of remittances. Many migrants find themselves in a situation of “standby,” trying to subsist while waiting for the recession to end.
Z00|Marriage Formation in Context: Four Decades in Comparative Perspective|Marriage formation is deeply embedded in societal context. This study documents trends towards lower marriage rates and delayed marriage in Europe and the US. Using time series analyses, it shows the relevance of economic and gender context in understanding marriage formation. The study extends previous work by including more countries, a longer time period, and by examining changes in predictors of marriage patterns over time. Analyses show that the association between economic context and marriage rates weakens over time, but the role of gender equality and policy context remain stable. Differences in age at first marriage across policy clusters are diminishing. Although greater gender equality is consistently linked to later marriage entry, the link between economic context and age at first marriage is changing. Changes in predictors of cross-national marriage patterns over time strongly suggest the institution of marriage itself is changing.
Z00|Reimagining the Hajj|Throughout the Middle East and the Islamic world, political and religious leaders are being pulled into sharpening debates over rival approaches to reforming the Hajj. For at least two decades, Hajj controversies have deepened with rising death tolls among the pilgrims and with soaring complaints about corruption and incompetence against pilgrimage managers in Saudi Arabia and dozens of other countries. Demands for Hajj reform are reaching new peaks after Saudi officials recently revealed stunning details of the scope and magnitude of pilgrim fatalities during the last 14 years. The Saudi data leave little doubt that the quality of care for Hajjis varies enormously depending on several key factors which policy makers and religious leaders must address with greater honesty and determination. Year in and year out, the most vulnerable pilgrim populations are poor people, women, and children from across Africa and Asia as well as foreign workers, refugees, and illegal migrants living in Saudi Arabia. Most of the current proposals for Hajj reform ignore these high-risk groups. Saudi planners focus on promoting year-round pilgrimage to boost tourism revenues and high-end infrastructure. In most other countries, government-run Hajj agencies are busy cutting market-sharing deals with private business cartels and their political patrons. The combined effect of these policies is to weaken what remains of already inadequate regulations that are vital to the protection of all Hajjis. Meanwhile, support is also growing for more sweeping proposals to reimagine and reinvent the Hajj instead of fine-tuning the status quo. Some of these reforms are particularly likely to test the ingenuity and influence of leaders from all backgrounds because they challenge longstanding custom. A few of the most unconventional suggestions include lengthening the Hajj season to several months as well as linking the Hajj to pilgrimages and festivals of other world religions throughout the year.
Z00|Enhancing Intersectional Analyses with Polyvocality: Making and Illustrating the Model|Since the inception of the intersectionality framework by feminists over three decades ago, scholars have advanced the analysis and subsequent understanding of peoples’ social locations, identity constructions, and systems of oppression involving gender, ethnicity, religion, class, and caste, to name a few. Considering these axes of differentiation as mutually constitutive rather than only as individual factors has been the single most important innovation. However, intersectionality has yet to reach its potential theoretically, methodologically, and practically. For instance, the framework is rarely applied to social phenomena that extend beyond the confines of a given nation-state. In previous publications, we have addressed this shortcoming by arguing for applying intersectionality across multiple social scales (intimate, regional, national, and transnational). We have shown how any given person’s intersectionality can and often does shift according to the scale of analysis. In this article, we address another important way to strengthen intersectionality—bringing in polyvocality. That is, and drawing upon arguments originally made in postmodern critiques of “writing culture”, publications tend to reflect partial and/or limited perspectives, typically those reflecting researchers’ privileged, authoritative accounts. In this article, in contrast, we include different insider (ego) and outsider (ego’s relatives’ and the researchers’) perspectives. The article includes the theoretical and methodological argument for adding polyvocality to intersectionality and then applies the proposed model to an ethnographic case. We illustrate how intersectional constellations shift from voiced interpretation to voiced interpretation and, in so doing, deepen, expand, and problematize these same analyses.
Z00|Frozen in Time: How Disney Gender-Stereotypes Its Most Powerful Princess|Disney’s animated feature Frozen (2013) received acclaim for presenting a powerful heroine, Elsa, who is independent of men. Elsa’s avoidance of male suitors, however, could be a result of her protective father’s admonition not to “let them in” in order for her to be a “good girl.” In addition, Elsa’s power threatens emasculation of any potential suitor suggesting that power and romance are mutually exclusive. While some might consider a princess’s focus on power to be refreshing, it is significant that the audience does not see a woman attaining a balance between exercising authority and a relationship. Instead, power is a substitute for romance. Furthermore, despite Elsa’s seemingly triumphant liberation celebrated in Let It Go, selfless love rather than independence is the key to others’ approval of her as queen. Regardless of the need for novel female characters, Elsa is just a variation on the archetypal power-hungry female villain whose lust for power replaces lust for any person, and who threatens the patriarchal status quo. The only twist is that she finds redemption through gender-stereotypical compassion.
Z00|Measuring the Unmeasured: Cultural Heritage Studies in Honor of Prof. Francesco Forte|Abstract This paper presents the contributions of Francesco Forte to the measurement of art and cultural goods and services, as I worked with him as his co-author. These contributions range from the valuation of art goods by the art matrix we conceived, to the valuation of the cultural welfare of nations, regions and local communities. Our work also assessed the provision of cultural welfare at the national, regional and local level for the public and non-profit sectors and measured the efficiency and effectiveness of museum bureaucracies. We also studied the profitability of investments in the arts by considering product life cycles, artistic movements and economies. More recently, with Michele Caputo, we focused on the long-run life cycle and success of the movie industry for select countries competing with foreign movie industries and TV entertainment by adopting Caputo’s fractional derivatives theory, which captures the role of past history. Professor Forte and I also developed the Differential Touristic Development Index to measure the effects of art and cultural enterprises as tourist attractions. The most innovative contributions of Francesco Forte to the measurement of the economic value of cultural goods and services demonstrate that it is possible to “measure the unmeasured,” and therein improve public collection of statistical data with the goal of increasing the preservation and valuation of cultural goods and services and highlighting their potential as economic multipliers.
Z00|Electricity consumption and Economic growth: A panel data approach to Brics countries|This paper serves to investigate the causal relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth in the Brics countries during the period 1990 – 2014. Carbon dioxide emissions and urbanisation were included as additional variables to form a multivariate framework. The Kao panel co-integration and Johansen Fisher panel co-integration techniques are applied to analyse the co-integration relationship between the variables while the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) Granger-causality test is used to estimate the causality relationship among the variables. The study’s results reveal that there is a long run relationship between the variables. The research outcome further detected a unidirectional causality flowing from economic growth to electricity consumption in the long run in Brics countries. So in the light of determination of the study, the policy implication is that a significant transformation of low carbon technologies such as renewable energy should be implemented to curb the emissions and sustain economic growth and development.
Z00|Strengthening the Management of Ubiquitous Internet by Refining ISO/IEC 27001 Implementation Using a Generic Responsibility Model|The recent emergence of decentralized networks and ubiquitous Internet has highlighted the need for a better management of the companies’ IT architecture and for an improvement of the users of the network’s responsibility. Many standards have recently emerged to face these requirements. By analyzing them, we observe that they all include reference to the user responsibility but also that no common understanding of it exists. These statements have oriented our research toward the elaboration of an innovative, simple and pragmatic responsibility model that includes a user commitment dimension. ISO/IEC 27001:2005 is one of that new standard that aims at providing a framework for improving the information system management and the security of IT architecture. Although this standard is recognized over the globe, many surveys and cases studies provide interesting feedback about its implementation problems. In this paper, we introduce our responsibility model, we depict the responsibility aspects encompassed in ISO 27001 and we propose some improvement perspectives to face these problems and strengthen its implementation.
Z00|The Relationship of Financial Risks Towards the Performance of Vivocom Intl Holdings Berhad|The purpose of this study is to examine the overall performance of Vivocom Intl Holdings Berhad with specific risk and corporate governance variables on profitability performance. The data obtained from annual report of Vivocom Intl Holdings Berhad starting from 2011-2015. The measurement of liquidity ratio and operating ratio used to see the overall performance of Vivocom Intl Holdings Berhad in 5 years which allegedly beyond benchmark. To see the relationship of risks factors to the profitability, this paper is utilizing liquidity (current ratio), operating ratio, corporate governance (index and BOD’s remuneration). Data was analysed by utilizing regression and bivariate correlation. The regression analysis and bivariate correlation shows that index, BOD’s remuneration, current ratio, liquidity ratio, operating ratio, and size have a significant relationship on profitability. However, the leverage, exchange rate, inflation rate, GDP and unemployment rate is not significant to profitability with low impact to the profitability.

Z00|Utopian Left-Wing Expectations and the Social Consequences of the 3rd Memorandum in Greece|In January 2015 the radical left SYRIZA has won the Greek national elections and formed a coalition government with Independent Greeks (ANEL), a right-wing populist party. After a seven-month negotiation with Greece’s creditors and the agreement for the implementation of a third memorandum of fiscal adjustment, SYRIZA announced the conduction of a second round of national elections in September 2015. After a second electoral victory, SYRIZA formed again a coalition government with ANEL. The main characteristic of SYRIZA’s pre-electoral campaign was that it has primarily focused on the commitment for austerity measures termination and on the implementation of tax alleviation. Even during the second electoral campaign in September 2015, after the agreement for the implementation of the third memorandum of fiscal adjustment, SYRIZA was promising that its implementation will be socially endued in order to reduce negative social consequences, such as those created by the previous memoranda. Practically though, after the first months of the new memorandum implementation, it is obvious that the government has introduced an unprecedented tax policy. Interestingly, this policy is not different from a traditional left logic of tax enforcement but actually leads to the implementation of horizontal austerity policies which firstly affect the socially vulnerable groups. From this point of view, while SYRIZA emphatically declare that it aims at resolving the crisis, its policies seem to deepen the depression. For instance, its inability to find alternative options to finance the social security system, leads to the implementation of restrictive policies which dismantle the welfare state. This paper aims at analyzing the policies of the first left government in Greece by focusing on the tentative social consequences of the third memorandum and at the same time, studying some of the basic factors for its electoral victory, such as populism.
Z00|Global Perspective of CPEC Regarding Economic Integration and Trade Openness|There is a misconception about CPEC that this mega project is only going to benefit China and Pakistan. However, this corridor is going to restructure and transform not only South and Central Asia, but also Middle East and Europe. Unlike EU, this project is planned to link different regions for economic integration and trade. This study is to analyse the importance of CPEC for its participants and its role in enhancing the economic integration and trade openness among Asian, European and African states. Not only this, challenges and opportunities associated with this project are also been discussed in this paper.
Z00|Simulating the Mutual Sequential Mate Search Model under Non-homogenous Preferences|This paper extends the Todd and Miller's (1999) mutual sequential mate search model with homogenous preferences to the case of non-homogenous preferences. Our simulations show that the size of heterogeneity in the preferences affects the performance rankings -as well as the absolute success levels- of the mate search heuristics in the model with respect to both mating likelihood and mating stability.
Z00|An Elo ranking for economics journals|Rankings for sports such as chess or table tennis are based on the so called Elo rating system. In this paper, we apply this rating system to rank economics journals. One main advantage of the Elo ranking compared to existing ones is its explicit consideration of a journal's performance path. Another advantage is the easy application of the system to any journal metric that is published on a regular basis. Our application is based on data from Web of Science that comprises the impact factors of 382 economics journals for the period from 1997 to 2016. The most recent Elo ranking is quite different for rather 'middle-class' journals compared to other existing rankings. However, also some differences for the top 30 emerge.

Z00|Will social media strengthen or threaten romantic love?|The ways we represent our relationships, notice our partners, and let the social media interfere in our romantic relationships have aroused researchers’ interest. In this research, the purpose was to analyze, how people who use social media actively perceive the connection between social media and romantic relationships. The research questions set for this study were: (1) What are the rules of self-disclosure that support romantic relationships in social media?; (2) What kinds of benefits do social media provide for romantic relationships?; and (3) What kinds of threats or disadvantages do social media provide for romantic relationships? This was a qualitative research in which the research participants (N=25) were approached with an online questionnaire that included open-ended questions. The answers were analyzed with the qualitative content analyzing method. The findings showed that the research participants could name some principles of self-disclosure regarding their romantic relationships in social media and certain benefits as well as harms and threats of social media for a romantic relationship. The findings were further discussed in the light of the elements of love as emotions, love as actions, and love as skills and knowledge that here could be interpreted as “the media literacy of romantic relationships”.
Z00|On the Investigation of Factors Effecting International Tourist Arrivals to Cambodian Market: A Static and Dynamic Gravity Approach|The paper investigates factors influencing international tourist arrivals into the Cambodian market during the period of 1995 to 2015, covered 32 cross-sectional countries by adopting a static and dynamic gravity approach with respect to fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) and the GMM estimator of Arellano and Bond (1991). Our analysis shows that mostly economic factors such as travel cost, GDP per capita and population size are the main sources in attracting international tourist arrivals. The country specific dummy variables are found to be associated with the respects to its significant level. The empirical results demonstrate that one and two step GMM with robust standard errors produces better outcomes and improves the estimated accuracy over a static approach.
Z00|Impact of Microcredit Scheme on the Development of Entrepreneurship Skills among Low Income Households in a Developing Country Context|This study seeks to investigate the extent to which microcredit scheme can predict the development of entrepreneurship skills, particularly on entrepreneurial acumen, competitive of business, advantages of small business and business survival. This quantitative study is based on survey data from 1176 microcredit scheme participants. The data shows that participant involvement in microcredit scheme has a positive relationship with the development of entrepreneurial skills. The study provides insight into how theories from microcredit scheme may help us to understand the nature of entrepreneurial development, particularly among low income households. This article has focused only on the borrowers from microcredit scheme known as Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia and TEKUN. Hence, future research is recommended to include leadership style and expand the sample of the research to the elite group consisting of chairman/CEO of these two institutions. Emergent results make a contribution to research regarding how microcredit scheme can lead to the development of entrepreneurial skills in the context of developing countries. The findings demonstrate that to sustain in small medium scale business are require essential entrepreneurship skills such as competitive advantage, business survival to try varies type of business before they can be succeeding.
Z00|Expert System for Bomb Factory Detection by Networks of Advance Sensors|(1) Background: Police forces and security administrations are nowadays considering Improvised explosives (IEs) as a major threat. The chemical substances used to prepare IEs are called precursors, and their presence could allow police forces to locate a bomb factory where the on-going manufacturing of IEs is carried out. (2) Methods: An expert system was developed and tested in handling signals from a network of sensors, allowing an early warning. The expert system allows the detection of one precursor based on the signal provided by a single sensor, the detection of one precursor based on the signal provided by more than one sensor, and the production of a global alarm level based on data fusion from all the sensors of the network. (3) Results: The expert system was tested in the Italian Air Force base of Pratica di Mare (Italy) and in the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) in Grindsjön (Sweden). (4) Conclusion: The performance of the expert system was successfully evaluated under relevant environmental conditions. The approach used in the development of the expert system allows maximum flexibility in terms of integration of the response provided by any sensor, allowing to easily include in the network all possible new sensors.
Z00|Electrochemical Sensor for Explosives Precursors’ Detection in Water|Although all countries are intensifying their efforts against terrorism and increasing their mutual cooperation, terrorist bombing is still one of the greatest threats to society. The discovery of hidden bomb factories is of primary importance in the prevention of terrorism activities. Criminals preparing improvised explosives (IE) use chemical substances called precursors. These compounds are released in the air and in the waste water during IE production. Tracking sources of precursors by analyzing air or wastewater can then be an important clue for bomb factories’ localization. We are reporting here a new multiplex electrochemical sensor dedicated to the on-site simultaneous detection of three explosive precursors, potentially used for improvised explosive device preparation (hereafter referenced as B01, B08, and B15, for security disclosure reasons and to avoid being detrimental to the security of the counter-explosive EU action). The electrochemical sensors were designed to be disposable and to combine ease of use and portability in a screen-printed eight-electrochemical cell array format. The working electrodes were modified with different electrodeposited metals: gold, palladium, and platinum. These different coatings giving selectivity to the multi-sensor through a “fingerprint”-like signal subsequently analyzed using partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Results are given regarding the detection of the three compounds in a real environment and in the presence of potentially interfering species.
Z00|About the Purification Route of Ionic Liquid Precursors|In this work a purification route of precursors for ionic liquids tailored to electrochemical energy storage systems is reported and described. The study was carried out on the N -butyl- N -methylpyrrolidinium bromide (PYR 14 Br) precursor, which represents the intermediate product of the synthesis process of the N -butyl- N -methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PYR 14 TFSI) hydrophobic ionic liquid. The target is to develop an easy and cost-effective approach for efficiently purifying several kinds of ionic liquid precursors and determining their purity content. The PYR 14 Br precursor was synthesized through an eco-friendly preparation procedure, which requires water as the only processing solvent, and purified through sorbent materials, such as activated charcoal and alumina. The effect of the treatment/nature/content of sorbents and processing temperature/time was investigated. The impurity content was detected by UV-VIS spectrophotometry measurements. Additionally, a correlation between the measured absorbance and the content of impurities within the precursor was obtained. The purity level of the precursor was seen to play a key role in the electrochemical performance of the ionic liquids.

Z00|Ice XVII as a Novel Material for Hydrogen Storage|Hydrogen storage is one of the most addressed issues in the green-economy field. The latest-discovered form of ice (XVII), obtained by application of an annealing treatment to a H 2 -filled ice sample in the C 0 -phase, could be inserted in the energy-storage context due to its surprising capacity of hydrogen physisorption, when exposed to even modest pressure (few mbars at temperature below 40 K), and desorption, when a thermal treatment is applied. In this work, we investigate quantitatively the adsorption properties of this simple material by means of spectroscopic and volumetric data, deriving its gravimetric and volumetric capacities as a function of the thermodynamic parameters, and calculating the usable capacity in isothermal conditions. The comparison of ice XVII with materials with a similar mechanism of hydrogen adsorption like metal-organic frameworks shows interesting performances of ice XVII in terms of hydrogen content, operating temperature and kinetics of adsorption-desorption. Any application of this material to realistic hydrogen tanks should take into account the thermodynamic limit of metastability of ice XVII, i.e., temperatures below about 130 K.
Z00|New Studies of the Physical Properties of Metallic Amorphous Membranes for Hydrogen Purification|Amorphous metallic membranes display promising properties for hydrogen purification up to an ultrapure grade (purity > 99.999%). The hydrogen permeability through amorphous membranes has been widely studied in the literature. In this work we focus on two additional properties, which should be considered before possible application of such materials: the propensity to crystallize at high temperatures should be avoided, as the crystallized membranes can become brittle; the hydrogen solubility should be high, as solubility and permeability are proportional. We investigate the crystallization process and the hydrogen solubility of some membranes based on Ni, Nb, and Zr metals, as a function of Zr content, and with the addition of Ta or B. The boron doping does not significantly affect the crystallization temperature and the thermal stability of the membrane. However, the hydrogen solubility for p ~7 bar is as high as H/M ~0.31 at T = 440 °C and H/M ~0.27 at T = 485 °C. Moreover, the membrane does not pulverize even after repeated thermal cycles and hydrogenation processes up to 485 °C and 7 bar, and it retains its initial shape.
Z00|Ionic Mobility and Phase Transitions in Perovskite Oxides for Energy Application|Perovskite oxides ﬁnd applications or are studied in many ﬁelds related to energy production, accumulation and saving. The most obvious application is oxygen or proton conductors in fuel cells (SOFCs), but the (anti)ferroelectric compositions may ﬁnd application in high energy capacitors for energy storage, efﬁcient electrocaloric cooling, and electromechanical energy harvesting. In SOFCs, the diffusion of O vacancies and other mobile ionic species, such as H+, are at the base of the functioning of the device, while in the other cases they constitute unwanted defects that reduce the performance and life-time of the device. Similarly, the (anti)ferroelectric phase transitions are a requisite for the use of some types of devices, but the accompanying domain walls can generate extended defects detrimental to the life of the material, and structural phase transformations should be avoided in SOFCs. All these phenomena can be studied by mechanical spectroscopy, the measurement of the complex elastic compliance as a function of temperature and frequency, which is the mechanical analogue of the dielectric susceptibility, but probes the elastic response and elastic dipoles instead of the dielectric response and electric dipoles. The two techniques can be combined to provide a comprehensive picture of the material properties. Examples are shown of the study of structural transitions and hopping and tunnelling processes of O vacancies and H in the ion conductor BaCe1-xYxO3-x and in SrTiO3-x, and of the aging and fatigue effects found in PZT at compositions where the ferro- and antiferroelectric states coexist.
Z00|Tie-Up Cycles in Long-Term Mating. Part II: Fictional Narratives and the Social Cognition of Mating|In the first part of this paper, we have introduced a novel theoretical approach to mating dynamics, known as Tie-Up Theory (TU). In this second part, in the context of the bio-cultural approach to literature, that assigns to fictional narratives an important valence of social cognition, we apply the conceptual tools presented in the first part to the analysis of mating-related interaction dynamics in some blockbuster Hollywood movies from WWII to today. The interaction dynamics envisioned by our theory accurately reflect, to a significant level of detail, the narrative development of the movies under exam from the viewpoint of the mating dynamics of the couple of main characters, accounting for the specific reasons that lead them to react to certain situations via certain behaviors, and for the reasons why such behaviors lead to certain outcomes. Our analysis seems thus to bring some further legitimacy to the bio-cultural foundation of the narrative structure of the movies that we analyze, and moreover to the idea that it is possible to ‘inquire’ characters about their choices according to the narratological-experimental lines suggested by some proponents of the bio-cultural approach.
Z00|A Study of the Conformers of the (Nonafluorobutanesulfonyl)imide Ion by Means of Infrared Spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations|Pyrrolidinium-based ionic liquids with anions of the per(fluoroalkylsulfonyl)imide family are particularly interesting for their use as electrolytes in lithium batteries. These ions have several geometric isomers and the presence of different ion conformers and their distribution affects the ILs (Ionic liquids) physical and chemical properties. In the present work, we report the temperature dependence of the infrared spectra of the N -butyl- N -methyl-pyrrolidinium(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)(nonafluorobutanesulfonyl)imide (PYR 14 ‑ IM 14 ) ionic liquid; DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations performed with different models provides indications about the IM 14 conformers and their vibrational spectra. Moreover the temperature dependence of the intensity of the lines identified as markers of different conformers provide indications about the conformers’ distribution and the difference of their enthalpy in the liquid phase.
Z00|Hydrides as High Capacity Anodes in Lithium Cells: An Italian “Futuro in Ricerca di Base FIRB-2010” Project|Automotive and stationary energy storage are among the most recently-proposed and still unfulfilled applications for lithium ion devices. Higher energy, power and superior safety standards, well beyond the present state of the art, are actually required to extend the Li-ion battery market to these challenging fields, but such a goal can only be achieved by the development of new materials with improved performances. Focusing on the negative electrode materials, alloying and conversion chemistries have been widely explored in the last decade to circumvent the main weakness of the intercalation processes: the limitation in capacity to one or at most two lithium atoms per host formula unit. Among all of the many proposed conversion chemistries, hydrides have been proposed and investigated since 2008. In lithium cells, these materials undergo a conversion reaction that gives metallic nanoparticles surrounded by an amorphous matrix of LiH. Among all of the reported conversion materials, hydrides have outstanding theoretical properties and have been only marginally explored, thus making this class of materials an interesting playground for both fundamental and applied research. In this review, we illustrate the most relevant results achieved in the frame of the Italian National Research Project FIRB 2010 Futuro in Ricerca “Hydrides as high capacity anodes in lithium cells” and possible future perspectives of research for this class of materials in electrochemical energy storage devices.
Z00|Case Studies of Energy Storage with Fuel Cells and Batteries for Stationary and Mobile Applications|In this paper, hydrogen coupled with fuel cells and lithium-ion batteries are considered as alternative energy storage methods. Their application on a stationary system (i.e., energy storage for a family house) and a mobile system (i.e., an unmanned aerial vehicle) will be investigated. The stationary systems, designed for off-grid applications, were sized for photovoltaic energy production in the area of Turin, Italy, to provide daily energy of 10.25 kWh. The mobile systems, to be used for high crane inspection, were sized to have a flying range of 120 min, one being equipped with a Li-ion battery and the other with a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell. The systems were compared from an economical point of view and a life cycle assessment was performed to identify the main contributors to the environmental impact. From a commercial point of view, the fuel cell and the electrolyzer, being niche products, result in being more expensive with respect to the Li-ion batteries. On the other hand, the life cycle assessment (LCA) results show the lower burdens of both technologies.
Z00|Creativity through personal and team conduct|"There are two sets of factors for creativity - basic and extra. The specifics of creativity is explained, formulating its characteristics. The structural distinctions between creativity and ingenuity are presented by means of schemes. The analysis of the link ""creativity - values"" focuses on four groups of values: intellectual,moral, emotional and aesthetic. The teamwork creativity phenomenon is investigated, focusing on step-by-step achievement. Methods are proposed to maintain a good level of motivation for sharing the ideas of the team members."
Z00|The Influence of Ancestral Lifeways on Individual Economic Outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa|Does a person's historical lineage influence his or her current economic status? Motivated by a large literature in social sciences stressing the effect of an early transition to agriculture on current economic performance at the level of countries, we examine the relative contemporary status of individuals as a function of how much their ancestors relied on agriculture during the pre-industrial era. We focus on Africa, where by combining anthropological records of groups with individual-level survey data we can explore the effect of the historical lifeways of one's forefathers. Within enumeration areas and occupational groups, we find that individuals from ethnicities that derived a larger share of subsistence from agriculture in the pre-colonial era are today more educated and wealthy. A tentative exploration of channels suggests that differences in attitudes and beliefs as well as differential treatment by others, including differential political power, may contribute to these divergent outcomes.
Z00|Teoretické Východiská Skúmania Problematiky Hybridnej Vojny – Vojny 21. Storočia (Theoretical Background For The Research Of Problems Of The Hybrid War – The War Of The 21. Century)|Hybridná vojna predstavuje v posledných rokoch jeden z najpoužívanejších pojmov vo sfére vojenstva a bezpečnosti, a čiastočne aj politiky a medzinárodných vzťahov, zvlášť po vypuknutí konfliktu na Ukrajine. Čoraz častejšie sa objavuje nielen vo vedeckých alebo odborných publikáciách, štúdiách či článkoch z oblasti vojenstva a bezpečnosti, ale tiež v rôznych časopisoch, správach a debatách mimo vojenskú a bezpečnostnú komunitu. Mohlo by sa zdať, že ide o nový termín alebo dokonca nový typ konfliktu, ale nie je to tak. Hybridná vojna nie je žiadny nový fenomén, je známa už veľa rokov, avšak po ruskej anexii Krymu je tento pojem oveľa populárnejší a častejšie používaný. Na druhej strane, väčšia časť širšej verejnosti nevie, čo tento termín naozaj znamená, čo hybridná vojna predstavuje, a preto sa autor vo svojom príspevku zaoberá teoretickými východiskami skúmania problematiky hybridnej vojny a prostredníctvom dosiahnutých výsledkov realizovaného výskumu objasňuje podstatu skúmaného problému. (Hybrid war represents one the most used terms in the area of military and security affairs, and particularly also in politics and international relationships in the last years, especially after the outbreak of conflict in Ukraine. It appears still more frequently not only in scientific or specialized military or security publications, studies or articles, but also in various journals, news, reports or debates out of military or security community. It might be seemed it is a new term or even new type of conflict, but it is not. Hybrid war is really no new phenomenon, it is known for many years; however, after the Russian annexation of Crimea, it is much more popular and used. On the other hand, the majority of wider public do not know what the mentioned term exactly represents, and that is the reason why an author of the article deals with this topic from theoretical point of view, and, through gained results of the research, trays to explain the essence of examined problem.)
Z00|Bridging conflicting innovation spheres of tourism innovation: the role of diplomacy|In service sectors such as tourism production and consumption are tied to places. In these places different actors base their production on a set of shared resources. Such localized systems can be characterized by different service practices, disagreements among actors, lack of trust, and competition which may inhibit networked and open innovation. Tourist destinations are examples of such localized systems. In this paper we present two extreme cases of tourist destinations in which collaborative innovation processes were established in spite of fierce disagreements between actors. We argue that in tourist destinations actors belong to conflicting innovation spheres but can be brought together in innovation processes when a diplomat enable compromises and when innovation spheres change from personalized to more generalized forms of activity during interaction. The findings are relevant not only for tourism but also for other sectors characterized by localized systems. JEL Codes: L83, L14, L19, O30, Z00
Z00|Identifying the Effects of Place-based Policies – Causal Evidence from Germany|The German government provides discretionary investment grants to structurally weak regions to reduce regional disparities. We use a regression discontinuity design that exploits an exogenous discrete jump in the probability of receiving investment grants to identify the causal effects of the investment grant on regional outcomes. We find positive effects for regional gross value-added and productivity growth, but no effects for employment and gross wage growth.
Z00|Water Conservation Behavior and Environmental Concerns|Water conservation represents important pro-environmental behavior for a sustainable environment. This paper investigates the link between water conservation behavior and general environmental concerns using a large dataset from the Multipurpose Household Survey conducted annually by the Italian Central Statistics Office. Univariate probit models show that pollution and resource exhaustion are positively related to individual water conservation behavior while alteration of environmental heritage exhibits a negative relationship with water saving behavior. These findings are robust to the inclusion of environment knowledge and social capital variables. Robustness analysis also indicates that television and radio, participation in environmental initiatives, money for environmental protection and churchgoing are significant determinants of water conservation behavior.
Z00|What women want in their sperm donor: A study of more than 1000 women’s sperm donor selections|Reproductive medicine and commercial sperm banking have facilitated an evolutionary shift in how women are able to choose who fathers their offspring, by notionally expanding women’s opportunity set beyond former constraints. This study analyses 1546 individual reservations of semen by women from a private Australian assisted reproductive health facility across a ten year period from 2006 to 2015. Using the time that each sample was available at the facility until reservation, we explore women’s preference for particular male characteristics. We find that younger donors, and those who hold a higher formal education compared to those with no academic qualifications are more quickly selected for reservation by women. Both age and education as proxies for resources are at the centre of Parental Investment theory, and our findings further build on this standard evolutionary construct in relation to female mate preferences. Reproductive medicine not only provides women the opportunity to become a parent, where previously they would not have been able to, it also reveals that female preference for resources of their potential mate (sperm donor) remain, even when the notion of paternal investment becomes redundant. These findings build on behavioural science’s understanding of large-scale decisions and human behaviour in reproductive medical settings.
Z00|Patrones de co-localización espacial de la industria aeroespacial en México|Mexico's aerospace industry (IA) is considered strategic due to the possibilities offered to national business to be inserted into supply chain; by its productive characteristics involves the development of suppliers by externalities, which requires business co-location. This document applies the Co-location Quotient (CLQ) statistic in five Mexican entities in order to detect spatial co-location patterns in clusters related to the IA. The results indicate its spatial attraction to aerospace business, as well as electronics, machinery and equipment. Additionally, it can be identified differences in regards co-location patters with respect to the productive capacities by entity; this suggests inputs for the design of industrial policy.

Z00|Tie-Up Cycles in Long-Term Mating. Part I: Theory|In this paper, we propose a new approach to couple formation and dynamics that abridges findings from sexual strategies theory and attachment theory to develop a framework where the sexual and emotional aspects of mating are considered in their strategic interaction. Our approach presents several testable implications, some of which find interesting correspondences in the existing literature. Our main result is that, according to our approach, there are six typical dynamic interaction patterns that are more or less conducive to the formation of a stable couple, and that set out an interesting typology for the analysis of real (as well as fictional, as we will see in the second part of the paper) mating behaviors and dynamics.
Z00|Potential for Reuse of E-Plastics through Processing by Compression Molding|The amounts of e-waste, consisting of metal (e-metals) and plastic (e-plastics) streams from electronic goods, are increasing in the United States and elsewhere. The e-metals waste streams are being recycled to a reasonable degree due to the value of precious metals. E-plastic waste streams currently are not recycled or reused to a significant extent. As a result, most e-plastics are disposed of by landfilling or thermal treatment, or sent overseas for alleged recycling or reuse, any of which could result in unsafe worker exposure and release into the environment. Two of the major barriers to e-plastics’ reuse or recycling are the mixed plastic content and the presence in the e-plastics of flame retardants (FR), of which two classes in particular, the brominated flame retardants (BFR) and organo-phosphorus flame retardants (OPFR), have associated health concerns. The major goal of this project is to investigate the possibility of direct reuse of e-plastics in compression molding. Preliminary data generated have identified a molding procedure that yields remanufactured e-plastics having a tensile strength of 29.3 MPa. This moderate strength level is suspected to be due to inclusions of plastic bits that did not melt and internal voids from out-gassing. Handheld X-ray fluorescence (XRF) was utilized to characterize elemental components in the e-plastics tested for compression molding. Several high “hits” for Br were found that could not be predicted visually. The preliminary XRF data for BFR and OPFR in this work are helpful for environmental and occupational hazard assessments of compression molding activities. Additionally, methods are suggested to characterize the metals, BFR, and OPFR content of the e-plastics using several different additional laboratory analytical techniques to determine the suitability for cost-effective and easy-to-use technologies.
Z00|Challenges in Creating Evidence in Environmental Health Risk Assessments: The Example of Second-Hand Smoke|Public health interventions are directed to influence the (state of a) risk factor, either by behavioral or environmental changes. Therefore, environmental health risk assessments are highly relevant for public health decision making and policy development. The credibility of an environmental health risk assessment depends, to a large extent, on the strength of the scientific evidence on which it is based. In this article, the main challenges for assessing the impact of a potential adverse health effect from an environmental pollutant are described. Second-hand smoke (SHS) was chosen to illustrate the current state of evidence. The assessment of the impact of potential adverse health effects from environmental risk factors is dependent on several issues, such as the hypothesized health outcome, the nature of the exposure, the dose-response-relationship and the variability and susceptibility of the exposed population. The example of SHS exposure highlights the need for evidence-based public health. Several challenges in terms of study design, assessment methods, as well as data analysis and synthesis with respect to the stratification of results, and consideration of bias and confounding exist. Future research needs to take into account which methods and techniques will be used to generate evidence for population-level decisions.
Z00|Practical Eco-Design and Eco-Innovation of Consumer Electronics—the Case of Mobile Phones|Annually, it is estimated that about 4 billion units of consumer electronics for mobile communications are produced worldwide. This could lead to various ecological imbalances unless the design and disposal of the products are handled optimally. To illustrate how industry looks at and responds to the increasing social awareness, this article describes how sustainability is successfully implemented in practice at a large Chinese company, developing and producing various kinds of electronic products used for communication. It also describes how a variety of eco-innovations and business models contribute to reducing the environmental impact; for example, through increased recovery and recycling. A new kind of eco-design procedure is presented along with a new methodology which shows how a mobile phone gradually becomes more sustainable from one generation to the next. The issues with and set-up of new eco-labeling schemes for mobile phones, eco-rating, is described in detail. The conclusion is that due to high competition between companies, the industry acts resourcefully and a lot is done to the save the ecological environment.
Z00|Use of Bacteriocinogenic Cultures without Inhibiting Cheese Associated Nonstarter Lactic Acid Bacteria; A Trial with Lactobacillus plantarum|Bacteriocinogenic cultures can represent a natural way to increase the safety of cheeses made from raw milk, in which a relevant role in ripening and flavor formation is exerted by the nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB). Since the latter can be inhibited by bacteriocin producers, this study evaluated to which extent a nisinogenic culture inoculated at low initial levels can affect the growth rate and peptide degradation activity of the nisin-sensitive cheese isolate Lactobacillus plantarum LZ by comparison with its isogenic variant, L. plantarum LZNI, with increased immunity to nisin. A growth delay of the nisin sensitive strain was observed only when its initial number was 100-fold lower than the nisin producer and nisin was added as an inducer of its own production. In this case, the amount of free α-amino groups was significantly different between cultures of L. plantarum LZ and LZNI only at Day 1. Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) highlighted a few differences between the peptide profiles of co-cultures L. plantarum LZ and LZNI. However, results showed that the bacteriocin producer did not dramatically influence the behavior of the sensitive NSLAB and that the evaluation of the effects on microbial contaminants in cheese is worthwhile.
Z00|Bridging the Gap between Eco-Design and the Human Thinking System|Technological progress has enabled widespread adoption and use of consumer electronics, changing how global society lives and works. This progress has come with immense environmental cost, including extraction of scarce materials, consumption of fossil fuels, and growing e-waste challenges. Eco-design has emerged as a promising approach to reduce the environmental footprint of electronics by integrating sustainability-oriented decisions early in the product realization process. However, most approaches focus on the product itself, not on the consumer who ultimately decides how to purchase, use, maintain, and dispose of the device. This article presents a new framework to guide designers in developing products with features that encourage consumers to use them in an environmentally sustainable manner. The Sustainable Behavior Design (SBD) framework links common design concepts (ergonomic, emotional, preventative, and interaction design) with core aspects of the human thinking system to create features to make users aware of their behavior and decisions (reflective thinking) or result in sustainable behaviors even when users are unaware (automatic thinking). The SBD framework is demonstrated using a case study on a smartphone, a high demand product. The reimagined smartphone design integrates solutions addressing both automatic and reflective thinking systems, potentially reducing life cycle impacts by almost 30%.

Z00|Modeling Autonomous Decision-Making on Energy and Environmental Management Using Petri-Net: The Case Study of a Community in Bandung, Indonesia|Autonomous decision-making in this study is defined as the process where decision-makers have the freedom and ability to find problems, select goals, and make decisions for achieving the selected problems/goals by themselves. Autonomous behavior is considered significant for achieving decision implementation, especially in the context of energy and environmental management, where multiple stakeholders are involved and each stakeholder holds valuable local information for making decisions. This paper aims to build a structured process in modeling the autonomous decision-making. A practical decision-making process in waste-to-energy conversion activities in a community in Bandung, Indonesia, is selected as a case study. The decision-making process here is considered as a discrete event system, which is then represented as a Petri-net model. First, the decision-making process in the case study is decomposed into discrete events or decision-making stages, and the stakeholders’ properties in each stage are extracted from the case study. Second, several stakeholder properties that indicate autonomous behavior are identified as autonomous properties. Third, presented is a method to develop the decision-making process as a Petri-net model. The model is utilized for identifying the critical points for verifying the performance of the derived Petri-net.
Z00|Validation of a Miniaturized Spectrometer for Trace Detection of Explosives by Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy|Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) measurements of some common military explosives were performed with a table-top micro-Raman system integrated with a Serstech R785 miniaturized device, comprising a spectrometer and detector for near-infrared (NIR) laser excitation (785 nm). R785 was tested as the main component of a miniaturized SERS detector, designed for in situ and stand-alone sensing of molecules released at low concentrations, as could happen in the case of traces of explosives found in an illegal bomb factory, where solid microparticles of explosives could be released in the air and then collected on the sensor’s surface, if placed near the factory, as a consequence of bomb preparation. SERS spectra were obtained, exciting samples in picogram quantities on specific substrates, starting from standard commercial solutions. The main vibrational features of each substance were clearly identified also in low quantities. The amount of the sampled substance was determined through the analysis of scanning electron microscope images, while the spectral resolution and the detector sensitivity were sufficiently high to clearly distinguish spectra belonging to different samples with an exposure time of 10 s. A principal component analysis procedure was applied to the experimental data to understand which are the main factors affecting spectra variation across different samples. The score plots for the first three principal components show that the examined explosive materials can be clearly classified on the basis of their SERS spectra.
Z00|Putting Soil Security on the Policy Agenda: Need for a Familiar Framework|Soils generate agricultural, environmental, and socio-economic benefits that are vital to human life. The enormity of threats to global soil stocks raises the imperative for securing this vital resource. To contribute to the security framing and advancement of the soil security concept and discourse, this paper provides a working definition and proposes dimensions that can underpin the conceptualization of soil security. In this paper, soil security refers to safeguarding and improving the quality, quantity and functionality of soil stocks from critical and pervasive threats in order to guarantee the availability, access, and utilization of soils to sustainably generate productive goods and ecosystem services. The dimensions proposed are availability, accessibility, utilization, and stability, which are obviously similar to the dimensions of food security. Availability refers to the quality and spatial distribution of soils of a given category. Accessibility relates to the conditions or mechanisms by which actors negotiate and gain entitlements to occupy and use a given soil. Utilization deals with the use or purpose to which a given soil is put and the capacity to manage and generate optimal private and public benefits from the soil. Finally, stability refers to the governance mechanisms that safeguard and improve the first three dimensions. These dimensions, their interactions, and how they can be operationalized in a strategy to secure soils are presented and discussed.
Z00|Soft Energy Paths Revisited: Politics and Practice in Energy Technology Transitions|This paper argues that current efforts to study and advocate for a change in energy technologies to reduce their climate and other environmental impacts often ignore the political, social, and bodily implications of energy technology choices. Framing renewable energy technologies exclusively in terms of their environmental benefits dismisses important questions about how energy infrastructures can be designed to correspond to democratic forms of socio-politics, forms of social organization that involve independence in terms of meeting energy needs, resilience in terms of adapting to change, participatory decision making and control, equitable distribution of knowledge and efficacy, and just distribution of ownership. Recognizing technological choices as political choices brings explicit attention to the kinds of socio-political restructuring that could be precipitated through a renewable energy technology transition. This paper argues that research on energy transitions should consider the political implications of technological choices, not just the environmental consequences. Further, emerging scholarship on energy practices suggests that social habits of energy usage are themselves political, in that they correspond to and reinforce particular arrangements of power. Acknowledging the embedded politics of technology, as the decades’ old concept of soft path technologies encourages, and integrating insights on the politics of technology with insights on technological practices, can improve future research on energy policy and public perceptions of energy systems. This paper extends insights regarding the socio-political implications of energy paths to consider how understandings of energy technologies as constellations of embedded bodily practices can help further develop our understanding of the consequences of energy technologies, consequences that move beyond environmental implications to the very habits and behaviors of patterned energy usage, which are themselves arguably political. This paper calls for future research that involves explicit examination of the relationship between technologies, socio-political distributions of power and access to energy resources, the social organization of energy practices, and options for energy transitions not just in terms of energy source, but also in terms of scale, design, and modes of ownership and control.
Z00|Field Prototype of the ENEA Neutron Active Interrogation Device for the Detection of Dirty Bombs|The Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy, and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA) Neutron Active Interrogation (NAI) device is a tool designed to improve CBRNE defense. It is designed to uncover radioactive and nuclear threats including those in the form of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), the so-called “dirty bombs”. The NAI device, at its current development stage, allows to detect 6 g of 235 U hidden in a package. It is easily transportable, light in weight, and with a real-time response. Its working principle is based on two stages: (1) an “active” stage in which neutrons are emitted by a neutron generator to interact with the item under inspection, and (2) a “passive” stage in which secondary neutrons are detected originating a signal that, once processed, allows recognition of the offence. In particular, a clear indication of the potential threat is obtained by a dedicated software based on the Differential Die-Away Time Analysis method.
Z00|Optimization of Plating Conditions for the Determination of Polonium Using Copper Foils|The technique of adsorption of polonium onto metal surfaces by spontaneous deposition has found applications in the analysis of environmental samples such as marine sediments, foodstuff, water, and tobacco since the 1960s. Silver foil has been preferred by many scientists but can become quite expensive for routine analysis. Deposition onto copper was first proposed in the 1970s, but has remained poorly studied. In the present study, the cost-effective and rapid optimum conditions necessary for the optimal recovery of Po from aqueous solutions during spontaneous deposition onto copper foils was evaluated while minimizing the deposition of Bi and Pb, which may interfere with subsequent analyses. A series of experiments was performed to determine adsorption yields for Po, Bi, and Pb to copper foils for a range of pH values from 1.0 to 5.5, with and without stable Bi and Pb carriers. Different methods for cleaning the copper foils were also compared. After initial measurements, Po, Bi, and Pb were desorbed from the disc in plating solutions without added activity. At higher pH values (3.0 and 5.5), less Bi was adsorbed to the copper foils, and subsequent desorption removed up to 99.1% of the plated Bi. The polonium yield remained fairly constant at all pH values and was unaffected by the desorption process. There was also no measureable increase in the polonium activity after 33 days, suggesting that Bi and Pb were not significantly co-deposited. All three cleaning methods performed well, whereas uncleaned foils in the same solution showed limited uptake. The use of copper foil under the optimum conditions described here could provide a valuable alternative to the use of silver in 210 Po analyses.
Z00|Challenges in Specialty Coffee Processing and Quality Assurance|Coffee is an important crop that assures a sustainable economy to farmers in tropical regions. A dramatic concern for coffee production is currently represented by climate change, which threatens the survival of Coffea arabica cultivation worldwide and imposes modifications of the agronomic practices to prevent this risk. The quality of coffee beans depends on optimized protocols of cultivation, ripe berries collection, and removal of the outer fruit layers by dry or wet processes and moisture reduction. Storage and shipment represent two steps where bean quality needs to be preserved by preventing fungal contamination that may impact the final product and form mycotoxins, mainly ochratoxin A. In this review, we describe the challenges faced by the coffee industry to guarantee quality from production to roasting and brewing. An overview of novel technologies, such as the application of starter cultures in fermentation and the exploitation of industrial enzymes in accelerating the process of flavour development in coffee beans, is given. Moreover, the results of studies on microbial populations on coffee and the differences found in fungi, yeasts and bacteria composition among the investigations, are summarized. In particular, this review describes new attempts to contain the development of mycotoxigenic fungi, through the application of antagonistic microorganisms such as S. cerevisiae . The new wave of specialty coffees, i.e., those with a cupping score higher than 85/100, is also presented. It is shown how, through careful coffee production methods and controlled fermentation processes, coffee producers may increase their income by assuring high standards of quality and high added value for the coffee experience sector.
Z00|Technical Problem Identification for the Failures of the Liberty Ships|The U.S. Liberty Ship Building Program in World War II set a record—a total of 2700 Liberty Ships were built in 6 years, in order to support the battle against Nazi-Germany. However, numerous vessels suffered sudden fracture, some of them being split in half. This paper demonstrates and investigation of the Liberty Ships failure and problems, which reveals that the failures are caused by a combination of three factors. The welds produced by largely unskilled work force contain crack type flaws. Beyond these cracks, another important reason for failure associated with welding is the hydrogen embitterment; most of the fractures initiate at deck square hatch corners where there is a stress concentration; and the ship steel has fairly poor Charpy-Impact tested fracture toughness. It has been admitted that, although the numerous catastrophic failures were a painful experience, the failures of the Liberty Ships caused significant progress in the study of fracture mechanics. Considering their effect, the Liberty Ships are still a success.
Z00|A Linear Bayesian Updating Model for Probabilistic Spatial Classification|Categorical variables are common in spatial data analysis. Traditional analytical methods for deriving probabilities of class occurrence, such as kriging-family algorithms, have been hindered by the discrete characteristics of categorical fields. To solve the challenge, this study introduces the theoretical backgrounds of the linear Bayesian updating (LBU) model for spatial classification through an expert system. The main purpose of this paper is to present the solid theoretical foundations of the LBU approach. Since the LBU idea is originated from aggregating expert opinions and is not restricted to conditional independent assumption (CIA), it may prove to be reasonably adequate for analyzing complex geospatial data sets, such as remote sensing images or area-class maps.
Z00|Innovations in Detection of Deliberate or Accidental Contamination with Biological Agents in Environment and Foods|In 2016, two special issues were launched and attended in this journal, “Challenges in New Technologies for Security” (http://www.mdpi.com/journal/challenges/special_issues/tech_ security) and “Food Microbiology: Technologies and processes, microbiology analysis methods, and antimicrobials” (http://www.mdpi.com/journal/challenges/special_issues/food-microbiology). In this editorial, I will review one of the topics of biological hazards detection, namely, the rapid analysis of biological agents (DNA and antigens of fungi, bacteria, and viruses) and their toxins.[...]
Z00|Stand-Off Device for Plastic Debris Recognition in Post-Blast Scenarios|The fast analysis of crime scenes is a very critical issue for investigators that should collect, as much as possible, all and only meaningful evidence, and rapidly bring back to normality the involved area. With the scope to respond to the end user’s requirements, the project FORLAB (Forensic Laboratory for in-situ evidence analysis in a post blast scenario) has set, as its main goal, to develop a system of sensors for fast screening of post-blast scenes. In this frame, a new sensor based on laser induced fluorescence has been developed for standoff individuation and localization of plastic debris in post-blast scenarios. The system can scan large areas in short times (in some cases, minutes) providing real-time images of the scene where material discrimination is highlighted. In fact, the combined use of a laser source with a high repetition rate and of a signal collection setup based on a fixed intensified charged coupled device (ICCD) with a large field of view has allowed for the brief duration of the scanning process. In addition, dedicated software elaborates the fluorescence data obtained from the targets and retrieves a chemical characterization useful for material recognition.
Z00|Early Warning of Biological Threats via Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy: A Case Study of Bacillus Spores|A study on the application of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) in detecting biological threats is here reported. Simulants of deadly Bacillus anthracis endospores were used. This study proposes an automated device where SERS is used as a fast, pre-alarm technique of a two-stage sensor equipped with a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In order to check the potentialities of SERS in terms of sensitivity and specificity for on-site, real-time, automatic detection and identification of biological agents, two strains of genetically and harmless closely B. anthracis -related spores, Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus atrophaeus , were used as simulants. In order to assure the selectivity of the SERS substrate against B. thuringiensis spores, the substrate was functionalized by specific peptides. The obtained SERS measurements are classified as positive or negative hits by applying a special data evaluation based on the Euclidian distance between each spectrum and a reference spectrum of blank measurement. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied for discriminating between different strains representing dangerous and harmless spores. The results show that the SERS sensor is capable of detecting a few tenths of spores in a few minutes, and is particularly sensitive and fast for this purpose. Post-process analysis of the spectra allowed for discrimination between the contaminated and uncontaminated SERS sensors and even between different strains of spores, although not as clearly. For this purpose, the use of a non-functionalized SERS substrate is suggested.
Z00|Attitudes towards Tax Evasion in Turkey and Australia: A Comparative Study|The authors conducted a survey of 502 Turkish and Australian undergraduate and graduate business and economic students to determine their views regarding the ethics of tax evasion. These two groups were selected on the premise that their views represented the perceptions of two very different cultures, which has not been investigated in previous studies. The survey instrument required students to indicate their level of agreeableness to 18 general statements representing various scenarios in the socio-economic environment. The statements in the survey reflected the three main viewpoints regarding the ethics of tax evasion which have emerged from the literature to date. The results of the study show that although Turkish scores are significantly different from the Australian scores, both Turkish and Australian respondents believe that tax evasion can be ethically justifiable in certain situations, although some arguments are stronger than others.
Z00|Gender, Fitness Doping and the Genetic Max. The Ambivalent Construction of Muscular Masculinities in an Online Community|This article is based on written accounts posted on an online forum called Flashback. The purpose of the study was to explore how participants in this community negotiated the meanings of fitness doping and how such negotiations could be understood in terms of masculinity. The findings indicate that the Internet community studied in this article can be read as an example of a transformational process in which ordinary rules are questioned and partly put out of play. In the world of the bodybuilder, the marginal masculinity is, in certain senses, dominant. On the one hand, achieving a muscular and well-trained body is regarded as a core aspect of manhood within the community. Marginal masculinity is thus momentarily transformed into dominant and hegemonic masculinity. On the other hand, however, the findings also indicate that a drug-using, muscular masculinity is constructed in negotiation with other central masculine ideals, such as the employable man and the responsible father. Found within the community is a complex and dynamic interplay between intersecting discourses of manhood.
Z00|Decreasing Obesity and Obesity Stigma: Socio-Demographic Differences in Beliefs about Causes of and Responsibility for Obesity|Obesity is a stigmatized condition, and research has shown that obesity stigma varies based on the perceived cause of obesity. It is important that public health professionals develop policy and campaigns that resonate with specific populations while avoiding an increase in harmful stigma. This study identifies socio-demographic differences in causal attributions of obesity and beliefs about responsibility for obesity. Using data from a survey of 923 people in the United States conducted by ABC New/Time Magazine, attributions of cause and responsibility are analyzed using Ordinary Least Squares regression. Beliefs about cause and responsibility fall on a continuum from primarily individual cause and personal responsibility to primarily societal cause and social responsibility. In general, women and minority racial groups are found to be more likely to identify causes over which individuals have little control and place responsibility on societal factors than men and Whites. People in higher income categories are found to be more likely to identify individual responsibility for obesity. Findings from this study can be used to shape information and public health policy to address obesity in ways that will not exacerbate obesity stigma as well as to create programs that will be customized for specific communities based on their existing beliefs.
Z00|Crisis Communication Competence in Co-Producing Safety with Citizen Groups|The aim of this article is to explore interpersonal communication competence needed by crisis communication and management experts when co-operating with citizen groups in response to emergencies. Moreover, the purpose is to understand how response organizations can further develop this crisis communication competence and so contribute to the functioning of response networks. The research task is approached qualitatively by eliciting crisis communication and management experts’ ( n = 33) perceptions of the interpersonal communication competence response organizations needs when co-operating with citizen groups. The data were gathered via an international online questionnaire using a method referred to as “thematic writing” and consist of written responses to open-ended questions on what constitutes the core of crisis communication competence and what aspects of it need more attention. The research findings indicate that co-producing safety with citizen groups demands crisis communication competence related to message production, message reception, and interaction between experts and citizen groups. In addition, the findings clarify what areas of crisis communication competence need to be further developed to facilitate co-operation between experts and citizen groups. However, the authors suggest that crisis communication competence should not be seen solely as a characteristic of individual crisis communicators but approached as a networked and co-created area of competence.
Z00|American Long-Distance Locomobility and the Spaces of Actor-Network Theory|Much of the discourse surrounding national intercity passenger rail service in the United States revolves around why it has lagged so far behind European and Asian counterparts. However, a more interesting question might be why it has survived despite competition from faster, more nimble transport modes, discriminatory public policy, and the ascension of neoliberal discourse hostile to public endeavor. This paper uses the concept of durability in actor-network theory to offer some insights into how the system has achieved a remarkable but problematic stability, and how that durability relates to an imagined role for national intercity passenger rail in a future of increasingly constrained material resources. This paper also demonstrates the application of actor-network theory (ANT) in a way that can serve as a useful introduction to and template for the use of that methodology.

Z00|From Athletes to Astrophysicists: Gender Differences in Patterns and Predictors of Career Aspirations in Pre-Adolescence|This paper adds to research on girls’ growing educational advantage by examining gender differences in career paths. Using baseline data from an intervention study (TRY-IT!) targeting 265 sixth-graders in Title I schools, our research traces adolescent career aspirations by gender, race and class. Additionally, we investigate whether girls and boys exhibit differential sensitivity to environmental risk and protective factors that shape career and educational aspirations. We find that the career choices of boys vary more widely by social context, including socioeconomic status, race, and academic resources. Specifically, among youth with fewer social and academic advantages, girls aspire to more practical careers and careers which require higher levels of educational attainment relative to boys. The findings reveal how sources of inequality such as race and class shape gendered aspirations and complicate gender inequality. We reason that boys’ choices are more volatile and socially contingent because of the emphasis on high-status careers as a signifier of masculinity.
Z00|Voluntary Turnover: A Means of Reducing Perceived Job Insecurity? A Propensity Score Matching Procedure Applied on Swiss Data|The investigation of job insecurity has been a growing field of research. However, little is known about the strategies employees adopt to reduce job insecurity. Former research has shown that employees who perceive high job insecurity tend to engage in voluntary turnover. Yet, we do not know whether such a strategy is successful in reducing perceived job insecurity. Based on the Swiss Household Panel (SHP), a general population survey in Switzerland, a propensity score matching procedure is applied to investigate whether voluntary turnover successfully reduces feelings of job insecurity for employees who previously perceived an above-average level of job insecurity. Assuming that individual and family conditions are important factors explaining the success of this strategy it is distinguished between men and women with high, equally shared, or low financial responsibilities and of different age and educational groups. The results show that voluntary turnover indeed reduces perceived job insecurity. Whereas the individual factors do not moderate this relationship, the level of financial responsibilities does: employees who equally share financial responsibilities with their partners are most successful in reducing perceived job insecurity through voluntary turnover. The use of a propensity score matching procedure has proven fruitful as the bias caused by differing pre-turnover characteristics can be reduced considerably.
Z00|The Left- and Right-Wing Political Power Design: The Dilemma of Welfare Policy with Low-Income Relief|Findings from this experiment contributed novel insights into the theoretical field of welfare policy, addressing fundamental questions about wealth redistribution rules and norms. The expenses of the redistribution pertaining to basic goods, as well as those associated with public (non-basic) but vital goods, are separately estimated by transforming the expenses into functions of the poverty line. The findings reveal that, along the poverty line that treats all citizens equally, the politicians representing opposing ideologies decide how the redistribution of basic and vital goods should be financed. Politicians should come to an agreement, subject to an approval of their decisions by voters-citizens. However, in the absence of such approval, politicians have no alternative but to continue the negotiations. Based on this premise, we concluded that political decisions with an elevated poverty line as a parameter would give rise to inverse working incentives of benefits claimants. This may result in unbalanced books, due to the expenditure on the delivery of basic and non-basic goods to their respective destinations. By keeping the books in balance, we postulate that one half of median income μ, in accord with Fuchs point, may be used in the form of poverty line ½μ for just and fair wealth redistribution in resolving the ideological controversies between left- and right-wing politicians. Through the income exception rule equal to ½μ, as a result of a relief payments simulation, the wealth redistribution system, known since 1962 from as Friedman’s Negative Income Tax (NIT), diminished the Gini coefficient.
Z00|Transnationalism: A Vehicle for Settlement and Incorporation of Muslim Iraqi Turkoman Forced Migrants in Sydney|Based on a qualitative study of eight “less visible” Muslim Iraqi Turkoman immigrants in a multicultural Sydney, this article highlights the dynamic nature of immigrant identity that is constructed of multiple ethno-communal identities. This article explores the significance of transnational activities, due to readily available communication technologies, and how this allows Muslim Iraqi Turkoman immigrants not only to hold multiple identities, but also move and mix in societies with plural ethno-religious communities, such as Sydney. Through a transnational lens and the use of qualitative study, this article looks at how Muslim Iraqi Turkoman forced migrants have engaged in identity reproduction and settlement in Sydney, and how their experiences compare with the utopic dream of a “multicultural Australia”. The key findings in this article show that: firstly, “less visible” Muslim Iraqi Turkoman ethnic minority usually finds it difficult to self-define their identity, and often uses nation states as point of reference; secondly, Islamophobic attacks affect feelings of belongingness to the larger Australian society; thirdly, maintaining home culture promotes feelings of belongingness to Australia.
Z00|Hybridity: A Theory of Agency in Early Childhood Governance|Contemporary social science research concerning governance tends to take an institutional perspective that privileges structural analysis. The resulting body of literature has an emphasis on classification, typologies and regimes. This approach has been criticized on the basis that it neglects the role of agency and context when research concerns complex and heterogeneous community governance cases. An emerging literature on hybridity in social services aims to address the limitations of structural accounts by acknowledging that diverse logics, ideas, and norms influence the way community based social services resist or adapt in turbulent policy environments. This article considers the strengths and limitations of hybridity in development of a research framework incorporating structure, agency and ideas. The relevance of hybridity theory for the Kids in Communities study—an Australian research project investigating neighborhood influences on child development across multiple case study sites—is evaluated.
Z00|Integrated Social Housing and Health Care for Homeless and Marginally-Housed Individuals: A Study of the Housing and Homelessness Steering Committee in Ontario, Canada|Homelessness is a complex social issue that requires a coordinated systems approach. In recent years, Canada has seen an emergence of integrated care, the joining of health care and social care, to address the needs of homeless persons. This article documents the findings of open-ended interviews with eleven members of the central east Ontario Housing and Homelessness Framework Steering Committee, comprised of service managers and the Local Health Integration Network. As the system planners for social housing and health care, respectively, members of the group work together to align system approaches for homeless persons. Research by this group identified three challenges of collaborating—their different histories and legislation, varied accountability structures, and differing roles and responsibilities within the central east region of Ontario. The study findings indicate that developing a joint document to guide the work was a process through which members began to work through these differences.
Z00|Political Experience and the Success of Female Gubernatorial Candidates|This research examines the effect that political experience has on the success of female gubernatorial candidates by analyzing the female vs. male gubernatorial elections from 1976–2014. The study questions whether prior statewide political office experience is advantageous for female candidates and is this consistent across party lines. This research builds on the political pipeline theory, which suggests that the shortage of women holding higher level political office, such as governor, is due to the lack of qualified and motivated women running for political office. We argue that women who hold lower level statewide office develop the necessary experience and name recognition that provides them with the qualifications and motivation, both within themselves and from other sources such as political parties, to run for and win the office of governor. Our findings suggest that statewide office experience is important for the success of Democratic women gubernatorial candidates but not for Republican women gubernatorial candidates.
Z00|The Fragility of Gender Equality Policies in Spain|Within the last decade, Spain has become a model in legislative policies for gender equality at the international level. However, the economic crisis has led to a growth in inequality, which has revealed the weaknesses of the adopted instruments. Despite the large amount of legislation in this area, the social reality has not changed at all, even experiencing a setback over the past few years. This situation was exposed in our country by a report issued in 2015 by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). This report showed the negative effects of the economic crisis and austerity policies on women, even in a context necessitating increased efforts towards women’s rights. Therefore, it is imperative that the concept of gender mainstreaming and the adoption of instruments of “hard law” be revisited. The goal should be to achieve gender justice based on three elements—distribution, identity, and representation—and a real parity democracy.
Z00|Masculinities in Cyberspace: An Analysis of Portrayals of Manhood in Men’s Rights Activist Websites|A growth in cultural ideologies concerned with men and masculinities in contemporary American society has recently emerged. Men’s rights activist (MRA) groups embody a movement emphasizing the crisis of masculinity. Despite men’s privileged societal status, MRAs seek to establish resources for men to utilize in elevating their perceived subordinated position in society in relation to women and social minorities. Little research has systematically investigated MRAs on the Internet, which is rapidly becoming a primary source of information and social connectedness for people. Through a content analysis of the 12 most prominent MRA websites, we explore the various strategies used by contemporary men’s groups designed to provide support for men in their pursuit of social legitimacy and power. Two primary categories of MRAs with distinctive ideological strategies emerged from this analysis: Cyber Lads in Search of Masculinity and Virtual Victims in Search of Equality . Though both groups promoted men’s entitlement to social power, Cyber Lads utilized themes of explicit aggression towards and devaluation of women, while Virtual Victims adopted political and social movement rhetoric to address men’s issues. The implications of these websites are discussed in terms of gender equality and their potential effects on individual men and women.
Z00|Making Communication Strategy Choices in a Fast Evolving Crisis Situation—Results from a Table-Top Discussion on an Anthrax Scenario|This paper aims at clarifying a timely topic of how communication strategy choices are made in evolving, complex crises, such as those caused by terrorism involving chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) agents. This is done by examining data gathered from a table-top discussion among crisis communication experts, focusing on a scenario of an anthrax attack and analysed qualitatively. The communication experts followed the evolving crisis situation by gathering inputs from various actors in the crisis management network, thereby creating situational understanding, and interpreted these inputs for decision-making on communication strategies. The underlying process of coping with complexity in evolving CBRN terrorism crises can be described as a continuous, dynamic process that can best be explained with a combination of traditional and more modern crisis communication approaches. Strategy-making in crisis situations by communication experts is still largely a black box. In this study, a novel approach of decomposing strategy-making by observing a table-top discussion is chosen to clarify the process. By identifying the core elements involved, a more detailed picture of communication strategy-making is created, thus promoting preparedness and professional resilience in the field.
Z00|Oil in Syria between Terrorism and Dictatorship|The sale of oil and gas is one of the most important components of the Syrian economy. Unfortunately, since the discovery of these resources, the Syrian people have not benefited from the revenues earned. This study deals with the development of oil and gas production and the geographical distribution of fields, as well as production control, deterioration of production, refining and selling mechanisms, and the resulting health and environmental impacts following Islamic State’s (IS) control of the majority of oilfields in Syria. Since summer 2015, IS controls 80% of the fields with a production of 65,000 barrels per day (b/d); the Assad regime controls 8% of fields with 10,000 b/d; and Kurdish forces dominate the remaining 12% with 25,000 b/d. IS depends on oil as a major source of financing for its military and civilian activities, and has also managed to set up an extensive network of middlemen in neighbouring territories and countries, with the aim of trading crude oil for cash and other resources. IS produces and exports within its areas of control and sells part of the oil to the Assad regime, and another portion to the liberated areas, as well as to Iraq and Turkey.
Z00|Veiled Politics: Muslim Women’s Visibility and Their Use in European Countries’ Political Life|One of the many disastrous consequences of the tragic events of 9/11 is the war waged by the neocolonialists in order to “liberate” Muslim women. This gender-based war stands on a series of pillars, such as the presumption that Western civilization offers women a great deal of privileges, while Muslim culture gives none. Therefore, it would be logical to suppose that, because of the many opportunities the West grants to Muslim women who reside there, the latter may have an active role in the local political process. However, Muslim women have scarce visibility in European political life, and their presence is sometimes merely instrumental to some party: in most cases, women are coopted because they are a good sample of “secular Muslims” ( i.e. , they do not wear the hijab , i.e. , the veil and a modest attire); in others, they are appointed because they are veiled and can therefore become a good vehicle in order to win the support both of the Muslim community and of its sympathizers. In this paper, I will analyze some crucial aspects of Muslim women’s formal political participation in some European countries; in addition, I will focus on the Italian case with the help of a series of interviews with Muslim women who play an active role in local political councils. The study shows how in European politics, Muslim women can become a commodity even when they stand out as rising political individuals; but also how they fight to gain visibility and public recognition, in spite of the tense situation and of the rampant Islamophobia.
Z00|U.S. Volunteering in the Aftermath of the Great Recession: Were African Americans a Significant Factor?|The Great Recession weakened U.S. families’ abilities to make charitable gifts. Although African Americans are generally especially hard hit by these types of economic crises, they have a long and distinctive history of volunteerism and mutual assistance. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to examine African American volunteering in nonprofit organizations in the aftermath of the 2008–2009 recession. Specifically, we examined race as well as other factors with the potential to influence volunteering in four categories of organizations: poverty organizations, senior service agencies, social action groups, and religious affiliated organizations. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data, this secondary analysis produced significant findings regarding volunteerism among African Americans in these community-based organizations.
Z00|Effectiveness of Recycling Promotion and Education Initiatives among First-Generation Ethnic Minorities in Ontario, Canada|This study examines how first-generation ethnic minorities respond to different types of recycling promotion and education campaigns (P&E) used by municipalities in Ontario, Canada. A total of eight focus group sessions were conducted over an eight-week period to gauge participant attitudes and responses towards print (newspaper and signs) and electronic (websites) P&E messaging. Participants were asked to comment on message “recognition”, “clarity”, “the ability to increase recycling awareness” and “the ability to affect changes in recycling behavior”. Results from the focus group sessions suggest that none of the P&E mediums tested were able to increase recycling awareness or change recycling behavior in any meaningful way. First-generation ethnic minorities struggle with recognizing the central theme and purpose of P&E advertisements. Respondents also found existing campaigns excessively complex and confusing, and were not familiar with many of the terms and symbols used in existing P&E messaging. Other findings suggest that ethnic minorities are skeptical and distrustful of the municipalities’ intentions with respect to what they do with the waste after it is collected. The findings from this study lead to the recommendation that municipalities rethink and redesign recycling promotion and education initiatives to better engage minority communities.
Z00|The Effects of Religion on Enduring Marriages|This article adds to recent literature in the study of religion and marriage by examining older couples’ use of religion as a cultural repertoire in enduring marriages. The study includes qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with 43 married, Christian couples. Couples reported four predominant social contexts that gave sacred meanings to their marriage: prayer, worship services and sermons, first-rite rituals and communion. These social contexts magnify sacred meanings within religious cultural repertoires by enhancing older couples’ perceptions of their marriages as sacred through formal and public recognition of their marriage longevity, lauding their marriage longevity as a blessing from God to be emulated, promoting religious meanings of familism and giving positive marriage outcomes sacred meanings. Negative effects of religion on marriage outcomes occurred among older couples when lived experiences of religion conflicted with their cultural expectations for enduring marriages.
Z00|Validity and Reliability of the Problem Solving Inventory (PSI) in a Nationwide Sample of Greek Educators|The Problem Solving Inventory (PSI) is designed to measure adults’ perceptions of problem-solving ability. The presented study aimed to translate it and assess its reliability and validity in a nationwide sample of 3668 Greek educators. In order to evaluate internal consistency reliability, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was used. The scale’s construct validity was examined by a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and by investigating its correlation with the Internality, Powerful others and Chance Multidimensional Locus of Control Scale (IPC LOC Scale), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and demographic information. Internal consistency reliability was satisfactory with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from 0.79 to 0.91 for all PSI scales. CFA confirmed that the bi-level model fitted the data well. The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the comparative fit index (CFI) and the goodness of fit index (GFI) values were 0.030, 0.97 and 0.96, respectively, further confirming the bi-level model and the three-factors construct of the PSI. Intercorrelations and correlation coefficients between the PSI, the IPC LOC Scale and the RSES were significant. Age, sex, and working experience differences were found. In conclusion, the Greek version of the PSI was found to have satisfactory psychometric properties and therefore, it can be used to evaluate Greek teachers’ perceptions of their problem-solving skills.
Z00|The Impact of Sanctions and Neo-Liberalism on Women’s Organising in Iran|As in the case of many contemporary movements, Iranian women’s activism is connected into local, international and transnational politics. However, Iranian women’s views of transnational solidarity and perceptions of foreign support for women’s rights in Iran are complicated by the experience of Western foreign policy of the last three decades. This is perceived to have claimed to support women’s rights and liberalism against what is often described as a “conservative theocratic state” but has, in some ways, made it more difficult for women to organise “on the ground” and strengthened the hand of conservative forces both materially and ideologically. Two facets of Western foreign policy towards Iran will be discussed and analysed in relation to their impact on women; firstly, this article will investigate the impact of sanctions and the international isolation of the country since 1979 on women’s organisations. Secondly, it will analyse neo-liberalism and the changing nature of the Iranian state, as well as political elites. Utilising interviews with Iranian women activists conducted in 2009, in addition to April 2015, the article will discuss views of transnational solidarity and the diverse political strategies utilised by women activists and organisations in Iran today.
Z00|Do Robots Need to Be Stereotyped? Technical Characteristics as a Moderator of Gender Stereotyping|As suggested by previous results, whether, when designing robots, we should make use of social stereotypes and thus perpetuate them is question of present concern. The aim of this study was the identification of the specific conditions under which people’s judgments of robots were no longer guided by stereotypes. The study participants were 121 individuals between 18 and 69 years of age. We used an experimental design and manipulated the gender and strength of robots, and we measured the perception of how a robot could be used in automotive mechanics for light and heavy tasks. Results show that the technical characteristics of robots helped to anchor people’s judgments on robots’ intrinsic characteristics rather than on stereotypical indicators. Thus, stereotype perpetuation does not seem to be the sole option when designing robots.
Z00|Converging Urban Agendas: Toward Healthy and Sustainable Communities|In light of recent developments such as the COP21 Paris climate agreement, the UN adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals for 2030, and the Habitat III Conference, there is increasing recognition of the role of human settlements as key components of both global challenges and global solutions. “Urban sustainability” under various names has matured over the last three decades not only in planning and related fields, but also in wider professional and popular discourse. In this paper we trace a historical overview of urban sustainability theory and practice, and explain why urban sustainability planning and development currently face limited and inconsistent application. We show that this lack of public uptake is due in part to monitoring, assessment, and decision-support frameworks and tools that do not engage citizens and their governments in a shared “strong sustainability” analysis and/or vision. We argue that urban sustainability today clearly needs to embrace equity, inclusion, and other social considerations; contribute to constructive societal mobilisation and compelling policy-making; advocate for development as a better alternative to growth; encourage the integration of human and environmental health interests; and encompass triple-bottom-line-inspired outcomes. Focusing on community capital productivity and regeneration may be the key to advancing healthy and sustainable communities.
Z00|Method in the Madness: Hysteria and the Will to Power|At the very start of a chapter on hysteria in her book From Mastery to Analysis: Theories of Gender in Psychoanalytic Feminism , Patricia Elliot cites Nietzsche’s “truths are illusions of which one has forgotten that they are illusions”. This paper follows this connection between hysteria and the work of Nietzsche. This paper will highlight how a Lacanian interpretation of hysteria can elucidate Heidegger’s reading of Nietzsche’s Will to Power and how this interpretation of the Will to Power can better explain the value and importance of hysteria for psychoanalysis and philosophy. I will show that the hysteric’s discourse has a “higher value” than the master’s discourse because it meets Nietzsche’s definition of art, which aims at life’s enhancement rather than the master’s knowledge or truth which aims at the preservation of life. My work will explain how the hysteric’s discourse can transform the master’s discourse into the analyst’s discourse through the Will to Power. This is important, as this is the ultimate aim of psychoanalysis where “At the end of analysis the subject passes to the position of analyst”. This is the ultimate aim of psychoanalysis because “For Lacan, the Discourse of the Analyst is revolutionary because it articulates the truth of the (unconscious) subject”. Fundamentally, the objective of this article is to demonstrate that “hysteria is to be understood not as an ‘abnormal’ condition but as one possible manifestation of the subject’s uncanny relationship to itself”.
Z00|In Pursuit of Child and Family Well-Being: Initial Steps to Advocacy|Communities across the United States, in both urban and rural areas, are seeking ways to promote well-being for their citizens in sustainable ways. This paper provides a descriptive case study of one rural community that used an inquiry-based approach to ask, “How can we engage our citizens to improve child and family well-being in our community?” The group also wondered “What if Brookings had one place for families to access all family resources that support well-being?” “What if all families had a place where their needs were heard?” and “What if all resources for families looked at the well-being of children and families in a holistic way?” This paper describes the initial journey of a community of practice advocating on several different community levels, including the role of university students, the process of the community of practice formation, its growing connections to community agencies and its initial efforts to build calls to action through participatory research and grassroots community efforts. While conveying a linear narrative, the authors also maintain a focus on the organic processes of knowledge construction and the evolution of a community of practice. Data collection, using the Delphi approach, is underway to access initial ground-up definitions of well-being and to identify areas of focus.
Z00|Worksheet for Describing and Categorizing a Genocidal Event: A New Tool for Assembling More Objective Data and Classifying Events of Mass Killing|A new tool is presented for facilitating greater objectivity in the chaotic field of genocide studies: first, assembling the available factual data about any event of mass murder systematically; second, contextualizing each of our judgments of the nature of the crime as a choice being made by a given scholar or institution (e.g., a specific court), but not as “God’s word.” The Worksheet for Describing and Categorizing a Genocidal Event is believed to be innovative in several ways: (1) This model presents researchers with a methodology for developing systematic, extensive and objective information about many different aspects of an event of mass killing; (2) Emphasis is placed on identifying each researcher’s guiding concept of genocide; (3) The proposed methodology purposely postpones any effort at classification—including whether an event constitutes “genocide”—until after factual data have been assembled; (4) Categorization of an event is also to be understood as an act of judgment by each researcher, not as scientifically established truth; (5) It is also to be understood that classification in the language of social sciences is different than legal classifications that in turn also are to be understood as based on whatever specific code of law.
Z00|Population Growth, Migration, and Changes in the Racial Differential in Imprisonment in the United States, 1940–1980|The proportion of U.S. prison inmates who were black increased dramatically between 1940 and 2000. While about two-thirds of the increase occurred between 1940 and 1970, most recent research analyzes the period after 1970, focusing on explanations such as the war on drugs, law-and-order politics, discrimination, inequality, and racial threat. We analyze the growth in the racial difference in incarceration between 1940 and 1980, focusing on the role of demographic processes, particularly population growth, migration, and urbanization. We implement three analyses to assess the role of these demographic processes: (1) a simple accounting model that decomposes the national trend into population growth, changes in arrests, and changes in sentencing; (2) a model of state variation in incarceration that decomposes the racial difference in incarceration into population change, migration between states with different incarceration rates, and other processes; and (3) race-specific models of within-state variation in incarceration rates using state characteristics coupled with a decomposition of the role of changes in state characteristics.
Z00|Who Wants Income Inequality?: An Analysis of Public Choice under Income Comparison|This study investigates when individuals from advantaged and disadvantaged groups are in favor of reducing income inequality. Using a model that considers both an individual’s absolute income and relative income, I examine the conditions under which income equalization is supported by some members in the advantaged group and, more interestingly, opposed by part of the disadvantaged group. In equilibrium, the valuation towards relative income, the initial endowment the difference between the two groups and the amount of income transfer upon equalization have opposite effects on different groups’ likelihood of favoring equalization. To this end, I conduct a comparative statics analysis, and the results suggest that in order to incentivize more individuals to support inter-group income transfer, a policymaker’s optimal strategy substantially depends on how much the society values relative income.
Z00|Trans* + ing Classrooms: The Pedagogy of Refusal as Mediator for Learning|Gender and sexuality norms, conscribed under cis/heteropatriarchy, have established violent and unstable social and educational climates for the millennial generation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, agender/asexual, gender creative, and questioning youth. While strides have been made to make schools more supportive and queer inclusive, schools still struggle to include lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender* + , intersex, agender/asexual, gender creative, queer and questioning (LGBT* + IAGCQQ)-positive curricula. While extensive studies must be done on behalf of all queer youth, this work specifically focuses on how to support classroom teachers to uptake and apply a pedagogy of refusal that attends to the most vulnerabilized population of queer youth to date, those that are trans* + . A pedagogy of refusal will be explored through an evolving theory of trans* + ness, then demonstrated through a framework for classroom application, followed by recommendations for change.
Z00|Misalignment of Career and Educational Aspirations in Middle School: Differences across Race, Ethnicity, and Socioeconomic Status|Misalignment of educational and career goals (i.e., educational aspirations expressed are inadequate for attaining one’s desired occupation) is associated with lower educational attainment and a lack of college readiness, and may contribute to persistent educational and employment disparities. Drawing on data from 249 sixth graders in low-income schools, this research examines misalignment between educational and career aspirations across racial and ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Findings indicate that students in low-income schools aspire to middle and upper middle class careers, but sometimes lack an understanding of the educational degrees required to achieve their goals. Latinos are significantly more likely than other groups to report misaligned aspirations, as are students in the free and reduced lunch program and those without a college-educated parent. Consequently, early gaps in misaligned career and educational goals for disadvantaged students may set them on a trajectory that perpetuates educational and occupational inequalities in this population. We discuss the programmatic implications of these findings in light of the elevated college and career planning needs of students traditionally underrepresented in higher education.
Z00|“I Collected Money, not a Bribe”: Strategic Ambiguity and the Dynamics of Corruption in Contemporary Nigeria|This article explores the language of corruption in Nigeria. It uses Eisenberg’s Strategic Ambiguity concept to examine the extent to which Nigerian legislators and those who occupy the executive arm of the government employ ambiguous languages and actions to execute and defend corrupt practices, and how this institutionalizes the culture of corruption in contemporary Nigeria. The article further explores how ambiguous light punishment, outright non-punishment, state pardon of corrupt elites and the reward of corrupt elites with sensitive government appointments engender corruption in Nigeria. The article argues that while the elites engage in diverse corrupt practices and employ ambiguous words to defend their acts, the judiciary appears to defend rather than punish them. The paper discusses the implications of these findings, concluding that the war against corruption in Nigeria may not be effective, because as those who appear to be fighting corruption are themselves corrupt, the frameworks with which corruption is fought are strategically manipulated by the elites.
Z00|Domestic Violence against Albanian Immigrant Women in Greece: Facing Patriarchy|Immigration is becoming an increasingly important policy concern in Europe and in many other nations. Importantly, there is an ever-growing number of women who migrate, many of whom are undocumented. Violence against immigrant women is nearly impossible to estimate. However, immigrant women who are abused face multiple barriers to seeking legal protection from the abuse as a result of their migration status, their positions within family and the host country. This paper examines the issues related to intimate partner violence within the Albanian immigrant community in Greece. It explores how the situation in Greek society and the labor market (such as social policies, xenophobic attitudes, job segregation and the prevailing economic crisis) changed the traditional gender roles and distribution of the power within Albanian families and increased intimate partner violence (IPV). The study found evidence of an increase in IPV in the aftermath of the economic crisis, which could be explained by the ideology of familial patriarchy. Battered immigrant women also face challenges in the Greek criminal justice system, which is also influenced by patriarchal values, when they are seeking relief and assistance in cases of interpersonal violence.
Z00|Safety on Passenger Ferries from Catering Staff’s Perspective|The majority of employees on passenger ferries consist of the catering staff: those who operate in restaurants, shops, and in the hotel on board. Research on this category is scant. The aim of this study is to investigate the catering staff’s experiences and perceptions of safety practice on board passenger ferries. The methods are semi-structured interviews and a qualitative content analysis of official documents and research articles. Results: Increased safety regulations and directives on an international and a national level have taken place after the major ferry disasters of late 1990s. Changes in the safety organization on the passenger ferries have resulted in more involvement of the catering crew in safety on board. Safety awareness and the way the catering staff think about safety have improved. The risk of terrorism has further reinforced safety awareness. A clear challenge for safety work on ferries is the reduction of catering crew. The transition to job flexibility for catering crew may constitute risk factors regarding safety and security.
Z00|Strategies for Combating Islamic State|The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) announced the formation of the “Islamic Caliphate” as an alternative to modern states, on 29 June 2014 (the first day of Ramadan). The ISIS vision shared by other global jihadist organizations such as al-Qaeda is an apocalyptic post-state. Many authors very quickly evolve from the idea of the potential threat to either the U.S. or its allies to a requisite necessity of strong military action by the U.S. to defeat ISIS. Something frequently absent in analyses of U.S. reactions to ISIS is the capabilities, responsibilities, and opinions and desires of neighboring Gulf countries. This paper will incorporate attitudes and opinions of Gulf countries to imply responsibilities to deal with ISIS prior to considering potential U.S. actions.
Z00|Engaging Citizen Participation—A Result of Trusting Governmental Institutions and Politicians in the Portuguese Democracy|Public participation is a mainstay of democracy. However, the ways in which it can be understood inevitably influence the achievement of the goals that preside over any public policy. Literature argues that the drawbacks of citizen participation are directly related to the level of trust in governmental institutions and in politicians. The present study was carried out on a sample of 250 individuals and aimed to (1) describe citizens’ opinions and trust in politicians and government institutions; and (2) demonstrate that healthy levels of citizen engagement in politics may be upheld as long as citizens trust their political institutions and leaders, through a case study of Portugal’s democratic system. The current study found no statistically significant association between political participation and the study participant’s perception that government representatives heard ( p = 0.769) or considered ( p = 0.810) their opinions. Similarities were found between the participants’ assessments of the quality of life brought about by the decisions of those in power and the levels of citizen participation around land planning and land management ( p = 0.011). Also, citizen assessments of life quality were influenced by their understanding of political decisions ( p = 0.014). Effective communication between citizens and politicians will allow both to better understand the aims of political policy. When citizens believe that politicians are honest, show moral leadership and demonstrate integrity, and that these values are upheld by public institutions, a common aspiration can be realized: improving the quality of life.
Z00|Piracy and the Politics of Social Media|Since the 1990s, the understanding of how and where politics are made has changed radically. Scholars such as Ulrich Beck and Maria Bakardjieva have discussed how political agency is enacted outside of conventional party organizations, and political struggles increasingly focus on single issues. Over the past two decades, this transformation of politics has become common knowledge, not only in academic research but also in the general political discourse. Recently, the proliferation of digital activism and the political use of social media are often understood to enforce these tendencies. This article analyzes the Pirate Party in relation to these theories, relying on almost 30 interviews with active Pirate Party members from different parts of the world. The Pirate Party was initially formed in 2006, focusing on copyright, piracy, and digital privacy. Over the years, it has developed into a more general democracy movement, with an interest in a wider range of issues. This article analyzes how the party’s initial focus on information politics and social media connects to a wider range of political issues and to other social movements, such as Arab Spring protests and Occupy Wall Street. Finally, it discusses how this challenges the understanding of information politics as a single issue agenda.
Z00|The Death of Democracy and the Forces of Power and Control: The Case of Europe|At the time of writing, the United Kingdom is grabbling with its decision to abandon its European Union membership. As the country is divided and hate incidents are increased by almost 50%, this think-piece presents a critical analysis of Europe’s missed opportunity for social justice. The paper presents evidence by analysing the civil and political rights jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights in order to explore the potential of what it calls the “human rights project” for a regional democracy. The paper shows that a key objective of the European Convention of Human Rights was the development of case law that would construct a regional democracy for bringing consistency in the enjoyment of civil and political rights across the continent. This “human rights project” was well underway, but is now hampered by contemporary forces of power and control that are ridiculing the work and status of the Council of Europe. The paper identifies three levers that move these forces, namely: financial and security terror as well as nationalism. The paper warns that if these forces are not managed, the backlash in social justice will continue while the human rights project for a regional democracy will come to its demise.
Z00|Researching and Working for Transgender Youth: Contexts, Problems and Solutions|In May 2016, two events epitomized the complexities of working for global transgender youth rights. First, United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) hosted a ministerial event in which education ministers from around the world released a call to action for protection of students on the basis of their gender identity and expression in schools. Second, the United Nations (UN) hosted an event celebrating the family, attended by conservative ministers and activists who mobilized family protectionist discourse against transgender students. This article contemplates, in light of transgender activist Raewyn Connell’s Southern Theory contributions, the complexity of global research and work for transgender youth. It considers key informant interviews with 50 stakeholders in the global push for transgender student rights in education, including members of government and non-government organisations, and academics from Northern and Southern countries. Problems in aiding transgender youth at the global level included safety concerns, the impacts of conservative advocates and media backlash (within family and national protectionist discourses), cultural complexities hampering engagement and translation, dissemination hindrances pertaining to established publishing biases, and financial and collaboration barriers. Solutions including virtual work; multi-level leadership; alliance-building; representation; visibility of transgender youth citizenship and family membership; and legal, financial and capacity-building aid are considered.

Z00|The Importance of National Ethos in Military Victories|When nations are violently threatened, the choices that they make in order to cope with the challenge of war reflect different alternative possible reactions. They may choose to fiercely fight their battles; they may prefer to surrender, and sometimes the options lay in-between. One puzzle is, therefore, what makes nations fight, and more importantly—what causes them eventually to win or to lose the war. In search for an answer, this study inquires through secondary sources three historical case studies from World War II: Britain, France and Germany, and reviews how each of these major European powers acted throughout the war. After each historical description, the study examines the part that national ethos played in the manner in which each state handled war in moments of crisis. The national ethos of a people is the creed formed from the shared values and traditions through which the nation views its past, present and future; it is the integrating element that defines a nation’s identity and bonds it into a coherent social group. The study reveals how national ethos is intertwined with another phenomenon of social psychology that turns it into a crucial factor in the management of international campaigns: war enthusiasm. Since national ethos is so crucial for the results of the war that a country might lead in order to survive or prosper, it is imperative for decision makers to bear in mind that it is also subject to a process of shaping and reshaping, as the Soviets have proved in relation to their Russian national ethos during World War II. A word of caution, however, is noteworthy: a wide historical perspective shows that even though the right kind of national ethos is essential for winning a war it is far from being enough. Hence national ethos proves, at the end of the day, to be a necessary condition for military victory but certainly not a sufficient one.
Z00|Reconfiguring the Contours of Statehood and the Rights of Peoples of Disappearing States in the Age of Global Climate Change|Many of the elements that have traditionally supported state level normative self-organization, most notably territory, are being actively undermined by rising sea levels, flooding, desertification, amongst other climate change effects. As more and more states come to be redefined as “disappearing”, that is, states losing their territories to the natural environment through no specific fault of their own, a question arises as to how displaced communities will be assisted in their desire (and right) to continue to practice principles of self-determination and self-government? What is clear is that the international community can no longer continue with the fiction of a unified or unchanging model of the liberal democratic state. Instead, alternative ontological models of sovereign community are required, as is a re-imagining of how statehood might be re-constituted in the future in response to deepening ecological problems. The international community must now begin to address the immanent nature of threats posed to disappearing states and consider how a model of statehood that does not privilege territory as a fixed component of state identity could be operationalized. This paper considers how a democratic reform of statehood might proceed and resettlement agreements for displaced communities determined. The transition to an era of peaceful sovereign relations under deteriorating global climate conditions and growing natural resource scarcity, it argues, will require a significant extension of established traditions of democratic compromise, human rights solidarity and cosmopolitan justice.
Z00|Income Sharing within Households: Evidence from Data on Financial Satisfaction|This paper contributes to the understanding of gender aspects in the intra-household sharing of income. I estimate models of differences in financial satisfaction between household partners using panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, which allows one to account for household-level fixed effects. The paper adds to the literature a further convincing rejection of the equal sharing hypothesis. What is more and novel, the results imply that unequal income sharing is asymmetric and triggered by the relative employment statuses of the partners: in male breadwinner households, the women’s well-being is affected by the distribution factor; in double full-time couples, it is the man’s well-being.
Z00|State-Society Relations in Ethiopia: A Political-Economy Perspective of the Post-1991 Order|This article analyses state-society relations in Ethiopia with particular emphasis on the post-1991 period. The objective of the study is to identify and analyse the fundamental factors of state-society relations at the national level: property rights, political representation, and the urban-rural elite cleavage. The article views state-society relations at the local level with reference to perception and practice, taking into account symbols, social control, ability to make decisions and control over the means of violence. The study was conducted in eight purposively selected localities in three administrative regions in Ethiopia. The empirical data was collected at national and local levels using key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and a household survey. The analysis shows that state-society relations in Ethiopia are driven by three major factors: property rights, political representations and the urban-rural divide.
Z00|Did the Great Recession Downsize Immigrants and Native-Born Americans Differently? Unemployment Differentials by Nativity, Race and Gender from 2007 to 2013 in the U.S|We use data from the Current Population Survey from 2007 and 2013 to investigate demographic differentials in unemployment during the Great Recession in the U.S. Although our analysis is primarily exploratory and descriptive, our major research objective is to illuminate the unemployment differential between the foreign born and the native born. The findings indicate that during the height of the Great Recession, the foreign born had higher unemployment rates than the native born. However, this differential is statistically explained by their observed characteristics, such as race/ethnicity, gender, age and education. With the net of those variables and a few other demographic covariates, foreign born workers as an overall group actually had somewhat lower chances of being unemployed than native born workers. This finding is discussed in terms of the selectivity of immigrant workers and the possibility that they are somewhat more immediately dependent on having a job. After breaking down the foreign born into major racial/ethnic groups, the results suggest that foreign-born blacks and foreign-born Hispanics are particularly selective with the net of their observed characteristics. The possible sources of such differentials by race/ethnicity and by gender are discussed.
Z00|18 Million Cracks, but No Cigar: News Media and the Campaigns of Clinton, Palin, and Bachmann|Decades of research within political science, political communication, and mass media found pervasive gender biased media coverage of female political candidates. However, recent research suggests that gender stereotypes do not have a consistent effect in all campaign environments and when gender stereotypes are not activated, female candidates are not disadvantaged. As a result, if we see a reduction in reliance on gender stereotypes in the media, female candidates should enjoy a more level playing field. In this analysis, we focus on mass media’s coverage of female candidates in elite executive political races. This study conducts a content analysis of media coverage of three recent women candidates for the United States’ highest executive offices: Senator Hillary Clinton, Congresswoman Michelle Bachmann, and Governor Sarah Palin. Our analysis of newspapers and television news coverage confirms the media do not discuss female and male candidates in neutral terms, but instead fall back onto traditional gender stereotypes and emphasize female candidates’ physical appearances and family roles far more frequently than they do for male candidates. This may, in turn, prime gender stereotypes in voters, impair candidates’ fundraising ability, and limit the electoral ambition of future generations of female candidates.
Z00|Approaches to Sampling Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex with Men from Geosocial-Networking Smartphone Applications: A Methodological Note|Geosocial-networking smartphone applications utilize global positioning system (GPS) technologies to connect users based on their physical proximity. Many gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) have smartphones, and these new mobile technologies have generated quicker and easier modes for MSM to meet potential partners. In doing so, these technologies may facilitate a user’s ability to have multiple concurrent partners, thereby increasing their risk for acquiring HIV or other sexually transmitted infections. Researchers have sought to recruit users of these applications (e.g., Grindr, Jack’d, Scruff) into HIV prevention studies, primarily through advertising on the application. Given that these advertisements often broadly targeted large urban areas, these approaches have generated samples that are not representative of the population of users of the given application in a given area. As such, we propose a method to generate a spatially representative sample of MSM via direct messaging on a given application using New York City and its geography as an example of this sampling and recruitment method. These methods can increase geographic representativeness and wider access to MSM who use geosocial-networking smartphone applications.
Z00|“Religious Freedom” as a Tool to Oppress: The Explosion in Religion-Based Attacks on Civil Rights in Litigation|Over the last half-decade, there has been an explosion in the United States of lawsuits in which claims to religious liberty have been used to justify abridging the civil rights of women, LGBTQ people, and other minorities. This article surveys such litigation in several areas: health-insurance coverage, healthcare services, marriage-related services, employment, and housing. For each area, the article analyzes recent litigation, compares it to earlier activity (if any), and discusses the kinds of arguments that have been made, how courts have responded to them, and how such arguments are likely to fare in the future. The article concludes that the ultimate fate of many of these kinds of cases will likely be determined by who the next member is of a U.S. Supreme Court that is currently split four-four between social liberals and conservatives.
Z00|Prescribing under the Influence: The Business of Breastmilk Substitutes|This study draws on a general theoretical framework comprising of a decision maker (a doctor), perceived moral intensity of the issue (breastfeeding substitute prescription), and the situational environment (hospital policy, pharma company promotions, and mother’s beliefs regarding breastfeeding) to explain the physician’s role and influence on mothers’ infant feeding choices when prescribing infant formula in Kuwait, Middle East. Moral intensity is an issue-contingent model that suggests ethical decisions vary in terms of how much a moral imperative is present in a situation. The moral intensity of the issue is assessed using six components. Path Least Squares results indicate the following moral intensity components have significant impact on prescription behavior: magnitude of consequences, probability of effect, and temporal immediacy. Company promotion and hospital policy also significantly influence doctor’s prescription of infant formula. Doctors appear to disengage from the consequences of over prescribing infant formula.
Z00|Dispositional Immobility: An Analysis of Non-Decisions as Public Policy in Alberta’s City-Regions|For local governments in city-regions, the term “dispositional immobility” can be applied in situations where the question of municipal restructuring becomes an arena for permanent public policy non-decisions. Disposition is here used to mean both the inherent qualities of persons and communities, and the arrangement of the structures within an area. It is argued that administrative stasis results as dispositional immobility creates tactical political barriers to innovation, and policy inaction becomes a deliberate response. In Alberta, city-regions since the 1950s have preserved multiple autonomous municipalities rather than initiating centripetal reforms as is the case elsewhere in Canada. An analysis of the province and its leadership during the past half-century suggests reasons for this entrenched dispositional immobility within the institutional culture of Alberta’s city-regions. Our conclusion suggests that the time has come to rethink and challenge the long-standing and unquestioned continuation of the city-regional structural status quo.
Z00|Children’s Civic Engagement in the Scratch Online Community|In public discourse, and in the governance of online communities, young people are often denied agency. Children are frequently considered objects to protect, safeguard, and manage. Yet as children go online from very early ages, they develop emergent forms of civic and political engagement. Children appropriate the affordances of digital platforms in order to discuss, connect, and act with their peers and in their communities. In this paper, we analyze civic engagement in Scratch Online, a creative community where children from around the world learn programming by designing and sharing interactive media projects. We explore the ways that young Scratch community members connect with issues of global importance, as well as with local topics and questions of community governance. We develop a typology of the strategies they use to express themselves, engage with their peers, and call for action. We then analyze the reaction of the community, including other Scratch members and adult moderators, and draw key lessons from these examples in order to describe guidelines for educators and designers who would like to support children’s rights to civic engagement in online learning environments.
Z00|Boomers versus Millennials: Online Media Influence on Media Performance and Candidate Evaluations|Facebook posts, YouTube videos, tweets and wooing political bloggers have become standard practice in marketing political campaigns. Research has demonstrated the effect of new media on a host of politically-related behavior, including political participation, knowledge acquisition, group formation and self-efficacy. Yet, issues related to media trust, media performance and candidate evaluations have not been fully explored. In addition, much of the political marketing research looks exclusively at the Millennial age cohort, ignoring other age groups, particularly Baby Boomers. This case study addresses whether attention to traditional (i.e., television, hard-copy newspapers and radio) and online media sources (i.e., political candidate websites, television network websites, online newspapers, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr and political blogs) about the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign influences Millennials and Baby Boomers’ media trust and performance ratings, as well as candidate evaluations. Panel surveys were completed by both age cohorts, Millennials ( n = 431) and Baby Boomers ( n = 360), during the last two weeks of the presidential election. Findings indicate that traditional sources, specifically television, rather than online sources are significantly linked to media trust and performance ratings among both Boomers and Millennials. Attention to traditional media for campaign information predicts Boomers’ candidate evaluations, whereas Millennials’ candidate evaluations are influenced by online sources, such as Facebook and candidate websites.
Z00|War Trauma, Politics of Recognition and Purple Heart: PTSD or PTSI?|This paper discusses the exclusion of veterans with combat PTSD (CPTSD) from eligibility for the Purple Heart (PH). The main argument is that this exclusion is unjustified and that it strengthens the stigma attached to the traumatized veterans, with detrimental implications to their wellbeing. In the context of the politics of recognition, the history of the term PTSD, and with support evidence from brain studies, the paper contends that in the case of combat veterans, posttraumatic stress should be termed PTSI (posttraumatic stress injury) rather than PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder). The proposed alteration in terminology may enable eligibility of posttraumatic combat veterans’ for the Purple Heart, and consequently mitigate the stigma of their wounds, help to deconstruct their misrecognition as inferior to physiologically wounded, increase their willingness to seek aid, and improve their chances to heal.
Z00|Support for Protests in Latin America: Classifications and the Role of Online Networking|In recent years, Latin Americans marched the streets in a wave of protests that swept almost every country in the region. Yet few studies have assessed how Latin Americans support various forms of protest, and how new technologies affect attitudes toward protest tactics. Using data from the Latin American Public Opinion Project (N = 37,102), cluster analyses grouped citizens into four distinct groups depending on their support for protests. Most Latin Americans support moderate forms of protest, rejecting more radical tactics. Online networking is associated with support for both moderate and radical protests. But those who support only moderate protests use online networking sites more than Latin Americans as a whole, while those who support radical protests use online networking sites significantly less. Our findings suggest that only peaceful and legal demonstrations have been normalized in the region, and online networking foments support for moderate protest tactics.
Z00|Just Not Like Us: The Interactive Impact of Dimensions of Identity and Race in Attitudes towards Immigration|Since 2009, more Mexicans have been leaving rather than coming to the USA; likewise, illegal immigration from Mexico has declined. Yet, immigration remains a hotly contested issue in the 2016 presidential election, with a seemingly marked increase in anti-immigrant policy and rhetoric, much of which is directed at immigrants from Mexico. In this paper, we seek to explain how individual ethnocultural and civic-based conceptions of what it means to be an American influence attitudes towards immigration. Past theoretical research on national identity has framed the effects of these dimensions as interactive but past empirical work has yet to demonstrate an important interaction between race and ethnocultural identity. Failure to account for these interaction effects has led to inaccurate assumptions about the levels of hostility towards immigrants and how widespread anti-immigrant sentiment really is. We demonstrate a clear interactive effect between identification as white and ethnocultural dimensions of identity and show that this effect has masked the root of the most ardent anti-immigrant sentiment. We also show that while there is a sizeable minority of the population that identifies as both white and have high levels of ethnocultural identity, a majority of Americans prefer to keep immigration levels at the status quo and have an identity that is balanced between ethnoculturalism and civic-based conceptions of identity.
Z00|Azerbaijani Women, Online Mediatized Activism and Offline Mass Mobilization|Despite its post-Soviet history, Azerbaijan is an under-investigated country in academic research—compared with the other former constituencies, such as the Baltic countries or Russia, of the USSR—and gender questions of the contemporary Azerbaijani society are even less touched on. Within the current context of the post-“Arab Spring” era of mediatized connectivity and collective political engagement, this article looks into and analyzes how Azerbaijani women participate in different online and offline social and political movements, and if (and how) they are impeded by the increased state authoritarianism in Azerbaijan. Using data, obtained from online information resources, yearly reports of human rights organizations, focus group discussions, and interviews, the study detects four major activist constellations within the Azerbaijani field of gendered politics. Based on the analysis of conditions of detected groups, the article claims that flash mobs, a tactic employed mainly by liberal activists, emerge as the promising way in overcoming the normative nature of Azerbaijani patriarchal society, thus providing an opportunity for normalization and internalization of the feeling of being on the street and acting in concert with others—the practices which might lead towards an increasing participation of (especially young) women in the political processes of the country.
Z00|Banishment in Public Housing: Testing an Evolution of Broken Windows|Banishment policies grant police the authority to formally ban individuals from entering public housing and arrest them for trespassing if they violate the ban. Despite its widespread use and the social consequences resulting from it, an empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of banishment has not been performed. Understanding banishment enforcement is an evolution of broken windows policing, this study explores how effective bans are at reducing crime in public housing. We analyze crime data, spanning the years 2001–2012, from six public housing communities and 13 surrounding communities in one southeastern U.S. city. Using Arellano-Bond dynamic panel models, we investigate whether or not issuing bans predicts reductions in property and violent crimes as well as increases in drug and trespass arrests in public housing. We find that this brand of broken windows policing does reduce crime, albeit relatively small reductions and only for property crime, while resulting in an increase in trespass arrests. Given our findings that these policies have only a modest impact on property crime, yet produce relatively larger increases in arrests for minor offenses in communities of color, and ultimately have no significant impact on violent crime, it will be important for police, communities, and policy makers to discuss whether the returns are worth the potential costs.
Z00|40 Is the New 65? Older Adults and Niche Targeting Strategies in the Online Dating Industry|Niche dating sites have become a popular trend in the online dating industry; yet, little is known about the specialization strategies these sites use to cater to their users’ needs. Moreover, previous research alludes to the idea that many of these sites may be engaging in pseudo-individualization —a deceptive technique that creates an illusion of specialization. This study focuses on niche dating sites for older adults, one of the fastest growing niches in online dating. Through a qualitative content analysis and close reading of older-adult dating sites, I seek to determine how and to what extent online dating sites that target older adults actually customize their services to benefit this population. Three key findings emerge: (1) the use of mass segmentation, a strategy that combines elements of both mass marketing and market segmentation; (2) a strategic broadening of the boundaries of the older-adult niche; and (3) the use of deceptive advertising to attract users. These findings suggest that older-adult dating sites are, in fact, engaging in pseudo-individualization. They also highlight some of the unique aspects of online media that facilitate this practice. Implications for both online daters and site producers are discussed.
Z00|Turning Points in the Lives of Chinese and Indian Women Leaders Working toward Social Justice|Institutional change has a human face. This paper explores how a select group of women in China and India experienced economic and political turmoil and why they chose to become change agents. Through in-depth interviews with 40 women from NGOs, government agencies and private business, four broad moments in the evolution of a change agent are identified and discussed: (1) awareness of a double-bind; (2) reframing the tension induced by that double-bind; (3) becoming an agent of change; and (4) building a vibrant network. To highlight these key features, four women’s narratives are discussed in greater depth from recognizing injustice to taking a non-traditional stand. The paper concludes with a call for further comparative work on the role of personal narratives in shaping a movement for change.
Z00|Ascription, Achievement, and Perceived Equity of Educational Regimes: An Empirical Investigation|This article considers how countries differ in the opinions that citizens hold about the fairness of the social and educational system. From the literature, we derive a typology of four educational “regimes”, based on differences in educational system, labour market and welfare state design. We then use data from the ISSP (2009) to investigate how much weight respondents attribute to ascribed characteristics (e.g., being born in a wealthy family) and individual responsibility (e.g., working hard) to explain success in life or at school. We also examine how these judgments relate to the educational background of the respondents. We consider how these patterns correspond to the existing knowledge on social and economic inequality and what this means for the legitimacy of the social system.
Z00|Netflix and Engage? Implications for Streaming Television on Political Participation during the 2016 US Presidential Campaign|A large body of existing research has consistently demonstrated that the use of social networking sites (SNS) by citizens in elections is positively related to different forms of both offline and online participation. The opposite argument, however, is often advanced with regard to increased viewing broadcast or cable television, particularly entertainment programming. This study proceeds from this broad vantage point by examining survey-based indicators of active SNS use and conventional television viewing in the 2016 presidential primaries, as well as the frequency of streaming television viewing during the early stages of this campaign. Data for this study was drawn from a representative nationwide online panel, and findings observed here suggest that more personalized communication through the ongoing morphology of social networking sites and streaming both political and apolitical television content are significant factors in positively shaping both online and offline participation. Comparisons with other media including conventional television viewing are introduced, and theoretical implications from a media system dependency framework are discussed.
Z00|The New Eugenics: Black Hyper-Incarceration and Human Abatement|In the early twentieth century, the eugenics movement exercised considerable influence over domestic US public policy. Positive eugenics encouraged the reproduction of “fit” human specimens while negative eugenics attempted to reduce the reproduction of “unfit” specimens like the “feebleminded” and the criminal. Although eugenics became a taboo concept after World War II, it did not disappear. It was merely repackaged. Incarceration is no longer related to stated eugenic goals, yet incapacitation in prisons still exerts a prophylactic effect on human reproduction. Because minorities are incarcerated in disproportionately high numbers, the prophylactic effect of incarceration affects them most dramatically. In fact, for black males, the effect of hyper-incarceration might be so great as to depress overall reproduction rates. This article identifies some of the legal and extralegal variables that would be relevant for such an analysis and calls for such an investigation.
Z00|Postcolonial Reflection on the Christian Mission: The Case of North Korean Refugees in China and South Korea|The purpose of this paper is to challenge the dominant narrative of Christian service providers working for North Korean refugees’ welfare, and to articulate the perspectives of non-Christian aid recipients, especially North Korean refugees in China and South Korea. Drawing upon postcolonialism, I will unpack dysfunctions of Christian missions and ministries while relating them to anthropological insights and ethnographic research data. As a Christian scholar, I attempt to invite Christian leaders and field workers to engage in critical reflections on their goals, dispositions, and strategies in relating to the culturally, politically, and economically marginalized. This paper is aimed to offer opportunities for Christian missionaries to critique their colonial models and to reclaim their missions that decolonize both missionaries and the missionized.
Z00|Angry and Alone: Demographic Characteristics of Those Who Post to Online Comment Sections|The Internet and social media afford individuals the opportunity to post their thoughts instantaneously and largely without filters. While this has tremendous democratic potential, it also raises questions about the quality of the discourse these technological changes portend. Online comment sections may be a particularly unique form of communication within social media to investigate because of their ubiquitous and often anonymous nature. A longitudinal examination of Pew Center data over the course of 4 years suggests that there are demographic differences between people who post and those who do not post to online comment sections. Specifically, in 2008 and 2010 regression analysis demonstrates there is an increased likelihood of posting among men, the unmarried, and the unemployed. However, the 2012 data tells a different story and suggests the possibility that the nature of comment sections might be changing. The findings have important implications for understanding the character of online discourse as well as the vitriol undergirding the political attitudes of disaffected citizens.
Z00|Epistemic Communities, Human Rights, and the Global Diffusion of Legislation against the Organ Trade|Over the past several decades, over 100 countries have passed legislation banning commercial organ transplantation. What explains this rapid, global diffusion of laws? Based on qualitative data from in-depth interviews, historical analysis, and secondary sources, this paper explores the role played by the medical epistemic community and human rights in the global spread of laws against the organ trade. In addition to shaping, guiding, and influencing norms and approaches to transplantation, the epistemic community has been instrumental in the development of various resolutions, policy initiatives, recommended practices, statements, legislation, and model laws. Moreover, the epistemic community helped position the organ trade as an issue of societal and global importance, and it persistently encouraged states to undertake actions, such as implementing legislation, to combat the organ trade. Critically, the epistemic community’s efforts against the organ trade incorporated the concepts of human rights, integrity, and dignity, which had diffused globally and become institutionalized in the period after WWII.
Z00|Education Policy and Under-Five Survival in Uganda: Evidence from the Demographic and Health Surveys|This study seeks to examine the influence of mothers’ schooling accomplishments on child mortality outcomes by exploiting the exogenous variability in schooling prompted by the 1997 universal primary education (UPE) policy in Uganda. The UPE policy, which eliminated school fees for all primary school children, provides an ideal setting for investigating the causal effect of the subsequent burst in primary school enrollment on child mortality outcomes in Uganda. The analysis relies on data from three waves of the nationally representative Uganda Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2000/01, 2006, and 2011. To lessen the bias created by the endogenous nature of education, this study employs the mother’s age at UPE implementation as an instrumental variable in the two-stage least squares model. The empirical analysis shows that one-year spent in school translates to a 2.24 percentage point decline in under-five mortality as observed at survey date and a 1.58 percentage point reduction in infant mortality even after accounting for potential confounding variables. These upshots are weakly robust to a variety of sample sizes and different model specifications. Overall, the results suggest that increasing the primary schooling possibilities for women might contribute towards a reduction in child mortality in low-income countries with high child mortality rates.
Z00|In Their Own Words: The Health and Sexuality of Immigrant Women with Infibulation Living in Switzerland|Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a significant public health problem. It is estimated that around 14,700 women affected by FGM live in Switzerland, primarily among women with a history of migration. Our qualitative research investigated the sexual health of immigrant women living with FGM in Switzerland, describing their own perception of health, reproductive life and sexuality. We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with a group of eight immigrant women of sub-Saharan origin living in Switzerland with Type III FGM (infibulation). Seven of the women were from Somalia and one was from the Ivory Coast. All of the Somali women were mothers and married (two separated), and the Ivorian woman was a single mother. The women in our study reported a low level of sexual satisfaction and reproductive health. They affirmed their desire to improve, or at least change, their condition. Although they rarely talk with their husbands about sexual subject matter, they would like to include them more and improve dialogue. Specific socio-sexual management is recommended when caring for immigrant women living with FGM in order to respond to their specific health care needs. Multidisciplinary approaches may be able to offer more comprehensive health care, including facilitated communication to improve dialogue between women and health care professionals, and eventually between women and their husbands in discussing sexual subject matter.
Z00|Peer-Review Writing Workshops in College Courses: Students’ Perspectives about Online and Classroom Based Workshops|Peer-review workshops are commonly used in writing courses as a way for students to give their peers feedback as well as help their own writing. Most of the research on peer-review workshops focuses on workshops held in traditional in-person courses, with less research on peer-review workshops held online. Students in a freshman writing course experienced both a classroom based writing workshop and an online workshop and then took a survey about their experiences. The majority of the students preferred the online writing workshop because of the convenience of the workshop and being able to post anonymous reviews. Students whom preferred the traditional in-person writing workshop liked being able to talk with their peers about their papers. This research article focuses on the students’ responses and experiences with traditional and online peer-reviews.
Z00|“My Mom Says Some Girls Have Penises”: How Mothers of Gender-Diverse Youth Are Pushing Gender Ideology Forward (and How They’re Not)|Despite a rapid rise in the public visibility of parents who are choosing to support their transgender and gender-diverse children in recent years, little is yet known about how these parents challenge the regulatory forces of hegemonic gender through their parenting. Based on semi-structured in-depth interviews, this article offers a comparative analysis of the ways that two groups of mothers—gender-expansive and gender-subversive—with differing ideological understandings of gender diversity resist the transmission of hegemonic schemas as they work to affirm their child’s sense of self. Drawing on Ridgway’s concept of gender as a primary frame, I identify a range of strategies used by each group and assess the potential for and limitations to advancing progressive gender ideology through trans-affirming mothering. While both groups contribute in powerful ways to trans-positive, gender-inclusive change, they do so through distinct parenting approaches that vary in their potential to undermine dominant gender ideology. While both groups of mothers resist the transmission of hegemonic gender beliefs in their parenting, the tactics and rhetoric used by gender-subversive mothers pose a more direct threat to the gender order than do those of gender-expansive mothers.
Z00|Household Structure and Suburbia Residence in U.S. Metropolitan Areas: Evidence from the American Housing Survey|Suburbs have demographically diversified in terms of race, yet little research has been done on household structures in suburbs. Using the 2011 American Housing Survey and 2009–2013 American Community Survey, this study investigates the distributions of household structures in suburbia and central cities, and the relationship between household structures and residential attainment. The findings of this research include: (1) The distribution of household structures differs between suburbia and central cities. Married-couple households are the most common household type in both central cities and suburbs, but they are more likely to reside in suburbia than in central cities; (2) Household structure is a determinant of residential attainment and the relationship varies by race/ethnicity groups. Among Hispanics and Asians, multigenerational household structure is indicative of central city residence, but this association does not hold for whites and blacks. For multigenerational households, the odds of living in suburbia decreases by almost 40 percent among Hispanics and by almost 50 percent for Asians.
Z00|Women, Gender, and Politics in Morocco|This article analyzes the intersection of gender, women’s activism, and political participation in Morocco in a socio-political approach. The emergence of women’s activism is an answer to the gender-based discrimination in the country. Women’s non-government organizations (NGOs) struggle for women’s rights and participate actively in the feminization and democratization of the public sphere to ensure sustainable development. They create progressive social change through the mobilization and participation of women. The role of women’s NGO’s (liberal and Islamic alike) in the struggle against gender inequalities is remarkable in regard of their efforts to consolidate democracy and social justice and to challenge traditional thinking and inequitable, oppressive, undemocratic, sexist practices of governance. Despite the different approaches, they act together to achieve women’s rights in a variety of places.
Z00|The Influence of Religiously and Scientifically Framed Messages on Agreement with Water Use Restrictions|Recent droughts in 2012 and 2013 have increased attention to water use issues in the United States. Cities, government agencies, and environmental nonprofit organizations use scientifically-framed messages to advocate for water conservation. In addition, some religious organizations use messages based on religious teachings to promote water conservation. Because approximately 70% of the U.S. public reports some religious affiliation, it is important to investigate the influence of religious and scientific messages for promoting water conservation. I report the results of an experiment that examines how scientifically- and religiously-framed messages influence attitudes about water use restrictions. I found that Christians were no more or less likely to agree with a policy calling for water use restrictions than non-Christians and non-religious people. However, a Christian religious message negatively influenced agreement with water use restrictions in the entire sample—and in a Christian subsample. Results suggest that religiously framed messages may not increase environmental concern.
Z00|Vahid Online: Post-2009 Iran and the Politics of Citizen Media Convergence|An attempt is made to study the social network site, Vahid Online, pseudonym of a leading Iranian activist who has the largest social media followership online. Vahid Online is Iran’s leading distributor of information about social and political news about Iran, a source of information used by citizens and journalists. Similar to Twitter, Vahid Online posts, shares, and communicates news in short messages with hyperlinks, hashtags, or internet slang for multimedia purposes. In this networking media space, citizen journalism is assumed the civic responsibility of news and information dissemination with a perceived conception of internet as an agency of change. Vahid Online, I argue, is representative of an individuated networking activism in the new technology for information production. Technology, likewise, is imagined as a political agency and, in turn, citizenship is redefined through technology that carries the promise of change. It is also argued that Vahid Online’s conception of citizen journalism is directly born out of the Green Movement in 2009, a protest movement against the 2009 presidential elections with a self-image of networked citizenship with a relative reliance on a weak tie model of civic association. The notion of citizen journalism examined here is one of civic participatory activism in archiving the collection, reporting, and dissemination of news through the merging of diverse media technologies in an attempt to create and distribute the most impact spreading news. The paper finally offers a critical analysis and argues that Vahid Online is more about individuated network framing of a privileged politics through practice of new technology.
Z00|The Militarization of Mass Incapacitation and Torture during the Sunni Insurgency and American Occupation of Iraq|While scholars and journalists have focused important attention on the recent militarization of intensive policing and imprisonment policies in the United States, there is little reciprocal recognition of how militarized versions of these policies were also exported for use in the occupation of Iraq. Intensive policing and imprisonment enabled the American-led and Shia-dominated Iraq Ministries of Defense and Interior along with U.S. forces to play significant roles in the ethnic cleansing and displacement of Arab Sunnis from Baghdad neighborhoods, and in their disproportionate detention in military- and militia-operated facilities, of which the Abu Ghraib prison is only the best known. The failure of American authorities alone and working with Iraq’s government to intervene in stopping the use of police and prisons as places of torture is a violation of U.N.-invoked and U.S.-ratified treaties, and thereby subject to prosecution. Such prosecutions have imported into international law the concept of “joint criminal enterprise” anticipated by the criminologist Donald Cressey and incorporated in the American Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statutes used to convict organized criminals. We elaborate how the concept of joint criminal enterprise can be used to understand and possibly prosecute a chain of command responsibility for the use of policing and prisons as sites of torture in Iraq. We analyze the previously neglected international consequences of U.S. policing, prison, and mass incapacitation strategies with links to American criminology.
