H12|Outline of a redistribution-free debt redemption fund for the euro area|Public debts in the euro area have increased sharply due to the economic crisis, and remain at historically high levels in several countries. In a monetary union, high-debt members represent a permanent threat to financial stability, as they are subject – even if fundamentally solvent – to significant rollover risk. Given the tight financial and economic links between member states, a liquidity crisis in one of them would trigger area-wide turmoil. While prudent fiscal policies are essential to address the legacy debt problem, it takes time for them to bring the debt back to (at least) pre-crisis levels. Against this background, the paper explores the feasibility and desirability of transferring a share of national public debts to a European Redemption Fund. In exchange, each country would transfer a yearly flow of resources to the Fund. We show that it is possible to design such a scheme so that it does not entail any ex-ante cross-country redistribution, while the euro area as a whole would benefit as the lowering of member states’ annual refinancing needs would improve financial stability. The fraction of mutualized debt would be fully redeemed over a reasonable number of years. The scheme would not jeopardize national commitment to debt reduction; if anything, market discipline would become more effective at the margin.
H12|Consumer payment choice during the crisis in Europe: a heterogeneous behaviour?|In this research paper we investigate the use of payment media from consumers during a financial crisis. The scene is Europe in 2015 and the aftermath - or the very peak for some countries - of the Eurozone crisis. The contrast in the scene is augmented through researching countries at the centre of Eurozone crisis versus far more stable Economies. In the first group and in order of severity of the crisis' impact: Greece, Cyprus and to a lesser extent Spain. In the latter group Sweden and UK. We deployed a quantitative survey-based study for which the instrument was originally constructed in the medium of English and translated (and back-translated) in Greek and Spanish, and was delivered both hand-to-hand (printout) and online via Survey monkey. Descriptive statistics are presented over the totally 1003 gathered questionnaires and a comparative analysis is performed illustrating indeed an heterogeneous behaviour among the five countries under investigation. All the above comprise the empirical part of our research, that follows naturally and complements the theoretical one: a deductive model of the hierarchy of payment media - and the respective changes of - during periods of financial distress. Within that model our main hypothesis is formed around the regional differences and the impact of the crisis in the use of cash as a payment medium, both confirmed by our empirical evidence to a large extent. So during the Eurozone crisis: a) the use of cash as a payment medium is evident, and b) this is more the case in countries mostly affected from the crisis - most notably Greece.
H12|When the bank is closed, the cash is king; ... not!|In this research paper we investigate changes in payment media used from consumers as a result of extreme financial restrictions. The motivation comes from the summer of 2015 in Greece where after failure for an agreement between Greece and the Troika (EU, IMF and ECB) for an extension of lending support from the latter, the Greek government decided to close the banks for three weeks; and apply capital controls still in place ten months after the event - however gradually relaxed. Methodologically we adopted grounded theory and through this a fully qualitative and longitudinal study comprised of three series (every six months) of in-depth interviews with individual citizens (on behalf of their households) over a period of one calendar year. We aim to investigate research changes in payment media used during and after the period when the banks were closed, as well as permanent changes in consumer and social behavior. Acknowledging that with this methodological approach reaching statistical significant results is very difficult to be achieved, we do however seek and to a great extend provide insight in what really happened during and after the events, and one thing came out again and again: people turned more into the use of debit cards, and secondary to online banking and to a lesser extent to credit cards; the later came with an inevitable raise of household debt. Cash use was only temporarily increased and more evidently during the three-week event, while all the previous aforementioned results had of a more permanent nature, as illustrated from the longitudinal analysis.
H12|Wirtschaftspolitik-Fehlorientierung des Westens nach 1989: Bankenkrise, Globalisierungs-Ordnungsdefizit und Desintegrationsdruck|Der Zerfall der sozialistischen Wirtschaftssysteme vollzog sich Ende der 1980er Jahre in den Ländern Osteuropas und der Sowjetunion, wobei osteuropäische EU-Länder einen ökonomischen Aufholprozess begonnen haben. 1991 hat aber der Westen teilweise keine vernünftigen Konsequenzen aus der beginnenden Systemtransformation gezogen und eine Phase geringer politischer Selbstdisziplin bei manchen westlichen Regierungen bzw. eine Expansion des Populismus - erklärbar unter Bezug auf Harry-Johnson-Ansätze und Identity Economics - begonnen. Die Transatlantische Bankenkrise ergab sich aus überzogener Bankenderegulierung in den USA und UK, die faktisch auch die Länder der Eurozone zur Bankenderegulierung brachte und sich absehbar wiederholen könnte; auch als Folge des BREXIT. Bei der Digitalisierung fehlt ein Ordnungsrahmen. Dessen Fehlen hat zu einer Art digitalem Sozialismus geführt – mit negativen Konsequenzen für Effizienz in der Marktwirtschaft und für die Demokratie. Mit dem Populismus in UK, dem strukturellen US-Populismus – inklusive Anti-Multilateralismus - und dem Anti-Liberalismus in Teilen der EU(27) steht der Westen vor einer Abstiegs- und die EU vor einer politischen Spannungsphase; eine sinnvolle Reformagenda wäre eine Stabilisierungschance für die EU, wird aber teilweise blockiert, während zugleich verfrühte Vergemeinschaftung, etwa bei Einlagensicherung, droht. Der US-Sachverständigenrat unter Trump sieht die USA wohlfahrtsmäßig vor Nordeuropa, was eine Fehlsicht ist.
H12|How to Handle the Fiscal Crisis in Greece? Empirical Evidence Based on a Survey of Economic Experts|We asked economic experts polled by the CESifo World Economic Survey how to handle the fiscal crisis in Greece in the year 2015. The sample includes about 850 experts from 110 countries. We find systematic differences in experts’ recommendations. Our results suggest that policy advice is related to an expert’s personal and country-level attributes. Country-level characteristics, especially credit default swaps as a measure of fiscal stability, predict views on whether Greece should exit the eurozone. An expert’s educational background, age and professional affiliation predict opinions on the credit programs of the International Monetary Fund. We propose that policymakers who seek balanced policy advice should consult experts from different countries and personal backgrounds.

H12|The Fall in UK Potential Output due to the Financial Crisis: a Much Bigger Estimate|Conventional estimates suggest that the 2007-9 financial crisis reduced UK potential output by 3.8 to 7.5 per cent of GDP. This implied a need for fiscal tightening as the structural budget deficit had increased considerably. The austerity that followed led to the rise of UKIP, the EU referendum and the vote for Brexit. Brexit will reduce potential output by somewhere between 3.9 and 8.7 per cent of GDP. Thus, it can be argued that the total fall in UK potential output due to the banking crisis is approximately double the conventional estimate.

H12|Do the Right Thing! Leaders, Weather Shocks and Social Conflicts in Pre-Industrial France|I use spatial and temporal variation in temperature shocks to examine the effect of adverse weather conditions on the onset of social conflicts in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century France. The paper’s contribution is threefold. First, I document the effect of temperature shocks on standards of living using cross-section and panel prices data. Second, I link high-resolution temperature data and a new database of 8,528 episodes of social conflicts in France between 1661 and 1789. I use a linear probability model with subregional and year fixed effects to establish a causal connection between temperature shocks and conflicts. One standard deviation increase in temperature increased the probability of social conflicts by about 5.3 per cent. To the best of my knowledge, these results are the first to quantify the effect of temperature shocks on intergroup conflict in pre-industrial Europe. Finally, I investigate the role of local leaders– the intendants– in the mitigation of temperature shocks. I show that leaders with higher level of local experience were better able to cope with adverse weather conditions. I argue that years of local experience were a key determinant in the intendant’s ability to administer efficiently his province. This interpretation is supported by historical evidence.
H12|The Swedish Fiscal Framework – The Most Successful One in the EU?|This paper discusses the history and future of the Swedish fiscal framework. First, we claim that the fiscal framework has contributed to a sharp decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio, from one of the highest to one of the lowest in the European Union. Next, we focus on the future. Despite its success, we argue that the framework is unsustainable. Running large surpluses over the long run is not a steady-state solution. We recommend two changes to the framework. First, that the public pension system is excluded, and second that the Swedish fiscal authorities shift attention from maintaining a budget surplus of 1/3 percent of GDP over the business cycle to sustaining a stable debt-to-GDP ratio of 25 percent of GDP +/- 5 percentage points. A debt anchor at this level will provide sufficient insurance in case of a future major economic crisis judging from recent cross-country evidence. In addition, a debt anchor around 25 percent of GDP would contribute to political stability in time of crises. In a world, where populism and austerity fatigue are rampant, we stress the importance of a fiscal framework allowing successful consumption and tax smoothing in case of major negative shocks to the fiscal space. We conclude with a set of recommendations for the fiscal governance of the EU.
H12|A novel supply-side measure to combat abuse of addictive prescription drugs|In the United States, 115 people die each day due to overdose, and a third of overdoses involve the concurrent use of opioids and a class of sedatives called benzodiazepines. Facing a similar problem in 2012, Austria responded by installing public health officers (PHOs) as third-party institutions overseeing prescriptions of the most potent and commonly abused benzodiazepine, flunitrazepam. Since December 15, 2012, every single flunitrazepam prescription must be authorized and countersigned by a PHO, prescriptions were restricted to a month’s supply of the drug, and doses must be dispensed daily, under supervision, in a pharmacy. I identify a sample of opioids addicts in administrative social security data and study their response to this reform. Event studies suggest a persistent decline in flunitrazepam prescriptions but substitution to less potent benzodiazepines following the reform. To examine subsequent health, labor market, and drug abuse-related outcomes, I additionally exploit regional variation in PHO strictness affecting the likelihood that addicts opt to quit the drug due to the reform. I find that addicts who quit after encountering a strict PHO have better health and labor market outcomes, have fewer opioid overdoses, and are less likely to take antidepressants or weak opioids. I discuss how these findings translate to the US setting, and whether a similar policy can help curb its opioid epidemic.
H12|State of Public Finance and Fiscal Management in India during 2001-16|During 2001-16, State Finances in India have undergone significant changes in both revenue mobilization and controlling expenditures which helped states to contain deficits (revenue as well as fiscal). Introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) helped states to augment revenue mobilization whereas adoption of Fiscal Responsibility Budget Management (FRBM) Act helped states in prudential fiscal management. During the period, the improvement in union finances was not as good as state finances. There were two significant shocks to Indian public finances during 2001-16 - firstly, introduction of pay revision for the union as well as majority state government employees, in response to recommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission and secondly, global financial crisis (2008-09). States experienced revenue shocks mostly through fall in states' share in central taxes and a mild fall in own tax revenue mobilization during 2008-10. Higher pressure on revenue expenditure due to implementation of the pay commission recommendations (including revision of pensions and payment of arrears) and falling share in central taxes resulted in rise in revenue deficits for states during 2008-10. As a strategy to combat fiscal shocks, different states adopted different measures and some of the measures have inter-temporal implications. The objective of the present paper is to assess the impact of the shocks in Indian public finances and identify challenges for the times to come. Though increasing revenue (`front loading') and reducing expenditure (`back loading') are common responses to any fiscal shock, understanding inter-temporal implications of those responses with specific to changing structure of inter-governmental fiscal transfers could be an interesting exercise.
H12|Transition finance country study of Lebanon: Global public goods and the response to adverse shocks|This study investigates transition finance in Lebanon, an upper middle-income country in the MENA region transitioning from a significant adverse shock. Lebanon’s development path has been historically non-linear and, most recently, the Syrian conflict adversely affected the country’s development path. The Syrian conflict compounded pre-existing deficits and challenges in Lebanon, calling for increased international assistance.DAC donors increased official development assistance (ODA) to Lebanon to preserve stability and promote refugee protection. Donors also created special financing instruments such as the Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) to foster the provision of multilateral concessional financing to Lebanon. Official development finance in Lebanon is high in comparison to its peers, particularly on a per capita basis and for humanitarian assistance. The country also attracts high amounts of FDI and remittances. Overall, domestic credit dominates the financing landscape and public debt is high.DAC members and other donors can strengthen the humanitarian-development-peace nexus, address long-standing country needs to promote self-sufficiency, and re-design partnerships driven by mutual accountability and appropriate incentive structures.
H12|Integrating gender analysis into food & nutrition security early warning systems in West Africa|Integrating gender dimensions into early warning systems is critical to support equitable crisis prevention and response. This paper investigates the extent to which food and nutrition security early warning systems (FNS EWS) in the Sahel and West Africa are gender-responsive and highlights existing gaps at national and regional levels. Progress has been made by key partners and stakeholders towards strengthening the gender analysis of FNS EWS, however, these efforts have not led to a unified reconfiguration of joint FNS EWS mechanisms to be more gender-responsive. More concerted efforts are required to assess and track the gender dimensions of FNS EWS to inform more equitable emergency prevention and response. This paper provides timely policy directions to support stakeholders’ efforts in strengthening the gender-responsiveness of early warning systems in the Sahel and West Africa.
H12|Intégrer l’analyse sexospécifique dans les systèmes d’alerte précoce pour la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle en Afrique de l’Ouest|L’intégration de la problématique femmes-hommes dans les systèmes d’alerte précoce est essentielle afin de prévenir et gérer les crises de façon plus équitable. Cette Note examine la prise en compte dans les systèmes d’alerte précoce pour la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle (SAP-SAN) au Sahel et en Afrique de l’Ouest du genre. Elle identifie les lacunes aux niveaux national et régional. Il en ressort que les partenaires et parties prenantes ont renforcé la capacité d’analyse sexospécifique de ces systèmes. Mais ces avancées n’ont pas abouti à une refonte uniforme des mécanismes conjoints auxquels font appel les SAP-SAN afin de les rendre plus sensibles aux disparités qui existent entre les sexes. Des efforts plus concertés s’imposent pour déterminer les aspects de la problématique femmes-hommes à intégrer dans les SAP-SAN et en assurer le suivi pour des systèmes de prévention et de gestion de crise plus équitables. Ce document présente des pistes pour appuyer ces efforts.
H12|Boeotians, Achaeans and Europeans. Can we learn from the ancient Greek federal experience?|In this paper we analyze in brief how two ancient Greek federations, the Boeotoian and the Achaean ones took decisions on two crucial issues that relate the balance of power between city-states- members within the federation and defense policy. We analyze why the Boeotoian Federation followed a wrong grand strategy whereas the Achaean one implemented a prudent strategy regarding the issue of federal principles. Lastly, we compare our findings with a series of decisions that were taken in the last years by the today’s European Union (EU) policy-makers, and we relate them to the issues of “mismanagement” of “solidarity” of economic policies among member-states and democratic decision-making.
H12|Modern Democracy-Welfare State and Public Goods. A current consequence for Greece|People expect the state to create jobs and provide them with a social security net. Whatever its defects, whatever the virtues of the private sector, no structure other than the state can today provide citizens with the basic public goods. Under the present right-wing government of Nea Dimokratia in Greece, which is not particularly at odds with neoliberalism, a very active role of the state is not expected. Also is nor expected the introduction of a serious program of public investment and demand boosting to stimulate the national economy and enter into a virtuous circle of recovery. Greece, which has undergone the economic crisis with drastic cuts in its traditionally deficient social state, has to respond directly to the marked underinvestment in public goods (in key areas such as education, health, natural disasters, dealing with decent living conditions).The most important tool for inputting resources is the tax system.
H12|Rescued Wild Boar Soccer Team members in the Tham Luang Cave: Transforming an Impossible Mission to a Possible Mission|When problems have solutions in hand, they are not too difficult to solve. On the other hand, for an unprecedented case which has many unknown factors and threatens the survival of the victims, it is risky and challenging. The Tham Luang Cave is located in the Maesai District, Chiangrai Province, Northern Thailand. Thirteen members of the Wild Boar Soccer Team decided to visit the cave after they finished practice. Although some members had visited the cave in the past, this time, conditions in the cave were different from their previous visits. The rainy season came earlier than usual and heavy rain caused them to be trapped in the cave for more than two weeks. As soon as it became known that they were still in the cave, a rescue operation was mounted.In the first stage, there were many limitations for rescue operations in terms of details of the cave map, cave diving skills and rescue operation techniques. However, international cooperation together with systematic local management could make the rescue mission possible. The rescue of the Wild Boar Soccer Team members is a unique case. This study aims to better understand the crisis management process. Knowledge of crisis management is still limited and more work needs to be done to enhance the field. Therefore, this study illustrates the framework of integrated crisis management through an analysis of the rescued Wild Boar Soccer Team members case. Research Results Analysis help to shed new light on the crisis management process and to provide lessons learnt from an unprecedented crisis management case.
H12|Tools for the Rescue of Banks in Crisis|The financial crisis of 2008 drew attention to the insufficient regulation of banks. Due to the bank failures taking place at different places of the world, the crisis significantly decreased the budgetary funds of the countries. Banks too big to fail that had extensively grown due to the previously used practice expected the governments of the countries in which they were established to save them from the money of the taxpayers. However, this process was not sustainable on a long term and mainly after the crisis, and induced the operators to develop a new solution. Not only new legislation was necessary, but new institutions had to be also set up. In the framework of the European Union, the reform was named banking union, and two of its three components, i.e. banking supervision and resolution, are intended to prevent bank failures, and one, i.e. deposit guarantee, is intended to mitigate the damages caused by the failure. This study presents the economic tools used to prevent the failure of banks in crisis, with special regard to the institutional system of resolution. Resolution is a tool for the restoration of the operation of an institution that is becoming or has become insolvent, with the intention to prevent the spread of the problem in order to make sure that the involvement of the institution paying funds in the case of the bank failure is not necessary and the society is affected by the situation to the minimum extent. The national resolution funds as well as the Single Resolution Fund of the EU have been established mainly to reduce the system risk caused by the so-called banks too big to fail, ensuring thereby the stability of the financial system.
H12|Drought response in an election year: Evidence from Brazil|Research on the impact of water conservation instruments rarely considers the role of electoral politics. This paper evaluates the response of a major state-owned water utility to the drought that occurred in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil during 2014. The response coincided with an election for state governor. A difference-in-difference research design produces no evidence that a reward-based instrument implemented before the election reduced household consumption. Evidence is found that a penalty-based instrument implemented after the election reduced consumption by 4 to 8%. The implications of insulating water utilitiesâ€™ drought response from the political-electoral cycle are discussed.
H12|The Urgent Need for an Economics of “Hategoatism”|The word “scapegoat” is defined as “a person made to bear the blame for others,” and similarly, “scapegoatism” refers to “the act or practice of assigning blame or failure to another, as to deflect attention or responsibility away from oneself” (Collins English Dictionary and Dictionary.com, respectively.) While these definitions do not mention economics specifically, in most cases the blame on the scapegoat is economic in nature. Scapegoatism also provides a convenient, though extremely inferior, substitute for valid analyses of economic problems. Scapegoatism, however, has a partner, dehumanization, which is the process of demonizing certain people as less than human and unworthy of humane treatment. Scapegoatism is not only accompanied by dehumanization, but it is often motivated by it. Thus, “scapegoatism” is a euphemism and it is understudied as a result, because there is no single term of art that combines scapegoatism and dehumanization. This paper offers a solution to this semantic dilemma by proposing the new term, “HATEGOATISM,” for the simultaneous existence of scapegoatism and dehumanization. Only one subfield of economics regularly embraces hategoatism, which is Libertarianism (where the “HATEGOAT” is government workers). Economists must lead by example by combating hategoatism, and that requires cleaning their own house first.
H12|Public credit and Economic cycle yn Spain: 1971-2015|Public credit in Spain was organized around the Official Credit Institute (ICO) from 1971 onwards. The importance of the public credit as part of the total credit has been decreasing from 1971 until 2015. Considering that public credit is an economic policy instrument, the role it played during expansions and recessions may be of major significance to stabilize the economy. This paper analyzes the behavior of the credit in relation to the economic cycle during the last forty years through the application of the à la Bry and Boschan algorithm that allows to date the peaks and troughs during the cycle. This helps us observe whether the public credit has been procyclical or countercyclical with respect to the private credit cycle and the GDP cycle as well, thus offering a meaningful explanation linked to the ICO history. Besides, there is evidence of a certain degree of synchronization between the credit cycle -both public and private- and the economic cycle, with the private credit showing the largest synchronization, both in the economic upswing and downswing. The public credit behaviour, on the contrary, tends to be more countercyclical during the recessive part of the cycle, thus exerting a buffer function of the economic situation.
H12|Los retos del desapalancamiento público|Los niveles de deuda pública sobre el PIB en una mayoría de países de la UEM, incluida España, se encuentran en niveles muy elevados de acuerdo con los registros históricos disponibles. La literatura económica es concluyente en señalar que el mantenimiento de ratios de deuda pública muy elevadas durante períodos temporales prolongados puede resultar perjudicial para el crecimiento económico y suponer una fuente de vulnerabilidad para la economía, además de reducir la capacidad estabilizadora del presupuesto público. En este contexto, las reformas del Pacto de Estabilidad y Crecimiento europeo y de la ley de estabilidad presupuestaria española acometidas durante la reciente crisis reforzaron el papel de esta variable en el marco presupuestario. Las simulaciones realizadas en el presente trabajo muestran que, bajo determinados supuestos macroeconómicos, un proceso de desapalancamiento público como el exigido por el Pacto de Estabilidad para el caso de la economía española exigirá un esfuerzo de consolidación fiscal todavía significativo y que debe perdurar en el tiempo.
H12|Did the Basel Process of Capital Regulation Enhance the Resiliency of European Banks?|This paper analyses the evolution of the resiliency of the European banking sector after the implementation of the Basel Capital Accord. In particular, by analysing SRISK and CoVaR we trace systemic risk and measures of systematic risk as the Basel process unfolds. We observe that, though systematic risk for European banks have been decreasing over the last three decades, systemic risk has heightened especially for the largest systemic banks. While the Basel process has succeeded in containing systemic risk of small banks, it has been less successful for the larger institutions. The latter ones opportunistically exploited the option of self-regulation by employing internal models and effectively increasing SRISK. Hence, the sub-prime crisis found the largest and more systemic banks ill-prepared and lacking resiliency. This condition was even aggravated during the European sovereign crisis.
H12|Debt Sustainability and the Terms of Official Support|We study theoretically and quantitatively how official lending regimes affect a government's decision to raise saving as opposed to defaulting, and its implication for sovereign bond pricing by investors. We reconsider debt sustainability in the face of both output and rollover risk under two types of institutional bailouts: one based on long-maturity, low-spread loans similar to the ones offered by the euro area official lenders; the other, on shorter maturity and high-spread loans, close to the International Monetary Fund standards. We show that official lending regimes raise the stock of safe debt and facilitate consumption smoothing through debt reduction. However, to the extent that bailouts translates into higher future debt stocks and countercyclical deficits in persistent recessions, they also have countervailing effects on sustainability. As a result, the effect of official loans is nonlinear in their size. As the threshold for safe debt rises, the maximum debt level the country finds it optimal to sustain when markets price rollover risk falls. This result unveils a fundamental trade-off in the provision of official loans, in turn rooted in a basic form of moral hazard. Quantitatively, the model is able to replicate Portuguese debt and spread dynamics in the years of the bailout after 2011. We show that, depending on the composition of debt by maturity and official lending, sustainable debt levels can vary between 50% of GDP and 180% of GDP depending on the state of the economy and the conditions for market access. Longer maturities have a stronger effect on sustainability than lower spreads.

H12|An Analysis of Peer Effects on Vaccination Behavior Using a Model of Privately Provided Public Goods| Traditional economic models of vaccination behavior simply assume that agents free-ride on the vaccination decisions of others. We provide three different models of private provision of a public good, such as a joint production model and a conjectural variation model, to explain how a positive peer effect regarding vaccination behavior arises. We conduct two empirical studies using Japanese data in these models. The first empirical analysis, using a data set on the vaccination behavior of neighbors residing in the same block of a city, finds the existence of positive peer effects on individuals' vaccination decisions. The second empirical analysis also confirms that there are peer effects on the vaccination decisions of members of the same household using a dataset from the national survey we conduct.
H12|Coups, Regime Transition, and the Dynamics of Press Freedom|This paper explores the dynamics of press freedom around events that threaten or oust the incumbent regime of a country. While democracies on average grant the press more freedom, our theoretical starting point is that democracies and autocracies may have similar incentives to protect the power of the governing regime. A priori it is, nevertheless, not clear whether democracies or autocracies react more harshly – by silencing or controlling the media – to an attempt to overthrow the government. We estimate the dynamics of press freedom around both failed and successful coups and find that although press freedom is quite stable, successful coups lead to a substantial reduction in press freedom. This is, however, only the case when the coup is directed against a democratically elected government.​
H12|Sitting on a Volcano: Domestic Violence in Indonesia Following Two Volcano Eruptions|This is the first study to provide pre- and post-treatment family-level data on the impact of volcano eruptions on domestic violence. I use data from 2,024 families in Indonesia, of which a subset has been exposed to two eruptions. Findings confirm an increase in domestic violence of four percent in the treatment group. The proposed channel is an increase in mental distress. This is supported by lower household expenditures, increased rates of alcohol/drug abuse and lowered emotional wellbeing in affected populations. A subsample of previously displaced families shows higher risk of developing domestic violence. Policymakers should consider the multi-fold non-economic outcomes of natural disasters.

H12|The 2015 Refugee Crisis in Germany: Concerns about Immigration and Populism|This paper investigates the effect of the refugee crisis, and the related government’s asylum policy, on concerns about immigration of the German population. Exploiting exogenous variation in survey interview timing of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), I employ a difference-in-differences strategy to estimate the short-term causal effect of the refugee crisis on concerns about immigration. The estimated effect is substantial, representing an increase in concerns of around 22%, compared to the pre-refugee crisis baseline level. Interestingly, I find that this increase was twice as large for East Germans, compared to West Germans. In a second section, I show concerns about immigration are positively correlated with political support for the relatively new, right-wing populist party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). However, using the variability in concerns generated by the refugee crisis, I find no evidence of a causal effect of concerns on political preferences in the short term.
H12|Liquidity regulation, the central bank and the money market|Money markets play a central role in monetary policy implementation. Money market functioning has changed since the financial crisis. This arguably reflects the interaction of two forces: Changes in monetary policy, and changes in regulation. This interaction is not yet well understood. We focus on the newly introduced Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and how it influences the behaviour of banks and the equilibrium on the money market. We develop a theoretical model to analyse how liquidity regulation may interfere with the central bank's implementation of monetary policy. We find that when the market equilibrium is suboptimal due to asymmetric information, both the central bank and the regulator can act to improve welfare. These actions can be complementary or conflicting, depending on the environment. The main insight from the central bank perspective is that the regulator can reach the welfare optimum, but at the expense of the central bank moving away from its optimum. The central bank will thus need to adjust its implementation of monetary policy accordingly, to address the effects of liquidity regulation.
H12|Government Debt And Banking Fragility: The Spreading Of Strategic Uncertainty|This article studies the interaction of government debt and financial markets. This interaction, termed a “diabolic loop,” is driven by government choice to bail out banks and the resulting incentives for banks to hold government debt instead of self‐insure through equity buffers. We highlight the role of bank equity issuance in determining whether the “diabolic loop” is a Nash equilibrium of the interaction between banks and the government. When equity is issued, no diabolic loop exists. In equilibrium, banks' rational expectations of a bailout ensure that no equity is issued and the sovereign‐bank loop is operative.
H12|L’analyse économétrique des conflits internes par l’approche causale : les évolutions d’une littérature en expansion|Prévenir les conflits internes nécessite une meilleure compréhension de la manière dont ils se forment et se propagent dans le temps et l’espace. Par rapport aux autres sciences sociales, l’économie n’a que très récemment investi ce champ d’étude.

Ce document définit le périmètre d’analyse de ce champ d’étude en insistant sur trois mécanismes profonds à l’origine des comportements de prédation : les capacités de l’Etat, la valeur du gain issu de la capture de l’Etat et le coût d’opportunité d’entrer dans un groupe armé auquel les individus font face (i.e. l’arbitrage entre des activités de production ou de prédation). Il dresse également un bilan des contraintes et avancées récentes dans l’analyse causale des conflits internes. Il montre que l’amélioration des méthodes d’inférence causale, des outils économétriques et des méthodes de collecte de données dessine des perspectives de recherche prometteuses sur des sujets tels que le rôle de la cohésion sociale et les conséquences du changement climatique sur le risque de conflit.

H12|Government Guarantees and the Valuation of American Banks|Banks’ ratio of the market value to book value of their equity was close to 1 until the 1990s, then more than doubled during the 1996–2007 period, and fell again to values close to 1 after the 2008 financial crisis. Some economists argue that the drop in banks’ market-to-book ratio since the crisis is due to a loss in bank franchise value or profitability. In this paper we argue that banks’ market-to-book ratio is the sum of two components: franchise value and the value of government guarantees. We empirically decompose the ratio between these two components and find that a large portion of the variation in this ratio over time is due to changes in the value of government guarantees.

H12|A game theory approach to optimizing the banking and financial resolution framework|Before the 2007-2008 financial crisis, creditinstitutions were assured (though not officially or formally) that if they were large enough they would be rescued with tax-payers’ money, an action also known as bail-out, denoting what became known as the “too big to fail” paradigm. The introduction of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (2014/59/EU) proposes a legal framework that aims at eliminating the possibility of bailing-out institutions. This paper has the objective of assessing througha game theory approachto what extent the BRRDirectivehas the potential to achieve its purpose and if there are identifiable possible improvements to this framework that could be considered for practical purposes or for a possible future review of the legal framework.The term institution, for the purpose of this paper, refers to credit institutions but can also be read as referring to other types of financial institutions such as investment firms or insurance companies
H12|Coups, Regime Transition, and the Dynamics of Press Freedom|This paper explores the dynamics of press freedom around events that threaten or oust the incumbent regime of a country. While democracies on average grant the press more freedom, our theoretical starting point is that democracies and autocracies may have similar incentives to protect the power of the governing regime. A priori it is, nevertheless, not clear whether democracies or autocracies react more harshly – by silencing or controlling the media – to an attempt to overthrow the government. We estimate the dynamics of press freedom around both failed and successful coups and find that although press freedom is quite stable, successful coups lead to a substantial reduction in press freedom. This is, however, only the case when the coup is directed against a democratically elected government.
H12|Predictors of Bank Distress:The 1907 Crisis in Sweden|This paper contributes to literature on bank distress using the Swedish experience of the international crisis of 1907, often paralleled with 2008. By employing previously unanalyzed bank-level data, we use logit regressions and principal component analysis to measure the impact of pre-crisis bank characteristics on the probability of their subsequent distress. The crisis was characterized by “creative destruction,” as those banks with weaker corporate governance structures, wider branching networks, operating with lower cost efficiency were more likely to experience distress. We find that poor credit allocation rather than foreign borrowing, as often stressed, were associated with ultimate demise.

H12|An Analysis of Peer Effects on Vaccination Behavior Using a Model of Privately Provided Public Goods|Traditional economic models of vaccination behavior simply assume that agents free-ride on the vaccination decisions of others. We provide three different models of private provision of a public good, such as a joint production model and a conjectural variation model, to explain how a positive peer effect regarding vaccination behavior arises. We conduct two empirical studies using Japanese data in these models. The first empirical analysis, using a data set on the vaccination behavior of neighbors residing in the same block of a city, finds the existence of positive peer effects on individuals’ vaccination decisions. The second empirical analysis also confirms that there are peer effects on the vaccination decisions of members of the same household using a dataset from the national survey we conduct.
H12|L'opus di Mauro Fasiani|Scopo di questo lavoro non è quello di discutere il pensiero scientifico di Fasiani, ma solo di attirare l'attenzione degli studiosi facendo conoscere il contenuto dei suoi apporti scientifici, perché Mauro Fasiani non sembra occupare ancora il posto che merita nell'ambito scientifico. In questo lavoro viene quindi presentato un profilo biografico di Mauro Fasiani, seguito da una breve analisi dei suoi scritti scientifici disposta secondo i principali filoni delle sue ricerche. Segue una bibliografia delle sue opere e la bibliografia degli scritti riguardanti il suo apporto scientifico. Il lavoro si conclude con la presentazione di trentotto schede, ciascuna corrispondente ad un suo saggio; rispetto agli scritti elencati nella bibliografia, mancano le schede corrispondenti a otto scritti, considerati del tutto trascurabili.
H12|Trust in Lending|We develop a theory of trust in lending, distinguishing between trust and reputation, and use it to analyze the competitive interactions between banks and non-bank lenders (fintech firms). Trust enables lenders to have assured access to financing, whereas a loss of investor trust makes this access conditional on market conditions and lender reputation. Banks endogenously have stronger incentives to maintain trust. When borrower defaults erode trust in lenders, banks are able to survive the erosion of trust when fintech lenders do not. Trust is also asymmetric in nature—it is more difficult to gain it than to lose it.
H12|An Analysis of Puerto Rico's Debt Relief Needs to Restore Debt Sustainability|This paper makes two contributions. First, we examine the macroeconomic implications of Puerto Rico’s Fiscal Plan that was certified in March 2017 for fiscal years 2017-18 to 2026-27. Second, we perform a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) that incorporates the expected macroeconomic dynamics implied by the Fiscal Plan in order to compute Puerto Rico’s debt restructuring needs. We detect a number of flawed assumptions in the Fiscal Plan that lead to an underestimation of its contractionary effects on the island’s economic activity. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of the expected macroeconomic dynamics implied by the plan that allows us to construct more realistic scenarios of Puerto Rico’s debt restructuring needs. We show that the island’s current debt position is unsustainable, and compute the necessary debt relief to restore sustainability under different sets of assumptions. The paper offers general insights for performing a macro-consistent DSA.
H12|Quel est le régime démocratique optimal en Afrique ?<BR>[What is the optimal democratic system ?]|Referring to several rebellions in Africa, referring to troubles after each election in Africa, the purpose of that paper is to analyze the strengths and the weaknesses of each democratic regime in Africa. Indeed, according to customary past of Africa, according to the drifts of the presidentialism, from our analyses, it rises that the best democratic regime in Africa are those which do not facilitate the emergence of a strong man to the summit of the state (parliamentary system, constitutional monarchy, hybrid republican system). From the econometric analyses, we deduce that the practice of the democracy in the economies of the second group attracts more investments and improves the investment climate.
H12|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.
H12|Reporting the natural environmental hazards occurrences and fatalities over the last century|This paper presents the occurrences and fatalities of natural environmental hazards drawing an initial picture of concentration, if there is any. For that reason, the authors use aggregate regional tables as well as map visualizations created in R- studio. As it is shown, there appears to be a space concentration on the natural environmental hazards that need to be deeply examined with the use of advanced econometric techniques.
H12|Tax Evasion and Financial Instability|This article explores the association between tax evasion and financial instability. The discussion also examines the effect of tax evasion for financial instability. The discussion shows that tax evasion can reduce the tax revenue available to governments to manage the economy and can weaken the government’s ability to promote stability in financial systems, while on the other hand, taxpayers who evade taxes feel they can use the evaded tax money to rather improve their own financial stability.
H12|Environmental Risks between Conceptualization and Action|Changes in the contemporary world materialized in particular through population growth and mobility, urbanization, and economic expansion also result in an increased exposure of people and assets to extreme events and impose, implicitly, adequate management of induced risks. The occurrence of natural and anthropogenic risk phenomena, known as hazards, puts a heavy tribute on disaster-sensitive human communities regardless of their level of development. The magnitude of the disasters and their increasing frequency and severity imply the need for their approach by the entire world community and for global action. Knowledge of risks becomes a sine qua condition in carrying out impact studies, risk prevention plans, spatial planning plans, and, in general, a condition for effective management of natural resources or sustainable development projects.
H12|Study on The Impact of Socio-Economic Crisis on Greek Wellness Tourists’ Spending Behavior|As most of the sectors of the world economy, tourism has also been affected by the global economic crisis and the resulting social redeployment. This global socio-economic situation, since 2010, has exerted additional pressure on the mental health and physical condition of people who are increasingly looking for new ways of relaxation and rejuvenation. The present study aims to investigate the impact of the current socio-economic crisis on the behavior and attitude of Greek wellness tourists. Quantitative research was conducted using a structured questionnaire on a sample size of 452 wellness tourists in totally 10 spas at Crete, Kos, Lefkada and Thessaloniki. The survey compared the spending behavior of respondents before 2010 and today. The findings of the survey show that although the behavior of Greeks as consumers is being negatively affected by the economic downturn, there is positive intention to continue using and spending on wellness services. In addition, results indicate the existence of positive attitude towards wellness tourism as a means of health promotion and enhancement. Proposals for further research are suggested.

H12|Modern financial repression in the euro area crisis: making high public debt sustainable?|The sharp rise in public debt-to-GDP ratios in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008 posed serious challenges for fiscal policy in the euro area countries and culminated for some member states in a sovereign debt crisis. This note examines the public policy responses to the euro area crisis through the lens of financial repression with a particular focus on how they contributed to easing government budget constraints. Financial repression is defined in this context as the government’s strategy – supported by monetary and financial policies – to gain privileged access to capital markets at preferential credit conditions and divert resources to the state with the aim to secure and, if necessary, enforce public debt sustainability. Following a narrative approach, this note finds that public debt management and resolution, European financial legislation, EMU crisis support and ECB monetary policy have significantly contributed to relieving sovereign liquidity and solvency stress and generated fiscal space through non-standard means. The respective authorities have in fact applied the tools of financial repression to restore stability after the euro area crisis.
H12|Nationalism, Populism, Realism and the Intensification of East Asia's Maritime Disputes: The Northern Territories, Dokdo/Takeshima and Daoiyu/Senkaku|The neo-realist paradigm in international relations scholarship holds that sovereign states are rational, unitary, value-maximizing actors capable of understanding and rank-ordering their tangible national interests while distinguishing between short- and long-term goals. In the neo-realist view, territorial conflicts, unless involving central security concerns, will be subordinated to larger foreign policy objectives. Neo-liberals, on the other hand, argue that the growth of trade and economic interdependence is conducive to cooperation. ?Trade dependency? on a state with which there is a territorial conflict will lead to sublimation, sidelining or delayed resolution of the dispute without the threat or use of force. This paper analyzes three of East Asia?s high-profile maritime disputes, those over the Southern Kurlies/Northern Territories (Russia and Japan), Dokdo/Takeshima (South Korea/Japan), and Diaoyu/Senkaku (China/Japan). The paper demonstrates that, to an increasing degree, nationalist and populist sentiment ? rather than neo-realist or neo-liberal calculation ? has been the prime mover in each of these conflicts. The four regional players ? China, Japan, South Korea and Russia ? have politically invested far more in these islands than an objective analysis would seem to warrant, leading to intensified diplomatic conflict, hampered cooperation, emotion-driven domestic populism, and the possibility of future military action. The paper rejects the reasoning of some recent scholarship on the resolution of maritime disputes. It argues that the increasing salience of populist nationalism as a force hampering the resolution of maritime conflict is part of a global trend in the second decade of the 21st century.
H12|Restoring Trust in Finance: From Principal-Agent to Principled Agent|Bonuses in finance represents a bad equilbrium among multiple equilibria. Motivating agents with bonuses can promote untruthfulness, via motivation crowding out, justifying the decision to pay them bonuses. In the equilibrium that works in other professions, moral norms are upheld enough to not require bonuses. Escaping the bad equilibrium is difficult if banks engage in an ‘optimal’ amount of deceit (moral optimization). Restoring trust instead requires that untruthfulness be ruled out a priori (moral prioritization). Reinstating truth telling in finance must contend with a tendency for ethics to be confined to the private domain and motivation crowding out in finance.
H12|You failed! Government satisfaction and party preferences facing Islamist terrorism|International crises like dramatic terror attacks leave their mark on society in various ways. According to the existing literature, some of these consequences include two seemingly conflicting responses: increasing as well as decreasing support for the incumbent government. To make sense of this seeming contradiction, this study combines these observations in one empirical framework. We investigate the effects of Islamist terrorism on citizens' evaluation of the national government by logistic regression analyses using data from the European Social Survey (ESS) for Germany from 2014 to 2017. Our analyses demonstrate that support for the government significantly increases in the aftermath of Islamist terror attacks. However, the intensity of such support decreases with repeated exposure to terror attacks, and these effects even reverse when a certain level of terror is reached. Further, we find that radical right parties benefit from the issues accentuated by terrorism.
H12|Die Verantwortung von Wirtschaftswissenschaftlern für Wirtschaftskrisen und die Wirtschaft allgemein|Die jüngste globale Wirtschafts- und Finanzkrise sowie die Eurokrise werden kurz skizziert und analysiert. Wirtschaftswissenschaftler waren an diesen Krisen und ihrer Überwindung beteiligt. Ihr Anteil sollte jedoch nicht überschätzt werden. Mehr Forschung zu relevanten Problemen und eine bessere Vermittlung der Forschungsergebnisse wären wünschenswert, wozu jedoch die Anreizstrukturen in den Wirtschaftswissenschaften verbessert werden sollten.
H12|Though this be madness: A game-theoretic perspective on the Brexit negotiations|On June 19, 2017 the European Union and the British government officially commenced negotiations on the terms of the British exit from the union. The dominant view among most economic policy analysts and commentators seems to be that the cards are clearly stacked against Britain and that the high-handed behaviour of the British representatives is, at best, either a bluff or, at worst, a sign of a loss of reality. In this paper we develop a formal model to show how this uncertainty regarding the preferences and strategy of the British side may affect the dynamic of the negotiations and may lead to unanticipated outcomes.
H12|Public investment in R&D in reaction to economic crises: A longitudinal study for OECD countries|The paper investigates the reaction of public R&D spending on economic crises. We are interested in two counteracting motives: On the one hand, public R&D spending can be seen as a means to fight the crisis, and governments may decide to increase their R&D budgets. On the other hand, a crisis reduces public income and urges governments to cut spending, which may negatively affect public R&D budgets. Using panel data from 26 OECD countries over the period 1995 to 2015, we investigate how public R&D expenditure changes over the business cycle for different types of government R&D expenditure. On average, we find evidence for a strong pro-cyclical effect on public R&D investments. But country heterogeneity matters. Whereas European innovation leaders and non-EU countries pursue a counter-cyclical strategy, innovation followers and moderate innovators behave pro-cyclical. This leads to an increasing innovation gap in Europe. Short-run and long-run financing conditions (budget surplus and government debt levels) also significantly affect public R&D spending. However, there is no evidence that economic crises systematically affect the composition of public R&D spending along different thematic areas or by beneficiaries.
H12|Financial development, growth, and crisis: is there a trade-off ?|"This paper reviews the evolving literature that links financial development, financial crises, and economic growth in the past 20 years. The initial disconnect -- with one literature focusing on the effect of financial deepening on long -- run growth and another studying its impact on volatility and crisis?has given way to a more nuanced approach that analyzes the two phenomena in an integrated framework. The main finding of this literature is that financial deepening leads to a trade-off between higher economic growth and higher crisis risk; and its main conclusion is that, for at least middle-income countries, the positive growth effects outweigh the negative crisis risk impact. This balanced view has been revisited recently for advanced economies, where an emerging and controversial literature supports the notion of""too much finance,""suggesting that there might be a threshold beyond which financial depth becomes detrimental for economic growth by crowding out other productive activities and misallocating resources. Nevertheless, the growth/crisis trade-off is alive and strong for a large share of the world economy. Recognizing the intrinsic trade-offs of financial development can provide a useful framework to design policies targeting financial deepening, diversity, and inclusion. In particular, acknowledging the trade-offs can highlight the need for complementary policies to mitigate the risks, from financial macroprudential policies to monetary policy frameworks that monitor the growth of credit and asset prices."
H12|The Bank of England as Lender of Last Resort: New historical evidence from daily transactional data|We use daily transactional ledger data from the Bank of EnglandÕs Archive to test whether and to what extent the Bank of England during the mid-nineteenth century adhered to Walter BagehotÕs rule that a central bank in a financial crisis should lend cash freely at a high interest rate in exchange for ÔgoodÕ securities. The archival data we use provides granular, loan-level insight on the price and quantity of credit, and information on its distribution to particular counterparties. We find that the BankÕs behaviour during this period broadly conforms to BagehotÕs rule, though with variation across the crises of 1847, 1857 and 1866. Using a new, higher frequency series on the BankÕs balance sheet, we find that the Bank did lend freely, with the number of discounts and advances increasing during crises. These loans were typically granted at a rate above pre-crisis levels and, in 1857 and 1866, typically at a spread above Bank Rate, though we also find some instances in the daily discount ledgers where individual loans were made below Bank rate in 1847. Another set of customer ledgers shows that the securities the Bank purchased were debts owed by a geographically and industrially diverse set of debtors. And using new data on the BankÕs income and dividends, we find the Bank and its shareholders profited from lender of last resort operations. We conclude our paper by relating our findings to contemporary debates including those regarding the provision of emergency liquidity to shadow banks.
H12|Official Sector Lending Strategies during the Euro Area Crisis|In response to the euro area crisis, European policymakers took a gradual, incremental approach to official lending, at first relying on the approach followed by the International Monetary Fund, then developing their own crisis resolution framework. We review this development, marked by a substantial divergence in the terms of official loans offered to the crisis countries by the IMF and the euro area official lenders. Based on a unique dataset, we use event analysis to assess the impact of changing maturity and spreads of official loans on bond yields, liquidity and market access. In light of the euro area experience, we discuss arguments for rebalancing Debt Sustainability Analysis and programme design in favour of cash-flow management. While the official assistance granted to crisis countries in the euro area may not be replicable elsewhere, key lessons from it could foster a reconsideration of the modalities by which official lending institutions handle crises.
H12|Cyber Technology and Arms Race|Cyber technology represents digital military capability with the purpose of causing damage to the military strength and the social infrastructure of a potential enemy. War using conventional weapons may be preceded by or combined with a war using cyber technology. This paper introduces such technology into the theory of conflicts, suggesting the striking proposal that the expected return on cyber investment is convex. It is shown that an asymmetric successful cyber program results in an option for a pre-emptive cyber attack. These features of the model make the cyber technology a first-ranked military investment. The optimal scale of a cyber program of a country expected to have access to a superior cyber capability is derived. It is shown that the asymmetric cyber capability reduces the international arms race but nevertheless raises the likelihood of a war reducing the deterrence.
H12|Offset Contracts as an Insurance Device in Building the National Security| A dynamic multi-stage decision-theoretic approach is introduced to establish the optimal offset and its incidence, the contract price arising from bargaining, and the scale of the acquisition. A new rationale is suggested for offsets in terms of their role as an insurance devise. Results are derived for the pricing of delivery contracts subject to offset claims and their national security implications. It is shown that the national security is strictly convex in the offset transaction. As to the incidence of the offset, the offset claim is shown to be capitalised in the delivery price. The bargaining price is shown to depend on the value of the product to be delivered for the national security, the relative negotiation power of the contracting partners and the social cost of public funds. The analysis highlights the expectation effects of offsets on the bargaining price and the scale of delivery. The results aid in explaining why offsets are widely used in procurement contracts for defence materiel. As they contribute to the national security, they should be allowed to survive and not be denied under competition laws.
H12|Engineering Crises: Favoritism and Strategic Fiscal Indiscipline|If people understand that some macroeconomic policies are unsustainable, why would they vote for them in the .first place? We develop a political economy theory of the endogenous emergence of fiscal crises, based on the idea that the adjustment mechanism to a crisis favors some social groups, that may be induced ex-ante to vote in favor of policies that are more likely to lead to a crisis. People are entitled to a certain level of a publicly provided good, which may be rationed in times of crises. After voting on that level, society votes on the extend to which it will be financed by debt. Under bad enough macro shocks, a crisis arises: taxes are set at their maximum but despite that some agents do not get their entitlement. Some social groups do better in this rationing process than others. We show that public debt .which makes crises more likely .is higher, as is the probability of a crisis, the greater the level of favoritism. If the favored group is important enough to be pivotal when society votes on the entitlement level, favoritism also leads to greater public expenditure. We show that the favored group may strategically favor a weaker state in order to make crises more frequent. Finally, the decisive voter when choosing expenditure may be different from the one when voting on debt. In such a case, constitutional limits on debt may raise the utility of all the poor, relative to the equilibrium outcome absent such limits.
H12|Does the Education Level of Refugees Affect Natives' Attitudes?|In recent years, Europe has experienced an unprecedented influx of refugees. While natives’ attitudes toward refugees are decisive for the political feasibility of asylum policies, little is known about how these attitudes are shaped by refugees’ characteristics. We conducted survey experiments with more than 5,000 university students in Germany in which we exogenously shifted participants’ beliefs about refugees’ education level through information provision. Consistent with economic theory, beliefs about refugees’ education significantly affect concerns about labor market competition. These concerns, however, do not translate into general attitudes because economic aspects are rather unimportant for forming attitudes toward refugees.
H12|The Collateral Policy of Central Banks - An Analysis Focusing on the Eurosystem|Die vorliegende Dissertation wurde von Christopher Weber während seiner Tätigkeit als wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter am Center for Economic Studies (CES) an der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) München verfasst. Sie wurde im Juli 2016 an der volkswirtschaftlichen Fakultät der LMU eingereicht. Ziel der Arbeit ist es, die Ausgestaltung der Pfänderpolitik innerhalb des Zielsystems von Zentralbanken als Instrument der Zentralbankpolitik zu etablieren und praktische Ausgestaltung, Wirkungsweise sowie Auswirkungen darzulegen. Die Arbeit gliedert sich in drei Teile und neun Kapitel. Der erste Teil bespricht die Rolle von Pfändern in der Zentralbankpolitik. Die verschiedenen möglichen Aufgaben und Ziele von Zentralbanken werden historisch abgeleitet. Dann wird die Ausgestaltung der Pfänderpolitik innerhalb dieses Zielsystems besprochen und geschlussfolgert, dass Pfänderpolitik mit Blick auf alle Zentralbankziele von Bedeutung ist. Somit entsteht ein normativer Rahmen für die Rolle von Pfänderpolitik. Im zweiten Teil werden praktische Pfänderpolitikmaßnahmen mit Blick auf diesen Rahmen vorgestellt. Der Fokus liegt dabei auf der Pfänderpolitik des Eurosystems, deren Facetten im Detail erarbeitet werden. Während der Finanz- sowie der Eurokrise hat das Eurosystem seine Pfänderpolitik mit Blick auf verschiedene Zentralbankziele stark intensiviert. Vergleichend werden der historische Einsatz von Pfänderkriterien als Instrument der Zentralbankpolitik und die Ausgestaltung der Pfänderkriterien im Federal Reserve System sowie bei Bank of England und Bank of Japan während der jüngsten Krisenjahre gegenübergestellt. Im dritten Teil geht es zunächst darum, die Wirkungsweise von Pfänderpolitik innerhalb des Zielsystems einer Zentralbank theoretisch zu fundieren. Sie wird dazu in Haircut- und Quantitypolicy gegliedert und klassischer Zinspolitik gegenübergestellt. Der optimale Einsatz von Pfänderpolitik, je nach Zentralbankziel, wird hergeleitet. Anschließend werden Auswirkungen der Ausgestaltung der Pfänderpolitik des Eurosystems aufgedeckt: Ein Kapitel zeigt modelltheoretisch die einseitigen Förderung schlechter Qualitäten durch das Angebot von segmentweise gepoolten Refinanzierungsbedingungen (adverse Selektion der schlechten Pfandqualitäten). Ein weiteres Kapitel geht mit Hilfe eines schematischen Modells auf die Verteilungseffekte innerhalb der Währungsunion durch diesen Poolingansatz ein, die sich gegenüber einer Fiskalunion, wie den USA, dem Vereinigten Königreich oder Japan, wesentlich unterscheiden. Im Ergebnis kann für die Eurozone auf eine Umverteilung zugunsten der Krisenländer geschlossen werden. Schließlich widmet sich ein Kapitel der Suche nach Spuren im Marktverhalten, als Reaktion auf die Politik des Eurosystems. Dazu wird der Datensatz der zentralbankfähigen Sicherheiten im Eurosystem von 2007 bis 2013 angereichert und deskriptiv ausgewertet. Besonders für Pfänder aus Krisenländern und aus dem Bankensektor sind solche Marktreaktionen ableitbar.

H12|A new database for financial crises in European countries|This paper presents a new database for financial crises in European countries, which serves as an important step towards establishing a common ground for macroprudential oversight and policymaking in the EU. The database focuses on providing precise chronological definitions of crisis periods to support the calibration of models in macroprudential analysis. An important contribution of this work is the identification of financial crises by combining a quantitative approach based on a financial stress index with expert judgement from national and European authorities. Key innovations of this database are (i) the inclusion of qualitative information about events and policy responses, (ii) the introduction of a broad set of non-exclusive categories to classify events, and (iii) a distinction between event and post-event adjustment periods. The paper explains the two-step approach for identifying crises and other key choices in the construction of the dataset. Moreover, stylised facts about the systemic crises in the dataset are presented together with estimations of output losses and fiscal costs associated with these crises. A preliminary assessment of the performance of standard early warning indicators based on the new crises dataset confirms findings in the literature that multivariate models can improve compared to univariate signalling models.

H12|Guns and butter? Fighting violence with the promise of development|There is growing awareness that development-oriented government policies may be an important counterinsurgency strategy, but existing papers are usually unable to disentangle various mechanisms. Using a regression-discontinuity design, we analyze the impact of one of the world's largest anti-poverty programs, India's NREGS, on the intensity of Maoist conflict. We find short-run increases of insurgency-related violence, police-initiated attacks, and insurgent attacks on civilians. We discuss how these results relate to established theories in the literature. One mechanism consistent with the empirical patterns is that NREGS induces civilians to share more information with the state, improving police effectiveness.
H12|What explains the speed of recovery from banking crises?|While a large body of research has explored the causes and effects of banking crises, less is known about what determines recovery from banking crises, despite large variations in post-crisis performances across countries. In order to identify local and global factors that determine the length of recovery (i.e. the time it takes until countries reach their pre-crisis level of per capita GDP), this exploratory paper employs event–history analysis on 138 incidents of banking crises between 1970 and 2012. Regarding domestic factors, the simultaneous occurrence of currency crises, large financial sectors, overvalued currencies and large primary deficits are associated with later recovery, whereas higher debt-to-GDP ratios or inflation levels do not exhibit a negative effect on post-crisis performances. Regarding external factors, a low growth of world trade as well as indicators of uncertainty in financial markets are correlated with later recovery. Global interest rate shocks are particularly harmful for the speed of recovery among middle-income countries with a strong reliance on external capital. The results are similar when using the length of recessions as an alternative indicator of post-crisis performances.
H12|Creating change through pilot and demonstration projects: Towards a valuation policy approach|Beyond R&D and competitiveness theories of innovation, various conceptual broadenings have recently been proposed to tackle the complex, multidimensional and multi-level dynamics of innovation at stake in the transformation of the economy and society towards new sustainable development regimes. This paper proposes a reading of these conceptual broadenings as a matter of ‘valuation’. In line with pragmatic theories of socio-economic value and market construction, it is argued that value creation is not the result or byproduct of innovation. In contrast to traditional regulation and R&D policies, which confine themselves to framing innovation, valuation policies are endogenous triggers of the transformation of a value regime. Value creation is about inquiring into new values in society, translating them into social and technological solutions and making them valuable in markets. In this perspective, pilot and demonstration (P&D) projects in current transition policies can be interpreted as fundamental inceptions of new values that are not predetermined by innovation but actuated through complex processes of value co-creation in society and markets, and which engage policies as agents of change. By focusing on the purpose behind the sustainability transition rather than the factors that contribute to it, a valuation policy approach offers new insights for future research and policy.
H12|Tourism Stocks in Times of Crises: An Econometric Investigation of Unexpected Non-macroeconomic Factors|Following the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, the European media emphatically pronounced that billions of Euros were wiped from tourism related stocks. The theoretical relationship of the industry with such unexpected non-macro incidents received moderate academic coverage. Nevertheless, the quantifiable impact of such events on tourism-specific stock values, both in terms of returns and volatility, is still a barren landscape. Using econometric methodology, the paper investigates the reaction of five hospitality/tourism stock indices to 150 incidents depicting major Acts of Terrorism, ‘Acts of God’, and War conflicts in the 21st Century. Empirical findings underscore the effect of such incidents on hospitality/tourism stock indices, with distinctive differences among the different types, the specificities of each event, and the five regions under investigation. This paper contributes to the extant literature and enhances our conceptual capital pertaining to the industry’s current financial practices that are related to stock performance and behavior.
H12|Experience of Greece on Recapitalization of Banks, Marketing Management and Personnel Retraining in Conditions of Economic Recession|The article covers instruments which are aimed at strengthening of global and national financial and credit systems, encouraging banks recapitalization, techniques of marketing management of financial and credit sector development focused on ensuring financial stability of banks. The authors consider also basic methods of banking market services regulation, point out specific issues of bank management and human recourse management development in conditions of economic recession. Greek experience of anti-crisis measures has revealed key factors and peculiarities of the changes that were brought by the global financial crisis of 2008-2010 to development of banking systems of the countries implementing the model of “catch-up development”. The experience of Greece in development and application of regulatory instruments has shown that if in the period of long sustainable economic growth for countries having emerging markets an opportunity to use the methods and control systems of developed countries can be visible, then with the appearance of negative scenarios system limitations come to the fore and the risks associated with high degree of uncertainty are realized.
H12|New Scenarios of Joint Crises Fighting in Socio-Economic Sphere of Russia and Greece|The purpose of the article is to verify this hypothesis and to determine the newest scenarios of joint overcoming of crises in socio-economic sphere of Russia and Greece. The work uses the method of statistical analysis, with the help of which the authors study the dynamics of socio-economic development of Russia and Greece in 2008-2014 and determine common tendencies and regularities. As a result of the research, the authors found out that Russia and Greece are peculiar for common socio-economic problems which cause similar crises, which leads to expedience of unification of efforts of both countries for their joint effective solution. This research distinguishes three most perspective directions of fighting crises in socio-economic sphere and offers three possible scenarios of joint crisis fighting in socio-economic sphere of Russia and Greece: innovations-oriented, business-oriented, and institution-oriented scenario, with development of the authors’ concept of joint crises fighting in socio-economic sphere of Russia and Greece.
H12|A Macroeconomic Model with Occasional Financial Crises|Financial crises are born out of prolonged credit booms and depressed productivity. At times, they are initiated by relatively small shocks. Consistent with these empirical observations, this paper extends a standard macroeconomic model to include financial intermediation, long-term defaultable loans, and occasional financial crises. Within this framework, crises are typically preceded by prolonged boom periods. During such episodes, intermediaries expand their lending and leverage, thereby building up financial fragility. Crises are generally initiated by a moderate adverse shock that puts pressure on intermediaries’ balance sheets, triggering a creditor run, a contraction in new lending, and ultimately a deep and persistent recession.
H12|Historical Patterns of Inequality and Productivity around Financial Crises|To understand the determinants of financial crises, previous research focused on developments closely related to financial markets. In contrast, this paper considers changes originating in the real economy as drivers of financial instability. Based on long-run historical data for advanced economies, I find that rising top income inequality and low productivity growth are robust predictors of crises – even outperforming well known early-warning indicators such as credit growth. Moreover, if crises are preceded by such developments, output declines more during the subsequent recession. In addition, I show that asset booms explain the relation between income inequality and financial crises in the data.
H12|Does going easy on distressed banks help the macroeconomy?|During banking crises, regulators often relax their requirements and refrain from closing troubled banks. I estimate the real effects of such regulatory forbearance during the U.S. savings and loan crisis by comparing states' economic outcomes by the amount of forbearance they receive. As instruments, I use historical variation in deposit insurance of similar financial intermediaries (thrifts) and exploit geographic variation in principal supervisory agent (PSA). The evidence suggests a policy-induced real estate boom during forbearance (1982-89), followed by a bigger bust in real estate and real GDP. The relationship does not appear driven by the ex ante size, industry exposure, or systematic cyclicality of a state.
H12|Engineering Crises: Favoritism and Strategic Fiscal Indiscipline|If people understand that some macroeconomic policies are unsustainable, why would they vote for them in the first place? We develop a political economy theory of the endogenous emergence of fiscal crises, based on the idea that the adjustment mechanism to a crisis favors some social groups, that may be induced ex-ante to vote in favor of policies that are more likely to lead to a crisis. People are entitled to a certain level of a publicly provided good, which may be rationed in times of crises. After voting on that level, society votes on the extend to which it will be financed by debt. Under bad enough macro shocks, a crisis arises: taxes are set at their maximum but despite that some agents do not get their entitlement. Some social groups do better in this rationing process than others. We show that public debt -- which makes crises more likely -- is higher, as is the probability of a crisis, the greater the level of favoritism. If the favored group is important enough to be pivotal when society votes on the entitlement level, favoritism also leads to greater public expenditure. We show that the favored group may strategically favor a weaker state in order to make crises more frequent. Finally, the decisive voter when choosing expenditure may be different from the one when voting on debt. In such a case, constitutional limits on debt may raise the utility of all the poor, relative to the equilibrium outcome absent such limits.
H12|The Bank of England as lender of last resort: new historical evidence from daily transactional data|We use daily transactional ledger data from the Bank of England’s Archive to test whether and to what extent the Bank of England during the mid-nineteenth century adhered to Walter Bagehot’s rule that a central bank in a financial crisis should lend cash freely at a penalty rate in exchange for ‘good’ securities. The archival data we use provides granular, loan-level insight on the price and quantity of credit, and information on its distribution to particular counterparties. We find that the Bank’s behaviour during this period broadly conforms to Bagehot’s rule, though with variation across the crises of 1847, 1857 and 1866. Using a new, higher frequency series on the Bank’s balance sheet, we find that the Bank did lend freely, with the number of discounts and advances increasing during crises. These loans were typically granted at a rate above pre-crisis levels and, in 1857 and 1866, typically at a spread above Bank Rate, though we also find some instances in the daily discount ledgers where individual loans were made below Bank rate in 1847. Another set of customer ledgers shows that the securities the Bank purchased were debts owed by a geographically and industrially diverse set of debtors. And using new data on the Bank’s income and dividends, we find the Bank and its shareholders profited from lender of last resort operations. We conclude our paper by relating our findings to contemporary debates including those regarding the provision of emergency liquidity to shadow banks.
H12|Optimal Fiscal And Monetary Policy, Debt Crisis, And Management|The initial government debt-to-GDP ratio and the government’s commitment play a pivotal role in determining the welfare-optimal speed of fiscal consolidation in the management of a debt crisis. Under commitment, for low or moderate initial government debt-to-GPD ratios, the optimal consolidation is very slow. A faster pace is optimal when the economy starts from a high level of public debt implying high sovereign risk premia, unless these are suppressed via a bailout by official creditors. Under discretion, the cost of not being able to commit is reflected into a quick consolidation of government debt. Simple monetary-fiscal rules with passive fiscal policy, designed for an environment with “normal shocks”, perform reasonably well in mimicking the Ramsey-optimal response to one-off government debt shocks. When the government can issue also long-term bonds–under commitment–the optimal debt consolidation pace is slower than in the case of short-term bonds only, and entails an increase in the ratio between long and short-term bonds.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H12|Averting Catastrophes that Kill|"We face a variety of potential catastrophes; nuclear or bioterrorism, a climate catastrophe, and a ""mega-virus"" are examples. Martin and Pindyck (AER 2015) showed that decisions to avert such catastrophes are interdependent, so that simple cost-benefit analysis breaks down. They assumed that catastrophic events cause ""destruction,"" i.e., a reduction in the stream of consumption. But some catastrophes cause death instead of, or in addition to, destruction. Here we incorporate death in a model of catastrophe avoidance, and show how it affects the interdependence of catastrophic events and the ""willingness to pay"" to avoid those events."
H12|The Rise, the Fall, and the Resurrection of Iceland|This paper documents how the Icelandic banking system grew from 100 percent of GDP in 1998 to 9 times GDP in 2008 when it failed. We base the analysis on data from the banks that was made public when the Icelandic parliament lifted among others bank secrecy laws to investigate the run up to the financial crisis. We document how the banks were funded, and where the money went with a comprehensive analysis of their lending. We also analyze policies implemented after the crash, including emergency legislation, capital control, alleviation of balance of payment risks and preservation of the financial stability. We estimate the output costs of the crisis, which was about average relative to the 147 banking crisis documented Laeven and Valencia (2012) and the 100 banking crisis documented by Reinhart and Rogoff (2014). Our computation of the governments direct costs, reveals that the recently concluded negotiation with foreign creditors may leave the Icelandic government in net surplus as a consequence of the crisis, although there is still some uncertainty about the ultimate cost and our benchmark estimate is a cost corresponding to 5 percent of GDP. We summarize several lessons from the episode.
H12|Managing disaster-related contingent liabilities in public finance frameworks|Natural disasters have caused, and continue to cause, a significant amount of economic costs. The costs of disasters are often, and to a large extent, shouldered by governments, especially in economies where private insurance markets are not well developed. Governments are asked to provide financing for explicit commitments made prior to a disaster, and are often under pressure to make payments for which no such commitments were made earlier. Ex-post costs to governments take the form of contingent liabilities within national budgeting and government balance sheet frameworks. Disasters can thereby cause both downside risks to government revenue as well as to expenditure. There is little evidence, and hence limited policy advice, on how disaster-related contingent liabilities are managed by governments. This paper sets out to clarify the concept of contingent liabilities and the channels through which they can impact government balance sheets, including fiscal risks. It provides a framework for identifying and quantifying disaster-related contingent liabilities with a view to inform country case studies for comparative policy analysis.
H12|Organizational Resilience of Family Business: Case Study|Organizational resilience, understood as an ability to survive in harsh market conditions, captures increased research consideration in recent years. The same applies to family businesses that attracted significant attention lately. Although the interest in the topic grows, there are still remaining questions to be answered. In the paper we focus on identifying factors affecting organizational abilities to adapt to dynamic, hostile and complex environment especially when disruptive events occur in the environment. Literature studies in the topic allowed development of research proposition - organizational resilience should help to survive negative occurrences in the environment and family business should focus their attention on building resilience capacity while it may allow and facilitate longevity and well-being of an organization. We illustrate this proposition with the use of two family company cases from the Silesian Voivodeship. The first is a case of a large production company that existed between 2010 and 2013, and after receiving increased growth in 2005-2012 period it went bankrupt in 2014 after two large contracts. The second is a case of a developer company from the same region that started its operation in the same period and managed to develop both its market and products in years. We compare the data flowing from interviews with the owners (that are also managers of these companies) using Eisenhardt (1989) methodology and that leads to creation of propositions for future research. Research results indicate there are several factors influencing ability to cope with critical situations. Firstly, we identified that professionalization of management of family business leads to better chances to survive in the environment. Secondly, we conclude that awareness to weak signals diminishes the probability of risky behaviors and helps to survive in dynamic, hostile environment.
H12|Kryzys gospodarczy w Federacji Rosyjskiej w kontekscie imigracji z panstw WNP|Szereg zmian w kierunku wiekszej otwartosci na naplyw obcokrajowej sily roboczej podjetych w ostatnich latach w Federacji Rosyjskiej sklania do analiz imigracji do tego kraju. Przyjete rozwiazania w sferze polityki migracyjnej nie pozostaja bowiem bez wplywu na inne regiony docelowe (np. UE). Liberalizacja w zakresie dostepu migrantow do rosyjskiego rynku pracy wpisuje sie bowiem w szerszy problem: konkurencji (w skali miedzynarodowej) o naplyw zagranicznej sily roboczej. W tym kontekscie, warte zbadania jest jak kryzys, ktory dotknal gospodarke rosyjska, wplynal na ksztaltowanie sie skali imigracji do Rosji z glownych panstw wysylajacych, tj. z krajow Wspolnoty Niepodleglych Panstw (WNP). Celem artykulu jest ukazanie wplywu kryzysu, jaki dotknal gospodarke rosyjska w ostatnich latach na skale imigracji z panstw WNP do Rosji. Glowna hipoteza przyjmuje nastepujace brzmienie: czynnikiem wyjasniajacym imigracje z panstw WNP do Rosji jest zroznicowanie poziomu dobrobytu mierzonego PKB per capita (PPP) pomiedzy panstwem wysylajacym a panstwem docelowym. Zalozenie ukazania wplywu kryzysu gospodarczego w Rosji na imigracje do tego kraju implikuje zastosowanie analizy korelacji i analizy regresji. Jak zostanie wykazane, pomimo spadku PKB w Rosji imigracja do Rosji z panstw WNP nie spada. Jest to zatem zaleznosc odmienna od zalozen ekonomii neoklasycznej, zgodnie z ktora zmniejszenie zroznicowania w poziomie dobrobytu miedzy panstwem wysylajacym a docelowym powoduje zmniejszenie skali migracji miedzynarodowych. Jak zostanie wyjasnione, nie we wszystkich panstwach WNP skala migracji do Rosji moze byc wyjasniona zroznicowaniem poziomu PKB per capita, a glownego znaczenia w ksztaltowaniu skali migracji do Rosji nabieraja m. in. czynniki polityczne, konflikty czy procesy naturalizacji.
H12|What To Do If The Stock Market Crashes?|If the Stock Market crashes, the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) ought to open the Discount Window to Main Street, by making 1. loans only for the creation of real wealth; 2. loans at cost; 3. loans to benefit as large a number of people as possible by issuing loans to individual entrepreneurs, cooperatives, corporations with ESOPs and/or CSOPs as well as to public agencies with taxing power to fund infrastructure projects.
H12|Economic Crises and Globalisation as Drivers of Pension Privatisation: an Empirical Analysis|Pension systems are core institutional arrangements that are expected to be stable and reliable over consecutive generations. Nevertheless, reforms in pension provision intensified over the past decades, with several countries opting for privatisation of their pension system. We ask which factors lead governments to privatise pension systems and focus on economic crises and different facets of increased global pressures. We conduct duration analyses on a cross-section of nearly 100 economies among which 28 privatise their pension system between 1981 and 2012. Consistent with the crisis-begets-reform hypothesis, we find that severe economic crises speed up reform implementation. Likewise, high growth in economic and political globalisation is conducive for pension privatisation. These findings are robust to a variety of alternations in the empirical methodology.
H12|Analysing the Relevance of the MIP Scoreboard's Indicators|The EU established an early warning system by introducing the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP) in the wake of the recent recession. Nevertheless, it has been found by some authors to be rather vague when launching the Excessive Imbalances Procedure. Performed analysis reflects on such views and treats the MIP indicators as a system while assessing the significance of all particular variables separately. This assessment was accomplished by applying a multivariate unbalanced logit model, utilising all 14 MIP headline indicators, using time horizons ranging from one to three years before crisis, which was represented by periods with output gap lower than negative 2 per cent. The approach was confronted with the estimates of a linear probability model to provide an idea about the robustness of the results. In the short term, activity rates, youth unemployment rates and private sector debt are the best performing indicators, complemented by current account balances in the long term.

H12|Tourism stocks in times of crises: An econometric investigation of non-macro factors|Following the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, the European media emphatically pronounced that billions of euros were wiped from tourism related stocks. This comes at a troublesome time for the tourism industry, in the midst of a global financial crisis, and the unpredictable rise of radical Islamic ideologies, which have caused chaos in the Middle East and Europe. The relationship and vulnerability of the industry to non-macro incidents have been well documented in the literature, mostly in theoretical terms. Nevertheless, the quantifiable impact of such events on tourism-specific stock values, both in terms of returns and volatility, received much less attention. With the use of an econometric methodology, the paper aims to enhance our conceptual capital pertaining to the effects of such possibilities on five hospitality and tourism stock indices. The empirical findings are of interest to stakeholders at all echelons of the spectra of the tourism and financial industries.
H12|Financial Development, Growth, and Crisis: Is There a Trade-Off?|"This paper reviews the evolving literature that links financial development, financial crises, and economic growth in the past 20 years. The initial disconnect—with one literature focusing on the effect of financial deepening on long-run growth and another studying its impact on volatility and crisis—has given way to a more nuanced approach that analyzes the two phenomena in an integrated framework. The main finding of this literature is that financial deepening leads to a trade-off between higher economic growth and higher crisis risk; and its main conclusion is that, for at least middle-income countries, the positive growth effects outweigh the negative crisis risk impact. This balanced view has been revisited recently for advanced economies, where an emerging and controversial literature supports the notion of ""too much finance,"" suggesting that there might be a threshold beyond which financial depth becomes detrimental for economic growth by crowding out other productive activities and misallocating resources. Nevertheless, the growth/crisis trade-off is alive and strong for a large share of the world economy. Recognizing the intrinsic trade-offs of financial development can provide a useful framework to design policies targeting financial deepening, diversity, and inclusion. In particular, acknowledging the trade-offs can highlight the need for complementary policies to mitigate the risks, from financial macroprudential policies to monetary policy frameworks that monitor the growth of credit and asset prices."
H12|From Fiscal Austerity towards Growth-Enhancing Fiscal Policy in Ukraine|The study analyses the dynamics and the structure of Ukraine’s public finances. It assesses the medium-term impact of fiscal austerity 2014-2016, examines fiscal sustainability and estimates further fiscal adjustment efforts. It evaluates the economic and social implications of current fiscal policies especially on education, health and other social indicators. It examines the benefits and costs of the medium-term budget for 2017‑2019 with an emphasis on evolving challenges and puts forward policy recommendations aimed at a successful implementation of growth-enhancing economic reforms.
H12|Export market shares – a trivial concept?|The European Commission and euro area central banks use different methods to calculate export market shares and rely on different data sources to do so. Thus, the resulting evidence varies considerably over time, prompting different economic policy conclusions with respect to the development of export competitiveness – which is an undesirable fact. This paper presents methods and data sources used to derive export market shares with a view to explaining these differences. We conclude that the export market share concept is trivial only at a first glance because it can be implemented in a number of ways none of which would appear to be the single best practice.
H12|Approaching effects of the economic crisis on university efficiency: a comparative study of Germany and Italy|Abstract In this paper, we compare the efficiency of the Italian and German universities in the process of transforming public funding into the multiple outputs of a university, i.e. graduating students, publishing research, and patenting activity. We do this with a particular focus on the policies implemented following the financial crisis in 2008. Using a sample of 133 public universities, of which 73 public universities in Germany and 60 public universities in Italy observed over the period 2006–2011 we find that Italian universities perform significantly better in terms of output maximization than German universities. The crisis does not show a general impact, while the treatment effect indicates that Italian universities coped better during the crisis than their German counterparts at a highly significant level.
H12|Capital injection to banks versus debt relief to households|House financing has played a prominent role in advanced economies. In addition, most of the banking crises in advanced economies were associated with boom-bust cycles in house prices. Prominent researchers suggest that more grants for household debt reduction would have provided a significant boost to the economy lacking aggregate demand after the Great Recession of 2007. In contrast, leading policy makers at that time, such as Geithner and Summers, argue differently. In his paper, Yoo comes up with a dynamic stochastic equilibrium (DSGE) model to evaluate the relative effectiveness of a policy to inject capital into banks versus a policy to relieve households of mortgage debt. He concludes that in the middle of a housing debt crisis, when households are highly leveraged, the short-run effects of the debt relief policy are more substantial. When the zero lower bound is additionally considered, the debt relief policy can be much more powerful in boosting the economy both in the short-run and in the long-run.
H12|Information, perceived education level, and attitudes toward refugees: Evidence from a randomized survey experiment|From 2014 onwards, Europe has witnessed an unprecedented influx of refugees. We conducted a survey experiment with almost 5,000 university students in Germany in which we randomly shifted the perception of refugees’ education level through information provision. We find that the perceived education level significantly affects respondents’ concerns regarding labor market competition, but these concerns do not translate into general attitudes toward refugees.
H12|ICT and resilience in times of crisis: Evidence from cross-country micro moments data|ICT-intensive firms are often found to have a better performance than their non-ICTintensive counterparts. Along with investing in ICT capital they have to adapt their production and business processes in order to reap the potentials implied by the use of ICT. Are these firms also more resilient in times of crisis? We study this question by exploiting a novel and unique data set from the Microments Database. Covering 12 countries, 7 industries and the period from 2001 to 2010, the data allow us to distinguish between ICT-intensive and non-ICT-intensive firms within industries. We find evidence that indeed during the crisis in 2008 and 2009, ICT-intensive firms were hit less hard with respect to their productivity. This holds in particular for firms from service industries. Moreover, ICT-intensive firms were also more successful in introducing process innovations during that period which could explain their better productivity performance compared to non-ICT intensive firms.
H12|On some recent proposals of public debt restructuring in the Eurozone|This chapter deals with the issue of sovereign debts in the Eurozone. After a brief discussion of the reasons for their reduction, the different strategies used in the past to this end are considered. It is argued that they are either not viable today or can assure only limited results. Thus, the policy of accumulating primary surpluses seems the only practicable one. However, the alternative of restructuring has been investigated with growing attention. Two distinct perspectives have been followed. On one side, a number of proposals deal with the issue of existing debt. There are reasons to doubt that they are substantially different from the policies currently followed. On the other side, several projects are aimed at establishing a permanent insolvency mechanism for sovereigns, with the purpose of making effective the no bail-out principle. The question is raised as to whether they are feasible in the absence of any element of fiscal union.
H12|Spanish Public Finances through the Financial Crisis|Spain’s public finances have been under significant stress during the crisis, despite pre-crisis fiscal surpluses and low levels of public debt. The impact of the crisis and an initial phase of counter-cyclical activism exacerbated the existing (structural) fiscal vulnerabilities. To correct the fiscal imbalances, a significant number of bold policy actions were taken, affecting taxation, public spending, national fiscal rules and the structure of the public sector. In this paper we discuss the evolution of public finances in Spain during the financial crisis, framing crisis-related fiscal policy measures within medium-term economic trends and focusing on policy responses to the financial crisis. We also touch upon the main policy challenges ahead.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H12|Can a Bank Run Be Stopped? Government Guarantees and the Run on Continental Illinois|This paper analyzes the run on Continental Illinois in 1984. We find that the run slowed but did not stop following an extraordinary government intervention, which included the guarantee of all liabilities of the bank and a commitment to provide ongoing liquidity support. Continental's outflows were driven by a broad set of US and foreign financial institutions. These were large, sophisticated creditors with holdings far in excess of the insurance limit. During the initial run, creditors with relatively liquid balance sheets nevertheless withdrew more than other creditors, likely reflecting low tolerance to hold illiquid assets. In addition, smaller and more-distant creditors were more likely to withdraw. In the second and more drawn out phase of the run, institutions with relative large exposures to Continental were more likely to withdraw, reflecting a general unwillingness to have an outsized exposure to a troubled institution even in the absence of credit risk. Finally, we show that the concentration of holdings of Continental's liabilities was a key dynamic in the run and was importantly linked to Continental's systemic importance.

H12|Prezidentská Diplomacie: Srovnání Tří Brazilských Prezidentů (Presidential Diplomacy: Three Brazilian Presidents In A Comparative Perspective)|Role Brazílie na mezinárodní scéně roste od začátku nového milénia. V prezidentském politickém systému může hlava státu upravovat své zapojení do rozhodovacího procesu, a tak prezident F. H. Cardoso ukončil tradiční delegování zahraniční politiky výhradně Ministerstvu zahraničních věcí a představil nový fenomén prezidentské diplomacie. Odborníci však předpokládali, že po odchodu prezidenta Cardosa dojde k jeho úpadku. Komplexní analýza proaktivního zapojení posledních tří brazilských prezidentů do diplomacie ukazuje, že očekávání o vymizení prezidentské diplomacie se nenaplnila a že předchozí osobní zájem a zkušenost v dané oblasti mají rozhodující vliv na zahraničněpolitickou aktivitu prezidentů. Brazil’s role on the international scene has been growing since the beginning of the new millennium. In the presidential political system, the head of state can adjust his/her own involvement in decision-making processes, and so President F. H. Cardoso ended the traditional delegation of foreign policy exclusively to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and introduced a new phenomenon of presidential diplomacy. Scholars expected its decline after his retirement. A complex analysis of last three Brazilian presidents’ pro-active engagement in diplomacy concludes that these expectations did not prove true and that the previous personal interest and experience in the field have a decisive influence on presidents’ activity in foreign policy.
H12|Reading Between the Lines: Prediction of Political Violence Using Newspaper Text|This article provides a new methodology to predict armed conflict by using newspaper text. Through machine learning, vast quantities of newspaper text are reduced to interpretable topics. We propose the use of the within-country variation of these topics to predict the timing of conflict. This allows us to avoid the tendency of predicting conflict only in countries where it occurred before. We show that the within-country variation of topics is an extremely robust predictor of conflict and becomes particularly useful when new conflict risks arise. Two aspects seem to be responsible for these features. Topics provide depth because they consist of changing, long lists of terms which makes them able to capture the changing context of conflict. At the same time topics provide width because they summarize all text, including coverage of stabilizing factors.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H12|Reconciling insurance with market discipline: A blueprint for a European fiscal union|This contribution develops a blueprint for a European fiscal union. The proposal addresses the shortcomings of most other reform designs which do not offer a solution for insolvent or noncooperative euro countries. We suggest a design which combines fiscal insurance with an orderly procedure to restructure the debt of an insolvent euro member. We show that fiscal insurance and a sovereign insolvency procedure are no contradiction but, on the contrary, mutually enforcing: An effective fiscal insurance helps to limit the stability risks involved in the implementation of an insolvency regime for sovereigns. And vice versa, a well-defined insolvency procedure reduces the danger that a fiscal capacity motivated as an insurance against transitory asymmetric shocks degenerates into a permanent transfer system. Moreover, we show that both elements are a helpful complement for the functioning of the European banking union and the new European fiscal governance.
H12|How to Handle the Crisis in Greece? Empirical Evidence Based on a Survey of Economics Experts|We asked experts from 113 countries polled by the CESifo World Economic Survey for their opinions on how to handle the crisis in Greece. 61.9% of the experts surveyed were not in favour of Greece exiting the Eurozone in the course of the negotiations held in June and July 2015. However, experts in countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Denmark, and Slovakia were in favour of Greece exiting the Eurozone. The share of experts who were in favour of Greece staying in the Eurozone increased to 69.8% in October 2015. 72.4% of experts surveyed believed that the IMF should provide credit to Greece and 83.6% stated that the IMF should engage in economic reform programmes. Econometric evidence shows that experts from those Eurozone countries with high public debt-to-GDP-ratios were less likely to support the Grexit: when the debt-to-GDP-ratio increased by one percentage point, the likelihood of survey participants favouring the Grexit decreased by around 0.35 percentage points. Support for IMF reforms, by contrast, proved far less controversial.
H12|Regional heterogeneity, the rise of public debt and monetary policy in post-bubble Japan: lessons for the EMU|Abstract Both Japan and parts of the European Monetary Union have experienced boom and bust in stock and real estate markets, which have been followed by a lasting crisis. The paper analyses the role of a high degree of regional heterogeneity for public debt and monetary policy in the context of crisis. It is shown for Japan that the attempts to maintain regional cohesion via a regional transfer mechanism has contributed to the unprecedented rise in public debt and persistent monetary expansion. Econometric estimations show that in Japan regional redistribution of funds has ensured homogeneous living conditions across Japanese regions pre- and post-crisis. The side condition is monetary expansion. A similar effect could emerge in Europe, if the crisis persists.
H12|The Collateral Framework of the Eurosystem and Its Fiscal Implications|"Die vorliegende Arbeit wurde von Jakob Eberl während seiner Tätigkeit als Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter am Center for Economic Studies (CES) an der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) München erstellt. Sie wurde im Dezember 2015 abgeschlossen und von der Volkswirtschaftlichen Fakultät der LMU München als Dissertation angenommen. Die Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit dem Sicherheitenrahmen des Eurosystems und dessen fiskalischen Implikationen. Sie umfasst sieben Kapitel (ohne Einleitung und Schluss), die in zwei Teile gegliedert werden können. Der erste Teil beinhaltet die Kapitel 2 bis 5 und analysiert den Sicherheitenrahmen des Eurosystems. Kapitel 2 gibt eine Einführung in die Entwicklung der Geldpolitik des Eurosystems während der Finanz- und Staatsschuldenkrise. Die Pfänderkriterien des Eurosystems werden dabei als essentiell für das Umsetzen dieser Geldpolitik identifiziert. Kapitel 3 präsentiert eine umfassende Analyse der im Sicherheitenrahmen des Eurosystems verankerten Pfänderkriterien, indem es eine narrative Datenbank von allgemeinen Prinzipien und Änderungen erstellt. Darüber hinaus werden Effekte von Änderungen der Pfänderkriterien auf die notenbankfähigen Sicherheiten („Sicherheitenpool"") hinsichtlich verschiedener Aspekte herausgearbeitet. Kapitel 4 beschäftigt sich mit der Risikokontrolle des Eurosystems und legt dar, wie diese in den vergangenen Jahren angepasst wurde. Ferner werden Schwächen der Risikokontrolle aufgezeigt. Kapitel 5 untersucht Effekte der Pfänderkriterien und der Risikokontrolle, indem es die Entwicklung der Bonität der dem Eurosystem verpfändeten Sicherheiten nachvollzieht. Das innerhalb dieses Kapitels erarbeitete Modell zeigt, dass Banken Sicherheiten minderer Qualität dem Eurosystem verpfänden, während qualitativ hochwertige Sicherheiten am Markt genutzt werden („adverse Selektion von Pfändern""). Der zweite Teil der Dissertation umfasst die Kapitel 6 bis 8 und untersucht die fiskalischen Implikationen des Sicherheitenrahmens. Kapitel 6 entwickelt das Instrumentarium zur Analyse der fiskalischen Implikationen, welche vor dem Hintergrund der fiskalischen Tragfähigkeit durchgeführt wird. Das Erweitern des Konzepts der fiskalischen Tragfähigkeit um Unsicherheit ermöglicht das Formulieren eines intuitiven Indikators zur Beurteilung der fiskalischen Implikationen. Kapitel 7 untersucht die fiskalische Implikation, die aus der Bedeutung dieser Kriterien für die finanzielle Lage einer Notenbank und der engen Verbindung zwischen dieser finanziellen Lage und dem Staatshaushalt resultiert. Das Kapitel bestimmt ein aus fiskalischer Sicht optimales Niveau der Pfänderkriterien und zeigt, dass einheitliche Pfänderkriterien in einer Währungsunion aus heterogenen Staaten länderübergreifende fiskalische Implikationen bergen. Kapitel 8 adressiert die fiskalische Implikation, die aus der Bedeutung der Kriterien für den Anreiz eines Staates explizite Garantien auszusprechen, resultieren. Das Kapitel zeigt, dass der Sicherheitenrahmen des Eurosystems Spielraum für Staaten birgt, notenbankfähige Sicherheiten durch explizite Garantien zu schaffen. Dieser Spielraum muss berücksichtigt werden, wenn das aus fiskalischer Sicht optimale Niveau expliziter Staatsgarantien bestimmt wird. Abschließend schlägt die Dissertation auf Basis der gewonnenen Ergebnisse Verbesserungen der im Sicherheitenrahmen des Eurosystems verankerten Pfänderkriterien und Risikokontrolle vor."
H12|Personal der öffentlichen Verwaltung in Nordrhein-Westfalen: Entwicklungen und Handlungsoptionen zur Neustrukturierung|In dem Gutachten werden ein Überblick der Personalausgaben und der Personalstruktur des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen gegeben und Handlungsoptionen für die Personalpolitik des Landes abgeleitet. Im Jahr 2012 stellten die direkten und indirekten Personalausgaben in Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW) 43% der Gesamtausgaben des Landes und 28% der Gesamtausgaben aller Gemeinden dar. Organisatorische und haushaltstechnische Veränderungen, insbesondere die Ausgliederung öffentlicher Aufgaben aus dem Kernhaushalt, erschweren eine transparente Erfassung der Ausgaben. Wegen der Ausgliederungen, Kostenvorteile aufgrund der hohen Bevölkerungszahl und einem hohen Kommunalisierungsgrad lagen die direkten Personalausgaben des Landes NRW im Jahr 2012 mit 1.220 Euro pro Kopf unter dem Durchschnitt der westdeutschen Bundesländer, während die Ausgaben der Gemeinden mit 651 Euro pro Kopf über dem Durchschnitt lagen.
H12|Foundations of the Soviet Command Economy, 1917 to 1941|In a command economy, centralized political priorities take precedence over market equilibrium, and government purchases cannot be refused. This chapter describes the antecedents, origins, evolution, and outcomes of the Soviet command economy from the Bolshevik Revolution to World War II. The Soviet command economy was built in two phases, 1917 to 1920, and 1928 onward, with a ‘breathing space’ between. The present account gives prominence to features of a command economy that, while missing from the first phase, were developed during the breathing space, and then helped to ensure the relative success of the second phase. These were features that assured secrecy, security, and the selection of economic officials for competence and party loyalty. Like any economy in the international system, the command economy had a comparative advantage: the production of economic and military power.
H12|Funding Liquidity, Market Liquidity and the Cross-Section of Stock Returns|Following theory, we check that funding risk connects illiquidity, volatility and returns in the cross-section of stocks. We show that the illiquidity and volatility of stocks increase with funding shocks, while contemporaneous returns decrease with funding shocks. The dispersions of illiquidity, volatility and returns widen following funding shocks. Funding risk is priced, generating a returns spread of 4.25 percent (annually) between the most and least illiquid portfolios, and of 5.30 percent between the most and least volatile portfolios. Estimates are robust using mimicking portfolio returns, alternative portfolio sorts, traditional test assets, other risk factors, monthly returns or quarterly returns.
H12|Políticas públicas desde las crisis económicas y sociales, en el marco de los Estados y territorios emergentes|En el presente artículo se aborda la política pública en dos aspectos: por una parte, la emergencia social, la crisis institucional y económica en algunos países de Latinoamérica, así como su estructura compleja y sistémica; por otra, la formulación e implementación de las políticas públicas, que son consideradas en el marco de las crisis internacionales de los estados de emergencia. Por medio del análisis multicriterio se establecerán los argumentos relacionados con la capacidad de gestión, los resultados o el trabajo en diferentes sectores. Luego, mediante el designing process, se sustentará explicativamente el problema a través de la revisión económica, jurídica, política y social. Finalmente, se valoran las bondades de las políticas públicas en las situaciones trascendentales o difíciles que requieran de su asomo o su plena presencia.******The present article approaches two aspects of public policy. On the one hand, we have social emergence, the institutional and economic crisis in some Latin American countries, as well as its complex and systematic structure. On the other, it looks at the formulation and implementation of public policies, considered within the framework of the international crises ofthe states of emergency. Through a multi-criteria analysis, arguments related to the management capacity, and the results or work in different sectors are established. Then, using a process of design, the problem will be explained through a review of the economic, legal, political, and social arenas. Finally, the virtues of the public policies in transcendental or difficult situations that require their appearance or full presence will be evaluated.
H12|Institutional conditioning of the German labour market in the face of the global economic crisis 2008–2009|Aim: The scientific objective of this study is an attempt to clarify the institutional aspects of the functioning of the labour market in Germany that are relevant to the response to the global economic crisis of 2008–2009. Motivation: The reaction of German labour market was totally different than during previous recessions and the explanation of the sources of this response constitutes the main motivation to undertake this study. The considerations rely on the thesis that it could be attributed to the institutional infrastructure combined with clever economic policy of the state and responsible behaviour of social partners. The economic theory suggests how an isolated institution functions, but in the real world they works in the whole institutional network. Therefore the broader context and some linkages are mentioned. Results: After a brief review of the main macroeconomic indicators and selected labour market institutions in Germany in comparison to the OECD countries, the labour market reforms undertaken in the period between 2002 and 2007 will be discussed. Then, selected on the basis of literature studies, institutional buffers of the labour market mitigating shocks are examined with particular emphasis on the instruments of internal flexibility, social partners’ behaviour and institutional connections of labour markets with other domains of economic order. The elements of institutional framework are subject to qualitative analysis backed up by available official statistical data.
H12|Fiscal implications of central bank balance sheet policies|Under ordinary circumstances, the fiscal implications of central bank policies tend to be seen as relatively minor and escape close scrutiny. The global financial crisis of 2008, however, demanded an extraordinary response by central banks which brought to light the immense power of central bank balance sheet policies as well as their major fiscal implications. Once the zero lower bound on interest rates is reached, expanding a central bank's balance sheet becomes the central instrument for providing additional monetary policy accommodation. However, with interest rates near zero, the line separating fiscal and monetary policy is blurred. Furthermore, discretionary decisions associated with asset purchases and liquidity provision, as well as with lender-of-last-resort operations benefiting private entities, can have major distributional effects that are ordinarily associated with fiscal policy. In the euro area, discretionary central bank decisions can have immense distributional effects across member states. However, decisions of this nature are incompatible with the role of unelected officials in democratic societies. Drawing on the response to the crisis by the Federal Reserve and the ECB, this paper explores the tensions arising from central bank balance sheet policies and addresses pertinent questions about the governance and accountability of independent central banks in a democratic society.
H12|The Political Economy of Financial Regulation Policies Following the Global Crisis|This paper analyses the efficiency of financial regulation reforms that are being supported in a variety of theoretical approaches after the 2007/2008 global crisis. The main challenges that prevent the efficiency of the reforms are; (i) Maintaining the Basel approach that is argued to have led to the financial crisis, (ii) its limited content, (iii) its lack of global and national financial infrastructure, (iv) not being designed in a framework that comprises the macro policies. Due to the reasons mentioned above, this paper argues that the regulation policy can neither fulfill its stability role nor its distributive role and that in this way, it restructures forthcoming crisis, not the financial sector. In order to prevent crises, a critical approach is required on the mode of regulation of the economy and a reorganization of capitalism is necessary on a larger scale
H12|Bank restructuring in the EU: Which way to go?|We empirically analysed the costs of bank restructuring measures undertaken in the EU countries during recent global financial crisis under the state aid framework. With a unique dataset from over 80 bank case studies in 2008–2014, we modelled the determinants of bailout costs and ranked the cost of each tool applied. We have found that the most important determinant was level of capital adequacy, while the most cost-consuming tool—liquidation of a bank. Thus, our study provides implications on the selection of state aid tools and sheds a new light on their costs. Overall, we concluded that banks’ higher loss absorption capacity, strengthened supervision over small and medium-sized banks and restrictive approach to diagnose bank's problems may limit the costs of future rescue operations.
H12|The impact of external debt on growth: Evidence from highly indebted poor countries|During the 1970's and 1980's, the external debt of poor countries rose to a level constituting a ‘debt crisis’. The main source of external debt was the surplus revenue generated by significant increases in the price of oil during the 1970s. Unfortunately, many of the countries failed to use the external debt wisely and prudently. When the revenue from oil sales started to decline due to low oil prices during the 1980s, heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) experienced difficulty servicing the debt. Using HIPCs data, this paper analyses the extent to which the external debt burden impacts on a country's GDP.
H12|The long-run consequences of Chernobyl: Evidence on subjective well-being, mental health and welfare|This paper assesses the long-run toll taken by a large-scale technological disaster on welfare, well-being and mental health. We estimate the causal effect of the 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe after 20years by linking geographic variation in radioactive fallout to respondents of a nationally representative survey in Ukraine according to their place of residence in 1986. We exclude individuals who were exposed to high levels of radiation—about 4% of the population. Instead, we focus on the remaining majority of Ukrainians who received subclinical radiation doses; we find large and persistent psychological effects of this nuclear disaster. Affected individuals exhibit poorer subjective well-being, higher depression rates and lower subjective survival probabilities; they rely more on governmental transfers as source of subsistence. We estimate the aggregate annual welfare loss at 2–6% of Ukraine's GDP highlighting previously ignored externalities of large-scale catastrophes.
H12|The political consequences of ethnic tension: Theory and evidence|By counting the number of articles published in major US newspapers containing carefully selected keywords, we construct a time varying measure of ethnic tension. Then, we empirically test the predictions of a theoretical model by using the aforementioned measure, and investigate how ethnic tension affects presidential approval ratings by different ethnic groups. Our results show that while ethnic tension decreases the approval by white voters, the opposite is true for the approval by African American voters. Further scrutiny reveals that this may be explained by the fact that government transfers to African Americans increase as a result of higher ethnic tension.
H12|Financialisation and the financial and economic crises: theoretical framework and empirical analysis for 15 countries|This chapter analyses the long-run effects of financialisation and of the recent financial and economic crises for 15 countries. In order to provide a theoretical framework, we first outline three types of regimes under the conditions of financialisation, namely a debt-led private demand boom, an export-led mercantilist, and a domestic demand-led regime. We then take a look at the sectoral financial balances of the main macroeconomic sectors and at the growth contributions of the demand aggregates for each of the 15 countries, focusing in particular on the trade cycle before the crises. This enables us to cluster these countries according to the typology of regimes and describe the development dynamics among various groups, which were complementary and often mutually reinforcing, in the years leading up to the crises. Subsequently, we focus on the period following the outbreak of the crises and, by considering transmission mechanisms and main obstacles to recovery, analyse how countries in each of these clusters were affected. Finally, we focus on the regime shifts that have taken place in the course of the crises and we discuss the implications of these recent developments for the world economy.
H12|Did Japan's high-growth success foster persistent stagnation?|This paper contends that there is a continuum in Japan's experience of growth and decline from the 1990s to the turn of the century and beyond. A lingering attachment to the bureaucratic, financial and political underpinnings of high-growth success affected Japan's response to critical shifts in national and international economic circumstance once economic catch-up had been achieved. The institutional and ideational matrix constructed to deliver catch-up growth subsequently affected the content and fate of economic policy in subsequent decades. In the tensions that emerged between shifting circumstance and established practice can be traced the origins and nature of the â€˜boom and bustâ€™ years of the 1990s, the lacklustre reform programme that ensued and the reasons for continued stagnation into the new millennium.
H12|Tourism Stocks in Times of Crises: An Econometric Investigation of Non-macro Factors|Following the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, the European media emphatically pronounced that billions of euros were wiped from tourism related stocks. This comes at a troublesome time for the tourism industry, in the midst of a global financial crisis, and the unpredictable rise of radical Islamic ideologies, which have caused chaos in the Middle East and Europe. The relationship and vulnerability of the industry to non-macro incidents have been well documented in the literature, mostly in theoretical terms. Nevertheless, the quantifiable impact of such events on tourism-specific stock values, both in terms of returns and volatility, received much less attention. With the use of an econometric methodology, the paper aims to enhance our conceptual capital pertaining to the effects of such possibilities on five hospitality and tourism stock indices. The empirical findings are of interest to stakeholders at all echelons of the spectra of the tourism and financial industries.
H12|Current Risk of Budget Deficit|To correct the serious imbalances accumulated before the crisis from 2014 to 2010 there were taken a number of tough but necessary reforms that have created today's macroeconomic situation. The macroeconomic situation of the country is likely to weaken again because of legislative initiatives with electoral purposes since the middle of 2015. Accelerating them represents a threat to financial stability or a danger to economic performance. One of the risks that could materialize because of it is the risk of budget deficit and public debt.
H12|Can a bank run be stopped? Government guarantees and the run on Continental Illinois|This paper analyzes the run on Continental Illinois in 1984. We find that the run slowed but did not stop following an extraordinary government intervention, which included the guarantee of all liabilities of the bank and a commitment to provide ongoing liquidity support. Continental's outflows were driven by a broad set of US and foreign financial institutions. These were large, sophisticated creditors with holdings far in excess of the insurance limit. During the initial run, creditors with relatively liquid balance sheets nevertheless withdrew more than other creditors, likely reflecting low tolerance to hold illiquid assets. In addition, smaller and moredistant creditors were more likely to withdraw. In the second and more drawn out phase of the run, institutions with relative large exposures to Continental were more likely to withdraw, reflecting a general unwillingness to have an outsized exposure to a troubled institution even in the absence of credit risk. Finally, we show that the concentration of holdings of Continental's liabilities was a key dynamic in the run and was importantly linked to Continental's systemic importance.
H12|The Resolution of a Systemically Important Insurance Company during the Great Depression|This paper explores the economic issues related to systemically important insurance companies, using an example from the Great Depression, the National Surety Company. National Surety was a large and diverse insurance company that experienced a major crisis in 1933 due to losses from its guarantees of mortgage-backed securities. A liquidity crisis ensued, as policyholders staged a massive run on the company, demanding the return of their unearned premiums. The New York State Insurance Commissioner stepped in with a reorganization plan that split the company in two, out of fear that a disorderly liquidation would have systemic consequences given the sheer number of the company's counterparties, scattered all across the United States. A key dynamic of the crisis was that policy holders at an insurance company have a dual role as holders of liabilities and as providers of income.
H12|An economic explanation of the nationalization of electoral politics|The literature on the nationalization of electoral politics focuses on the institutional characteristics of political regimes and the structure and organization of social cleavages. We argue that the nationalization of electoral politics is also driven by economic performance. Short-term economic perturbations increase vote transfers from large (and highly nationalized) parties to small (and weakly nationalized) parties. On the contrary, sharp improvements in economic performance may generate vote shifts towards large parties, and then nationalization should increase. Permissive electoral systems exacerbate the influence of economic performance on nationalization. Pooled cross-sectional time-series regression analysis is conducted on data from 43 countries and 475 elections between 1950 and 2012. The party-level mechanisms are shown through a closer look at Austria and Portugal.
H12|Public expenditure in time of crisis: are Italian policymakers choosing the right mix?|In the “austerity debate” a crucial issue is the composition of fiscal adjustment. This article provides empirical evidence on the relationship between economic crisis episodes and composition of public expenditure by examining the impact of economic crises on the share of different types of public spending in total public expenditure in the Italian regions. Our results suggest that fiscal consolidation strategies have not had growth-friendly composition.
H12|TARP and market discipline: Evidence on the moral hazardeffects of bank recapitalizations|We examine the moral hazard effects of bank recapitalizations by assessing the impact of the U.S. TARP program on market discipline exerted by subordinated debt-holders using a sample of 123 bank holding companies over the period 2004- 2013. Predicted distress risk has a consistently positive and significant effect on sub-debt spreads, suggesting the presence of market discipline. A higher bailout probability significantly reduces the risk-sensitivity of spreads for the full sample, indicating a moral hazard effect of recapitalizations. This appears to be a too-bigto-fail effect, as it is absent when the largest banks are dropped from the sample. Results indicate that it is transitory. We also find a large effect of the crisis, appearing both as a uniform rise in, and a heightened risk sensitivity of, sub-debt spreads during the crisis.
H12|A Comparison between the Styles of Transformational Leaders and Authentic Leaders in Crisis Management|Crisis leadership research is important owing to the unpredictability, cost, duration and intensity of the crisis. Leaders all around the world struggle with the challenges of crisis (Prewitt & Weil, 2014), which demonstrates the undeniable fact that leadership and crisis are closely intertwined. Therefore, the reaction of the leader towards the crisis is of utmost importance. Crises, which are simply defined as “unexpected and unpredictable circumstances that threaten the key mechanisms of a firm” (Barton, 1994), are an indispensable part of the workplace. Hence, managing crises has become a key responsibility of business leaders of the 21st century. Although there are various modern and postmodern leadership styles, this paper focuses on the styles of transformational and authentic leaders during crises. Though there is plenty of research on crisis and leadership, few studies and books were found which shed light upon transformational and authentic leaders’ behaviour in crisis situations. This study attempts to make a theoretical analysis of how transformational and authentic leaders behave during a crisis and make some inferences based on research on leadership styles and crisis leadership.
H12|Euro Area Sovereign Debt Crisis and Debt Mutualisation|We study debt mutualisation in the Euro area. Bearing in mind other existing proposals we provide an alternative Blue, Yellow and Red Bonds proposal: blue, would cover debt up to 60% of GDP, yellow would include debt from 60% up to 90% of GDP, and red would cover debt above 90% of GDP. Although not with joint liability, the rationale behind the Yellow Bonds with a joint issuance is the attraction of liquidity, which would be beneficial, especially for the countries with high yields. This could give more room to public authorities. Key Words : EMU, Euro area crisis, sovereign yields, government debt, debt mutualisation.
H12|Romania – To Have Or Not To Have Its Own Development Path?|Human societies are evolving in sequences similar to a business cycle. The cause for which the evolution is accompanied by setbacks lies in the complexity of social systems, which, ab initio, cannot be designed or intended by any human mind, and the irrationality arising from limited rationality of economic actors. Therefore, the time shows similarities, but rarely identities. Rather, we can talk about chronological series of similitudes, of repeatable errors and adjustable patterns. Using qualitative research and the introspective analysis, we explore the pattern which the Romanian economy followed under the sign of global crisis. We found that Romania's economy doesn't have a problem with its path but with the way in which it follows the trend ideologically and historically. Also, we found out that the end of the crisis is not just following an ordinary path, but represents the chance for the economy to be re-equipped with weapons of competitiveness and honour in order to leave the current era of nihilism.
H12|Government Policies and Financial Crises: Mitigation, Postponement or Prevention?|Abstract In the aftermath of the Great Recession, governments have implemented several policy measures to counteract the collapse of the financial sector and the downswing of the real economy. Within a framework of Minsky-Veblen cycles, where relative consumption concerns, a debt-led growth regime and financial sector confidence constitute the main causes of economic fluctuations, we use computer simulations to assess the effectiveness of such measures. We find that the considered policy measures help to mitigate the impact of financial crises, though they do so at the cost of shortening the time between the initial financial crisis and the next. This result is due to an increase in solvency and confidence induced by the policy measures under study, which contribute to an increase in private credit and, thereby, increase effective demand. Our results suggest that without a strengthening of financial regulation any policy intervention remains incomplete.
H12|Impact of Logistics on Technical Efficiency of World Production (2007–2012)|Abstract This research uses a production function of the type proposed by Mankiw et al. (1992) to study the effect of logistics and information and communication technologies (ITC) on domestic technical efficiency using stochastic frontier analysis for thirty-four countries over the period 2007–2012. We find that logistics and ICT are important channels for improving efficiency. This paper contributes to the literature by estimating the contribution of logistics and ICT to domestic technical efficiency. The economic impact of logistics measured using the LPI (Logistics Performance Index) on technical efficiency is estimated at 0.59 % for every 1 % increase in LPI, ceteris paribus.
H12|Measuring the Financial Shocks of Natural Disasters: A Panel Study of U.S. States|This paper employs panel vector autoregression to examine the dynamic fiscal response to natural disasters. With 50-state, 1970‐2013 panel data on state government finance and disaster damage, we estimate disaster impacts on revenue, expenditure, debt issuance, and federal-state transfers. We find that following a disaster, states increase program expenditure and receive more federal transfers. Disasters have limited impact on total tax revenues but amplify fluctuations in sales, income, and property tax revenues. Our findings suggest that disaster-induced additional spending is largely financed through federal transfers, which include not only disaster relief funds but also non-disaster-related public welfare assistance.
H12|Bank resolution as a new MNB function – resolution of MKB Bank|In this study, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the process of the successful resolution and reorganisation of MKB Bank Zrt., and the practical implementation of the resolution regulations, which was one of the first applications of these regulations in the European Union. The authors present the resolution tools and powers used by the central bank of Hungary (Magyar Nemzeti Bank), as the resolution authority, emphasising the indispensable cooperation between Hungarian and European Union authorities and institutions. As a conclusion, they find that the only fast and efficient way to protect the stability of the Hungarian financial system without the use of public funds was to apply the new resolution toolset. In connection with the resolution procedure, the creditors of MKB Bank Zrt. suffered no losses, as the funds of the bank’s customers and business partners were safely protected at all times.
H12|“One size does not fit all” – institutional determinantsof financial safety net effectiveness|The main objective of the study is to identify both similarities and differences among seemingly homogenous countries (OECD) in respect to their safety net de-sign and a supervisory role played by central banks. This goal is achieved using an extensive data set, describing financial supervisory institutions between 2000-2013, hence including recent modifications in response to global financial crisis. The data show the existence of similar supervisory standards in both crisis- and non-crisis countries. Whether it is a presence of single supervisory authority, allocation of macroprudential responsibilities in a country, or implementing capital adequacy re-quirements, while working well in certain countries, did not make others immune to a crisis. At the same time, data show that non-crisis countries implemented stricter rules than those in crisis-countries, and that this process started way before the burst of the Global Financial Crisis. Often, these more rigorous rules were observed in countries with past crisis experience, indicating an importance of learning mecha-nism. With empirical analysis, we prove that certain basic safety net elements (oblig-atory reserve requirements or sufficient coverage of deposit insurance scheme), as well as high level of central bank financial transparency are negatively correlated with the speed of credit growth. Based on our results and discussion on previous empirical analyses we give recommendations for institutions involved in the financial safety net.
H12|A Model of the International Monetary System|We propose a simple model of the international monetary system. We study the world supply and demand for reserve assets denominated in different currencies under a variety of scenarios: a hegemon versus a multipolar world; abundant versus scarce reserve assets; and a gold exchange standard versus a floating rate system. We rationalize the Triffin dilemma, which posits the fundamental instability of the system, as well as the common prediction regarding the natural and beneficial emergence of a multipolar world, the Nurkse warning that a multipolar world is more unstable than a hegemon world, and the Keynesian argument that a scarcity of reserve assets under a gold standard or at the zero lower bound is recessionary. Our analysis is both positive and normative.
H12|Social and economic development of Russia: Finding new dynamics|The paper deals with Russian economic development and economic policy in 2015—2016. The analysis is focused on external and domestic challenges as well as on anti-crisis policy of the Russian government. Special attention is paid to key elements of a new model of economic growth in Russia. The paper discusses priorities of economic policy of sustainable growth including: budget efficiency, structural reforms and import substitution, stimulation of entrepreneurship, efficiency of public administration, modernization of welfare state.
H12|How to destroy a country. The economics and the politics of the Greek crisis|"(On the book by J. K. Galbraith ""Welcome to the poisoned chalice: The destruction of Greece and the future of Europe"" and not only) The economic future of Europe depends on the combination of many processes, not only strictly economic ones. Currently, the situation is becoming quite complicated, with a number of particularly adverse tendencies overlapping and mutually strengthening one another. Adding to the classical problems involving the economic slowdown, high unemployment rate and insufficient innovation of the European economy, is the immigration crisis, the escalating terrorist threat and Brexit, as well as the risk of Grexit. The potential overlapping of Brexit and Grexit could be fatal for European integration. Solving the Greek syndrome requires a radical change in the way the European Union, especially Germany, approaches this problem. On the one hand, specific structural reforms and fiscal adjustments are necessary in Greece, but on the other hand, there’s a necessity for a conditional reduction of the Greek public debt by half. What is needed in the long run, is to ensure that some countries’ surpluses are not financed with others’ deficits and debts."
H12|World Economy Post-Crysis Development|Once the acute phases of the financial and euro crises were over, it was clear that it would take time for advanced economies to recover. The history of past financial crises gave a clear warning that recovery would typically be long and painful. The aim is to investigate the state of the world economy to make some conclusions for the less advanced countries, like Moldova. Research methodology involves analytical, comparative, foresight, induction and deduction methods. New development and planning institutions presume the rejection of forms of bureaucratic centralism and base on network forms of organization of the subject and the process of production, trade and services
H12|Pseudo-Scientific Economic Policies Of Moldova Association To The Eu: Methodology, Problems, Solutions|Economic policies and decisions on EU association starting with the begginig of 90’s were pseudoscientific, contradictory, incoherent because those policies have not based themselves on modern and current economic theories elaborated and promoted by the EU. Actuality. The topic is actual from the perspective of the factors’ analysis which were conducting to delay the association process of Moldova to the EU. At the same time, those were increasing instability, disequilibrium in the national economy and raise of social vulnerability and constraint levels which ultimately increased the gap between the national and EU economic development levels. During the period of 2000-2015, the socio-economic policy of the Republic of Moldova is described more as small and fragmented steps on conceiving economic and financial instruments for the integration into the EU which were reflected in the Neighbourhood Partnership and Association Agreement with the EU. These processes conducted for the state incapacity to define its own objectives and social-economic priorities for the association as well as legitimated a continuous stage of transition to the market economy. The scope of the present article is to propose a real change of the development and social-economic association policies for achieving final objective on integration to EU. The proposals would consist in emphasizing and implementation of the EU economic principles reflected in the neoclassic synthesis and neo-conservative theories; the elaboration and implementation of a new Strategy on economic supervision, coordination and anticipation of the economic disequilibrium; achieve economic stability for diminishing the negative effects of the global and regional crisis on national economy and adaptation of the development policies to the national socio-economic conditions. The methods used for the elaboration and achieving the expected results of the study were analysis and synthesis of the reliable data on economic processes’ trends as well as macroeconomic prognoses for designing a set of development scenarios. Results were reflected in elaboration of a system of actions which includes EU as a monitoring mechanism for preventing and anticipating the disequilibrium that may occur during the association process. Stimulation of consumption, of the research and technological progress and targeting foreign investments in the innovation development priorities are some of other actions that are recommended in the article
H12|Macroeconomic Effects of Budget Expenditure in Bulgaria (Econometric Analysis)|This article studies the short-term and long-term impact of expenditure fiscal policy on the macroeconomic activity in Bulgaria. The study is based on an econometric analysis that uses vari­ous econometric techniques within an established algorithm following the logical schema of vector au­toregression models that look at the characteristics, the significance, and the quantitative expressions of the studied relationships. The resulting empiri­cal data shows that long-term budget expenditure increase stimulates real GDP growth, providing that expenditure has not reached marginal levels. This macroeconomic activity driving effect is observed when capital expenditure increases, while current expenditure growth has no impact that is statistically significant. In short periods of economic up­turn, the expenditure fiscal policy should address the ratio between the different types of expenditure, giving priority to capital over current expenditure. In times of economic downturn, expansionary fiscal measures associated with increase in both capi­tal and current expenditure have the capacity to stimulate economic growth and help limit the drop in macroeconomic activity
H12|The Economic Consequences of Brexit: A Taxing Decision|Membership of the European Union has contributed to the economic prosperity of the United Kingdom. Uncertainty about the outcome of the referendum has already started to weaken growth in the United Kingdom. A UK exit (Brexit) would be a major negative shock to the UK economy, with economic fallout in the rest of the OECD, particularly other European countries. In some respects, Brexit would be akin to a tax on GDP, imposing a persistent and rising cost on the economy that would not be incurred if the UK remained in the EU. The shock would be transmitted through several channels that would change depending on the time horizon. In the near term, the UK economy would be hit by tighter financial conditions and weaker confidence and, after formal exit from the European Union, higher trade barriers and an early impact of restrictions on labour mobility. By 2020, GDP would be over 3% smaller than otherwise (with continued EU membership), equivalent to a cost per household of GBP 2200 (in today’s prices). In the longer term, structural impacts would take hold through the channels of capital, immigration and lower technical progress. In particular, labour productivity would be held back by a drop in foreign direct investment and a smaller pool of skills. The extent of foregone GDP would increase over time. By 2030, in a central scenario GDP would be over 5% lower than otherwise – with the cost of Brexit equivalent to GBP 3200 per household (in today’s prices). The effects would be larger in a more pessimistic scenario and remain negative even in the optimistic scenario. Brexit would also hold back GDP in other European economies, particularly in the near term resulting from heightened uncertainty would create about the future of Europe. In contrast, continued UK membership in the European Union and further reforms of the Single Market would enhance living standards on both sides of the Channel. Les conséquences économiques du BREXIT : les coûts d'une décision L’adhésion à l’Union européenne a contribué à la prospérité économique du Royaume-Uni. Les incertitudes entourant l’issue du referendum ont déjà commencé à affaiblir la croissance britannique. Une sortie du Royaume-Uni de l’UE (Brexit) conduirait à un choc négatif majeur pour l’économie du pays et aurait des incidences pour tous les membres de l’OCDE, en particulier en Europe. Dans une certaine mesure, le Brexit équivaudrait à un impôt sur le PIB, imposant un coût durable et croissant sur l’économie, qui ne serait pas encouru si Royaume-Uni restait dans l’UE. Ce choc serait transmis par le jeu successif de différents canaux. Sur le court terme, l’économie britannique serait affectée par le durcissement des conditions financières et l’affaiblissement de la confiance puis, après sa sortie officielle de l’Union européenne, par le relèvement des obstacles aux échanges et les conséquences précoces des limitations à la mobilité de la main-d’oeuvre. À l’horizon 2020, le PIB serait plus faible de 3 % qu’autrement (en cas de maintien dans l’UE), équivalent à un coût moyen de 2250 GBP par foyer (en prix actuels). Sur le plus long terme, les effets structurels s’affirmeraient par le biais de trois canaux : les capitaux, l’immigration et un progrès technique moindre. En particulier, la productivité du travail serait pénalisée par une baisse de l’investissement étranger direct et par l’accès à un volume de compétences plus limité. Le manque à gagner en termes de PIB se creuserait avec le temps. En 2030, selon le scénario de référence, le PIB serait inférieur de plus 5% qu’autrement – et le montant de l’« impôt Brexit » atteindrait alors 3200 GBP par ménage (en prix actuels). Les conséquences seraient encore plus marquées dans le scénario le plus défavorable, et resteraient négatives y compris dans le scénario favorable. Une sortie du Royaume-Uni de l’UE entraverait également le PIB dans d’autres économies européennes, notamment sur le court terme, en raison des incertitudes politiques sur l’avenir de l’Europe. À l’inverse, un maintien du Royaume-Uni dans l’Union européenne et la poursuite des réformes du marché unique amélioreraient les niveaux de vie des deux côtés de la Manche.
H12|Budget reform before and after the global financial crisis|Budgeting techniques are undergoing major change in many OECD countries in the wake of the global financial crisis. As part of this, many of the directions of pre-crisis budgeting reform are being critically reviewed. This paper reviews the past and future of budgeting reform. It also considers what will be needed to develop a more robust analytical framework within which to map future reform directions.

H12|Global Economic Crisis and Government Intervention|The new economic context which brings into discussion the stateâ€™s role in the economy is theresult of several factors, all contributing to the emergence and spread of the crisis. What doeshistory have to say about the political and economic after-effects of financial crises? There areclear similarities between the 1929-1935 and 2007-2009 crises in terms of initial conditions andgeographical origin. In each one of the cases, the financial pain at the root of the crisis wasfollowed by a deep recession in the real economy, but the most devastating impact of the globalcrisis was the human suffering. So, the society changed its vision of business legitimacy, calling forstructural changes in the system, including increasing government influence in economy. In thissense, structural policies are the best option for long-term recovery after the event of a crisis.
H12|Alexis Tsipras und der rhetorische Diskurs als Politik<BR>[Alexis Tsipras and the rhetorical discourse as Policy]|"Es existiert wohl keinerlei «Präzedenzfall», der in irgendeiner Weise vergleichbar wäre mit der vollkommenen Verwandlung des derzeitigen griechischen Ministerpräsidenten Alexis Tsipras und dessen Anpassung an die Anforderungen der griechischen Realität. Wahrhaft, all zu rasch übersetzte sich sein radikaler, unkonventioneller und extremer Diskurs gegen die in Griechenland seit 2010 implementierte harte Sparpolitik, in einen taktischen Rückzug. Die SYRIZA Partei, eine heterogene Mischung linker Strömungen, nutzte den Unmut der Bevölkerung gegenüber den schmerzhaft anmutenden Sparmaβnahmen des sogenannten griechischen Memorandums, um den eigenen machtpolitischen Senkrechtsstart voranzutreiben und sich ziemlich rasch von einer kleinen Protestpartei zu einer Machtpartei zu verwandeln. Dementsprechend transferierte diese Partei, ohne die geringste moralische Umschweife, die Verzweiflung der Bürger in einen extremen rhetorischen Diskurs der scheinbaren „Verteidigung sozialer Rechte“ hinein, jedoch mit dem Ziel des eigenen Wahlsieges und anschließend die Übernahme der Macht. Abstract English There is probably no ""precedent"", which would be comparable in any way with the perfect transformation of the current Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras and its adaptation to the requirements of the Greek reality. Truly, all too quickly his radical, unconventional and extreme discourse against the implemented in Greece since 2010 tough austerity policy, is transformed into a tactical retreat.. The SYRIZA party, a heterogeneous mixture of left Groups , used the displeasure of the population to the painful-looking Austerity measures of the so-called Greek memorandum to advance their own political take off to power and rather rapidly to transform from a small protest party to a ruling party. Accordingly, this party transferred, without the slightest moral ado, the despair of the citizens in an extreme rhetorical discourse of apparent ""defense of social rights"" into it, however, with the aim of the own electoral victory and then the acquisition of power."
H12|Social protection system in Bangladesh and the scope of social work: learning from lessons on the ground|Social protection is identified globally as the strategy for safeguarding the economic security of the vulnerable people including the poor. Social Safety Net Program (SSNP) is a component of social protection and a well-recognized instrument for economic wellbeing of the poor from the government and the non-government agencies. The objective of this paper is to explore the social protection system in Bangladesh from the demand side analysis and to identify the role of social work for better managing the system delivery of social protection. For this purpose, the strength and weakness of the SSNP in Bangladesh has been discussed and also identified the determinants of the participation of the program based on the national representative data of rural Bangladesh. Careful investigation and econometric analysis using the data from Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS) 2011-12 show that the existing system is reasonably progressive but it has failed to achieve the main objective of serving the disadvantaged group for scaling up their living standard, enabling them better coping mechanism and capability development for the sustainable income support. The proximate reasons for this failure are firstly the aggregate amount of support being abysmally small compared to the needs and secondly there is mistargeting issue in the distribution. More focus should be given to employment generation and human capital development for sustainable development of the poor people. Health insurance program should be initiated as early as possible because the health related shock is one of the main driver of poverty. The delivery system of the SSNP is not effective and sustainable. Employing social work graduates for implementing the program based on the principles of social works could offer better delivery system which would be more sustainable in future.
H12|Exploring the effect of terrorist attacks on markets|The aim of this paper is to explore the determinants of terrorist unexpected events and if these events can affect economic markets. Based on the existing literature and the methodologies already been used, our purpose is to draw some attention to specific events, which may create losses to investors or even to countries. Specifically, after a thoughtful consideration of the existing relative studies, we discuss a number of empirical findings concerning the main determinants of terrorism. In particular, religions and especially fanatics is the most common determinant followed by the economic perspective of an attack. We show that the more democratic and developed countries are inclined to decrease the spread on the returns. Relying on these empirical findings, we discuss the implied policy implications and the necessary further research.
H12|Tsipras and the rhetorical speech as policy|It is the first time after the restoration of democracy in Greece that such a U-turn has been conducted. The radical, unconventional and extreme rhetoric against harsh austeritywas sharply transformed into a tactical retreat in order to supposedly support more effectively the public interest. SYRIZA, a heterogeneous alloy of leftist tendencies, treated the popular anger and resentment towards harsher austerity measures in order to achieve electoral rise. Consequently, it was rapidly transformed from a small – protest – party into a power party. In this instance, it transformed, without moral curb, citizens’ despair into an extreme rhetoric which defended their “rights” in order to rise to power. Namely, SYRIZA treated instrumentally the expectations of the desperate as a means to rise to power in order to benefit the party but not for the whole society.

H12|Examining public Policy in Romania: is it transparent and legitimated?|In the last decades, in the context of many economic and financial crisis, the policy-making became the heart of government. In Romania, they represents the main instruments for solving the citizens’ problem: health care, education, the environment, and the mechanisms by which public money is budgeted. Therefore, this paper analyses the transparency and consultation in policy-making process from the view of different policy-making stages. The paper discusses the different mechanism and procedure designed and applied by Romanian government in policy-making process. Finally, it describes possible links between policy-making capacity and indicators for transparency, starting from Joseph Stiglitz assertion on the adverse effects of secrecy in government policy-making, “with more mistakes, public officials become more defensive; to protect themselves, they seek even more secrecy, narrowing in the circle still further, eroding still further the quality of decision-making”.
H12|Financial Markets and Debt Crisis in European Union: Preventing spillover effects of financial crisis between EU periphery and the eurozone|When the financial crisis revealed weaknesses in eurozone governance, EU responded with new prevention and crisis resolution governance structure and counter-cyclical policies. A new surveillance procedure for the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances, the so called Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP). The EC has recognized the existence of excessive imbalances that requires strong and comprehensive policy measures to undertake significant adjustments. International competitiveness indicators and policy instruments are the most important for correction of external imbalances. This is also one of the major challenges in the euro zone – the symmetric adjustment of the intra – euro area competitiveness divergences and external imbalances. For non – euro area EU members, monetary strategies and exchange rate policies are highly important instruments of adjustment process. Spillover effects of financial crisis in EU periphery (non – EMU economies) could be damaging for the eurozone economies. The European economic governance mechanisms are inconsistent with specific position of the non - euro area countries of the EU. The aim of this policy paper is to analyze European economic governance for non – euro area members. Our reform proposals are based on the two basic areas of improvements in European economic governance for non – EMU members of the EU: (a) new approach to the European Semester, and (b) new financial assistance facilities for non – euro area countries, in order to reduce contagion risk in EU.

H12|The Effect of Public Administration Reforms under the Post-New Public Management Paradigm|It is becoming increasingly apparent that the reform of public administration is a sort of Achilles heel of modern state especially, because the bureaucracies could not give up to the features of old public administration. However, the public administration, under the pressure of some international driving forces (global economic crisis, interaction with the EU system, Europeanization etc.) and development of several paradigms (new public management, post-new public management, corporate governance) has to adjust its policies, procedures, structures and relations with citizens and business and to function more effectively within the EU framework. Today, public administration is moving in new directions. Reforms are focusing on the quality of services for citizens and business on the efficiency of administration. The focus of the paper is on selected reform area in Romanian public administration, namely de-bureaucratisation and simplification of the procedures for citizens, business and administration to achieve the European standards and to be defined by transparency, predictability, responsibility, adaptability and effectiveness. As research methodology, the study adopts a case-oriented approach to advance its arguments, using both quantitative and qualitative data, published by European and national institutions.
H12|The Challenges of the Administrative Process in a Financial Crisis and their Effectiveness|When we think back to the financial crisis which has been over for a few years now, we can only see the negative aspects. However, the positive aspects are incontestable. One of these aspects is represented by the efforts of making the public administrative processes more efficient. Managers of public institutions were obligated, due to lack of funds, to concentrate on creating and/or developing various mechanisms in order to optimize the internal processes with the intention of assuring the development of their activities and obtaining their overall objective. By doing this, they gained the importance of organizational functions such as internal public audits, internal managerial control and governess. The intent of this paper is to present the efficient process which took place in public administration sector of Romania during the financial crisis and immediately after. In order to better understand this procedure, a comparative analysis between the process implemented in Romania and the ones applied by the European Union will be discussed. The conclusions which will be formulated due to this study can be applied both theoretically as well as practically.

H12|Shifting the tax burden from labor to property: The case of Germany|Contrary to frequent recommendations of the public finance literature and international institutions, a persistently high tax wedge on labor is observed in Europe. At the same time, the scope for shifting taxes from labor to more growth-friendly revenue sources appears underused in many European countries. This motivates our simulation of a revenue-neutral property tax reform for Germany, a country in which tax receipts from land are particularly low. More precisely, we assess by how much social insurance contributions (SIC) can be reduced when Germany switches from its current property tax scheme based on outdated cadastral values to one based on market property values. In order to make such a simulation possible, we match property related information with the input dataset of EUROMOD, the tax-benefit simulation model for the EU. Our results suggest that the implicit tax rate on labor could be reduced from currently 37,2% to 36,5%. Furthermore, we simulate different scenarios of the SIC reduction. Redistributive effects of these different scenarios tend to be modest and depend crucially on the design of the SIC reduction.
H12|Iceland, economic integration and the European Union|Iceland is a small resource rich country in Europe that is highly dependent of foreign trade. According World Bank classifications Iceland is a high income economy, but with a population of little more than 300 thousand inhabitants, it is the smallest economy within the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Iceland is highly dependent of foreign trade, especially to and from the European Union, where economic and political integration is evolving and the question about the most feasible level of participation is a future challenge for the country. Iceland is a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), the European Economic Area (EEA) and Schengen and European Union (EU) candidate country until recently, when its government decided to withdrew its EU membership application. The EEA agreement currently ensures Iceland’s access to the EU’s common market.
H12|On Economic Growth in Europe, or, The Uncertain Growth Prospects of Western Countries|Growth in the European Union since the outbreak of the global financial crisis is slower (1) than before the crisis, (2) than the trend would indicate, (3) than forecast and (4) than in the United States. The factors driving its weakness lie more on the supply side than the demand side. The loss of potential output after the crisis was exacerbated by inequalities from before the crisis; fiscal stimulus from 2007-2009, increasing public expenditure despite the lack of fiscal space; excessive liquidity support for banks; and inflexibility of the market for goods at the moment the crisis broke out. The problems with growth may deepen and become permanent if social support for anti-market parties continues to grow. Extremist parties are supported by divergence among the countries of the “old” EU and the slowdown of convergence in the new member states, as well as tendencies related to inequality, in particular the reduction of households’ mobility between income groups.
H12|Effect of controllability of product harm crisis on Asian consumer?s purchasing behavior|EA growing body of literature discusses the detrimental consequences of product harm crisis. However, very few discussed yet how controllability of the crisis shapes consumers? purchase decisions between nations in a highly globalized marketing environment. Moreover, studies related to consumer perceptions between Asian countries are very rare in the present crisis literature. Therefore, current study investigates how Sri Lankan and Chinese young consumers? purchase decisions vary in two different fictitious crisis grounds; company culpable and consumer culpable. Results of independent t test revealed that consumers? purchase intention decisions were significantly vary between China and Sri Lanka only under the consumer culpable crisis ground; where the controllability is with the consumer. Current study provides an indispensable guide for the crisis managers to take managerial decisions in midst of crisis and for further comparative research investigations in the product harm crisis literature.
H12|EU vor der Zerreißprobe – wie sieht die gemeinsame Zukunft aus?<BR>[A Crucial Test for the European Union – What Will the Common Future Look Like?]|Zusammenfassung Innerhalb der Europäischen Union macht sich zunehmend Nationalismus breit. Dies wird sichtbar an der Uneinigkeit über die Flüchtlingspolitik und die Rettungspakete sowie am Stimmengewinn antieuropäischer Parteien. Das Referendum in Großbritannien am 23. Juni steht kurz bevor und es ist nicht ausgeschloßsen, dass sich Großbritannien gegen die EU entscheidet. Einig sind sich die Autoren darüber, dass sich die Europäische Union in einer tiefen Krise befindet–auch aufgrund von Mängeln im institutionellen Design, der langjährigen Missachtung der sozialen Dimension und durch das Fehlen von identitätsstiftenden Maßnahmen. Helfen könnte ein Neuanfang–vielleicht durch eine Rückbesinnung auf ein Kerneuropa.

H12|Efficiency Study of Greek Health Units of the Public Sector using Data Envelopment Analysis Method, before and during the start of the Economic Crisis|Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the Technical Efficiency through an Efficiency Study of Health Units of the Greek Ministry of Health, before and during the start of the Economic Crisis in Greece. Design/methodology/approach – The research has been designed to collect data regarding the Health Units of the Public Sector from the Greek Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) and to process that data with the use of the Data Envelopment Analysis software. The methodology of the research extends to the application of the Efficiency Study of Decision Making Units (DMUs), the study of variations of Technical Efficiency during a number of years and the extraction of conclusions regarding variations in Technical Efficiency at a time period before and during the start of the Crisis. Data from large Health Units was used in order to achieve comparison of the results. Findings – We calculate the DEA scores based on the most common DEA models (CCR, BCC and Super Efficiency) for the Health Units of the Greek Ministry of Health. We examine the variation in Technical Efficiency of the Health Units during the extent of the time period of the study. The Efficiency Study of the Health Units leads to useful conclusions regarding the variation in the observed Efficiency of the Units and the integration of the Efficiency variation studies, as part of the initial stage of an Integrated Crisis Management. The research ranks the efficient and non-efficient units and suggests ways of improvement. Research limitations/implications – This is a study about the Health Units of the Public Sector using size as a criterion. The investigation is limited to the Public Health Sector and its conclusions cannot be extended to the Private Health Sector. There are no geographical restrictions. Originality/value – This is an innovative research which allows for further case studies in the future and completion of Efficiency studies after the end of the Economic Crisis.
H12|Tourism Stocks in Times of Crises: an Econometric Investigation of Non-macro Factors|Following the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, the European media emphatically pronounced that billions of euros were wiped from tourism related stocks. This comes at a troublesome time for the tourism industry, in the midst of a global financial crisis, and the unpredictable rise of radical Islamic ideologies, which have caused chaos in the Middle East and Europe. The relationship and vulnerability of the industry to non-macro incidents have been well documented in the literature, mostly in theoretical terms. Nevertheless, the quantifiable impact of such events on tourism-specific stock values, both in terms of returns and volatility, received much less attention. With the use of an econometric methodology, the paper aims to enhance our conceptual capital pertaining to the effects of such possibilities on five hospitality and tourism stock indices. The empirical findings are of interest to stakeholders at all echelons of the spectra of the tourism and financial industries.
H12|Multi-level multivariate normal distribution with self-similar compound symmetry covariance matrix|We study multi-level multivariate normal distribution with self similar compound symmetry co-variance structure for k di erent levels of the multivariate data.

Data from a clinical study is analyzed to illustrate the application of the obtained results.
H12|Government Policies and Financial Crises: Mitigation, Postponement or Prevention?|In the aftermath of the Great Recession governments have implemented several policy measures to counteract the collapse of the financial sector and the downswing of the real economy. Within a framework of Minsky-Veblen cycles, where relative consumption concerns, a debt-led growth regime and financial sector confidence constitute the main causes of economic fluctuations, we use computer simulations to assess the effectiveness of such measures. We find that the considered policy measures help to mitigate the impact of financial crises, though they do so at the cost of shortening the time between the initial financial crisis and the next. This result is due to an increase in solvency and confidence induced by the policy-measures under study, which contribute to an increase in private credit and, thereby, increases effective demand. Our results suggest that without a strengthening of financial regulation any policy intervention remains incomplete.
H12|Evolution of ICT and software industry: Crisis, resilience and the role of emerging clusters|The ICT and software industry have evolved as twin global industries now spanning a large number of interconnected clusters in the developed and emerging countries. Firms, governments and other actors have re-established different relationships and structures throughout 1980-1984, early 1990s, 2000-2001 and 2007-2008 crises, often resulting in decline of older clusters and emergence or solidification of newer ones. Studies indicate that a cluster's evolution, its position in the technological life-cycle, and dominancy are quite relevant with resilience of the cluster. On the other hand, region-specific factors seem to be important for specialization of ICT-software clusters, which, may work or against their benefit due to strategic geographic responses of larger actors in the industry, such as promotion of offshore outsourcing or onshore in-house activities. There is increasing evidence that these factors are recently used better by regional and national governments against clusters in more advanced regions, particularly by strategic use of timely legal reforms, state-sponsored large ICT-software projects and attempts to grow local ICT-software markets. Yet, the knowledge externalities created by these efforts are captured not only by large MNCs, but also by an increasing number of local companies, which are increasingly transforming into multi-national actors. This paper tries to evaluate how governments, local companies and MNCs establish strategic collaborations and promote growth of clusters in emerging country context, in the case of ICT-software industries. The study relies on secondary data resources and the literature in evaluating emerging country contexts, but also makes use of primary data, local and national strategic planning documents and interview interpretations in the context of Turkey's clusters. The study's main contribution lies in demonstrating how mixed core/periphery features, collaboration of local/national actors with global actors, and emerging new technologies play a role in the emergence of new forms and functional structures at industry level.
H12|Uncertainty and Catastrophe Management:The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Beyond|Natural disasters, instability in the finance and banking sector, widespread social protests, and other crisis situations have increasingly become the focus of public attention. With the growing visibility of such events, accelerated by the rise and proliferation of social media, the study of risk and crisis management in the Internet age is of vital importance. Uncertainty and Catastrophe Management is a clear and comprehensive guide to a variety of crises, and seeks to offer practical advice on how best to avoid them, minimize loss and damage once they have occurred, and how best to recover from these situations. The book examines 104 cases that run the gamut from natural disasters such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, to social movements like the Ukrainian protests in 2013, from the Syrian Electronic Army's cyber-attacks, to the reputational damage to firms in the wake of a corporate scandal. This book is a revised and expanded edition of Akira Ishikawa and Atsushi Tsujimoto's book, Risk and Crisis Management: 101 Cases, and explores a number of recent events. It draws on the expertise of the contributors to the volume to create a well-rounded book that will benefit professionals, academics, and the general public alike. In particular, safety professionals, public management professionals, CEOs, CIOs, students and researchers will appreciate its pragmatic approach to dealing with and recovering from crises in the interest of long-term survival and sustainability.
H12|Decision-making under radical uncertainty: An interpretation of Keynes' treatise|"Keynes' mathematical Treatise addresses what some call ""radical uncertainty"", which he thought endemic in world affairs and whose appreciation underpinned much of his later work. In contrast, the mainstream view in economics, as elsewhere, has been that even if radical uncertainty exists, either there is in principle nothing that can ever be done about it, or that even if one could in theory do something about it then the institutions required would be unreliable, and one would be better off without them. Thus the mainstream has worked as if it were realistic to ignore even the possibility of radical uncertainty. But one needs some conceptualisation of radical uncertainty, such as Keynes', before one can make such judgments. This paper presents an interpretation, to inform debate. The viewpoint taken here is mathematical, but this is not to deny the value of other views."
H12|Fiscal Implications of Central Bank Balance Sheet Policies|Under ordinary circumstances, the fiscal implications of central bank policies tend to be seen as relatively minor and escape close scrutiny. The global financial crisis of 2008, however, demanded an extraordinary response by central banks which brought to light the immense power of central bank balance sheet policies as well as their major fiscal implications. Once the zero lower bound on interest rates is reached, expanding a central bank's balance sheet becomes the central instrument for providing additional monetary policy accommodation. However, with interest rates near zero, the line separating fiscal and monetary policy is blurred. Furthermore, discretionary decisions associated with asset purchases and liquidity provision, as well as with lender-of-last-resort operations benefiting private entities, can have major distributional effects that are ordinarily associated with fiscal policy. In the euro area, discretionary central bank decisions can have immense distributional effects across member states. However, decisions of this nature are incompatible with the role of unelected officials in democratic societies. Drawing on the response to the crisis by the Federal Reserve and the ECB, this paper explores the tensions arising from central bank balance sheet policies and addresses pertinent questions about the governance and accountability of independent central banks in a democratic society.
H12|European versus Anglo-Saxon credit view: Evidence from the eurozone sovereign debt crisis|"We analyse whether different levels of country ties to Europe among the rating agencies Moody's, S&P, and Fitch affect the assignment of sovereign credit ratings, using the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis of 2009-2012 as a natural laboratory. We find that Fitch, the rating agency among the ""Big Three"" with significantly stronger ties to Europe compared to its two more US-tied peers, assigned on average more favourable ratings to Eurozone issuers during the crisis. However, Fitch's better ratings for Eurozone issuers seem to be neglected by investors as they rather follow the rating actions of Moody's and S&P. Our results thus doubt the often proposed need for an independent European credit rating agency."
H12|Herausforderungen der Flüchtlingskrise für Hochschulen|Flucht und Migration sind alte und weltweite Phänomene. Letztes Jahr hat jedoch die Zahl der Flüchtlinge nach Europa und insbesondere Deutschland stark zugenommen, während die deutsche Bundeskanzlerin die bis dahin geltenden europäischen und deutschen Regeln außer Kraft setzte. Dies stellt die gesamte Gesellschaft vor enorme Herausforderungen, auch und gerade die Hochschulen, für die sich neuer Forschungs- und Lehrbedarf ergibt. Idealerweise werden dafür ergebnisoffen zusätzliche Mittel und Stellen bereitgestellt. Ansonsten müssen die Hochschulen das sowie interne Anpassungen mit Bordmitteln bewältigen.
H12|What Explains the Speed of Recovery from Banking Crises?|While much research has been done on causes and effects of banking crises, little is known about what determines recovery from banking crises, despite of large variations in post-crises performances across countries. In order to identify local and global factors that determine the length of recovery (i.e. the time it takes until countries reach their pre-crisis level of per capita GDP), this paper employs event history analysis on 138 incidents of banking crises between 1970 and 2013. Cox proportional hazards show that crises characteristics, specific country conditions as well as external factors affect the duration of recovery. Regarding domestic factors, simultaneous currency crises, large financial sectors and overvalued currencies are associated with later recovery. Regarding external factors, a low growth of world trade has a negative effect on recovery, and so does uncertainty in financial markets as reflected in high gold prices. Moreover, contractionary monetary policy of the US Fed as Central Bank of the international key currency has a negative effect on the length of recovery in middle-income countries. In general, the dominance of global variables as well as variables related to the exchange-rate underline that the speed of recovery is particularly constrained by countries’ positions within the global economy.
H12|The Need For Evolving Practice Of Governance In Public Enterprises|The globalization of markets, technological change and deregulation of monopolies generated the need for readjustment and restructuring of the state sector and to develop efficient governance in public enterprises. The efficiency of an economic system depends, first of all of good management, and proper implementation for good functioning of society’s governing mechanics.
H12|The Baltic Economies and the Marked out Route to Membership in the European Monetary Union|The research paper presents analysis of policies and problems in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on their way to the European monetary union. At the beginning of the 1990s the Baltic countries and Bulgaria have similar problems and economic indicators and they embark on their way to establishing a market economy infrastructure in economic and political chaos. In the middle of the second decade of the 21st century the differences are substantial. The marked out route to the monetary union contains important lessons and the most significant economic comparisons for Bulgaria. The success of the Baltic countries is determined by the strategic choices made in the beginning of the 1990s and the remarkable perseverance based on political will for tough but unavoidable reforms and achieving real convergence as members of a union with developed European countries.
H12|Intercreditor and Debtor-creditor Equity Issues in Sovereign Debt Restructuring|Different types of creditors have different political and financial claims and thus different —at times, divergent or conflictive— interests. This means that the burden-sharing exercise of sovereign debt restructuring is played out not just between debtors and creditors, but also between different types of creditors. The private sector approach centered on collective action clauses (CACs) is not sufficient to solve the myriad problems, including those of inter-creditor and debtor-creditor equity, associated with sovereign debt restructuring. In response to the deficiencies of the current approach, several policy measures to enhance the equity and efficiency of sovereign debt restructuring procedures should be considered. These include: tighter regulation of sovereign credit default swap (SCDS) contracts; the provision of a greater role for debt reprofiling and bondholder aggregation; the development of common rules and norms for valuing public and private concessions in sovereign debt restructurings; and the establishment of greater creditor rights for implicit creditors.
H12|Los mecanismos extraordinarios de pago a proveedores de las Administraciones Públicas en España|The economic crisis was initially associated with an increase in regional and local government payment periods and trade debt. Since 2012, central government has approved various extraordinary mechanisms for the payment of local and regional government suppliers that have significantly reduced the stock of trade debt and the average supplier-payment periods attributable to these levels of government. Successive plans have helped unblock payments and channel funds of close to €67 billion towards the private sector in somewhat less than three years. And against a background of economic weakness, fiscal consolidation and difficult conditions of access to lending, it is believed this has provided a considerable impetus to activity that has helped mitigate some of the adverse effects of the economic crisis. In parallel, the roll-out of the plan has entailed a substantial increase in local and regional government debt vis-à-vis the State. To prevent inappropriate incentives for the conduct of local and regional government from arising, the funding mechanisms agreed on require compliance with certain adjustment plans.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H12|Fiscal consolidation after the Great Recession: the role of composition|We have examined the fiscal consolidation episodes in a group of OECD countries from 2009 to 2014. The range of the estimated short-term fiscal multiplier runs from 1.2 to 2.0, larger than those obtained in more ‘normal times’, implying that the contractionary effect has been larger in depressed environments. Nevertheless, we also found that revenue measures have a higher and more persistent real impact than expenditure measures, which is more consistent with the influence of current consolidations on the expectations about the future path of fiscal policies (the expectations channel). This result suggests that expenditure cuts are less harmful for the economy than tax hikes.
H12|Transparency and Views Regarding Nuclear Energy Before and After the Fukushima Accident: Evidence on Micro-Data|This paper examines the influence of government transparency on changing views regarding nuclear energy before and after Japan’s natural and nuclear disaster of 2011. Individual level data were used, covering 45 countries and containing 27,423 observations. It was observed in the majority of countries that the rate of favoring nuclear energy declined after the disaster. However, empirical results show that such a tendency is less likely to be observed in a more transparent country. This implies that views regarding nuclear energy were less elastic to the news of the Fukushima incident when people were more certain about nuclear energy prior to the Fukushima incident.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H12|Federal Reinsurance for Terrorism Risk in 2015 and Beyond: Working Paper 2015-04|CBO analyzed a variety of options for federal insurance against the risk of terrorism before the program was reauthorized in January 2015. This paper examines in more detail some options that might be considered in the future.
H12|Dissecting the brains of central bankers: The case of the ECB’s Governing Council members on reforms|Since 2009, European central bankers have supported some reforms, in order to draw roadmaps to get out of the euro debt crisis. This paper tests whether the educational and professional background of European central bankers matter for the type of reforms each of them advocated. Through a textual analysis of public speeches delivered by the European central bankers, we draw a cognitive map for each of them and, thus, of the reforms they propose as ways out of the euro debt crisis. Our results show that their occupational background is an important determinant of their respective economic reform proposals.
H12|Banking union: Mind the gaps|This paper reviews the various mechanisms and rules that have been proposed to create a banking union in Europe. We argue that the banking union is a promising solution to the Eurozone crisis because it completes the unification of the Euro currency, forms a solution to both the financial and monetary fragmentation of the Euro zone financial markets and helps break the vicious cycle created by domestic banking system impairments and the sovereign debt crisis. We underline the shortcomings and hurdles to attaining a fully-fledged banking union, and the hazards created by the inconsistencies between the phasing-in of the sequential programme decided by European member states. Various suggestions are made to fill the gaps created by the current architecture: establishing a shared-bailout rule to absorb the remaining losses, simplifying the organisation of banking groups and creating a truly federal deposit insurance scheme.

H12|Las reservas internacionales en Colombia: ¿Regla de acumulación, o política discrecional?|Las reservas internacionales constituyen una herramienta de política monetaria de vital importancia, especialmente en países como Colombia con alta dependencia de la exportación de commodities con precios volátiles, y a inversión extranjera directa que se vería desfavorecida bajo crisis de balanza de pagos. Sin embargo la acumulación de recursos públicos presenta costos de oportunidad considerables, y en ese sentido se requiere evaluar que tan adecuado es el tamaño del stock de reservas. El presente documento analiza el atesoramiento histórico de reservas en Colombia desde 1960 hasta la actualidad, usando para ello dos metodologías: las reservas óptimas y las reservas adecuadas. Se concluye que Colombia ha seguido los estándares internacionales en pequeños intervalos históricos. La discrecionalidad ha liderado en los periodos de bonanzas y de crisis, además de los últimos 10 años donde los indicadores muestran una sobre acumulación monetaria.
H12|When Do Governments Improve Fiscal Institutions? Lessons from Financial Crisis and Fiscal Reform in Latin America|Do crises really lead to more institutional reforms? This paper explores the con- nection between financial crises and one type of reform frequently advocated during the recent global financial crisis, namely, fiscal institutional reforms. Some authors expect that crises lead to reforms, but we demonstrate that the relationship is not so straightforward. Using a data set of Latin American countries that experienced several crises and also several periods of reform in the period from 1990 to 2005, we find that the type of crisis and its duration matter. We argue that reforms are less likely during a banking crisis, whereas fiscal crises are most likely to lead to fiscal reforms. This means that the type of economic crisis is important for explaining the likelihood of reforms. We explore other possible explanations for reform, such as the partisanship of the president and whether a country is under an IMF program, and do not find confirming evidence for alternative explanations.
H12|Sovereign Debt and Structural Reforms|Motivated the European debt crisis, we construct a tractable theory of sovereign debt and structural reforms under limited commitment. The government of a sovereign country which has fallen into a recession of an uncertain duration issues one-period debt and can renege on its obligations by suffering a stochastic default cost. When faced with a credible default threat, creditors can make a take-it-or-leave-it debt haircut offer to the sovereign. The risk of renegotiation is reflected in the price at which debt is sold. The sovereign government can also do structural policy reforms that speed up recovery from the recession. We characterize the competitive equilibrium and compare it with the constrained efficient allocation. The equilibrium features increasing debt, falling consumption, and a non-monotone reform effort during the recession. In contrast, the constrained optimum yields step-wise increasing consumption and step-wise decreasing reform effort. Markets for state-contingent debt alone do not restore efficiency. The constrained optimum can be implemented by a flexible assistance program enforced by an international institution that monitors the reform effort. The terms of the program are improved every time the country poses a credible threat to leave the program unilaterally without repaying the outstanding loans.
H12|Budget Deficits , Their Roles In The Economic Crises And The Effectiveness Of Stabilization Programs (In Case Of Turkey After 1990’S)|Economic crises frequently experienced in Turkey cause increases in budget deficit and as these deficits cannot be closed they bring new crises. So, the “stabilization programs” that tried to be implemented during crises become quite important. In this study, the effectiveness of stabilization programs in closing budget deficit implemented during crises in Turkey, has been analyzed. Especially it has been investigated that why some stabilization programs failed while others succeeded in closing the budget deficits emerged by the beginning of 1990s and reached its peak in 2000s. Also crises in 1994, 2000 and 2001 which substantially damaged economic balance in the period after 1990 and lastly the impact of 2008 global crisis have been researched. Success of stabilization programs in closing budget deficit, which were implemented during these crises, stabilization measurements in 5th April, inflation reduction program in 2000, transition to strong economy program in 2001 and urgent action plan in 2002, were tried to understand through actual budget figures and economic data.
H12|Lack of Governance During 2000-2001 Economic Crises in Turkey|Governance covers the quality of institutions and their effectiveness in translating policy into successful implementation. There are different types of governance such as global governance, corporate governance, regulatory governance, public sector governance, etc., however, we mainly focus on public sector’s governance. In this article we will try to explain evaluation of policies the 2000 and 2001 economic crises in Turkey before and during the crisis by adding crises management policies in order to monitor good or bad governance activities.
H12|Market discipline by bank creditors during the 2008–2010 crisis|We investigate whether uninsured depositors, insured depositors, and general creditors exhibit evidence of quantity market discipline during the recent financial crisis. To establish which types of creditors expect to incur loss, we evaluate the FDIC's expectations about losses to creditors at banks that failed between 2008 and 2010. Our results show that quantity market discipline tends to begin far enough in advance to signal to both banks and supervisors that corrective actions can and should be taken. Furthermore, creditors are able to distinguish between banks of different risk levels. Our findings support several policy implications for encouraging market discipline.
H12|The impact of macroeconomic and financial stress on the U.S. financial sector|During the 2008 global financial crisis, financial institutions in the United States experienced big losses, and some firms failed. These failures occurred despite the external and internal regulatory mechanisms imposed upon the financial sector aimed at ensuring confidence and stability in the financial system. This study analyzes the impact of macroeconomic and financial stress on the profitability of financial firms. We utilize data from 1980 to 2010 to model firm profitability and stock returns using a panel regression, fixed-effect methodology. Our results show that the profitability of all firms is negatively affected by increases in macroeconomic and financial stress, measured by the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) and the Adjusted National Financial Conditions Index (ANFCI), respectively; however financial sector firms have exhibited an increased marginal sensitivity to both stress indexes that began in the 1990s and continued through the financial crisis of 2008. In a further analysis of the financial sector and banks, we show that depository institutions are relatively robust to macroeconomic and financial stress, and financial sector instability is driven by non-depository finance, investment, and real estate firms. Additionally, the largest 33 percent of financial firms and banks exhibit increased sensitivity to macroeconomic stress in the most recent sample. Our results coincide with the risks associated with recent trends in the financial services industry, such as deregulation, global market integration, financial product innovation, and the increasing predominance of non-depository intermediation.
H12|Saving and the long shadow of macroeconomic shocks|The global crisis of 2008 raises many questions regarding the long-term response to crises. We know that households that lost access to credit, for example, were forced to adjust and increase saving. But, will households keep on saving more than they would have done otherwise had the global financial crisis not occurred? And for how long will this increased saving persist? Here, we study the degree to which past adverse income shocks increase the saving rates of affected households. We find evidence consistent with history-dependent dynamics: more experience of past crises tends to increase household saving. We follow up with an investigation of the importance of historical exposure for current account dynamics, but find no strong indication that our measure of past exposure is important to the current account's determination. We conclude by estimating the likely impact of the 2008 GFC on future saving.
H12|War and the growth of government|This paper empirically examines how wars impact the size and scope of government using a panel of all wars from 1965 to 2010. Higgs (1987) gives us reason to believe that wars may permanently increase government size and scope while Olson (1982) describes how wars can dislodge interest groups and allow for market liberalizing reforms. We find that wars permanently expand the scope of government regulation but do not impact government size systematically across the countries we study.
H12|Riflessioni su banche e mercati|Il saggio mira a rappresentare le relazioni che si allacciano tra attività finanziarie, banche, mercati ed investimenti. Nella fattispecie pone in evidenza l’interesse pubblico affinchè banche e mercati siano effettivamente funzionali allo svolgimento dei processi produttivi. Vengono successivamente presi in considerazione i fattori che alterano il fisiologico funzionamento del circuito ovvero il crescente debito pubblico, l’eccessiva proliferazione di strumenti finanziari, l’alta volatilità dei mercati e l’incertezza dell’azione politica. Sono infine individuati gli eventuali margini di manovra utili alla ripresa ed al sostegno degli investimenti.
H12|The Rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac|The imposition of federal conservatorships on September 6, 2008, at the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation—commonly known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—was one of the most dramatic events of the financial crisis. These two government-sponsored enterprises play a central role in the US housing finance system, and at the start of their conservatorships held or guaranteed about $5.2 trillion of home mortgage debt. The two firms were often cited as shining examples of public-private partnerships—that is, the harnessing of private capital to advance the social goal of expanding homeownership. But in reality, the hybrid structures of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were destined to fail at some point, owing to their singular exposure to residential real estate and moral hazard incentives emanating from the implicit guarantee of their liabilities. We describe the financial distress experienced by the two firms, the events that led the federal government to take dramatic action in an effort to stabilize housing and financial markets, and the various resolution options available to US policymakers at the time; and we evaluate the success of the choice of conservatorship in terms of its effects on financial markets and financial stability, on mortgage supply, and on the financial position of the two firms themselves. Conservatorship achieved its key short-run goals of stabilizing mortgage markets and promoting financial stability during a period of extreme stress. However, conservatorship was intended to be a temporary fix, not a long-term solution, and more than six years later, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac still remain in conservatorship.
