M14|Artificial Intelligence: Socio-Political Challenges of Delegating Human Decision-Making to Machines|Artificial intelligence is at the heart of current debates related to ethical, social and political issues of technological innovation. This briefing refocuses attention from the techno-ethical challenges of AI to artificial decision-making (ADM) and the questions related to delegating human decisions to ADM. It is argued that (a) from a socio-ethical point of view the delegation is more relevant than the actual ethical problems of AI systems; (b) instead of traditional responsible AI approaches focusing on accountability, responsibility and transparency (ART) we should direct our attention to trustworthiness in the delegation process; and (c) trustworthiness as a socio-communicational challenge leads to questions that may be guided by a responsible research and innovation framework of anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion, and responsiveness. This may lead to different questions policymakers and other interested publics may ask as well as novel approaches, including regulatory sandboxes and other measures to foster a more inclusive, open and democratic culture of human-ADM relations.
M14|Business Culture: The Role of Personal and Impersonal Business Relationships on Market Efficiency|In this paper, we study the effects of business culture on market efficiency. We exogenously vary the type of business culture between business-is-business cultures, which consist on impersonal relationships where financial matters are paramount, and business-is-family cultures, which comprise of cohesive personal relationships where financial matters and personal attachments are intertwined. We use a laboratory experiment to assess the effect of business cultures in environments with different degrees of contract enforceability and competition. Our main results indicate that business-is-family cultures are more effective when contracts are unverifiable because they help market participants overcome problems of trust. On the other hand, we find that business-is-business cultures are more effective in competitive settings because they facilitate the severance of ties with unproductive partners.
M14|Complementary Consumer Responsibility - The Limits to Immoral Delegation in Markets|Delegation has been shown to facilitate individual immoral behavior. It is however unclear, if these findings extend to markets, where consumers may punish firms who delegate immoral production decisions. I address this question by employing an experimental market paradigm, involving an unfair product, containing a negative externality, and a fair product without externality. Passive delegation of the production decision, with random matching between an owner and a seller, leads to a lower share of the fair product being traded, consistent with the findings on responsibility diffusion. Active delegation in contrast, where owners have a choice over sellers first, increases the share of the fair product relative to passive delegation. Responsibility norm beliefs support a mechanism of complementary consumer responsibility, which assigns more responsibility to consumers when owners have a choice over sellers and, therefore, over the product type offered. Consumers' buying decisions may therefore limit the possibility for delegating immoral behavior, depending on the specific design of the delegation.
M14|Sustainable Finance for Sustainable Development|The paper explores how ethical and sustainable oriented finance is key to reach sustainable development by tackling environmental risk through green finance and showing empirical evidence on the link between finance and inequality. The theory provided puts in the right mind frame to analyze markets, intermediaries and instruments with a sustainable lens to focus on the benefits that have brought to sustainable development. A discussion is presented between different intermediaries and highlights the benefits of cooperative banks especially the close relationship of customers and bank and the resilience it gives to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in difficult times. Different investments strategies are discussed walking through the evolution of Sustainable and Responsible Investing (SRI) funds and diving into the ESG analysis to use as criteria to allocate investments based on environmental, social and governance principles. Microfinance is introduced as a different market that has reached the people at the bottom of the pyramid and highlights the key role it will play to bring financial inclusion. Islamic finance and Fintech are also discussed. Different instruments are presented to understand the current landscape of how different investors are using innovative products to attack social and environmental problems. Finally, five different ways are presented on how policies can strengthen and support sustainable development arguing that the most important is by promoting sustainable footprint certification.
M14|Is Blinded Review Enough? How Gendered Outcomes Arise Even Under Anonymous Evaluation|For organizations focused on scientific research and innovation, workforce diversity is a key driver of success. Blinded review is an increasingly popular approach to reducing bias and increasing diversity in the selection of people and projects, yet its effectiveness is not fully understood. We explore the impact of blinded review on gender inclusion in a unique setting: innovative research grant proposals submitted to the Gates Foundation from 2008-2017. Despite blinded review, female applicants receive significantly lower scores, which cannot be explained by reviewer characteristics, proposal topics, or ex-ante measures of applicant quality. By contrast, the gender score gap is no longer significant after controlling for text-based measures of proposals’ titles and descriptions. Specifically, we find strong gender differences in the usage of broad and narrow words, suggesting that differing communication styles are a key driver of the gender score gap. Importantly, the text-based measures that predict higher reviewer scores do not also predict higher ex-post innovative performance. Instead, female applicants exhibit a greater response in follow-on scientific output after an accepted proposal, relative to male applicants. Our results reveal that gender differences in writing and communication are a significant contributor to gender disparities in the evaluation of science and innovation.
M14|Adoption of CSR and Sustainability Reporting Standards: Economic Analysis and Review|This study provides an economic analysis of the determinants and consequences of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability reporting. To frame our analysis, we consider a widespread mandatory adoption of CSR reporting standards in the United States. The study focuses on the economic effects of standards for disclosure and reporting, not on the effects of CSR activities and policies themselves. It draws on an extensive review of the relevant academic (CSR and non-CSR) literatures in accounting, economics, finance, and management. Based on a discussion of the fundamental economic forces at play and the key features and determinants of (voluntary) CSR reporting, we derive and evaluate possible economic consequences, including capital-market effects for select stakeholders as well as potential firm responses and real effects in firm behavior. We also highlight issues related to the implementation and enforcement of CSR reporting standards. Our analysis yields a number of insights that are relevant to the current debate on CSR and sustainability reporting and provides scholars with avenues for future research.
M14|Transfer Pricing and Corporate Social Responsibility: Arguments, Views and Agenda|The central thesis of the paper is that Multinational Companies (MNC) should invest in the use of â€œsoftâ€ methods (socially responsible behavior) to mitigate costs in society accrued due to use of â€œhardcoreâ€ tax evasion tactics (Transfer mispricing) to maximize profits from operations in developing countries and/or countries with weak or inefficient tax laws and tax collection institutions. Therefore, we articulate the argument of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as an indirect compensation for transfer mispricing. Our aim is not to present CSR as solution to transfer mispricing. An analytical approach is based on a content analysis of the existing literature with emphasis on a case study. We first discuss the dark side of transfer pricing (TP), next we present the link between TP and poverty and finally we advance arguments for CSR as a compensation for transfer mispricing. While acknowledging that TP is a legal accounting practice, we argue that in light of its poverty and underdevelopment externalities, the practice per se should be a strong defence for CSR because it is also associated with schemes that deprive developing countries of the capital essential for investment in health, education and development programmes.
M14|Sustaining cultural tourism through higher female participation in Nigeria: the role of corporate social responsibility in oil host communities|This paper adds to the gender discourse in sustainable African tourism development from the corporate social responsibility (CSR) perspective. Specifically, we examine the impact of CSR on the development of rural women in cultural tourism. A total of 600 rural women were sampled across the Niger Delta. Results from the use of a logit model indicate a significant relationship between CSR and cultural tourism development in oil host communities in Nigeria. This implies that CSR of a multinational oil company (MOC) is a critical factor for sustaining cultural tourism. The findings suggest increased female participation in General Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU) interventions of MOC and the need to pay close attention to which extent the participation of rural women in the GMoU projects may be limited by cultural and traditional obstacles.
M14|Endogenous Maternity Allowances as Exemplified by Academic Promotion Standards|I model the strategic interaction between scientists aiming for promotion and a research institution that seeks a highly productive faculty by setting a maternity allowance in the form of a minimum promotion standard. The model shows that maternity allowances need not derive from moral justice arguments but can emerge endogenously from efficiency considerations. The underlying mechanism rests on the assumption that exceptionally productive female professionals are also exceptionally productive if they choose to become mothers. Even though motherhood temporarily handicaps their productivity, it is exactly this cost of motherhood that signals the mothers’ intrinsic high productivity. I explicitly refer to the academic labor market and use empirical evidence from academia to justify the model’s specification, but the conclusions carry over to promotion decisions at the executive level in most professional lines of occupation.
M14|Equity Finance: Matching Liability to Power|There is widespread concern that the bonus culture for senior managers in limited liability companies is having adverse effects, e.g. on risk-taking, leverage and lower longer-term investment. The moral hazard of limited liability was appreciated in the 19th century, when unlimited or multiple liability, especially for bankers, was widely adopted. Whereas outside, notably retail, investors still need the protection of limited liability, we advocate moving towards a two-tier equity system, primarily for banks, with insiders, senior managers and others with influence over corporate decisions, becoming subject to multiple liability. But the transition costs of doing so suddenly would be great, so our proposal is to start by applying this initially just to Systemically Important Financial Intermediaries.
M14|Mapping the emergence of a new research field: an exploration of the intellectual structure of the B Corp research|The paper explores the emergence of a new research field, implementing a bibliometric analysis of the literature on the B Corp. We built a database including 82 articles collected by Scopus and published from 2009 to 2019 that discuss the B Corp, or the benefit corporation, or, more generally, social entrepreneurship. We performed descriptive and citation analyses, with the objective of identifying the roots and the evolution of the concept of B Corp. This emergent field is an important component of the structural change occurring in our society, which, in recent years, has seen the emergence of new for-profit organizational forms with a strong social consciousness. The bibliometric analysis reveals the foundational works and the historical evolution of the research field, which, while rooted in the corporate social responsibility literature, opened up into the analysis of how the legislation, the firmâ€™s strategy, the entrepreneurial orientation, and the policy interventions are intertwined in the concrete development of socially and environmentally conscious businesses.
M14|Corporate Social Responsibility and Profit Shifting|In this work we investigate the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and profit shifting. First, we employ worldwide data for parent firms and their foreign subsidiaries to derive a profit shifting measure. Then, drawing on legitimacy theory and risk-management strategy, we find corporate social responsibility to be positively correlated with profit shifting. In addition, we find this relationship to be stronger in parent firms in countries under the territorial tax system. We perform a battery of sensitivity tests and robustness checks to corroborate our findings. By and large, our results suggest that multinational firms with higher CSR scores shift larger amounts of profits to their low-tax foreign subsidiaries, potentially indicating strategic planning in the choice of CSR investments by multinational enterprises.
M14|Financial Stability: Does Social Activism Matter?|We investigate the impact of social activism on financial system stability. Financial stability was analysed from two complementary perspectives: bank-led financial stability and financial system stability driven by sector-wide credit supply. Social activism was analysed from three perspectives: gender equality advocacy, environmental sustainability advocacy, and social protection advocacy. The findings reveal that gender equality and environmental sustainability advocacy have significant positive effects for financial stability while social protection advocacy has a significant negative effect for financial stability. Also, social activism has negative effects for financial stability in the post-2008 financial crisis era. Finally, there are differential effects for country-groups, for instance, social activism strongly improves bank-led financial stability in African countries and for BLEND countries (countries that are eligible for IDA borrowing based on per capita income levels and are also creditworthy for some borrowing from the International Bank of Restructuring and Development (IBRD). The findings are relevant for the on-going debate about whether social inclusivity and activism has any economic value for the stability of businesses and the financial system. The findings have implications
M14|الصناعة التقليدية في الجزائر: تقييم الملائمة الاقتصادية و البيئية في ظل النموذج الاقتصادي الاجتماعي الأخلاقي<BR>[Traditional handicraft in Algeria: Assessment of Economic and Environmental Relevance under the Socio-Economic and moral model]|The aim of this paper is to evaluate the appropriateness of the traditional and crafts sector to achieve economic and environmental performance in light of the socio-economic and moral model through its respect for the concept of corporate social responsibility. This study sheds light on the sector of handicrafts and crafts as one of the emerging alternatives to diversify the Algerian economy. It deals with the most important dimensions of the social responsibility of the institution under the socio-economic and moral model.
M14|Faktor-Faktor Yang Mempengaruhi Kehandalan Nilai Informasi Keuangan Pemerintah Daerah<BR>[Factors Affecting Reliability Of Regional Financial Information Values]|This study aims to determine whether the quality of human resources, the use of information technology, the internal control system, the field of financial control, and organizational commitment affect the reliability of the financial reporting information value of the Bangka Regency government. The sample amounted to 96 respondents in the government of Bangka Regency. The sample in this study used purposive sampling using the specified criteria. The type of data and data collection methods are primary data, research data obtained directly from the original source in the form of answers to the questionnaire. The results form factors, namely the internal control system and the financial control area. Where the form factor consists of the variable quality of human resources, utilization of information technology, internal control systems, areas of financial control and organizational commitment have a significant influence on the reliability of the value of financial reporting information of local governments. The dominant variable is the internal control system, while the lowest variable is the quality of human resources.
M14|Drivers of eco-innovation in the Spanish hospitality industry|The main goal of this research is to determine whether the accommodation capacity and the financial performance can be considered as the main driving forces of eco-innovation in the context of Spanish hotel industry. Eco-innovation is a challenge for tourism industry, given the connection and interrelationship between environmental quality and business performance. The eco-innovation plans represent a new field of research in its infancy. This paper addresses the conceptual evolution of eco-innovation to subsequently develop an analytical framework that tentatively explores this concept and its implementation in Spanish hotel companies through two basic internal characteristics of these organizations: their business performance and their respective size, measured in terms of accommodation capacity. The case study method was applied -through documentary evidence and structured interviews- to the 10 companies leading -in terms of turnover- the national hotel offering and have a remarkable international presence. All these interviews were conducted between November 6th, 2017 and February 28th, 2018.
M14|Sustainable Development Strategy through GRI with Reference to VEDANTA Company|Sustainable development has become one of the key principles for succeeding human development goals while at the same time strengthening the power of natural systems in order to provide ecosystem services which the economy and society depends upon. The society’s end result is where the use of resources and the living conditions prolong to meet the human needs without hindering the balance of the natural systems. If ever focusing on Environmental sustainability, it will have a concern with the natural environment and how it remains diverse and productive. For natural resources are derived from the environment, the state of water, air, soil are of particular concern. GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) has an important role to form a framework of sustainable development in businesses, government and other organizations. The goal of the sustainable development process is to achieve the status of ‘sustainability’ in all communities. It is important to make compatible with developed and flexible using the standards laid down by GRI therefore in the long term, strategies’ of sustainable development should assist the continuance of the system of biodiversity of city and suburbs through the active protection and sustainable utilization of natural sources. Therefore in order to achieve sustainability, it is necessary to make structural reforms as regarded in the standards set by GRI and to create some deep and fundamental changes in all levels of communities. Sustainable Business Models (SBM) integrates a triple bottom line approach and includes stakeholder interests, including the environment and society. They are important in implementing business innovation for sustainability and can help fix sustainability into corporate purpose, and serve as a key driver of competitive advantage. This study focuses on the analysis of the sustainable development of Vedanta Company.

M14|Shared social responsibility and fair worker wages: evidence from an experimental market|We analyze repeated interactions occurring between workers, sellers and consumers within the framework of an experimental market. By successfully performing a task, workers allow sellers to offer a good through a market. Sellers set the price of goods and decide the wages of workers. Consumers enter the market sequentially and decide whether to accept one of the offers or to leave the market. Our data show that, especially in the first periods of the experiment, some sellers opt to pay high wages to their workers. However, this behavior is not rewarded by consumers, whose purchasing choices are almost exclusively driven by self- interest. This exposes sellers to a high level of price competition and, period after period, the propensity to act in a socially responsible way towards workers vanishes, creating a market scenario in which workers receive the minimum wage and where consumer surplus is significantly higher than those of workers and sellers. This result does not change when we manipulate the social distance between workers and consumers or when we limit opportunities for consumers to relinquish responsibility by avoiding information on workersâ€™ conditions.
M14|Compliance with socially responsible norms of behavior: reputation vs. conformity|The Social Responsibility of Business usually involves self-regulation, which entails spontaneous compliance with social norms or standards that are not imposed by hard law. In this paper we discuss the mechanisms that lead economic agents to comply with socially responsible norms that are not legally enforced, and do not coincide with profit, or self-interest, maximization. Companies exist because individuals need to cooperate and some institutions can facilitate cooperation, but at the same time these institutions may turn into places where unfair distributions are amplified and cooperative behaviours and motivations disrupted. The agents who decide to organize themselves into firms are usually motivated by the need to earn some benefit from mutual cooperation: since they have limited knowledge and bounded rationality, team production can highly improve their results. Therefore the main motivation to enter an organization is to gain from cooperation; but this also brings problems of how to divide the surplus that is generated and we find conflicts on the attribution of benefits among stakeholders, with a particular problem of abuse of authority by those who hold power. One of the drivers of socially responsible behaviour is the quest for reputation, which in turn induces a cooperative response from the stakeholders. This can be described in game-theoretical terms with a repeated Trust Game between a trustor (the stakeholder) and a trustee (the management of the firm). The problem with reputation is that it is compatible with multiple equilibria, included the one in which stakeholders always trust the firm, and the firm often abuses this trust. This leads to consider an alternative mechanism for norm compliance: conformity and reciprocity that derive from an impartial agreement among stakeholders. The present work analyses in depth the role of an agreement on cognitions and motivations, grounding on insights from psychology, game theory and experimental findings.

M14|A communitarian definition of shared value rooted in local development studies and in the Olivettian experience|"This paper aims at introducing a variation on the concept of shared value originally proposed by Porter and Kramer (2011). The variation is based on a couple of suggestions provided by Becattini (2011) commenting on that concept: the first concerns the rooting of shared value in processes of local development, as those exemplified by successful industrial districts, where the business sphere and the local community are strictly integrated within place-based relations. The second suggestions is the mention of the experience of the Olivetti company and the Canavese area (Ivrea, Italy) in the first decades after WWII. Becattini described this experience as an uncommon situation of reconciliation between a corporate function of profit and the function of social utility of a place. Hence, our study entails two main steps. Firstly, a conceptual discussion will focus on 1. the relation between shared value and local development; 2. the underlying connection with the Olivettian experience and the theorization of the concept of ""community"" included in the writings of Adriano Olivetti; 3. some implicit relations between the communitarian views of Olivetti and Becattini. Secondly, the reassessment of the concept of shared value, and in particular the reference to the Olivettian experience seen as a paradigmatic and forerunning case, brings to the proposal of our variation. This is the definition of what we call a ""communitarian shared value"", taking its roots to logics that combine business strategies of shared value, communitarian relations and culture, and processes and policies of local development."
M14|The Human-Centred Business Model and Hybrid Business Forms: A Primer and a Roadmap|The paper was written as part of the preliminary research for the Human Centred Business Model Project, a project developed within the Global Forum on Law, Justice and Development and now supported by the OECD Development Centre. In a preliminary fashion, the paper skims the surface of â€˜socialâ€™ businesses, in the broadest sense, around the world, identifying some general trends and commonalities and some differences. The paper covers jurisdictions from North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia and describes the organisations that can be used to carry out social business.
M14|Corporate Governance disclosure and implication in the financial audit of banks in Romania|Thispaperaims topresents the relevant aspects regarding the implementation of principles and rulesof corporate governance in the Romanian banking system.The purpose of the articleis to investigate the theoretical and legislative basis whichcontrolsthis area, but also research practical cases on this subject. Based on the review of nationaland international literature, the case study was based on a sample of 17 commercial banks from Romania.Usingcollected data from the official banks' websites, it was analyzed the details of chosen corporate governance elements: the management system, the shareholder and organizational structure, the financial control and audit, as well as if the banks offer disclosure for theapplicable governance codes. The main conclusion which resultsfrom thisstudy case is that,the information available to public provides details about the management structure and the audit department, but this information is not very detailed, the information about the professional experience of the members or the benefits that these credit institutions obtained from the application of corporate governance codes are not described, in some cases even missing.
M14|Planned Behaviour Theory: An Examination of the Intention to Return among Indonesian Hotel Resort Tourists|Objective – The intention of visitors of resort hotels is a highly studied topic. More specifically, the aim of the study is to analyse the intention of tourists to return to resort hotels in Indonesia. Methodology/Technique – An explanatory method was used with 388 visitors of resort hotels selected as the sample based on a random sampling technique. The chosen data analysis method is covariant SEM. Findings – The results confirm that the intention to return is based on the planned behaviour theory with variable factor weights. The intention to return can be predicted from the statements of hotel visitors based on responses about their affection, cognition and behaviour. Novelty – The statements provided in this study that show that visitors' expectations of multidimensional resort hotels identifies a need for improvement. This research emphasizes the importance of examining the behaviour of hotel visitors. Type of Paper: Empirical
M14|Model for Strengthening Employee Performance|Objective – The instability of employee performance in the last three years requires a solution to strengthen employee performance. This study aims to develop a model for strengthening employee performance. Methodology/Technique – This study uses quantitative exploratory techniques with SPSS software, with the following independent variable: Employee Performance (Y), and dependent variables: Organizational Change (X1), Organizational Culture (X2), and Achievement Motivation (X3). The case study is conducted in the Jakarta Islamic Centre, which has a population of 46 people. Findings – The regression Results (1) of the regression equation are Y = 0.099 + 0.148X1 + 0.037 X2 + 0.797X3; RSq = 0.737: F calculated 35.435 with Sig = 0,000. The findings show that employee achievement motivation is a factor that determines high employee performance, organizational changes and organizational culture have no significant effect but when taken together with motivation, have a significant influence on employee performance. Novelty – If there is no policy or implementation of organizational change, organizational culture, and motivation to support employee performance, then employee performance will be low, around 0.099 on scale 1-5. Type of Paper: Empirical.
M14|Escaping Social Pressure: Fixed-Term Contracts in Multi-Establishment Firms|We investigate the impact of local social pressure against dismissals on the choice of employment contracts made by firms using French linked employer-employee data. Taking into account the potential endogeneity of plant location, we show that establishments located closer to headquarters have higher shares of fixed-term contracts in hiring than those located further away whenever firms' headquarters are located in self-centered communities. We also show that this relationship is driven by firms that are highly visible in the community of the headquarters and whose CEOs not only work but also live there. In contrast, when firms' headquarters belong to communities that are not self-centered, the impact of distance to headquarters on the share of fixed-term contracts turns out to be positive. We show that these findings can only be explained by local social pressure. When the local community at the firm's headquarters is self-centered, CEOs are under pressure to avoid dismissing workers close to headquarters. By adding to the adjustment costs associated with open-ended contracts, this creates an incentive for CEOs to rely more on fixed-term contracts, in an attempt to escape social pressure.
M14|Product Innovation and Educational Diversity in Top and Middle Management Teams|The effects of diversity in management teams on firm innovation have become an important topic in strategic management. With a few exceptions, however, the literature has focused on diversity in Top Management Teams (TMTs), while the role of lower management levels, particularly in Middle Management Teams (MMTs), has usually been neglected. In this paper, we intend to fill this gap by explicitly differentiating between the effects of diversity in TMTs and MMTs. By matching various firm-level and individual-level datasets, we compiled a linked employer-employee panel dataset for Sweden for the period 2004–2012. Focusing on measures of educational diversity, we find that the effects differ considerably between MMTs and TMTs. TMTs diversity determines whether firms engage in innovation activities at all (strategic decision), while MMTs diversity affects the actual outcome of innovation processes (successful product innovations and their degree of market novelty).
M14|Effects of Hofstede?s Cultural Factors and Commitment on IJV Performance in ASEAN Country of Thailand|This study focuses on the effect of Hofstede?s cultural characteristics and commitment on international joint ventures (IJVs) performance in the Southeast Asian country context. The study has been provided the unpublished database of international joint venture (IJV) firms operating in Thailand from Thailand Board of Investment. The mail survey via questionnaire has been used as data collection method to obtain data from 89 target respondents, IJV managers. OLS regression is the main data analysis method of the study. The results indicate that all Hofstede?s cultural characteristics of IJV managers have no direct significant effect on awareness of IJV importance, but individualism and power distance have been found the significant effect on commitment. Uncertainty avoidance and power distance directly and positively impact on team performance. Interestingly, power distance has negatively effect on the IJV performance. In addition, the study can find the partial mediating effect of awareness of IJV importance mediating the association between Hofstede?s cultural characteristics and commitment, however, the moderating role of team commonality cannot be found. These results suggest that effective IJV managers have to effectively and efficiently manage the relationships, attempt to boost the commitment and the awareness of IJV importance, and robustly synergize the strengths among managers that come from different cultural background in order to successfully create better coordination and performance for organization.
M14|The Impact Of National Culture On Leadesrhip In Socety And Organizations: Why Do Serbs Love Authoritarian Leaders|The paper analyses the impact of national culture on leadership and leadership styles. It has been determined that national culture impacts leadership and leadership styles by defining the meanings that both the leader and his followers ascribe to the reality that surrounds them. The analysis includes the impact that the dimensions of national culture, identified in the Geert Hofstede?s and GLOBE?s researches, have on leadership. The paper analyses the impact that the dimensions of national culture have on two main dimensions used to differentiate leadership styles: authoritarianism?participative orientation and task orientation?people orientation. It has been determined that power distance and individualism?collectivism as well as uncertainty avoidance and assertiveness decisively impact the selection between authoritarian and participative leadership styles. The national culture?s ?masculinity???femininity? dimension, as well as gender equality, performance orientation, people orientation, and future orientation correlated with it, impact the selection between people orientation and task orientation. In certain contexts, a high uncertainty avoidance also impacts this leadership dimension. By intertwining two leadership styles? dimension, four leadership styles are created, as well as cultural contexts in which each of the styles is favoured, preferred, and thereby more effective. Serbian national culture, with its assumptions and values, implies using of authoritarian people-oriented style.
M14|Can Collusion Promote Corporate Social Responsibility? Evidence from the Lab|Competition has been argued to erode socially responsible behavior in markets, suggesting that allowing cartel agreements among firms may promote public interest objectives. We test this idea in a laboratory experiment. Participants playing the role of firms choose between offering a ÔfairÕ and an ÔunfairÕ good to a consumer participant. When the unfair good is traded, a negative externality is imposed on a third party. We vary whether or not the firms are allowed to coordinate on the type of good they sell Ð while remaining in price competing. We find that the opportunity to coordinate leads to more coordinated equilibria, but has no significant impact on the fraction of fair goods traded on the market. Instead it polarizes: more of the same good, fair or unfair, is offered in coordination. Irrespective of whether quality coordination between firms is allowed, participants are more likely to trade the fair good, the stronger their third-party preferences are. These findings suggest that both consumer and managerial values are more important drivers of socially responsible behavior than opportunities for firms to coordinate their corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. We highlight implications for competition policy, where cartels may be exempted on CSR grounds.
M14|Voice at Work|In the first large-scale study on voice, audio data on lawyers at the top U.S. law firmsâ€“a male dominated work environmentâ€“show that female lawyers alternate between two voice frequency modes: a primary female mode at about 200 Hz as well as a secondary female mode at about 100 Hz that is coextensive with the primary (and only) male voice frequency mode. This tendency is stronger among female associates than among female partners, and does not replicate for male lawyers or female assistants. Evidence of differences driven by firm heterogeneity is comparatively insignificant, indicating market-wide trends in workplace behavior.
M14|RSE et transformation numérique des entreprises artisanales : une étude sur données d’enquête|Les études sur la responsabilité sociétale des entreprises (RSE) dans les très petites en-treprises (TPE) sont rares. Les travaux existants soulignent les freins et retards des TPE en matière de RSE : manque de compétences, de temps ou de ressources financières. . . Notre article prolonge ces travaux en s’intéressant aux liens entre les compétences et usages nu-mériques des TPE d’une part et leurs pratiques de RSE d’autre part. Nous cherchons aussi à savoir si la mise en place d’actions de RSE facilite la transformation numérique des pe-tites entreprises. Nous exploitons une enquête réalisée par l’Observatoire M@rsouin auprès de 1019 entreprises artisanales en Bretagne, dans les secteurs du bâtiment, de la production, de l’alimentation et des services. Nos principaux résultats montrent que les entreprises arti-sanales les plus avancées en termes d’usages numériques sont aussi celles qui ont le plus de pratiques responsables (sur le plan environnemental et social). Nous constatons aussi que plus les entreprises sont engagées dans des démarches responsables et plus elles ont d’incitations à démarrer ou accélérer leur transformation numérique.
M14|Co-production as an interpretative framework in the creation of value in public services|Co-production is an important strand of the current public services reform agenda across the world. Several authors and institutions argued that co-production concept has the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public services becoming a key response to the need for the reform of public services. Moreover co-production can be a way to co-create public value. Nevertheless the growing body of literature, coproduction continues to be a multifaceted and not strongly definite concept with some shortcomings. One of the main gap regards the lack of studies that address the outcomes of the co-production process. There is a dominance of studies dedicated at the identification of influential factors or at the conceptualization of different co-production types showing that most academics aimed their study at the co-creation/co-production process rather than their outcomes. This paper aims at filling this gap by proposing a methodological pathway, composed by 6 steps, to evaluate the impact of co-production on outcomes. The six step are presented and, then mastered trough an application to a concrete case. The application regard the separate collection service. We tested the presence of a relation between the propensity of municipalities toward coproduction and a measure of effectiveness. Results showed Municipalities with an higher attitude to enhance citizen’s co-production reaching better recycling achievements.
M14|Employment of Persons with Disabilities as Competitive Advantage: An Analysis of the Competitive Implications|People with disabilities (PWD) represent a largely untapped market and customer segment worldwide, as well as an enormous untapped workforce potential. Although there are indications in the literature that the employment of PWD can bring many advantages for companies, the effects on companies and the resulting competitive advantages have rarely been empirically investigated. This article aims to analyze the competitive implications of the employment of PWD, as part of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy. The research is based on a literature review. The selected literature was evaluated regarding the competitive advantage using the value-rarityimitability-organisation (VRIO) framework. The results show that the employment of PWD is valuable, rare, and costly to imitate. If a company succeeds in using this resource effectively, this leads to a sustainable competitive advantage. An established corporate culture is a mandatory prerequisite to integrate PWD successfully. This prerequisite represents an imitation barrier. The promotion of the employment of PWD gives access to a new pool of applicants and can contribute to mitigating or preventing a future shortage of skilled workers. The employment of PWD does not wear off as a human resource. The concept can be transferred to different technologies, products, and markets. The sensitivity gained about people with disabilities can open new markets and customer segments. Therefore, PWD's employment as part of the value creation strategy can make a long-term contribution to the company's success and represent a sustainable competitive advantage.
M14|Social Inclusion Drives Business Sales: A Literature Review on the Case of the Employment of Persons With Disabilities|So far companies seem to ignore the potential of persons with disabilities (PWD) as customers and as employees. Although there is some empirical evidence that PWD employment can bring many benefits to companies and that social inclusion can attract a lasting customer base. The employment of PWD and social inclusion, generally, are important social commitments of companies and should represent a central element of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy. CSR is also an interesting marketing instrument for differentiation. However, customers are more aware of productrelated CSR activities than philanthropy or sustainable business initiatives. The aim of this article is to analyze how the promotion of social inclusion, through the example of the employment of PWD, could impact directly or indirectly on business sales. The research is based on a literature review. The selected literature was evaluated regarding the impact on business sales using a deductive content analysis. The results show that social inclusion, as a CSR activity, contributes to increased sales. This is particularly important when it comes to providing services and direct customer contact. Through social inclusion, the company reflects the diversity of existing and potential customers. In this way, new customers can be acquired, customer loyalty promoted or strengthened, and, as a result, sales increased. CSR activities that are used as a marketing tool for differentiation and do not pursue the sole goal of strengthening the company's reputation can create a competitive advantage and thus secure market share, open-up new market segments and permanently increase sales.
M14|IT-Compliance nach COBIT 2019|"Das Ende 2018 von der ISACA publizierte Framework ""COBIT® 2019"" knüpft in seinem Verständnis von IT-Compliance an die Vorgängerversionen 4.1 und 5 an. Trotzdem sind in der neuen COBIT®-Version zahlreiche Änderungen und Ergänzungen enthalten, die in diesem Arbeitspapier diskutiert werden sollen. Im Ergebnis umfasst das Compliance-Verständnis von COBIT® 2019 nach wie vor sowohl die IT-Compliance als auch die IT-gestützte Corporate Compliance. Die grundlegenden Compliance-Ziele bleiben genauso erhalten, wie die Governance- und Managementpraktiken mit ihren Aktivitäten zur Sicherstellung von Compliance. Die Enabler finden sich jetzt als ""Komponenten"" wieder, werden dafür aber systematisch und komplett abgehandelt. Die Änderungen der COBIT® 2019-Produktfamilie beinhalten Erweiterungen wie Streichungen gleichermaßen. Insgesamt fällt die Compliance-Thematik ähnlich umfangreich wie in COBIT® 5 aus. In COBIT® 5 beinhalteten 26 von 37 IT-Prozessen Compliance-Aufgaben, während in COBIT® 2019 15 von 40 IT-Governance- und IT-Managementzielen das Erreichen der compliance-bezogenen IT-Ziele unterstützen. Des Weiteren stellen Compliance-Anforderungen einen eigenständigen Designfaktor dar bzw. sind Teil weiterer Designfaktoren für die IT-Governance. Trotz aller Veränderungen und Anpassungen kann COBIT® 2019 nach wie vor den mit IT-Compliance betrauten Funktionen und Personen als Orientierung und Hilfsmittel für die praktische Arbeit dienen."
M14|Taxation in the digital economy: Recent policy developments and the question of value creation|"The paper reviews the evidence on the challenges of digitalization for direct (corporate profit) and indirect (consumption) taxation. Based on both anecdotal and empirical evidence, we evaluate ongoing developments at the OECD and European Union level and argue that there is no justification for introducing a new tax order for digital businesses. In particular, the significant digital presence and the digital services tax as put forward by the European Commission will most likely distort corporate decisions and spur tax competition. To contribute to the development of tax rules in line with value creation as the gold standard for profit taxation the paper discusses data as a ""new"" value-driving asset in the digital economy. It draws on insights from interdisciplinary research to highlight that the value of data emerges through proprietary activities conducted within businesses. We ultimately discuss how existing transfer pricing solutions can be adapted to business models employing data mining."
M14|Birthplace diversity and team performance|We present a simple model to illustrate how birthplace diversity may affect team performance. The model assumes that birthplace diversity increases the stock of available knowledge due to skill complementarities and decreases effciency due to communication barriers. The consequence of these two opposing effects is a humpshaped relationship between birthplace diversity and team performance. To verify this prediction, we exploit self-collected data on the first division of German male soccer. Our data set covers 7,028 matches and includes information about 3,266 players coming from 98 countries. We propose two different instrumental variable approaches to identify the effect of birthplace diversity on team performance. Our findings suggest that an intermediate level of birthplace diversity maximizes team performance.
M14|Social Cohesion and Labor Mobility|Social cohesion and labor mobility both have the same objective and do not need to be in conflict. They are about cooperating among individuals and societies in order to survive and prosper. Social cohesion can benefit from labour mobility: Labour mobility is economically beneficial for migrants and natives. Attitudes towards migrants are more friendly if they come and work. Migrants are more accepted if they are many. The wellbeing of natives is higher with more migrants present.
M14|The effect of culture on trade over time: New evidence from the GLOBE data set|In this essay I use the GLOBE research study by House et al. (2013) as a proxy for measuring cultural distance. Unlike other studies, GLOBE introduces nine cultural dimensions and focuses exclusively on managers, allowing for a distinct glimpse into the values of people actually making trade decisions. I make use of a state-of-the-art PPML approach using data on international trade flows together with intra-national trade flows (Yotov, 2012) and a comprehensive set of fixed effects to consistently estimate a gravity equation using a panel from 1995 to 2004. I distinguish between different industries by following the goods classification introduced by Rauch (1999). The results show that cultural differences indeed effect trade values differently over time, but their size and impact depends on the chosen measure of cultural distance and on the industry classification.
M14|Betriebswirtschaftliche Einsatzmöglichkeiten von Cognitive Computing|Cognitive Computing ist weder in der akademischen noch in der unternehmerischen Welt eindeutig definiert. Das Ziel der Arbeit ist daher die Beantwortung folgender Fragen: 1. Welche Einsatz- und Anwendungsmöglichkeiten bietet Cognitive Computing einem in Deutschland ansässigen Unternehmen? 2. Wie kann Cognitive Computing betriebswirtschaftlich sinnvoll eingesetzt werden? 3. Welche Voraussetzungen müssen für den Einsatz erfüllt sein?
M14|When does team remuneration work? An experimental study on interactions between workplace contexts|The extent to which individuals cooperate depends on the context. This study analyzes how interactions of workplace context elements affect cooperation when free-riding is possible. Context consists of a novel team building exercise, varying degrees of complementarity in production, and different remuneration schemes. After participation in the team building exercise and when complementarities are high, subjects exert higher efforts under team remuneration than under individual remuneration, despite the possibility to free-ride. Across all contexts, subjects cooperate significantly more than Nash equilibria predict. Compared to contexts in which not all contextual elements are cooperatively aligned, cooperation in a cooperative context relies significantly less on beliefs and personal values. Instead, a cooperative context changes how a subject's achievement motivation influences cooperation. Our findings present insights on how preferences react to context interactions and how these reactions enable organizations to use team incentives.
M14|Fall Siemens: Darf ein profitabler Weltkonzern Ost-Standorte schließen? Eine wirtschaftsethische Reflexion|Die Ankündigung des Siemens-Konzerns, trotz insgesamt guter Gewinnlage Arbeitsplätze in strukturschwachen Regionen Ostdeutschlands abzubauen, wurde quer durch das politische Parteienspektrum von namhaften Politikern skandalisiert. Meine wirtschaftsethische Reflexion dieses Falls tritt der Skandalisierung argumentativ entgegen. In Widerspruch zum öffentlich dominierenden Wahrnehmungsmuster entwickle ich zwei Thesen: (1) Es handelt sich nicht primär um einen Konflikt Arbeit versus Kapital, sondern um einen Konflikt Arbeit versus Arbeit. Und bei der Steuerung dieses Konflikts erfüllt das unternehmerische Gewinnprinzip eine Gemeinwohlfunktion. (2) Betriebsschließungen sind für strukturschwache Regionen als Unglück zu werten, nicht aber als Unrecht.
M14|Co-determination: A driving force for corporate social responsibility in German companies?|"This discussion paper examines the relationship between co-determination and corporate social responsibility (CSR) in German companies, thereby addressing two distinct literatures. On the one hand, most quantitative studies of co-determination focus on its economic impact, with relatively little attention paid to other kinds of outcomes. On the other hand, few studies on CSR have looked at the role of worker representatives. Using a new measure of co-determination strength, the Mitbestimmungsindex (MB-ix), it is demonstrated that co-determination strength is positively related to the presence of ""substantive"" CSR policies, such as the adoption of targets for reducing pollution, but is unrelated to ""symbolic"" CSR policies, such as membership in UN Global Compact. The paper therefore sheds new light on the role of co-determination and provides a more differentiated view of the spread of what has been termed ""explicit"" CSR in Germany, one of the most prominent of the ""coordinated market economies""."
M14|Is social responsibility a normal good?|We investigate whether growth in consumer income causes an increased willingness to pay to mitigate negative externalities from consumption. Correlational field evidence suggests a positive relationship between income and social responsibility. To investigate a causal link, we conduct a laboratory market experiment in which firms and consumers can exchange products that differ in the degree to which they mitigate negative external impacts at the expense of higher production costs. Our treatments exogenously vary consumers’ incomes. Our experimental results reveal that growth in consumer income causes an increase in the share of socially responsible consumption in the laboratory. Such a causal relationship is significant from a policy perspective, as it implies that some negative external impacts of consumption activity can be mitigated as societies experience economic growth.
M14|Offrir des biens publics et des communs et revitaliser l’action publique dans le cadre d’un processus de « destruction créatrice »|"Recent developments in the economic analysis about public goods and commons, initiated notably in relation to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and to the work of Elinor Ostrom, have highlighted the social utility of their production to meet societal expectations of democracy and of sustainable development. The production of public and social economy organisations is in this perspective of crucial importance for the future, as is the outline of public policies that help develop coproduction or joint production of public goods and services. Thus, Public and Social and Solidarity Economy Partnerships (PSSEP) are the subject of analyzes in the CIRIEC book Providing public goods and commons. Towards coproduction and new forms of governance for a revival of public action that highlights: the importance of these partnerships within the framework of the current paradigm of public action; the induced behavioral transformations of the organizations; the scope that these new forms of partnership can have in terms of co-construction of public action and of responses to expectations on the territories; and the place of these partnerships in a process called here ""creative destruction of public action""."
M14|La economía social ante los paradigmas económicos emergentes: innovación social, economía colaborativa, economía circular, responsabilidad social empresarial, economía del bien común, empresa social y economía solidaria|The social economy facing emerging economic concepts: social innovation, social responsibility, collaborative economy, social enterprises and solidarity economy. In the last two decades and prominently since the economic crisis and the crisis of legitimacy of the prevailing economic model based on for profit private businesses, a plurality of terms and notions have emerged in the academic field and in the economic and political world. They are concepts such as the social enterprises, the solidarity economy, the collaborative economy, the circular economy, the economy of the common good, the fourth sector, the social innovation and the corporate social responsibility. The objective of this paper is to explain this new wave of notions, to study their meanings and to identify their differences and commonalities in relation to the consolidated concept of social economy. This work is based on the 5 study carried recently for the European Economic and Social Committee (Monzón & Chaves, 2017). Within the framework of the Kuhn's theory of the scientific revolutions, in this paper we have proposed that in the social sciences, major changes in paradigms or scientific revolutions, and with them, changes in the language and concepts that generate a new worldview, are produced simultaneously to the great crisis and socio-economic transformations. In this framework, for the recent history, we have identified two periods of scientific revolutions in the field of the social economy / third sector, which we have called 'conceptual waves' and, between them, a period of normal science. The first wave of concepts appeared in the late seventies and eighties, with the oil crisis. During this first wave, the concepts of the social economy and of the nonprofit emerged. As rival approaches they coexisted as mainstream normal science until the second wave. The second wave of notions came out during the current economic crisis and the legitimization of the prevailing economic model. Other explanatory factors, linked to the sociology of the social scientist and of sociopolitical type, may also have influenced this proliferation of notions, such as the scientist pressure for differentiation and originality, and the positioning of some institutions in favor of some terms and against others. The social economy concept continues to be, with that of nonprofit organizations, the mainstream paradigm to refer to the 'space between the public economy and the private for profit economy'. It has a broad scientific and political consensus regarding its definition, it is well institutionalized and quantified and it has a strong scientific and social notoriety. It is a concept based on structural criteria, such as its social aims, its participatory and democratic decisional criterion and its profit distributive criterion based on the prevalence of people and labor factor over capital. Finally, it is not reduced to a few classical legal forms. Between these two main concepts of the “first wave” there are significant differences in terms of their scope and their structural criteria, as well as in terms of their systemic functions. Their main differences focus on the importance given to the social mission and the democratic criterion in the social economy approach and on the relevance of the distributive criterion, based on the non-distribution constraint, in the second approach. The following conclusions have been obtained from a detailed analysis of the different emerging concepts. First, given its novelty, there is still no broad consensus regarding their definitions. Terminological inflation is then joined by a semantic inflation. Secondly, these notions present are still in an incipient institutionalization process, if we attend their inclusion in official documents or position papers of the European institutions. Thirdly, they still present a low level of academic and social 6 notoriety, measured by their presence in specialized academic search engines, such as Dialnet and Google Scholar. From its semantic comparative analysis with that of the social economy, it can be seen that they are not rival concepts with the latter, but rather complementary and even revitalizing concepts of the social economy concept itself. This conclusion has been reached using the following typology of these concepts: Group 1, notions linked to the main challenges/fields of the system crisis and transformation; Group 2, notions linked to the reorientation of the objectives and governance of organizations and economies, both at the micro and macro level, with new assess and incentive mechanisms; and finally, Group 3, notions linked to new ways of understanding entrepreneurship. In the first group are included the concepts of social innovation, collaborative economy and circular economy, which refer to areas of system transformation such as, respectively, innovation, the digital revolution and the environment. They are transversal areas to the public, business private for-profit sector and third sector, and these paradigms constitute new approaches, both micro and macro, to face the challenges. In the second group are the notions of corporate social responsibility and the common good economy, which refer to the need to establish new mechanisms for evaluating economic performance and new incentive mechanisms that prioritize the social dimension. They are also transversal to the public, for-profit sector and third sector. Finally, the notions of social enterprise, social entrepreneurship, fourth sector and solidary economy are integrated in the third group. These last notions refer to specific entities and enterprises. In the case of social enterprises and the solidarity economy, their proximity to the social economy is maximum, to the point of being considered part of the latter. The importance of the participatory and deliberative dimension of the solidary economy concept has undoubtedly contributed to the emergence in Europe of another new term, integrating both: the 'social and solidarity economy'. In summary, the new notions that have emerged in the context of the crisis of legitimacy of the hegemonic economic model must be considered complementary and even revitalizing with respect to the concept of the social economy.
M14|Overcoming sustainability barriers through Formalized Network Contracts (FNCs): the experience of Italian SMEs|The role of formal business networking in SMEs is receiving more attention from scholars and practitioners. However, several aspects remain unclear, including if and how, corporate sustainability approaches are implemented and aligned within such networks, mostly created for competitiveness and resource efficiency purpose. With the aim of filling this gap in the literature over Small Business Social Responsibility, an empirical investigation is proposed by analyzing 389 Formalized Network Contracts and their original legal document, following Bocken et al. (2014) business model archetypes and NBS (2012) studies on sustainable innovation and, normative-making perspectives. Findings include the addition of a new general aims for such FNC that is the creation and enablement of clusters, following the perspective of Creation of Shared Value. In addition, we demonstrate that FNC is a suitable tool for micro, SMEs, and individual entrepreneurs to meet sustainability issues introducing eco-innovations, eco-efficiency and shared value herein their products/services, business models and organizational changes as roughly half of these contracts include a reference to sustainability issues.
M14|Corporate Social Responsibility and workers' motivation at the industry equilibrium|We consider an industry in which firms compete at two levels, the labor market and the product market. On the labor market two types of workers co-exist, socially responsible or not. Firms may strategically use CSR investments in order to screen and to elicit more effort from responsible workers. By doing so, virtuous firms lower their production costs and display a competitive advantage on the product market. As a consequence, CSR strategies by firms shape the toughness of competition on that market. In turn, incentives that firms have to invest in CSR are dampened when competition becomes harsher. Hence, we identify a twofold relationship between CSR and competition. Due to feedback effects on the competitive pressure, an increase in workers' social awareness may reduce the overall level of CSR. We also show that an exogenous increase of competition may affect positively or negatively the corporate social performance depending on the proportion of responsible workers.
M14|Re-Thinking the CSP-CFP Linkage: Analyzing the Mechanisms Involved in Translating Socially-Responsible Behavior to Financial Performance|In this paper, we re-examine the notion that socially-responsible behavior by firms will lead to increased financial performance. By identifying the underlying processes, institutional settings and actors involved, we present a framework that is more attentive to the multiplicity and conditionality of the mechanisms operating in the often-tenuous connection between firms’ social behavior and financial performance. Building and expanding upon existing analyses of the CSP-CFP linkage, our model helps explain the mixed results from a wide range of empirical studies which examine this link. It also provides a novel theoretical account to help guide future research that is more attentive to conditionalities and contextual contingencies.
M14|Corporate social responsibility and tax avoidance|We theoretically analyse the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and tax avoidance of an oligopolistic firm. The firm maximizes a weighted sum of profits and a CSR objective that depends on output and the firm's contribution to public good provision, that is, tax payments. Making one CSR element more important induces the firm to adhere less to the other and to reduce tax avoidance. Hence, simultaneously a substitutive and a complementary relationship between CSR and tax avoidance can be observed. Therefore, using composite indicators of CSR prevents an empirical identification of this linkage. Moreover, if tax avoidance declines, CSR activities will increase. Consequently, the overall link between CSR and tax avoidance is theoretically ambiguous.
M14|Can citizens transform companies? Monitoring of the online reputation of companies by consumers|The objective of this research is to see how in a new social context, the network society, a consequence of the 3rd Industrial Revolution or ICT revolution, a new relational model between business and the citizens is established. In this new digital context, companies see how it shapes around them, but not only for their performance, also for a long been known and widely studied intangible called Corporate Reputation. It has acquired a new dimension in the Internet environment, as an aggregation of impressions of different stakeholders of the companies. The new network society has tools for monitoring the actions of companies and it has the ability to communicate the results of this monitoring through tools such as social networks, the blogosphere and the called new journalism (citizen journalism or civic journalism). Establishing analogies with John Keane's Monitory Democracy, we examine whether this new relational model between the citizens and businesses affects the creation of Corporate Reputation of companies and if the changes in this intangible affect the economic results of companies. In this cyberspace, where economic and civic actors interact with each other using (more or less) the same tools, it is where we place the question this article tries to answer as to whether the citizens in the digital environment are able, through their actions and interactions, to monitor and influence firms’ reputation and, therefore, their functioning and their practices. Finally, three examples are included of reputational conditions for companies, as well as a brief analysis of the consequences.
M14|"""It's a Bible!"" Unexpected use, misuse and non-use of CSR standards among ""activist"" workers"|"The purpose of this empirical study is to understand how ""activist"" workers use CSR standards in order to manage tensions stemming from their idealist identity. I use a narrative methodology with findings based on the analysis of narratives from shop-floor workers who combine activism and work in a cooperative network of organic shops framing the activity of independent retailers through a specification note detailing CSR imperatives. I contrast two dynamics. As subjects in the application of standards, workers display a deep trust towards the standards creator, arising from an imaginary about the expertise and ethics of the organization. Hence, they blindly use this management tool as a resource to frame the hyper-awareness and hyper-knowledge which create endless internal conflicts. As objects of those standards, workers tend to adopt a more critical or cynical stance. Hence, dissatisfied workers use standards as a resource in a struggle for their own sake, framing their propensity to sacrifice in order to support a higher purpose. The main contribution of the present paper is to show that CSR standards are used as resource to outsource identity tensions management to the organization. Those standards give ""the right dose of stupidity"" protecting workers from over-questioning and over-commitment that are double-edge swords for this kind of organizations."
M14|Women Entrepreneurs in Italy: A Prosopographic Study|Women entrepreneurs have long been an understudied topic in business history. This paper contributes to fill this gap by analyzing Italian women’s entrepreneurship from the mid-20th century to 2016. It is based on a new dataset concerning the profiles of the 80 women who were successful entrepreneurs and became Cavalieri del Lavoro (Knights of Labour), i.e., they were decorated with the Ordine al “Merito del Lavoro” (Order of Merit for Labour), the highest recognition for achievements in the world of business in Italy. The dataset also includes a comparable balanced sample of men who obtained the same award to single out the main similarities and differences between men and women entrepreneurs. This paper employs a quantitative prosopographic approach: after presenting some descriptive statistics and some exemplary cases of women entrepreneurs, it uses cluster analysis to identify typological groups of women versus men entrepreneurs. This paper show that the institutional context and gender stereotypes slowed down the development of Italian women’s entrepreneurial abilities. Women entrepreneurs tend to cluster in family firms and to have become entrepreneurs by inheritance, whereas they have been handicapped in all other fields relevant to entrepreneurial success: access to education (especially STEM), managerial career and experience abroad. Nonetheless, women entrepreneurs operated beyond women’s niches tied to the traditional ideology of femininity, e.g., textiles, garment and services. Several women operated in sectors such as chemicals and engineering in which many Italian industrial districts are specialized.
M14|Does CSR contribute to the development of rural young people in cultural tourism of sub-Saharan Africa? Evidence from the Niger Delta in Nigeria|Handicrafts are key cultural products consumed in the Nigeria’s tourism industry. Owing to low entry barriers, as handicrafts require a low level of capital investment, there is potential to develop viable linkages between tourism and local handicrafts sectors that create economic opportunities for local artisans. Thus, we assess the impact of a new corporate social responsibility (CSR) model of multinational oil companies on the development of rural young people (RYP) in cultural tourism in the Niger Delta of Nigeria. Six hundred RYP were sampled across the rural Niger Delta region. Using the logit model, results indicate that RYP have remained widely excluded from the General Memorandum of Understandings (GMoUs) interventions in cultural tourism projects due to the traditional beliefs that cultural affairs are prerogatives of elders, a caveat to the youths. This implies that if the traditions of the communities continue to hinder direct participation of the RYP from the GMoUs cultural tourism project interventions, achieving equality and cultural change would be limited in the region. The findings suggest that since handicrafts are key cultural products consumed in the tourism industry, GMoUs can play a role in helping to create an appropriate intervention structure that will be targeted towards youth empowerment in the area of traditional handicraft. This can be achieved if the Cluster Development Boards (CDBs) would focus on integrating rural young artisans into local tourism value chains and ensuring that they benefit economically from the sector. The CDBs should aim at creating space for the views of rural young indigenous people’s handicrafts; emphasizing the value of indigenous knowledge, particularly on arts and crafts for tourists and expatriate in multinational corporations in Nigeria.
M14|Dominating Attributes Of Professed Firm Culture Of Holding Companies – Members Of The Bulgarian Industrial Capital Association|This article aims to outline the diversity of cultural phenomena that occur at organizational level, emphasizing the place and role of the key attributes of professed firm culture for the survival and successful development of big business organizations. The holding companies, members of the Bulgarian Industrial Capital Association, are chosen as a survey object as the mightiest driving engines of the local economy. That is why their emergence and development in the transition period is monitored and analyzed. Based on an empirical study of relevant website content, important implications about dominating attributes of professed firm culture on them are found and several useful recommendations to their senior management are made.
M14|Geert Hofstede et al’s Set of National Cultural Dimensions - Popularity and Criticisms|This article outlines different stages in development of the national culture model, created by Geert Hofstede and his affiliates. This paper reveals and synthesizes the contemporary review of the application spheres of this framework. Numerous applications of the dimensions set are used as a source of identifying significant critiques, concerning different aspects in model’s operation. These critiques are classified and their underlying reasons are also outlined by means of a fishbone diagram.
M14|Critical Review of Models, Containing Cultural Levels beyond the Organizational One|The current article traces back the scientific interest to cultural levels across the organization at the University of National and World Economy, and especially in the series of Economic Alternatives – an official scientific magazine, issued by this university. Furthermore, a wider and critical overview of international achievements in this field is made, which reveals the diverse analysis perspectives with respect to cultural levels. Also, a useful model of exploring and teaching the cultural levels beyond the organization is proposed.
M14|Do institutional investors drive corporate social responsibility? International evidence|This paper assesses whether shareholders drive the environmental and social (E&S) performance of firms worldwide. Across 41 countries, institutional ownership is positively associated with E&S performance with additional tests suggesting this relation is causal. Institutions are motivated by both financial and social returns. Investors increase firms’ E&S performance following shocks that reveal financial benefits to E&S improvements. In cross section, investors increase firms’ E&S performance when they come from countries with a strong community belief in the importance of E&S issues, but not otherwise. As such, these institutional investors transplant their social norms regarding E&S issues around the world.
M14|The Value of Being Socially Responsible. A Primal-Dual Approach|This paper models Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as one of the outputs that results from a firm's decisions regarding what and how to produce. The framework developed allows for studying technical efficiency and deriving a system of internal shadow prices to quantify the value of implementing socially responsible activities. The empirical application focuses on the food and beverage manufacturing sector worldwide. The results indicate high levels of technical efficiency in this sector and document a positive average shadow price of CSR activities, implying that the net value of implementing this kind of activities is positive to the firm as their benefit exceeds the cost. In particular, it is shown that increasing the CSR engagement at the margin positively contributes to the creation of firm value, while reducing it has a negative marginal impact.
M14|Is Social Responsibility a Normal Good?|We investigate whether growth in consumer income causes an increased willingness to pay to mitigate negative externalities from consumption.

Our experimental results reveal that growth in consumer income causes an increase in the share of socially responsible consumption in the laboratory. Such a causal relationship is significant from a policy perspective, as it implies that some negative external impacts of consumption activity can be mitigated as societies experience economic growth.
M14|Performance, Diversity and National Identity Evidence from Association football|The increasing national diversity of co-workers has no consensus on its impact on performance. Using a team’s predominant nationality as proxy for national diversity and national identity, there is robust evidence that it affects performance. Detailed worker-level data from a highly globalized industry, association football, shows a non-linear relationship between performance and the predominant nationality of a team’s roster. As the number of members from the predominant nationality increase, performance declines. However, beyond a threshold level, performance rises. It implies that performance benefits from national diversity when the predominant nationality is small and from national identity when it is large.
M14|Nudging and Environmental Corporate Responsibility: A Natural Experiment|We devise a ‘nudging’ natural experiment to test the impact of a simple form of advertising on environmentally responsible products with/without the increase of the responsible product price. We find that the simple use of a small shelf-poster explaining the importance of buying a green product (with/without a concurring price increase) generates significant changes in market shares for some of the product classes for both food and non-food products. Part of the effect is generated by the reduced price elasticity of consumers to the poster-plus-price-increase treatment.
M14|The Financial Performance-Corporate Reputation Nexus in Turkey|There is a growing interest in corporate reputation among researches. Those who indicate the institutional and organizational stability as main source of economic growth state that any endeavor of corporates increasing production and employment is no longer sufficient for sustainable growth. It is obvious that national economies need intangible assets as far as tangible ones. Corporate reputation is one of these intangible assets. Reputation of any organization entirely depends on stakeholders? perception. The presence and level of this perception are affected by some factors associated with the positions of external and internal stakeholders. In this context, we investigate the potential linkage between corporate reputation and financial performance of corporates in Turkey between 2006 and 2016. This study aims to identify the financial determinants of corporate reputation as well as perception of stakeholders. Our data set is balanced panel. The dependent variable is the current reputation rankings which are output of Capital Magazine?s survey of ?Most Admired Companies of Turkey?. This survey has been conducted since 1999, and respondents are professional managers. In order to have a balanced panel, we evaluate six companies which were in top 20 for the longest time together, and whose stocks are traded in Borsa Istanbul. Our independent variables are return on equity (ROE), current ratio (CR), debt ratio (DR), asset turnover ratio (ATR), growth of marketing expenditures, and previous reputation ranking of company. GDP growth rate, origin country of company, and company?s sector are control variables. Data sample is based on Capital?s survey, balance sheets and income statements of the companies. We employ a random-effects model for estimation. The preliminary results show that there are significant relationships between ROE, ATR, previous reputation ranking, company?s sector, and current reputation ranking. While ROE would increase, the current reputation of the company would be higher. On the other hand, our model indicates that there is a positive relationship between ATR and the current reputation ranking. These first results will inevitably lead to management policy advices for professional managers to build a sustain reputation in micro level. Additionally, some macro policy proposals can be inferred through the institutional-based view.
M14|Collaborative Innovation with External Partners in China: Cultural Similarity Effect|This study focuses on collaborative innovation in China ICT(Information and Communications Technology) industry. Although prior findings point out that collaborative innovations do facilitate innovation performance, there are some unresolved problems and one of which is the problem of ?collaborating with whom?. Is there the effect of cultural similarity in collaborative innovation. This paper aims to contribute to the literature of collaborative innovation by investigating into the effects of collaborative partners on innovation performance from the perspective of cultural similarity. Based on the analysis of patent and citation from the U.S. Patents and Trademark Office (USPTO) from 1985 to 2010, empirical results are shown the performance of collaborative innovation between China and foreign is significantly greater than that of domestic collaborative innovation in China. The performance of collaborative innovation between China and culturally similar country is significantly better than that between China assignees and culturally different country.
M14|Cooperation and competititon in international business negotiations|The purpose of the study is to examine the intercultural aspect in business negotiations. In doing so, it first outlines the theoretical background to distributive and integrative business negotiations as well as competition-related values and practices established by two pieces of large-scale dimension-based cross-cultural research. Then it moves on to discuss an empirical investigation which ? through the observation of twenty business negotiations between German and Turkish delegations ? aimed to find out whether and if yes, to what extent and how members of the two cultures demonstrate competition-related cultural norms. The results of the investigation indicate that failure to take national cultural differences into account may result in misunderstandings, loss of trust or even failure to conclude a deal even in integrative business negotiations.
M14|Dialogue of cultures in higher education|Internationalisation of higher education is not a new phenomenon. It has existed since the foundation of universities due to the international character of knowledge and the intent to be involved in the educational processes in the world. For decades, with the rise of globalisation the internationalisation of universities has been of growing importance and in consequence Hungarian institutions must face the challenges when foreign students are found in several courses, Hungarian students go abroad to widen their knowledge and outgoing and incoming professors and lecturers can be seen at universities. It means that several cultures can be found at institutions and cross-cultural issues are a key factor. This paper puts the examination in context by outlining the historical background of internationalisation of universities in Hungary, and then it describes the present situation focusing on the regulations determining the international process. This paper looks at intercultural interaction issues and then summarises the differences in behaviour, attitudes and norms. Attitudes of individuals with different cultural backgrounds are of critical importance to the outcomes of the interaction and are a basis for the relationship we form with others. These attitudes of individuals or groups of individuals are shaped, in large part, by prior experiences, and the socialization process, i.e. by culture. The findings of this study prove that culture also influences people?s way of thinking and behaving and result in different understanding toward vision and purposes of universities.
M14|Generational Differences in Career Expectations: An Empirical Study among Turkish workers|A new generation of employees with different needs and new expectations of management is entering the workplace. They are known by many names, but most will recognize them as the Nexters or Generation Y. It is essential to be understood about generational differences in organizations. Career expectations play a major role in determining career outcomes. It is important to understand what generations expect in their career path. This study aims to investigate career expectations of Generation X and Y in Turkish society. The sample of this study consisted of 1200 workers in differnet sectors in Turkey. The results represent the Turkish generational differences in career expectations.
M14|The Microfinance Industry|In this presentation the current stage of the microfinance industry will be described. The microfinance industry has increased drastically over the last few decades. It began as a handful of institutions in the late 1970´s but is now a growing market with thousands of institutions. Most of the microfinance institutions are in the developing countries, particularly in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Recently, however, microfinance institutions are being established in the developed world. In addition in the presentation, a history of past failure of subsidized loans is explained. Different but important contributions from Stiglitz and Yunnus are accounted for. Finally, the microfinance industry´s current state and potential future growth will be described.
M14|Women - The Microfinance Industry in the past, present and towards the future|In this presentation the stage of the microfinance industry in Iceland will be accounted for. Short introduction of the industry in Iceland will be made. Many microfinance institutions have been set up in the developing world causing great success in decreasing poverty in the area. The popularity in these institutions have ben noticed in the developed world and now, many microfinance institutions have been established in the developed west, including in Iceland. While the situation is not the same in Iceland as in the developed world, I will try to answer the following question ,,have the microfinance institutions in Iceland brought prosperity to their borrowers or are they worse off after taking microfinance loans??.
M14|Bullying and harassment in sport: overview of management instruments|Relevance of research. An aspiration to manage bullying and harassment in sport is a part of wider international issues there are solved ethics and integration of such problems as usage of doping, manipulation of competition, safety of events and fair game organization (Mountjoy et al, 2015; Maffulli, 2007; Brackenridge et al, 2011; Kainz, 2015; etc.). The behavior of sport?s leaders and even athletes themselves, such as ignoring, not reacting, and resisting of bullying and harassment prevention, is a challenge while trying to implement bullying and harassment management instruments in sport. The refuse to recognize prevention of bullying and harassment supports the root causes of coercion (Mountjoy et al., 2016). This is an important reason primary concentrate on analyses of existing management instruments of bullying and harassment.Object of research is management instruments of bullying and harassment in sport.Purpose of the research is to make analyses of management instruments of bullying and harassment comparing application of prevention models in sport.Methods of research were scientific research analyses of bullying and harassment prevention programs and their application.Research results. Analyses and comparison of such prevention programs as Olweus Bullying Prevention, KiVa Anti-bullying, Positive behavior support (SW-PBS), Athletic coach-delivered (ARA/SV) prevention, harassment programs called ?Take care?, and ?Control program on study skills?, showed that just some of these programs are applied to sport. Research of prevention programs application showed that interactive prevention applying contemporary technologies such as internet, smart phone aps, etc., could be more effective prevention than personal prevention using personal meetings with participant of bullying and harassment prevention. Prevention programs of bullying and harassment should be adjusted separately to the bystanders, participants and victims including differences of gender perception. An important orientation is towards the perpetrator but not to the victim, since only the taken responsibility could help to stop the actions of antisocial behavior. The leaders of sport organizations must initiate and implement the management instruments of bullying and harassment. They supposed to provide training and constructive beliefs to take responsibility of the own behavior and harmoniously improve the changing culture of sport organization. Thus, the management instruments of bullying and harassment should include reviews of law enforcement strategies, culturally tailored training programs, and implement policy and procedures to sport community.Acknowledgement.

M14|Beyond Budgeting - a fair alternative for management control? Examining the relationships between Beyond Budgeting, organizational justice and unethical behaviors|The influence of Management Control Systems (MCS) on the social framework of organizations has been discussed in research and practice since the seminal work of Chris Argyris (1953). In this context, the impact of MCS design on unethical behaviors has been of particular interest. To remedy MCS related unethical behaviors some researchers developed Beyond Budgeting (BB) as an alternative MCS approach that is rooted in McGregor?s Theory Y. BB builds on specific MCS characteristics and its proponents claim that these characteristics are capable to reduce MCS related unethical behaviors. However, there has been quite little research on the underlying effect mechanisms of the relationship between the design of MCS characteristics and unethical behaviors. Recent research suggests that the design of MCS characteristics has a significant impact on organizational justice perceptions. Furthermore, organizational justice has been found to be positively correlated with various positive organizational outcomes, particularly trust and behavior. This study tries to contribute to deepen the understanding of the interplay between MCS design, organizational justice and unethical behaviors by applying structural equation modelling to examine these relationships. The results suggest that some MCS characteristics that are part of a BB design have a significant impact on organizational justice perceptions. Moreover, the results also suggest that the enhancement of organizational justice perceptions might finally lead to a reduction of MCS related unethical behaviors.
M14|Cultural convergence or divergence?|The paper explores implications of implementation of contemporary market economy and company management in countries with significantly different national cultures comparing to those in which they emerged. In such countries a dilemma occurs: should national culture be adjusted to economic system and management or should just the opposite be done? The consequence in the first option is the process of convergence, while the consequence in the second option is the process of divergence of national cultures. The paper suggests that Serbia should choose and implement the strategy of crossvergence, that is, to simultaneously adjust the system of market economy and management on the one hand, and national culture on the other. The paper also analyses the roles that the Government, company managers and, especially, academic researchers and teachers should play in the process of crossvergence.
M14|Business ethics and corporate social responsibility as a tool to stimulate interest in the living environment|Business ethics, corporate social responsibility and environmental management in business largely overlap and are often the reason for the controversy over their effectiveness and real benefits for businesses and society. An elementary prerequisite for their effective functioning is the overall social interest. Specifically, it concerns the interest on the part of businesses management and, on the other hand, the interest of the citizens who are able to appreciate these practices and put a special emphasis on them. The constant pressure for the protection of the environment from interest groups and international organizations is of a fundamental importance in the development and application of ethical, social and environmental standards that are used in business practice. The information contained in this article presents the information from both primary and secondary surveys carried out in the Czech Republic. The aim of the information is to assess the attitudes of the respondents in the Czech Republic toward the issue of the overall social nature, which the business ethics and related areas such as corporate social responsibility and environmental management certainly are. In the light of the results of national surveys, it is possible to talk about a contradictory perception of these areas. The contradictory nature can be mainly seen in the positive attitudes toward the acquaintance with this issue and the real interest in the support through a financial compensation of such an approach to business. All interpretations are based on the data, which are derived from the questionnaire surveys carried out in the years 2015 - 2018.
M14|Ethical aspects of offering bank products and services to children, youths and young adults|Children, youths and young adults are becoming a group of clients increasingly served by banks. Due to the lack of regular incomes and an unstable financial situation, these people are not the key customer segment for the banks. Nonetheless, they are treated as prospective clients that are expected to bring profits in the future. An offering of products and services to customers with low financial knowledge and poor experience in finance is a serious ethical concern. Such offerings may bring vital social, economic and financial benefits but also may generate substantial risks. The goal of this paper is to characterise and evaluate ethical aspects of the offering of bank products to young people. For the purpose of the work we reviewed literature and used SWOT analysis to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the offering of bank products and services to children, youths, and young adults and considered them in an ethical context. We also conducted a survey using CAWI technique on a group of 209 young people. Research shows that young people perceive banks and their offers as safe, and this positively affects their financial knowledge.
M14|"""Cultural additivity"" and how the values and norms of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism co-exist, interact, and influence Vietnamese society: A Bayesian analysis of long-standing folktales, using R and Stan"|"Every year, the Vietnamese people reportedly burned about 50,000 tons of joss papers, which took the form of not only bank notes, but iPhones, cars, clothes, even housekeepers, in hope of pleasing the dead. The practice was mistakenly attributed to traditional Buddhist teachings but originated in fact from China, which most Vietnamese were not aware of. In other aspects of life, there were many similar examples of Vietnamese so ready and comfortable with adding new norms, values, and beliefs, even contradictory ones, to their culture. This phenomenon, dubbed ""cultural additivity"", prompted us to study the co-existence, interaction, and influences among core values and norms of the Three Teachings –Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism–as shown through Vietnamese folktales. By applying Bayesian logistic regression, we evaluated the possibility of whether the key message of a story was dominated by a religion (dependent variables), as affected by the appearance of values and anti-values pertaining to the Three Teachings in the story (independent variables). Our main findings included the existence of the cultural additivity of Confucian and Taoist values. More specifically, empirical results showed that the interaction or addition of the values of Taoism and Confucianism in folktales together helped predict whether the key message of a story was about Confucianism, β{VT ⋅ VC} = 0.86. Meanwhile, there was no such statistical tendency for Buddhism. The results lead to a number of important implications. First, this showed the dominance of Confucianism because the fact that Confucian and Taoist values appeared together in a story led to the story’s key message dominated by Confucianism. Thus, it presented the evidence of Confucian dominance and against liberal interpretations of the concept of the Common Roots of Three Religions (""tam giáo đồng nguyên"") as religious unification or unicity. Second, the concept of ""cultural additivity"" could help explain many interesting socio-cultural phenomena, namely the absence of religious intolerance and extremism in the Vietnamese society, outrageous cases of sophistry in education, the low productivity in creative endeavors like science and technology, the misleading branding strategy in business. We are aware that our results are only preliminary and more studies, both theoretical and empirical, must be carried out to give a full account of the explanatory reach of ""cultural additivity""."
M14|Money and the Commons: An Investigation of Complementary Currencies and their Ethical Implications|The commons is a concept increasingly used with the promise of creating new collective wealth. In the aftermath of the economic and financial crises, finance and money have been criticized and redesigned to serve the collective interest. In this article, we analyze three types of complementary currency (CC) systems: community currencies, inter-enterprise currencies, and cryptocurrencies. We investigate whether these systems can be considered as commons. To address this question, we use two main theoretical frameworks that are usually separate: the “new commons” in organization studies and the “common good” in business ethics. Our findings show that these monetary systems and organizations may be considered as commons under the “common good” framework since they promote the common interest by creating new communities. Nevertheless, according to the “new commons” framework, only systems relying on collective action and self-management can be said to form commons. This allows us to suggest two new categories of commons: the “social commons”, which fit into both the “new commons” and the “common good” frameworks, and the “commercial commons”, which fit the “common good” but not the “new commons” framework. This research advances a new conceptualization of the commons and of the ethical implications of complementary currencies.
M14|De la responsabilité sociale : à propos des rôles respectifs de l'entreprise et de l'Etat|La revendication d’une responsabilité sociale de l’entreprise va de pair avec un recul de la capacité d’intervention des États dans le contexte de mondialisation. Cela ne saurait justifier que l’entreprise taxe et dépense en lieu et place de l’État dont elle ne peut détenir ni le pouvoir juridique, ni l’information s’agissant du bien public. L’entreprise est, néanmoins, une source de droit étant, possiblement, à l’initiative d’avancées sociales et environnementales. Son action s’inscrit dans la montée en puissance d’une dualité des ordres juridiques, un ordre étatique et un ordre privé. Ce qui ne dispense en rien d’une validation des règles par l’État ne serait-ce que pour garantir une concurrence équitable et maintenir une hiérarchie des normes. Le mode de gouvernance, qui reflète l’influence des intermédiaires financiers, procède de cette validation et détermine le choix de l’entreprise entre un profit immédiat et un profit à long terme, autrement dit sa réelle responsabilité sociale. Aussi la question, dans le contexte actuel, n’est-elle pas de substituer l’entreprise à l’État, mais de concevoir l’instance publique qui est susceptible de permettre à des entreprises mondialisées de privilégier le long terme.
M14|Does Bank Stakeholder Orientation Enhance Financial Stability? Evidence from a Natural Experiment|Using the staggered enactment of US state constituency statutes, which provides plausibly exogenous variations in directors’ fiduciary duties, we find that stakeholder orientation significantly reduces bank risk. This relation cannot be explained by reverse causality, local economic conditions and coincidental state antitakeover laws and banking deregulation policies. Consistent with lower risk-taking, we find that banks reduce risk through increasing capital and lending to safer borrowers. Furthermore, stakeholder orientation improves bank performance only for those banks that take excessive risk. Finally, banks that previously received a statute passage fared significantly better during the crises. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of bank directors’ fiduciary duties in safeguarding financial stability, and more broadly, support the increasing calls for greater emphasis on stakeholder interests in the current bank regulatory and governance reforms.
M14|CEO general managerial skills and corporate social responsibility|This study examines the impact of managerial skill sets on corporate social responsibility (CSR). We show that firms with chief executive officers (CEOs) who gain general managerial skill sets through their lifetime work experience (i.e., generalist CEOs) tend to engage in less CSR. This finding remains consistent after considering potential endogenous matching between CEO types and firms, as well as alternative measures of CSR. We further show that the negative relationship between generalist CEOs and CSR becomes more prominent when CEOs are close to the timing of job-hopping, especially for firms with a higher level of institutional ownership and institutional investors who frequently alter their holding positions. These findings are consistent with the argument that CEOs who frequently face the short-term performance pressure from the labor market are reluctant to invest in projects which are likely to generate profits over the long run.
M14|Caractéristiques de l’entrepreneuriat féminin à Dakar au Sénégal|Cet article vise principalement à mieux comprendre la participation des femmes aux activités entrepreneuriales de la région de Dakar. À partir de modèles théoriques bien connus, nous créons le modèle de l’entrepreneure sénégalaise en mettant l’accent sur la culture entrepreneuriale. Des méthodes d’analyse de données multidimensionnelles, à partir de données primaires collectées auprès de 153 femmes entrepreneures, nous permettent de créer des typologies supervisées de l’entrepreneuriat féminin selon les secteurs (formel, informel). Les résultats montrent que la création dépend du capital humain, social et culturel de l’entrepreneure, et confirment l’importance du capital social dans l’entrepreneuriat féminin des pays en développement.
M14|L'innovation responsable|The aim of this paper is to present an overview of the « responsible innovation » concept. This concept was first defined at the beginning of the 21st century. It then spread around the world, driven by the European Commission. Firstly, we present the roots of this concept which are based on, on the one hand, the philosophical approach of “researchers and engineers responsibility”, and on the other hand, technological assessment. Then, we describe how the concept of “responsible research and innovation” has grown progressively in European research and innovation politics, in order to bring science and innovation closer to society. Lastly, we describe how this concept is used in companies in connection with their social responsibility. ....French Abstract: L’objectif de ce papier est de réaliser un « état de l’art » portant sur le concept d’ « innovation responsable » apparu au début des années 2000 et diffusé notamment sous l’impulsion de la Commission Européenne. Nous présentons tout d’abord les fondements, de ce concept, en lien avec l’approche philosophique de la responsabilité des chercheurs et ingénieurs, d’une part, les questions relatives à l’évaluation des techniques d’autre part. Puis nous exposons comment le concept de « recherche et innovation responsables » s’est développé progressivement dans les politiques européennes de recherche et d’innovation, afin de rapprocher la science et l’innovation de la société. Enfin, nous relatons comment ce concept est décliné dans les entreprises, en lien avec leur responsabilité sociétale.
M14|Creativity and entrepreneurship: Empirical evidence for Catalonia| In recent years creativity has gained importance because of its potential to generate economic growth based on their role in the innovation processes and economic development. In this regard, this work is twofold. First, it addresses the mechanisms through which creativity promotes knowledge externalities and innovation contributing to regional economic growth and competitiveness. And second, it aims to analyse the role of creativity, diversity and innovation on entrepreneurship at a municipality level for Catalonia. To conduct this analysis, information provided by the Register of Industrial Establishments of Catalonia (REIC) â€“ a register that includes the creation of new establishments located in Catalonia between 2002 and 2007 â€“ , and by the Statistical Institute of Catalonia (IDESCAT) are used. Main results highlight the role of creativity in the spreading of ideas and the creation of new projects encouraging entrepreneurship at local level. However, the role of cultural diversity does not seem to be so relevant in deciding the location of new firms in Catalan municipalities. Finally, intellectual and technological productivity in the municipality (in terms of patents) favours the creation of new firms but only in municipalities closer to technologic and scientific centres. Keywords: creativity, diversity, innovation, entrepreneurship, industrial location JEL codes: O31, M14, O32, L26, O14
M14|Employment of persons with disabilities as a corporate social responsibility initiative: Necessity and variants of implementation|Although companies recognize and promote the benefits of a diverse corporate culture, persons with disabilities (PWD), are more likely to be unemployed. Using secondary sources of information, this paper examines the need to address the employment of PWD as part of a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy, highlighting various implementation measures and variants. It shows that the employment of PWD can only be promoted by companies themselves. Measures at the national and international levels have so far shown little success. For a successful implementation, an obligation in the CSR strategy is not enough, measures need to be described explicitly. At its core, it is always necessary to remove physical and mental barriers in the company in order to enable the employment of PWD. The adaptation of CSR initiatives concerning the employment of PWD should be further investigated. The research should particularly focus on “best practice” approaches from business practice.
M14|Comparing the impact of vocational rehabilitation and the employment of persons with disabilities on companies: Analysis of existing research|The constant above-average unemployment rate of people with disabilities (PWD) and the failure of government measures to date indicate the need for companies to address this issue themselves. A reliable understanding of the effects and implications of employment of PWD and vocational rehabilitation for strategic corporate management is therefore required to specifically promote the integration of PWD into the labor market. This paper compares the impacts of the two concepts from a management perspective. A literature review was conducted to collect and analyze the state of research for similarities and differences regarding the categories government policies, corporate social responsibility (CSR), benefits and consequences for companies and business opportunities using a summary content analysis. The results suggest that the effects on companies and the resulting implications are identical, at least over a longer period. The employment of PWD, as well as vocational rehabilitation, can be a key to attracting customers with disabilities and thus allowing to enter new market segments.
M14|Creating shared value through implementing vocational rehabilitation in the corporate social responsibility strategy: A literature review|"After an accident or illness, it may be difficult or even impossible to return to work. Although occupational safety and health (OHS) are essential elements of corporate social responsibility (CSR), support for employees returning to work or vocational rehabilitation are rarely part of the CSR strategy. The aim of this paper is to assess and synthesize the current state of research of vocational rehabilitation in the context of CSR. A literature analysis was conducted to examine the need to address vocational rehabilitation as part of the CSR strategy as well as the existing approaches for implementation. Vocational rehabilitation is an important part of a company's social responsibility towards its employees as well as towards society. The promotion of vocational rehabilitation should be an essential element of the CSR strategy and can create shared value. However, a commitment to vocational rehabilitation alone is not enough; the commitment must be explicitly described and go beyond the legal minimum. That can be done, for example, through return-to-work (RTW) policies, proactive initiation and coordination of the rehabilitation process, the adaptation of the workplace and work activities, the institutionalization of sheltered workplaces, and a specialist unit for vocational rehabilitation within the company. Particularly access for external persons to the company's sheltered workplaces, internships or entry-level positions is a critical aspect for substantially promoting vocational rehabilitation and achieving additional shared value. Vocational rehabilitation as part of the CSR strategy must continue to be examined empirically, in particular ""best practice"" approaches from business practice."
M14|Job Quality, Health and Productivity: An evidence-based framework for analysis|The nature, content and milieu of work – i.e. the quality of the working environment – matter in many ways for people, firms and society as a whole. There is a great deal of evidence to show clear associations between job quality and the health of workers, their ability to successfully combine work and life while fully mobilising their skills and abilities to build a career, and their productivity. Investments in quality working environments can be welfare enhancing and economically efficient. Policies and practices reflect these findings insufficiently, an apparent paradox that finds its roots in various market failures. There is scope for public intervention to raise awareness, to ensure better coordination of key stakeholders (employers, workers’ representatives and various public entities) and to put in place the right financial incentives for firms to invest in better working conditions. Action in this field is also important in view of ongoing considerable changes in the labour market. The future of work is very uncertain at this stage; the digitalisation and uberisation of work have the potential for improvements in working conditions but also bear the risk of de-skilling, lower pay, lower job security and poor working conditions for parts of the labour force.
M14|Male pupils taught by female homeroom teachers show higher preference for Corporate Social Responsibility in adulthood|On the demand side, we test how early childhood education creates preferences for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) through teacher-student gender randommatching. Using originally collected individual-level data, we examine how female teachers in elementary school influence students f CSR stated preferences in their adulthood. In a quasi-natural experiment setting, our major findings are: (1) female teachers affect pupils f preferences for corporate responsibility later in life, (2) the effect of a female teacher is robust if she was a class teacher in first grade, (3) the effect of a female teacher is observed only for different-gender pupils but not for same-gender ones. These findings imply that the gender gap in adulthood is reduced by matching female teachers with male students in earlier years. We examine and support the female socialization hypothesis.
M14|The Review of Language Studies in International Business: Suggestions and Future Directions for Japan|We conduct a systematic and narrative review of the literature in the area of language studies in international business (IB). Our contributions seek to outline the research of language in IB both in Western countries and in Japan. Moreover, we aim to open up the debate of language studies in IB in Japan as the most important contribution; we offer suggestions for future research in Japan based on prior studies and discuss managerial implications for Japanese corporations. The pertinent literature we use in this paper is based on chronological and categorical turns, by dividing language studies in IB into three stages: infancy, toddler and preschool stages.
M14|Optimal taxation, environment quality, socially responsible firms and investors|We characterize the optimal pollution-, capital- and labour-tax structure in a continuous-time growth model in the presence of pollution (resulting from production), both in the first- and second-best, allowing investors to be driven by social responsibility objectives. The social responsibility objective takes the form of warm-glow, as in Andreoni (1990) and Dam (2011), inducing firms to reduce pollution through increased abatement activity. Among the results, the first best pollution tax is still positive under warm-glow, the second-best pollution tax displays the additivity property, and we show the circumstances under which the Chamley-Judd zero capital-income tax result does not hold.
M14|Social responsibility in a bilateral monopoly with R&D|This note examines social responsibility in a linear bilateral monopoly by incorporating a cost-reducing R&D investment and investigates an endogenous timing game. We find that in the presence of R&D, the retailer always adopts social responsibility irrespective of the timing of the game, but the manufacturer adopts only with its leadership in a sequential game where it can take the first-mover advantage. We also show that two sequential choices will be subgame perfect equilibria, but the commitment to the social responsibility by manufacturer is a payoff dominance outcome.
M14|Analysis of Corporate Social Responsibility, Default Risk and Conservatism Effect to Earning Management with Good Corporate Governance as Moderating Variable in Manufacturing Company Whose Shares Incorporated in Indonesia Sharia Stock Index|The purpose of this research is to examine and analyze Good Corporate Governance in moderating the relationship between Corporate Social Responsibility (as measured by economic, environmental and social), Default Risk (as measured by debt to equity ratio and debt to assets ratio) and Conservatism (as measured by earning / stock return relation, accruals and net assets) Earnings Management. The sample used is a manufacturing company during the period 2011-2015. The total sample used is 170 samples. Sampling technique used is saturated sample method. The analytical model used in this research with Structural Equation Modeling. The results showed that Corporate Social Responsibility, as measured by the economy and environment, has a positive and significant effect on earning management, while Corporate Social Responsibility measured by social have negative and significant effect to earning management. Default risk, as measured by debt to equity ratio and debt to asset ratio, has positive and significant effect on Earnings Management. Also, conservatism measured by earning / stock return relation and accrual has adverse and insignificant effect on earning management. Good Corporate Governance moderates weakening the effect of Corporate Social Responsibility as measured by economic, environmental to Earnings Management. Meanwhile, the interaction of Corporate Social Responsibility proxy by social with good corporate governance has a positive and significant effect. Good Corporate Governance moderates weakening the effect of default risk measured by debt to equity ratio on Earnings Management, while the interaction between default risk measured by debt to asset ratio with good corporate governance has positive and insignificant effect, so GCG does not moderate the effect of default risk as measured by debt to asset ratio to Earnings Management. Another result was that good Corporate governance does not moderate Conservatism effect measured by Earning Stock Return and accrual to Earnings Management on manufacturing companies registered in ISSI on the Indonesia Stock Exchange
M14|Финансово - Счетоводни Аспекти На Търговската Репутация<BR>[Financial and Accounting Aspects of Goodwill]|Репутацията като обект на счетоводството винаги е била предмет на множество дискусии и така е придавала облик на цялата тема за бизнескомбинациите. Дебатът за същността й, започнал в публикациите на авторите от края на 19 век, преминава през нормативното й регламентиране и продължава с пълна сила до днес. Целта на дисертационния труд е да се извърши критичен преглед на теоретичните аспекти на търговската репутация и развитието на нормативното й регламентиране, както и да се разкрият съществени проблеми при признаването, оценяването и оповестяването на търговската репутация във финансовите отчети на българските публични предприятия, участващи при формирането на борсовия индекс BGBX 40 и на тази основа да се изведат насоки за подобряване на отчитането, представянето и оповестяването й. Като резултат от проведеното изследване е обобщено, че съществуващите правила, залегнали в МСС/МСФО, от една страна са свързани с изпълнението на прекалено сложни процедури при практическото им реализиране, а от друга – дават възможност за проява на относително високо ниво на субективност от страна на ръководствата на предприятията при оценяването на репутацията. Установените слабости по отношение на информацията относно репутацията във финансовите отчети, са основание да се застъпва тезата, че е необходима промяна в режима на последващо отчитане на репутацията. Формулирани са конкретни предложения за подобряване на оповестяванията и са разработени примерни модели за оповестяване при действащия режим на отчитане в приложимите МСС/МСФО. Те имат за цел подобряване на качествените характеристики и повишаване на информационната стойност за потребителите на финансовите отчети. Goodwill has been a central topic in accounting for many years. It has always been the subject of many discussions and thus has given the whole face of business combinations. The debate about its essence, which began in the publications of the authors of the late 19th century, goes through its normative regulation and continues to its full force today. The purpose of this dissertation is to make a critical review of the theoretical aspects of goodwill and the development of its normative regulation, as well as to reveal significant problems in the recognition, assessment and disclosure of goodwill in the financial statements of Bulgarian public enterprises involved in the formation of the BGBX 40 index and, on that basis, to provide guidance on how to improve its reporting, presentation and disclosure. As a result of the research, it is concluded that the existing rules set out in the IAS / IFRS, on the one hand, are related to the implementation of overly complex procedures in their practical implementation and, on the other hand, allow for a relatively high level of subjectivity of the management of the enterprises in the evaluation of goodwill. The weaknesses identified with regard to goodwill in the financial statements are grounds for arguing that there is a need to change the subsequent reporting regime of goodwill. Specific suggestions to improve disclosures have been formulated and exemplary disclosure models have been developed under the current reporting regime in the applicable IAS / IFRS. They aim to improve the quality characteristics and increase the information value for the users of the financial statements.
M14|A note on the social responsibility in a bilateral monopoly|In a linear bilateral monopoly with the up-stream manufacturer and the down-stream retailer “consumers’ friendly” socially concerned (i.e. caring about a share of consumer surplus), Brand and Grothe (2015, in this Journal) shows that, although (as expected) both firms’ owners do not have an incentive to deviate from pure profit maximization when they choose their level of corporate social responsibility (CSR) simultaneously (or the retailer commits itself on social concern before the manufacturerer does), if the manufacturer commits itself on social concern before the retailer does, then both profits are enhanced. This paper shows that Brand and Grothe’s result may be strongly modified if there are decreasing returns to the input: only the retailer firm’s owners are incentived to adopt CSR and, at the equilibrium, this leads to a Pareto-superior outcome. This offers straightforward policy and empirical implications, arguing that the presence of CSR-type firms – which leads to higher profits and Pareto-superior outcomes, confirming the neoclassical economics point of view with respect to the adoption of CSR behaviors by firms’ owners – depends crucially on the technology.
M14|Does market competition dampen environmental performance? Evidence from China|Research Summary: Departing from the extant literature, which assumes that firms pursue strong environmental performance as a differentiation strategy, we analyze the general relationship between firms’ competitive strategy and their response to heightened market competition. We find that, using a large sample of Chinese manufacturing firms between 2000 and 2005, intensified market competition has an overall negative impact on firms’ environmental performance. The negative impact is exacerbated in firms adopting a cost‐leadership strategy, but is attenuated in those adopting a differentiation strategy. The results emphasize the importance of including an examination of the particular competitive strategies chosen by firms in seeking to understand the impact of intensified market competition. Managerial Summary: Advocates of corporate social responsibility (CSR) have long argued for the differentiation role of CSR. However, managers may be misguided if the assumed benefits of differentiation critically depend on certain presumptions. In the Chinese context and focusing on the environmental dimension of CSR, our study finds a negative relationship between market competition and corporate environmental performance. It suggests that firms, to a large extent, cannot escape competition via environmental differentiation. Managers should therefore be cautious about the value of strategic investment in CSR as a viable competitive device.
M14|Strategic Corporate Social Responsibility and Spillover|This paper investigates the firms’ incentive of using corporate socially responsible (CSR) innovation as a device in the presence of spillover effect of such innovation. By modelling a two-period environment where a fraction of consumers is altruistic who have higher willingness to pay for the CSR product, we particularly study the firms’ decision on CSR innovation with respect to the spillover effect and the fraction of the altruistic consumers. We find that a large (small) fraction of the altruistic consumers attracts (restricts) both firms to innovate. Moreover, if the leader has only one chance to innovate (i.e., makes decision on innovation in the first period onely), a relatively large fraction could be a credible threat from the follower to the leader of innovation. Furthermore, in the situation where the leader has option of innovating in both periods, there exists a “patient area” in which the leader wishes to delay its innovation and do it with its rival in the second period. By doing so, the leader can weaken the rival’s benefit from being a follower of innovation.
M14|"Устойчиво производство и потребление – ролята на стандартизацията, ИК “Ран-Р”, София, 2018 (Sustainable production and consumption - the role of standardization, Ed. ""Ran-R"", Sofia, 2018)<BR>[Sustainable production and consumption - the role of standardization, Ed. ""Ran-R"", Sofia, 2018]"|"In 2015, the UN New Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030 was adopted and seventeen global goals were developed integrating the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable development. Goal 12 is defined as ""Ensuring Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns"" (UN Global Goals 2030). It has a central role to play in tackling global consumption of resources and the environmental impacts associated with it, as well as numerous social and economic problems. The promotion of sustainable patterns of consumption and production and sustainable lifestyle is linked to the creation of policies involving a large number of stakeholders which in turn will offer innovative policy solutions to sustainable development problems. Against the backdrop of a variety of policy initiatives at international, European and national level, there is a need in Bulgaria for policies encouraging sustainable production and consumption. Standards have the potential to play a significant role in these processes, amid a wide range of regulations and existing social norms relating to sustainable consumption and production. A number of authors emphasize that the current development of standardization builds on its conventional focus on technical facilities or systems with the inclusion of social and environmental themes (Bistro and Klintman, 2011, Brunsson and Jacobson, 2000, Busch, 2000, Tamm Hallstrom, 2008). They support the idea that standardization emerges as a common new form of regulation in today's globalized world alongside traditional legislation and social norms (Bostrom and Klintman, 2011; Brunsson and Jacobson, 2000). In their entirety, standards build a ""new institutional infrastructure"" for organizational sustainability and social responsibility (Rasche 2015; Waddock, 2008). The monograph aims to identify the mechanisms by which standards support the implementation of sustainable patterns of consumption and production. In order to achieve the stated objective, the study examines the problems posed both theoretically and by providing a solid empirical material oriented to the Bulgarian organizations in their national context. The monographic work addresses current issues of sustainable consumption and production patterns through voluntary standardization mechanisms as ""soft"" regulatory instruments - an area still under-researched on a national and regional scale. The presented studies are among the few similar analyses in this field. They concern issues related to the management models of Bulgarian organizations placed under regulatory pressure in the field of environmental protection and social responsibility and the uncertain choice of the voluntary approaches proposed by international and European standards. At the same time, these studies also look at Bulgarian consumers who have the right to ""be heard"" in the development and implementation of government policies, laws and standards for sustainable consumption and production. The publication is a result of the author's constant interest in the scientific study of the problems of sustainable development in the country in the last ten years. The research work, both individual and joint in a team of fellow researchers – the University of National and World Economy - Sofia is manifested in the implementation of numerous projects, establishing cooperation and membership in the thematic networks in the field of sustainable consumption and production. The monograph could help all those interested in sustainable consumption and production problems - from Bulgarian consumers searching for their sustainable behaviour patterns, non-governmental organizations and consumer associations, through business organizations, certification and training organizations and reaches the state institutions setting out the policies and tools for implementation of these models."
M14|Contemporary Criticism of Corporate Behaviour|Abstract: Nowadays, corporations play an important role in the economic, social and political life. During the last century, they contributed to the economic and technological development of our world. We may say that this evolution led to a better wellbeing, which means more wealth, more speed, more options, more freedom and spare time. They have brought mankind, things without which we couldn’t imagine our existence: planes, communication means, computers, pharmaceutical products etc. But at what price? And who is going to pay it? Over the last decades, people and organizations were getting worried about the negative impact that corporations might have on their lives (and the next generations’ live) from an economic, social and environmental perspective. This paper is focused on corporate dominance and its aim is to bring into light the main critics of corporate behaviour classified according to different criteria.
M14|CSR in South Europe during the financial crisis and its relation to the financial states of Greek companies|This paper aims at presenting the notion of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in Europe by examining its application in Southern European countries, Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, thus, consisting of the major Mediterranean countries not only in terms of proximity but also sharing common features, were at the center of the financial crisis in Europe in 2009. The aforementioned countries are under examination on the one hand as members of Europe, which is the Mediterranean and on the other hand as independent ones. Additionally, the complexity of CSR is presented, its aspects through time, its diversity depending on the geographical position as well as its methods of evaluation. The longitudinal contrastive analysis is the starting point for further improvement as the countries, except for Portugal, are fluctuating within low levels and the Mediterranean in average ones. Furthermore, the examination of the financial state of the Greek companies within the 2015-2016 period, confirms the majority of the literature that the adoption of CSR’s good practices contributes, even partly, to the development of their effectiveness. As a conclusion, the structure of a commonly acceptable measurement model of the National Social Responsibility and the longitudinal measurement will be a useful tool for all involved institutions, with immediate results to both the society and the companies.
M14|Corporate Social Responsibility and Regulation: Taxing Ethical behaviour|This paper analyzes the impact of Corporate Social Responsibility in a monopoly setup and the implications of government intervention through a consumption tax or subsidy. Assuming that consumers have heterogeneous preferences regarding the CSR content of the private good they purchase and that their degree of altruism is positively related to their income, the paper assesses whether taxing CSR products could be welfare improving, when the tax revenues are recycled in the form of government provision of a public good that either substitutes for or complements the firm's CSR investments. When private and public investments are perfect substitutes, CSR activities should benefit from tax exemptions. However, when they are complements, the CSR products should be taxed when there is a sufficiently large marginal willingness to pay for such activities. Taxing the CSR product can then be viewed as a form of progressive taxation whereby more taxes are levied on wealthier consumers to make the public good available to everyone. Finally, given different objectives of the regulator, the question of whether taxes on CSR goods disfavor the efficient producers or rather the inefficient ones is discussed.
M14|De la responsabilité sociale : à propos des rôles respectifs de l’entreprise et de l’État|La revendication d’une responsabilité sociale de l’entreprise va de pair avec un recul de la capacité d’intervention des États dans le contexte de mondialisation. Cela ne saurait justifier que l’entreprise taxe et dépense en lieu et place de l’État dont elle ne peut détenir ni le pouvoir juridique, ni l’information s’agissant du bien public. L’entreprise est, néanmoins, une source de droit étant, possiblement, à l’initiative d’avancées sociales et environnementales. Son action s’inscrit dans la montée en puissance d’une dualité des ordres juridiques, un ordre étatique et un ordre privé. Ce qui ne dispense en rien d’une validation des règles par l’État ne serait-ce que pour garantir une concurrence équitable et maintenir une hiérarchie des normes. Le mode de gouvernance, qui reflète l’influence des intermédiaires financiers, procède de cette validation et détermine le choix de l’entreprise entre un profit immédiat et un profit à long terme, autrement dit sa réelle responsabilité sociale. Aussi la question, dans le contexte actuel, n’est-elle pas de substituer l’entreprise à l’État, mais de concevoir l’instance publique qui est susceptible de permettre à des entreprises mondialisées de privilégier le long terme.
M14|Do family firms contribute to job stability? Evidence from the great recession|This article analyzes if, on average, choices made by family businesses regarding job stability in bad times are different to those made by non-family firms. Moreover, we try to elucidate if this potential difference also depends on the family generation in charge. Our analysis relies upon a sample of 55,091 Spanish firms, Spain being one of the countries that suffered the greatest impact of the so-called “Great Recession”. We find that at times of crisis, family businesses do maintain jobs in a higher extent than non-family businesses, and that this effect is especially intense when the first generation is in charge.
M14|The Influence of Islamic Governance on Minimizing Non-Compliance with Sharia|Objective - One of the operational objectives of sharia banks is to comply with sharia principles. Therefore, the non-compliance of sharia banks to sharia law may be prevented by implementing Islamic Good Corporate Governance (GCG), which is controlled by the Sharia Supervisory Board (SSB), the board of directors, and the board of management. Methodology/Technique - In this study, sharia non-compliance is defined as all cases of disobedience found in the report of sharia banks, covering things such as non-halal income, criminal law violations, civil law violations, and fraud. The unit of analysis of this research is sharia banks in Indonesia. Seven sharia banks were used as the study sample for the period between 2012 and 2015. The source of data for this study comprised of GCG annual reports. The data analysis method and hypothesis testing was conducted using a factor analysis and multiple regression analysis. Findings - The findings show that higher levels of supervision from the SSB tend to minimize the instanc of sharia non-compliance as a whole, criminal and civil law violations, and fraud, although not to a level that is statistically significant. The influence of the board of management on non-halal income was negative, although statistically insignificant. The influence of the supervision from both the board of directors and the board of management on overall sharia non-compliance is also not statistically significant. Novelty - The influence of the board of management on non-halal income was negative, although statistically insignificant. The influence of the supervision from both the board of directors and the board of management on overall sharia non- compliance is also not statistically significant.
M14|Accrual Basis Landscape: The Absence of Political Will in Preventing Dysfunctional Behaviour in Indonesia|Objective - This research aims to reveal the failure of accrual accounting to create good governance and clean government in local governments in Indonesia. Additionally, the research seeks to examine the increase in accrual based rapid growth in Indonesia and the instance of corruption among government officials. Methodology/Technique - In connection with this objective, the study explains the practical perspective of political intervention during the adoption of accrual accounting and examines the role of the community in the implementation of accrual accounting using a critical phenomenology method. Findings - The findings of this study show that accrual-based accounting encourages deviant behaviour within the public sector and hence, good governance and clean government cannot be achieved. Accrual basis in this regard becomes a means for actors to conceal fraud by exploiting the weaknesses of accrual-based accounting to allow for creative accounting. Novelty - This study uses a qualitative method to describe the implementation of accrual-based accounting in local governments in Indonesia, which is a new approach to this phenomenon.
M14|Restoration of Budget Control: How It Should Be? A Case Study of the Local Government of Indonesia|"Objective - This research aim is to examine the phenomenon of budget control and deviant behavior in order to answer the question: ""how should budget control in the government sector be in order to effectively prevent deviant behavior such as budgetary slack?"" The study focuses on local governments in Indonesia, where such controls have not been able to combat budgetary slack, which has led to widespread corruption. Methodology/Technique - This study uses the Habermas method to criticize budgetary control practices that continue in the present day. Findings - By creating a public space over localized wisdom-based control, known as an informal control system, the weakness of formal control systems in overcoming budgetary slack with be reduced. Novelty - This study takes a critical approach, while most previous studies have adopted a positivistic approach or an interpretative study."
M14|The Mediating Role of Actual Self-Congruity on the Relationship between Religion and Store Loyalty: A Case of Mauritius|Objective - This study develops a mediation model to test the link between religious affiliation, religiosity and store loyalty through the inclusion of Actual Self-Congruity (ASC) as a mediating variable. The theoretical frameworks underpinning this study are drawn from literature related to religion, self-congruity theory, and more specifically Sheth's (1983) Shopping Preference Theory. Methodology/Technique - The data was collected through telephone interviews among a random sample of 409 Mauritian grocery shoppers. The sample was divided as follows: Hindus (n= 202), Muslims (n=71) and Catholics (n= 136), in line with the religious proportion of the population. Findings - The mediation model was tested using regression analysis. The findings indicate that religiosity is positively related to store loyalty. Moreover, ASC fully mediates the link between religiosity and customers' store loyalty. Research Limitations/Implications – This research is confined to Mauritian grocery shoppers. The generalisation of the results could be extended to include high and low involvement products. Future research may also consider dual congruity approaches (functional and self –congruity) so as to reflect a more balanced view of congruity in explaining store loyalty. A larger number of religious groups could also be considered. Novelty - The inclusion of consumer religiosity and ASC as antecedents of store loyalty as proposed in the mediation model is one of the distinctive features of this research. To date, this area is under-researched. The results provide new and valuable insights into how ASC is instrumental in developing store loyalty in the grocery sector in a devoutly religious population.
M14|L’évolution des rémunérations des dirigeants dans les sociétés cotées françaises|The highest levels of CEO pay trigger public outrage on a regular basis. A panel of large French listed companies show that these most outrageous levels of pay do not exhibit an upward trend during the 2001-2016 period. On the contrary, the equity-based part of these pays tends to recede since their fair values have been publicly disclosed. On the opposite side, CEO pay rose tremendously in less exposed firms. While public opinion focuses on the highest levels of pay, below-average CEOs catch up with their peers and in the end, they significantly contribute to rising income inequalities. Overall, cash pay rose significantly during the observed period. Market forces, such as pay competitiveness on the market for CEOs and shareholder pressure to increase performance-based components, partly explain rising managerial pays.

M14|Cultural diversity and employment growth: Moderating effect of the recent global financial crisis|This article analyses the effect of cultural diversity on employment growth, considering the recent global financial crisis (GFC) as a moderating factor. In doing so, we developed competing hypotheses based on Blauâ€™s theory of heterogeneity versus an alternative perspective which combines the resource-based view (RBV) with social identity theory (SIT). We empirically test such theories using a unique longitudinal dataset comprising the population of all firms in Sweden between 2003 and 2012. We find support for the latter hypothesis, that is, the relationship between cultural diversity and employment growth is inverted U-shaped, which is even more pronounced during/after the GFC. We discussed the implications of these findings for other contexts. JEL Classification: M14 , M51 , E24 , G01
M14|The effect of a mystery shopper scheme on prescriptions in primary care|Health care systems in many countries are still characterized by limited availability of provider performance data which can be used to design and implement welfare improving reforms in the health sector. We question whether a simple mystery shopper scheme can be an effective measure to improve primary care quality in such settings. Using a randomized treatment-control design, we conduct a field experiment in primary care clinics in a Chinese city. We investigate whether informing clinics in the treatment group of a forthcoming mystery shopper audit influences the physicians’ prescribing behavior. As expected, we find that antibiotic medications are prescribed to patients in the majority of cases, even though such prescribing is not in accordance with current recommendations or guidelines. While the intervention did not cause significant reduction in antibiotic prescriptions, our results show that a mystery shopper scheme reduces overall unnecessary prescribing.
M14|Do investors pay a premium for going green? Evidence from alternative energy mutual funds|We studied the financial performance of alternative energy mutual funds using multifactor models and propensity score matching techniques. For a sample of alternative energy mutual funds quoted in EUR and in USD for the period 2010–2016, we found that alternative energy funds underperformed corporate and socially responsible mutual funds in terms of returns and downside risk protection. Our results are consistent with the idea that investors are paying a premium for going green via renewable energies.
M14|National culture, information environment, and sensitivity of investment to stock prices: Evidence from emerging markets|This paper uses the data from 37 emerging markets and shows that national cultures play important role in determining sensitivity of investment to stock prices during the period between 2008 and 2014. We show that investments of firms headquartered in cultures with high power distance, high individualism, and high pragmatism (high uncertainty avoidance, high masculinity, and high indulgence) are significantly less (more) sensitive to their stock prices than that of firms headquartered in their counterpart cultures.
M14|The need for an alternative to shareholder value creation? The Ethomed student experience|This article aims to highlight the need for a radical break with the methodological individualism that dominates the fields of economics and management, especially finance. It advocates the need to try to understand the issues and methods that are required to coordinate economic action in order to meet social needs.
M14|Social Capital, Trust, and Firm Performance: The Value of Corporate Social Responsibility during the Financial Crisis|During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, firms with high social capital, measured as corporate social responsibility (CSR) intensity, had stock returns that were four to seven percentage points higher than firms with low social capital. High-CSR firms also experienced higher profitability, growth, and sales per employee relative to low-CSR firms, and they raised more debt. This evidence suggests that the trust between the firm and both its stakeholders and investors, built through investments in social capital, pays off when the overall level of trust in corporations and markets suffers a negative shock.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
M14|The Determinants of Virtue: Modelling Changes in the CSR Ratings of Chinese Firms|Most empirical studies on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) use cross-sectional data or case studies, making causality hard to establish. We overcome this limitation by using panel data on Chinese firms. We find no effect of last year's profits on CSR ratings, although their negative contemporaneous relation suggests a trade-off. Managerial shareholdings reduce CSR ratings while rising wages and employment are the main drivers of increasing CSR ratings. This suggests the CSR agenda aligns with the interests of labour, but not capital. However, the positive effect of Tobin's Q may indicate CSR is associated with intangibles of value to a firm.
M14|Sustainability-oriented Business Model Innovation: Context and Drivers|This study outlines a systemic review of the social and economic transformations that have been inducing the business to reconsider its traditional strategies and innovate to become sustainable. In doing so, the study adopts an original approach, focusing on the evolution in the socio-economic context, imposed by globalisation first and by the Great Recession afterwards. Hence, the review covers a wide range of literature and subjects, including political science, sociology, economics, finance and strategic management. Departing from the contextual picture, the study identifies the main drivers of the innovation of the business models, from the adoption of voluntary standards to the acknowledgement of the need to lengthen strategic time horizons. What emerges from the review is that, if business’ primary concern was initially to safeguard its declining reputation under competitive pressure, it perceives sustainability today as a necessary condition to survive the deep transformation of the economy.

M14|Retailers’ Responsibility towards Consumers and Key Drivers of Their Development in Poland|Multinational retailers are now very powerful and their activities could influence whole economies. In this paper, we investigate why they engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices towards consumers, how it fosters sustainable development, and what the role of institutions are in the process of developing CSR strategies. Changes that have taken place in Poland since 1989, when the transition process into a market economy started, constituted an excellent research field due to the fact that the retail market was not saturated at the beginning, consumers were only slightly protected by the law, and there were no institutions promoting the implementation of social responsibility standards by companies. Research involving analysis of secondary data drawn from retailers’ websites, CSR reports, and published data relating to the CSR institutions allowed the following: (1) identification of three stages of development in consumers’ conception of CSR characterized by the immoral, amoral, and moral management; (2) showing that these activities have a business case; and (3) explaining the role of institutions and competition in this process. It is also shown how multinational retailers could contribute to the sustainable development of less mature markets in which they invest.
M14|Strategy Implementation Style and Public Service Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Equity|Strategic decision-making theories suggest that organizations that combine rational and incremental strategy implementation styles are likely to perform better than those that emphasize a single style. To assess whether these arguments apply to the public sector; we explore the strategy implementation style and perceived service effectiveness, efficiency and equity of Turkish municipal government departments. Using fuzzy cluster analysis, we identify four distinctive though inter-related styles of strategy implementation in our sample organizations: logical-incremental; mostly rational; mostly incremental; and no clear approach. A logical-incremental and mostly rational style of implementation are associated with better effectiveness, efficiency and equity; with the absence of an implementation style associated with worse performance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
M14|The Functions of a Servant Leader|Servant leadership has been researched internationally and various types of favourable individual, team, and organisational outcomes have been linked to the construct. Different servant leadership measures have been validated to date and a clear distinction has been made between the theory of servant leadership and other leadership theories. However, it seems that research on the implementation of servant leadership within an organisation is still in need. The main functions of a servant leader are not yet conceptualised in the literature to help researchers or practitioners to implement servant leadership successfully within organisations. After conducting a systematic literature review, the main functions of a servant leader were identified. These functions were clustered into strategic servant leadership and operational servant leadership and supported by servant leadership characteristics and competencies as defined by current literature. The results of this study might help practitioners to develop servant leaders more effectively and assist organisations to cultivate a servant leadership culture within companies. Limitations and future research needs are discussed.
M14|Can Servant Leaders Fuel the Leadership Fire? The Relationship between Servant Leadership and Followers’ Leadership Avoidance|This study tested the effect of servant leadership on followers’ inclinations to strive for and, in contrast, to avoid leadership responsibility. Results from a study in the health care context, including two waves of data from 222 employees, revealed that servant leadership had a small but positive effect on followers’ leadership avoidance. This effect was influenced by followers’ implicit conception of an ideal leader. Specifically, servant leadership was found to reduce leadership avoidance when the congruence with the followers’ ideal leader prototype was high. Furthermore, followers’ core self-evaluations and affective motivation to lead mediated the relationship between servant leadership and reduced leadership avoidance. Implications of these patterns for theory and practice and avenues for future research are discussed.
M14|The Impact of Heavy Perceived Nurse Workloads on Patient and Nurse Outcomes|This study investigated the relationships between seven workload factors and patient and nurse outcomes. (1) Background: Health systems researchers are beginning to address nurses’ workload demands at different unit, job and task levels; and the types of administrative interventions needed for specific workload demands. (2) Methods: This was a cross-sectional correlational study of 472 acute care nurses from British Columbia, Canada. The workload factors included nurse reports of unit-level RN staffing levels and patient acuity and patient dependency; job-level nurse perceptions of heavy workloads, nursing tasks left undone and compromised standards; and task-level interruptions to work flow. Patient outcomes were nurse-reported frequencies of medication errors, patient falls and urinary tract infections; and nurse outcomes were emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction. (3) Results: Job-level perceptions of heavy workloads and task-level interruptions had significant direct effects on patient and nurse outcomes. Tasks left undone mediated the relationships between heavy workloads and nurse and patient outcomes; and between interruptions and nurse and patient outcomes. Compromised professional nursing standards mediated the relationships between heavy workloads and nurse outcomes; and between interruptions and nurse outcomes. (4) Conclusion: Administrators should work collaboratively with nurses to identify work environment strategies that ameliorate workload demands at different levels.
M14|Determining factors for audit opinion in private family and non-family firms. Evidence from Spain|This paper analyzes the determining factors for audit opinion in private firms, and whether such factors differ between family and non-family firms. With a sample of 9,873 Spanish firms for the period 2011-2015, the empirical results suggest that auditor tenure and ROA raise the probability of receiving a favorable opinion; and that losses during the previous year, high financial leverage, and hiring one of the so-called “Big 4” auditing firms increase the probability of receiving an unfavorable opinion. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the size of such effects differs between family and non-family firms.
M14|Transcendental and Social Accountability in Productive Waqf Assets|"""Objective – The objective of the study is to formulate a concept of transcendental and social accountability in the management of waqf assets as a trustworthiness from God (Triyuwono, 2004). The concept is expected to be an Islamic accountability which is religious and social in nature (Hameed, 2000) Methodology/Technique – The study uses tawhidic post-phenomenology, a modified post-phenomenology based on the basic tenet of Islam, as an instrument to analyze data. The method is actually the development and combination of philosophy of technology (Ihde, 1993) and Ibn Arabi’s philosophy of being (Dobie, 2007). Financial statements of waqf institutions, in this study, are regarded as a technology and additional are collected by interviewing four informants in the Regional Board of Muhammadiyah in Gresik. Findings – The study finds a da’i (preacher) metaphor as a form of accountability. This metaphor indicates that waqf assets functioned, firstly, as an instrument for doing Islamic missionary efforts with good practices (dakwah bi alhikmah) such as helping orphans, the poor and the needy, and overcoming natural disaster; secondly, as a spot for Islamic missionary efforts with good advices (dakwah bi al-mau’ihatul hasanah) for patients, employees, and people at large; and thirdly as an instrument for taking care of environmental health. Novelty – The study suggests transcendental and social accountability in the management of waqf assets as a trustworthiness from God."""
M14|Fundamental Effect of Implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility and Value Based Management on the Equity Value of Hotels in Bali|"""Objective – The purpose of this study was to examine the implementation of the fundamental effects of Corporate Social Responsibility and Value Based Management on the Equity Value of hotels in Bali. Methodology/Technique – The data collecting used purposive sampling method. The effects of moderating variables were tested using Moderated Regression Analysis (MRA). Findings – The research proves that there is a significant fundamental effect of the implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility and Value Based Management on the Equity Value of hotels in Bali. The fundamental effects prove that although the implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility cause the release of funds that is quite significant but it gives positive effects on companies that has fundamentally led to increased equity value in the eyes of investors. Novelty – The study proves that the expenditure on Corporate Social Responsibility can positively affect the stock price of a firm."""
M14|Do Intellectual Capital, Corporate Social Responsibility, and Good Corporate Governance Affect Indonesia’s Mining Companies Value?|"""Objective –The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of Intellectual Capital (IC), Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) disclosure, and Good Corporate Governance (GCG) on the value of mining companies (as measured by Tobin's Q) listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange period 2011-2015. Methodology/Technique – Intellectual capital was measured by Value Added Capital Employed (VACA), Value Added Human Capital (VAHU), and Structural Capital Value Added (STVA). CSR disclosure was measured using Global Reporting Initiative index. GCG was proxied using independent commissioner, managerial ownership, audit committee, and institutional ownership. Empirical analysis was conducted using linear multiple regression analysis. The samples consisted 15 mining firms. Findings –The results showed that VACA, VAHU, and institutional ownership had a positive and significant effect on company value. STVA and independent commissioner have a positive but insignificant effect on company value. Audit committee and managerial ownership have a negative and insignificant effect on company value. Novelty – The study suggests managers to improve the company value by investing IC subcomponents; that is, physical capital and human capital and also add the number of shares held by institutions."""
M14|The Effect of Slack Resources on Strategic Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): Empirical Evidence on Indonesian Listed Companies|"""Objective – This study examines the effect of companies' slack resources on strategic Corporate Social Responsibility ('CSR') and also non-strategic CSR. By analysing the slack resources as a determinant of CSR, it might indicate the companies' priority regarding their strategic CSR as part of companies' strategy. Methodology/Technique – Instead of using profitability as a measure of slack resources, this study employs slack resources as a variable itself as it was developed by Burgeois (1981), based on financial data in the companies' financial statements. Findings – The empirical result of this study indicates that un-absorbed slack resources positively affect the strategic CSR and also non-strategic CSR of a company, while absorbed slack resources do not significantly affect either. Novelty – Unlike previous studies, this study does not use profitability as a proxy of slack resources, but uses slack resources as a variable itself."""
M14|The Role of Firm Strategy to Intervene the Influence of Corporate Social Performance on Corporate Financial Performance|"""Objective – A Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) implementation has been implemented since over 50 years ago. All of the CSR implementation divided into two categories, namely Strategic CSR and Non-Strategic CSR. A Strategic CSR implementation should consider the firm strategy based on the CSR concept and firm strategy. Some empirical studies have tested the influence of CSR on Corporate Financial Performance. The results of those studies are still inconclusive. Methodology/Technique – The purpose of this study is to analyze firm strategy as intervening variable between Corporate Social Performance and Corporate Financial Performance. This study used capital intensity and product differentiation to measure the firm strategy. The samples were 33 companies of LQ-45, listed in Indonesian Stock Exchange. Findings – The results did not indicate that firm strategy intervenes the influence of Corporate Social Performance on Corporate Financial Performance, both directly and indirectly. Novelty – The research suggests future studies to employ the other ratios representing Firm Strategy that will strengthen the literature."""

Novelty – The study put emphasize with its original data on building resource-based strategy (RBV)."""
M14|Establishing Local Wisdom Values to Develop Sustainable Competitiveness Excellence|"""Objective – This research aimed to dig into local wisdom, values that grew and thrived amongst Balinese as well as its application in the tourism sector, particularly tourism marketing. The area scope of this research was Ubud and its surrounding area. Methodology/Technique – This research used ethnographic studies to describe and interpret the culture, social group or system. Even though the cultural meaning was very extensive, the ethnographic studies only focused on the patterns of activity, language, beliefs, rituals, and ways of life (Sukmadinata, 2006). Findings – The results showed that the values of society local wisdom had always accompanied the development of the Ubud area since the inception of civilization to become an international tourist area. These local wisdom values were the competitiveness excellence factors that were unique and difficult to imitate. As the result of the consistent application of local wisdom values, the tourism sector in Ubud could be sustained until today. Theoretically, this research had been able to uncover that the modern marketing concepts had existed on the values and practices of local wisdom implementation. Novelty – The model of developing competitiveness by implementing local culture became the further development of model stated by Barney and Clarke (2007) and Vorhies et al. (2009)."""
M14|Are environmentally responsible firms less vulnerable when investing abroad? The role of reputation|Globalization allows multinational firms to locate strategically the polluting activities in lax countries. This paper revisits the empirical evidence by exploiting heterogeneity in firms’ environmental image. While locating in countries with weak environmental standards is likely to be detrimental for a firm’s image and reputation, investing in corporate environmental responsibility can help firms to convince consumers that they have good environmental practices, even when investing in the “dirty” countries. Exploiting an original database that records an index of environmental responsibility for large European firms, we find that the firms viewed as environment-friendly are more often than others located in countries with weak environmental regulations. We show that our findings are not likely to be driven by omitted variables bias, specific sectors nor particular countries. Interestingly, this relationship is observed only among the firms with a well-established reputation for environmental responsibility.
M14|Independent directors: Less informed but better selected than affiliated board members?|This paper examines the relationships between independence, director unobservable ability and firm performance. We develop an original empirical strategy based on the AKM model to estimate separately director fixed effects (as a measure of individual ability) and firm fixed effects. We show that board independence has an ambiguous impact on corporate performance because of two opposing forces: one related to the director nomination process, the other one related to board functioning. On one hand, we report that independence is positively correlated with individual fixed effects, an evidence consistent with a nomination process of independent directors based on individual ability. On the other hand, and regarding board functioning, we show that independence, netted out individual ability, is negatively correlated with firm performance suggesting that independent board members experience an informational deficit (as compared to affiliated directors).
M14|CSR Performance and the Value of Cash Holdings: International Evidence|Abstract Using a worldwide sample, we examine whether corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance has an impact on the value of cash holdings. We find that investors assign a higher value to cash held by firms that have a high CSR rating. This result is consistent with the idea that CSR policies are a means for managers to act in the shareholders’ interests by mitigating conflicts with stakeholders. Finally, we reveal that CSR performance has a positive impact on the value of cash holdings only for firms which operate in countries where shareholders are well protected from expropriation by managers and in countries where the institutional quality is high.
M14|The Influence of Institutionally Embedded Ownership on Anglo-American Corporate Governance Migration into Emerging Economy IPO Firms|We argue that the corporate governance of emerging economy IPO firms is influenced by firm-specific institutionally embedded block ownership groups. Applying an extended institutional logic perspective and using a mixed-effects ordered probit model, our findings from 190 IPO-firms from 22 African countries 2000–2016, support the notion that five major block owner categories (corporate, private equity, non-executive, business group, state) exerts very different influence on African firms’ degree of adoption of Anglo-American corporate governance measures. We find that the influence from the various block owner groups is significantly moderated by institutional quality and tribalism, but to different degrees and directions across block owner groups. Our contextually embedded firm-specific results support the criticism of a one-hat-fits-all global and uniform corporate governance model.
M14|The external presentation of organizational identity orientation: A study of employment advertisement s 1975-2015|This longitudinal study analyzes organizational identity labels and their implicated organizational identity orientations. The data consist of 1348 self-presentation texts retrieved from employment advertisements published in a major Norwegian newspaper over a 40 year period and containing more than 3,000 identity labels. The study shows that the expression of organizational identity orientation is an organization-level phenomenon, that the contents of labels and orientations change over time, and that identity labels should be understood as malleable and dynamic. More specifically, identity orientations change (1) in terms of their composition, suggesting that the same identity orientation is communicated through different labels over time, and (2) in terms of their relative prevalence, suggesting that organizations may shift the emphasis from one orientation to another over time. Implications for the expression of organizational identity orientation, the contents of external identity communication, and the nature of organizational identity labels are discussed.
M14|Communicating Company Innovation Culture: Assessment Through Job Advertisements Analysis|"The paper explores the composition of researchers' skillsets in an innovation-driven environment from the perspective of employers. The authors analyze the relation between skills requirements described in job advertisements for researchers and the presumed innovation culture of companies. The study is based on job advertisements content analysis and in-depth interviews with chiefs of research and development companies. It uses biotechnology industry as an example as it is one of the fastest-growing and innovation-driven sectors globally. Authors used data from Russian, as well as Canadian, UK and USA job search engines to consider international context. Empirical findings demonstrated that skills composition stress on hard skills more frequently and detailed, while soft skills are often a ""must have without saying"". The same is for digital skills that are assumed to be essential in high-tech companies globally and therefore not fully specified in job ads. There is a certain mismatch between skills presented in the ads and articulated in the interviews as employers tend to demonstrate innovation-friendly company culture for possible applicants. The present paper enriches literature on skills assessment, giving comprehensive lists of biotech skills in-demand divided into soft and hard categories. In addition, it provides the new insight into employee skills articulated by the companies as a strong element of organizational innovation climate"
M14|Ethnic diversity in start-ups and its impact on innovation|"""The study analyses the impact of different ethnic compositions of start-ups in Germany on the innovativeness of the new businesses. We are able to distinguish between the ethnicity of the founders and that of the early employees following new results that demonstrate the importance of including all new firms' stakeholders for the firm's success. We make use of a measure introduced by Ruef (2002) and Ruef et al. (2003) which not only takes into account the number of different ethnicities involved, but also includes the unusualness of the ethnic compositions. Our results first reveal that foreigners are an important source of both entrepreneurs and employers. Second, we can show that only really rare combinations, of the founders and employees together, lead to more innovative businesses whereas the more common minorities are even found to have a negative impact on firms' innovativeness.""

M14|Mexican 2014 Strategy That Promotes Business Formality, Employment Generation, Financing, Growth And Competitiveness , Reforma Fiscal Mexicana 2014 Estrategia Que Fomenta La Formalidad Empresarial, Generacion De Empleo, Financiamiento, Crecimiento Y Competitividad|This research addresses the issue of Fiscal reform in 2014. We examine an administrative strategy adopted by the Executive federal power to foster business formation, generation of employment, access to financing, growth and business competitiveness. For several decades in Mexico, millions of small business owners have conducted economic activities in an irregular way. The operate without registering to the fiscal register or expressing, revenues, costs, home, workers. They have generally not paid taxes. In response to this situation, the Mexican Government from the year 2014 unveiled a fiscal reform. This reform encourages these merchants to sign up voluntarily to the fiscal register, which gives them a reduction of taxes and administrative facilities. We considered 300 small businesses in Mexicali, Baja California. Research was carried out in laws, decrees, journals and articles by specialists. In addition, we designed and a questionnaire and applied it to merchants. We wished to know if they consider tax reform strategy, which has fostered formality, employment, funding, growth and competitiveness. The information was processed using descriptive statistics, the results allowed to identify effect of the tax reform and make the relevant recommendations
M14|Methodology For Monitoring Graduates To Strengthen The Involvement Of The University With Society, Metodologia De Seguimiento De Egresados Para Fortalecer La Vinculacion De La Universidad Con La Sociedad|The monitoring of graduates contributes to the development of University social responsibility. It connects the Institution with the social context, and reunites its identity with graduates giving them continued pertinent education that improves their development. In the Faculty of Public Accounting of the Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla, we applied a new graduate questionnaire. We, obtained reliable information about the usefulness and opportunity areas of their university career. To obtain the information we applied three instruments; the first is applied to new graduates to know their opinion about the Study Plan and collocation process; the second is applies to graduates who graduated 3 or 5 years ago to know their work situation and continuous education requirements and opinions about the received information; and the third is applies in a presence way to the employers to know the labor performance of the BUAP graduates. We find, the institution is meeting one objective of University Social Responsibility. That responsibility is to reaffirm its graduates and society to give professionals, continuous education and improve their study programs as a result of the feedback received from two interest groups: graduates and employers

M14|Corporate Responsibility Under The Ecsi Model: An Application In The Hotel Sector Capital|This article deals with the study of Corporate Responsibility (CR) under the European Customer Satisfaction Index (ECSI). The methodology of this empirical study, conducted among 629 customers staying at hotels in the city of Seville, is based on structural equation modeling (PLS). The results obtained demonstrate the applicability of the European model to the hotel sector, although not all the relationships from the original model have been proven. The main contributions are derived from a better understanding of the model’s components, a variable not studied before having been incorporated: the importance of Corporate Responsibility (CR). Moreover, it means to contribute to the field of research on CR as, despite the growing interest in the subject, the effects of this construct are still poorly understood. / 0
M14|The Dark Side Of Iso 14001: The Symbolic Environmental Behavior|Some of the academic research on ISO 14001 has focused on analyzing the benefits of its adoption. However, this international standard has also received some criticism, particularly in respect of the adoption of ISO 14001 when not accompanied by significant improvements in environmental performance. This study analyzes the relationship between the symbolic environmental behavior and the adoption of ISO 14001. In so doing, it uses binary logistic regression to analyze an international sample of 1961 manufacturing facilities that each employs more than 50 people. The results indicate that the higher the symbolic environmental performance of the firm, the greater the probability of adopting ISO 14001. / 0
M14|Socially Responsible Human Resource Policies And Practices: Academicand Professional Validation|This article addresses the measurement and validation of socially responsible human resource policiesfrom academic and professional points of view. Corporate Social responsibility (CSR) has made greatprogress in recent years in the theoretical realm, showing its importance through different perspectivessuch as the institutional theory, the stakeholder approach, the theory of legitimacy, and the process ofshared value. However, from an empirical standpoint, more research is needed to provide new indicatorsand evidence of testing socially responsible policies on business performance. This paper aims to devise aset of socially responsible human resource policies, demonstrate the validation of their content throughseveral practices, and review the analysis of their relative weights thanks to the contribution of a panelof academic experts and a professional pretest, conducted in large Spanish companies. / 0
M14|The Effect of Board Directors from Countries with Different Genetic Diversity Levels on Corporate Performance|We link genetic diversity in the country of origin of the firms’ board members with corporate performance via board members’ nationality. We hypothesize that our approach captures deep-rooted differences in cultural, institutional, social, psychological, physiological, and other traits that cannot be captured by other recently measured indices of diversity. Using a panel of firms listed in the North American and UK stock markets, we find that adding board directors from countries with different levels of genetic diversity (either higher or lower) increases firm performance. This effect prevails when we control for a number of cultural, institutional, firm-level, and board member characteristics, as well as for the nationality of the board of directors. To identify the relationship, we use—as instrumental variables for our diversity indices—the migratory distance from East Africa and the level of ultraviolet exposure in the directors’ country of nationality.

M14|On the effectiveness of elected male and female leaders and team coordination|Abstract We study the effect on coordination in a minimum-effort game of a leader’s gender depending on whether the leader is democratically elected or is randomly selected. Leaders use non-binding messages to try to convince followers to coordinate on the Pareto-efficient equilibrium. We find that teams with elected leaders coordinate on higher effort levels. Initially, the benefits of being elected are captured solely by male leaders. However, this gender difference disappears with repeated interaction because unsuccessful male leaders are reelected more often than unsuccessful female leaders.
M14|Women in the Workplace and Management Practices: Theory and Evidence|We review recent studies on management practices and their consequences for women in the workplace. First, the High Performance Work System (HPWS) is associated with greater gender diversity in the workplace while there is little evidence that the HPWS reduces the gender pay gap. Second, work-life balance practices with limited face-to-face interactions with coworkers may hamper women’s career advancement. Third, individual incentive linking pay to objective performance may enhance gender diversity while individual incentive with subjective performance may have an opposite effect. Fourth, a rat race model with working hours as a signal of the worker’s commitment is a promising way to explain the gender gap in promotions. Fifth, corporate social responsibility practices may increase gender diversity. We temper the findings by identifying three major methodological challenges: (i) how to measure management practices; (ii) how to account for endogeneity of management practices; and (iii) how to minimize selection bias.
M14|The Determinants of Virtue: Modelling Changes in the CSR Ratings of Chinese Firms|Most empirical studies on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) use cross-sectional data or case studies, making causality hard to establish. The paper overcomes this limitation by using panel data on Chinese firms. The paper also finds no effect of last yearâ€™s profits on CSR ratings, although their negative contemporaneous relation suggests a trade-off. Managerial shareholdings reduce CSR ratings while rising wages and employment are the main drivers of increasing CSR ratings. This suggests the CSR agenda aligns with the interests of labour, but not capital. However, the positive effect of Tobinâ€™s Q may indicate CSR is associated with intangibles of value to a firm.
M14|Pratique de gestion des résultats et culture nationale. Quel lien ?|L’objectif de cet article est d'examiner l'impact des systèmes de valeurs sur la pratique de gestion des résultats à travers une analyse cross-nationale. Les valeurs culturelles incluent la distance hiérarchique, l’aversion à l'incertitude, l'individualisme, la masculinité et l'orientation à long terme. L'étude interculturelle utilise la méthode des équations structurelles par l'approche LISREL. Les résultats montrent que toutes les dimensions culturelles étudiées sont capables de définir la culture nationale dans les pays échantillons. Toutefois, les résultats indiquent que seules trois dimensions culturelles expliquent les différences au niveau de la pratique de gestion des résultats dans le contexte étudié. Ces dimensions sont en effet, la distance hiérarchique, l’aversion à l’incertitude et l’individualisme.
M14|Enterprise promotion in the road construction sector in a conflict-ridden area in Kenya : a solution for the nexus of developmental problems?|Overcoming the missing middle syndrome by promoting growth of micro and small enterprises through training is a key to solve the nexus of problems including industrial stagnation, inequality, and ethnic confrontation in Africa. We focus on collaborative interventions by an international NGO and the Kenyan government to disseminate labor-based technology of road construction and strengthen managerial skills of youth self-help groups in a county ridden by an ethno-political conflict, called the Post-Election Violence. They tried to help groups formalize as corporations and develop their businesses through training. Our research reveals that ethnically homogenous groups might have better chances to obtain construction contracts but the reason would be trust among permanent members lowering internal transaction costs, rather than ethnicity itself. In conclusion, development of micro and small firms are to some extent determined by education of leaders and internal trust. Trainings could contribute in case groups are equipped with those conditions.
M14|Does Board Gender Diversity Influence Financial Performance? Evidence from Spain|Abstract In recent years, several countries have enacted guidelines and/or mandatory laws to increase the presence of women on the boards of companies. Through these regulatory interventions, the aim is to eradicate the social and labor grievances that women have traditionally experienced and which has relegated them to smaller-scale jobs. Nevertheless, and despite the advances achieved, the female representation in the boardroom remains far from the desired levels. In this context, it is now necessary to enhance the advantages of board gender diversity from both ethical and economic points of view. This article examines the relation between board gender diversity and economic results in Spain: the second country in the world to legally require gender quotas in boardrooms and historically characterized by a minimal female participation in the workforce. Based on a sample of 125 non-financial firms listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange from 2005 to 2009, our findings show that in the period analyzed the increase of the number of women on boards was over 98 %. This suggests that compulsory legislation offers an efficient framework to execute the recommendation of Spanish codes of good governance by means of the increase in the number of women in the boards of firms. Furthermore, we find that the increase in the number of women on the boards is positively related to higher economic results. Therefore, both results suggest that gender diversity in boardrooms should be incremented, mandatory laws being a key factor to do so.
M14|Asymmetric Payoffs and Spatial Competition|Abstract We investigate the location choice of two firms whose objectives are the weighted average of their own profit and social welfare, in which they simultaneously decide their locations before setting their prices. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the asymmetric locations are influenced by the asymmetry of the firms’ objectives or by the asymmetry of firms’ marginal costs. We show that, when both firms have the same marginal cost, the equilibrium locations are always symmetric even in the case of the asymmetric objectives. On the other hand, the cost differences lead the asymmetric locations in equilibrium. That is, the asymmetric locations are a result of the cost asymmetry, but not the asymmetry of the firms’ objectives. We also demonstrate that the pursuit of profit by the cost-inefficient firm may increase consumer surplus.
M14|Offenlegung von CO2-Emissionen und Klimastrategien der CDAXUnternehmen – eine statistische Analyse erklärender Faktoren am Beispiel der CDP-Klimaberichterstattung|Im Rahmen des Beitrags untersuchen wir mithilfe des Regressionsansatzes, welchen Einfluss für die größten börsennotierten Unternehmen Deutschlands eine Auswahl unternehmensspezifischer Faktoren (Unternehmensgröße, Profitabilität, Sektorenzugehörigkeit, Beteiligungsstruktur, Status der Beantwortung, Vorjahresteilnahme) bei der Beantwortung folgender Fragestellungen besitzt: i) Wovon hängt die Teilnahme an der freiwilligen Klimaberichterstattung an CDP ab? ii) Wovon hängt die Qualität der freiwilligen Klimaberichterstattung an CDP ab? Der theoretische Teil der Untersuchung fokussiert die Befriedigung von Informationsbedürfnissen aller Anspruchsgruppen eines Unternehmens als Hauptmotiv für die freiwillige Bereitstellung klimarelevanter Daten und Strategien. Im Zuge dessen wird erläutert, wie auf dieser Grundlage eine Vertragsbeziehung zwischen einem Unternehmen und seinen Anspruchsgruppen effizient gestaltet werden kann. Dabei wird die freiwillige Offenlegung klimarelevanter Daten und Strategien beispielhaft als die unternehmerische Teilnahme an der CDP-Klimaberichterstattung analysiert. Die empirischen Auswertungen im Anschluss an die Vorstellung der Datenbasis sowie die statistische Hypothesenprüfung zeigen insbesondere, dass die Größe eines Unternehmens und seine Beteiligungsstruktur einen signifikanten Einfluss auf die hier zentralen Fragestellungen haben.
M14|Corporate Culture: Evidence from the Field|Does corporate culture matter? Can differences in corporate culture explain why similar firms diverge with one succeeding and the other failing? To answer these questions, we use a novel survey and interview-based analysis of 1,348 North American firms. Over half of senior executives believe that corporate culture is a top-three driver of firm value and 92% believe that improving their culture would increase their firm's value. Surprisingly, only 16% believe their culture is where it should be. Executives link culture to ethical choices (compliance, short-termism), innovation (creativity, taking appropriate risk), and value creation (productivity, acquisition premia). We assess these links within a framework that implies cultural effectiveness depends on interactions between cultural values, norms, and formal institutions. Our evidence suggests that cultural norms are as important as stated values in achieving success.
M14|What is the Business of Business?|This paper develops a simple framework for understanding the emergence of new organizational forms, such as socially responsible firms and social entrepreneurs, that embody the private sector's efforts to resolve problems that typically have been within the purview of government and traditional public charities. We consider organizations that can generate both financial and social returns. Differences in the technologies between the for-profit sector and the social sector give rise to comparative advantages and play a key part in the analysis. This allows us to analyze the conditions under which hybrid organizations emerge in place of traditional charities and profit-maximizers.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
M14|Diagnosing the Italian Disease|Italy’s aggregate productivity abruptly stopped growing in the mid-1990s. This stop represents a puzzle, as it occurred at a time of stable macroeconomic conditions. In this paper, we investigate the possible causes of this “disease” by using sector and firm-level data. We find that Italy’s productivity disease was most likely caused by the inability of Italian firms to take full advantage of the ICT revolution. While many institutional features can account for this failure, a prominent one is the lack of meritocracy in the selection and rewarding of managers. Unfortunately, we also find that the prevalence of loyalty-based management in Italy is not simply the result of a failure to adjust, but an optimal response to the Italian institutional environment. Italy’s case suggests that familism and cronyism can be serious impediments to economic development even for a highly industrialized nation.
M14|The ordonomic approach to business ethics|'Ordonomics' is a research program that has been developed at the Chair of Economic Ethics at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. It holds that business actors (persons and organizations) can employ morality as a 'factor of production', and that business ethics can be based on a specific rational-choice analysis that is fully in line with the established tradition of economic thinking. With regard to practice, the main point is that ordonomics offers a guiding concept for creating win-win solutions that help business firms to do well by doing good. With regard to theory, ordonomics offers a conceptual framework for business ethics that makes ethics and economics coherent and mutually compatible with each other.

M14|Do Professional Norms in the Banking Industry Favor Risk-taking?|In recent years, the banking industry has witnessed several cases of excessive risk-taking that frequently have been attributed to problematic professional norms. We conduct experiments with employees from several banks in which we manipulate the saliency of their professional identity and subsequently measure their risk aversion in a real stakes investment task. If bank employees are exposed to professional norms that favor risk-taking, they should become more willing to take risks when their professional identity is salient. We find, however, that subjects take significantly less risk, challenging the view that the professional norms generally increase bank employees’ willingness to take risks.

M14|Corporate social responsibility and supplier development|We study final good producers’ incentives and capabilities for implementing corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities with their input suppliers via supplier codes of conduct (SCoC). In this context, we first analyze the implicaitons of SCoC on the market equilibrium outcome in terms of the competition among final good producers as well as their supply relationships. We then derive the conditions under which SCoC are successfully implemented in the industry’s supply chains and clarify their implications for consumer welfare. In this context, we study endogenous as well as exogenous standards and further contrast two scenarios in which the input supplier either pricei discriminates or sets a uniform input price. In the case of endogenous standards, SCoC are set to maximize final good producers’ profits and, in equilibrium, are adopted in all supply chains. When standards are exogenous, either no, some or all final good producers successfully implement a SCoC. Here, the equilibrium may be characterized by an underprovision of SCoC, in the sense that not all final good producers that have incentives to adopt a SCoC also succeed to do so. In this context, we study the effectiveness and desirability of public and private initiatives that aim at overcoming this underprovision. In terms of the input suppplier’s pricing policy, we observe that input price discrimination may provide firms with greater incentivesi to adopt SCoC and, as a corollary, may maximize consumer surplus.
M14|A Matter of Trust? The Bond Market Benefits of Corporate Social Capital during the Financial Crisis|We investigate whether a firm's social capital, and the trust that it engenders, are viewed favorably by bondholders. Using the financial crisis as an exogenous shock to trust, and firms' corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities as a proxy for social capital, we show that high-CSR firms benefited from lower bond spreads in the secondary market during the financial crisis compared to low-CSR firms. These findings are more pronounced for firms that, when in distress, have a greater opportunity to engage in asset substitution or divert cash to shareholders. High-CSR firms were also able to raise more debt capital on the primary market during this period, and those high-CSR firms that raised more debt were able to do so at lower at-issue bond spreads, better initial credit ratings, and for longer maturities. Our results suggest that debt investors believe that high-CSR firms are less likely to engage in asset substitution and diversion that would be detrimental to stakeholders, including debtholders. These findings also indicate that the benefits of CSR that accrued to shareholders during the financial crisis carry across to another important asset class, debt capital.
M14|Deadlock on the Board|We develop a dynamic model of board decision making. We show that directors may knowingly retain the policy they all think is the worst just because they fear they may disagree about what policy is best in the future-the fear of deadlock begets deadlock. Board diversity can exacerbate deadlock. Hence, shareholders may optimally appoint a biased director to avoid deadlock. On the other hand, the CEO may appoint unbiased directors, or even directors biased against him, to create deadlock and thereby entrench himself. Still, shareholders may optimally give the CEO some power to appoint directors. Our theory thus gives a new explanation for CEO entrenchment. It also gives a new perspective on director tenure, staggered boards, and short-termism.

C’est ce que cet article propose d’étudier à travers l’analyse d’un cas : le réseau Alumnos. Nous identifions les principales caractéristiques d’un réseau de diplômés facilitant l’acquisition de ces ressources : un réseau dense favorisé par des liens forts entre ses membres, une diversité organisationnelle et hiérarchique des diplômés et l’existence d’une personne centrale pour animer la communauté des diplômés.(VA)The alumni network is a strategic advantage for the universities. It’s a way to improve reputation, to help students find jobs and to raise financial resources. Through this article one of this alumni network is studied: Alumnos.

M14|Sur la voie des achats responsables:le cas de la SNCF - On the way to PSR:the SNCF Case|(VF)L’objectif de cette recherche est de mieux comprendre le processus d’adoption d’une démarche d’Achats Responsables (AR). Peu de travaux se sont intéressés à ce processus ainsi qu’à ses antécédents intra et inter-organisationnels. L’étude empirique, basée sur le cas exemplaire de la SNCF, révèle que la démarche d’AR suit un processus en trois phases (mise en place, déploiement, maintien) et que les deux types d’antécédents jouent un rôle différencié selon ces phases. Ils montrent aussi le rôle clé joué par certains acteurs déjà convaincus pour accroître l’adhésion à la démarche. Cette recherche débouche sur des recommandations utiles aux entreprises désireuses de s’engager dans une démarche d’AR ou soucieuses de la pérenniser.(VA)The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of Purchasing Social Responsibility (PSR) adoption process. Few studies exist on PSR adoption process and its intra and inter-organizational antecedents. Based on the exemplary case of the SNCF, results support that PSR adoption process can be split into three stages (setting-up, operating, sustaining). They also show that antecedents differ according to those stages. Finally, results also shed some light on the key role of actors, who personally embrace CSR values and get others involved in this process. This research provides useful implications for firms which would engage into a PSR process or maintain such a process.
M14|L’investissement conforme à la Charia est-il socialement responsable ?,Is Shariah compliant investment socially responsible?|(VF) La porosité actuelle des frontières de l’Investissement Socialement Responsable (ISR) conduit ses adeptes à considérer l’Investissement Conforme à la Charia (ICC) comme l’un de ses sous-composants. Cette étude propose une réflexion inédite sur la pertinence d’inclure l’ICC dans la sphère de l’ISR. Pour cela, nous établissons une comparaison à la fois qualitative et quantitative entre ces deux types d’investissement pour comprendre dans quelle mesure l’ICC se distingue de l’ISR. Les résultats révèlent notamment une surperformance financière de l’ICC en période de crise en dépit d’une sous-performance sociétale qui se matérialise principalement dans deux domaines : la gestion de la diversité et l’engagement environnemental. Nous concluons que, bien que l’ICC obéisse à une certaine conception de l’investissement « socialement responsable », car reposant sur la stabilisation du système financier ainsi que sur le maintien de l’équité dans les transactions financières, et quand bien même une évolution du mode de gestion de l’ICC vers celui de l’ISR soit envisageable, la non-inclusion des considérations ESG dans ses règles de management actuelles devrait conduire les communautés académique et professionnelle à le traiter en tant que type d’investissement à part entière. (VA) Nowadays, Shariah Compliant Investment (SCI) is considered by its advocates as one of the subcomponents of Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) due to its unclearly set frontiers. This study proposes a new approach on the suitability of including the SCI in the sphere of SRI. For this purpose, we compare these two investment styles both qualitatively and quantitatively in order to understand whether and how the SCI differs from the SRI. The results show that even if SCI is characterized by social under-performance particularly encountered in its environmental and diversity dimensions, it also financially outperforms SRI and conventional investment during economic downturn. We conclude that SCI may be considered as a particular concept of “socially responsible” investment because it ensures the financial system stabilization and the fairness of financial transactions. However, although a move towards the SRI seems to be possible, the non-inclusion of ESG considerations by the SCI may lead the academic and professional communities to deal with SCI as a full investment style.
M14|Top Decision-Making Bodies in Large Companies: Gender Quota Shows Initial Impact on Supervisory Boards ; Executive Board Remains a Male Bastion|The gender quota for supervisory boards that has been mandatory since January 2016 has shown an initial impact. According to DIW Berlin’s Women Executives Barometer, at the end of 2016, there were more women on the supervisory boards of the 106 companies subject to the statutory quota than one year before. Their proportion increased by a solid four percentage points to more than 27 percent. And in the other groups of companies studied, the number of female supervisory board members also rose. However, the calculations based on the top 200 companies also showed that in companies in which the supervisory board already consisted of one-third women, the proportion hardly increased or did not increase at all. The gap between supervisory and executive boards has also widened because growth in the latter has flattened. Women represent only 6,5 percent of the executives at companies subject to the quota — even fewer than in the DAX 30 (11 percent) and the average of the 200 highest performing companies in Germany (eight percent). In companies with government-owned shares, the momentum has decreased significantly — they run the risk of losing their function as role models. To forestall a tightening of the law, companies should ensure more balanced gender representation on all executive levels.

According to DIW Berlin’s Women Executives Barometer, at the end of 2016, 21 percent of the supervisory and administrative board members of the 100 largest banks were female. The number has stagnated compared to last year. Since 2010, when the discussion about the gender quota for supervisory boards gained momentum, growth has been relatively flat — particularly in comparison to the top 100 companies outside the financial sector. At insurance companies, the proportion of women on supervisory boards was a solid 22 percent (an increase of around three percentage points). This puts insurance companies ahead of banks for the first time since 2006. Also of note: companies whose supervisory boards contained one-third women were not able to increase this number in 2016. Extrapolating from the past decade, supervisory boards of banks would need 50 years for the ratio of women to men to be equal. Gender parity in executive boards would be reached in 80 years. The proportion of women on executive boards remained very low overall as it reached roughly ten percent at insurance companies and eight percent at banks.
M14|Spitzengremien großer Unternehmen: Geschlechterquote zeigt erste Wirkung in Aufsichtsräten – Vorstände bleiben Männerdomänen|The gender quota for supervisory boards that has been mandatory since January 2016 has shown an initial impact. According to DIW Berlin’s Women Executive Barometer, at the end of 2016 there were more women on the supervisory boards of the 106 companies subject to the statutory quota than one year before. Their proportion increased by a solid four percentage points to more than 27 percent. And in the other groups of companies studied, the number of female supervisory board members also rose. However, the calculations based on the top 200 companies also showed that in companies in which the supervisory board already consisted of one-third women, the proportion hardly increased or did not increase at all. The gap between supervisory and executive boards has also widened because growth in the latter has flattened. Women represent only six percent of the executives at companies subject to the quota – even fewer than in the DAX 30 (11 percent) and the average of the 200 highest performing companies in Germany (eight percent). In companies with government-owned shares, the momentum has decreased significantly – they run the risk of losing their function as role models. To forestall a tightening of the law, companies should ensure more balanced gender representation on all executive levels. Die seit Januar 2016 verbindliche Geschlechterquote für Aufsichtsräte in Deutschland zeigt eine erste Wirkung: Dem Managerinnen- Barometer des DIW Berlin zufolge waren in den unter die Quotenregelung fallenden 106 Unternehmen Ende 2016 deutlich mehr Frauen in den Kontrollgremien vertreten als ein Jahr zuvor. Ihr Anteil stieg um gut vier Prozentpunkte auf mehr als 27 Prozent. Auch in den anderen Unternehmensgruppen legte der Anteil der Aufsichtsrätinnen zu. Die Berechnungen auf Basis der Top-200-Unternehmen zeigen zudem, dass in Unternehmen, in denen der Aufsichtsrat bereits zu einem Drittel mit Frauen besetzt ist, der Anteil anschließend kaum bis gar nicht mehr steigt. Die Schere zwischen den Aufsichtsräten und Vorständen öffnet sich indes weiter, denn in letzteren ist die Dynamik nach wie vor sehr schwach: In den unter die Quote fallenden Unternehmen sind im Durchschnitt nur 6,5 Prozent Frauen in den Vorstandsetagen vertreten – noch weniger als in den DAX-30 (gut elf Prozent) und den 200 umsatzstärksten Unternehmen (acht Prozent). In den Unternehmen mit Bundesbeteiligung hat sich die Dynamik deutlich abgeschwächt – sie drohen ihre Vorbildfunktion einzubüßen. Um möglichen Gesetzesverschärfungen zuvorzukommen, sollten Unternehmen auf allen Führungsebenen für ein ausgeglicheneres Geschlechterverhältnis sorgen.
M14|Finanzsektor: Banken fallen zurück: Frauenanteil jetzt auch in Aufsichtsräten geringer als bei Versicherungen|Women are still in the clear minority among the financial sector’s top decision-making bodies. According to DIW Berlin’s Women Executive Barometer, at the end of 2016, 21 percent of the supervisory and administrative board members of the 100 largest banks were female. The number has stagnated compared to last year. Since 2010, when the discussion about the gender quota for supervisory boards gained momentum, growth has been relatively flat – particularly in comparison to the top 100 companies outside the financial sector. At insurance companies, the proportion of women on supervisory boards was a solid 22 percent (an increase of around three percentage points). This puts insurance companies aheadof banks for the first time since 2006. The proportion of women on executive boards is almost ten percent at insurance companies and eight percent at banks. Overall, these levels areextremely low, and at the end of 2016 none of the corporate groups in the study had reached the ten-percent mark. Also of note: companies whose supervisory boards contained one-third women were not able to increase this number in 2016. Extrapolating from the past decade, supervisory boards of banks would need 50 years for the ratio of women to men to be equal. Gender parity in executive boards would be reached in 80 years. Nach wie vor sind Frauen in Spitzengremien des Finanzsektors deutlich in der Minderheit. Dem Managerinnen-Barometer des DIW Berlin zufolge waren die Aufsichts- und Verwaltungsräte der 100 größten Banken Ende des Jahres 2016 zu gut 21 Prozent mit Frauen besetzt. Damit stagnierte der Anteil gegenüber dem vorangegangenen Jahr. Auffallend ist die geringere Dynamik nach dem Jahr 2010 im Vergleich zu den Top-100-Unternehmen außerhalb der Finanzbranche – damals nahm die Diskussion um die Frauenquote in Aufsichtsräten Fahrt auf. Bei den Versicherungen betrug der Frauenanteil in den Aufsichtsgremien gut 22 Prozent – ein Anstieg um rund drei Prozentpunkte. Erstmals seit Beginn der Erhebung des DIW Berlin im Jahr 2006 lagen die Versicherungen damit vor den Banken. Auffallend ist, dass sich Unternehmen, deren Aufsichtsräte bereits zuvor zu einem Drittel mit Frauen besetzt waren, diesbezüglich im Jahr 2016 tendenziell nicht mehr steigern konnten. Schreibt man die Entwicklung der vergangenen zehn Jahre linear fort, würde es in den Aufsichtsräten der Banken noch ein halbes Jahrhundert dauern, bis Frauen und Männer gleichermaßen vertreten sind. In den Vorständen wäre das sogar erst in über 80 Jahren der Fall. Der Frauenanteil blieb mit fast zehn Prozent bei den Versicherungen und gut acht Prozent bei den Banken insgesamt sehr niedrig.
M14|Is Socially Responsible Production a Normal Good?|This paper uses a controlled laboratory experiment to investigate the effect of wealth on individual social responsibility (ISR), defined as choosing a more socially responsible product if a cheaper alternative is available. We find that rich consumers are significantly less likely to engage in ISR than poor consumers. This suggests that socially responsible production conditions may not be normal product attributes.
M14|Towards EU Legislation on Human Rights Due Diligence: Case Study of the Garment and Textile Sector|This study assesses the legal feasibility of a EU instrument that would impose mandatory human rights due diligence (“HRDD”) requirements on companies in the garment and textile sector. The proposal serves as an example of a sector-specific approach to HRDD requirements, and could be modified to develop similar proposals in other sectors. The study also illustrates the differences between a sector-specific and a cross-sectoral approach by highlighting the implications of each in the following areas: legal bases, personal scope, and requirements and enforcement.
M14|A Universe of Stories: Mobilizing Narrative Practices During Transformative Change|Constructing narratives of transformative change is an important but challenging practice through which strategy makers attempt to influence acceptance of an ongoing transformation. To understand whether and how strategy makers can construct a steady influx of captivating narratives of transformative change, we analyzed how one noted strategy maker assisted the successful transformation of his organization over three decades by orchestrating the production of change narratives. Our analysis reveals that the strategy maker constructed and reconstructed meanings of change over time using three sets of distinct but interconnected narrative practices. We develop a dynamic model linking the simultaneous mobilization of these practices to strategy makers’ ability to harness the persistent tension between novelty and familiarity in a transformative change, and thereby win endorsement from key audiences.
M14|A Skeptical View of Financialized Corporate Governance|"Managerial compensation typically relies on financial yardsticks, such as profits, stock prices, and return on equity, to achieve alignment between the interests of managers and shareholders. But financialized governance may not actually work well for most shareholders, and even when it does, significant tradeoffs and inefficiencies can arise from the conflict between maximizing financialized measures and society's broader interests. Effective governance requires that those in control are accountable for actions they take. However, those who control and benefit most from corporations' success are often able to avoid accountability. The history of corporate governance includes a parade of scandals and crises that have caused significant harm. After each, most key individuals tend to minimize their own culpability. Common claims from executives, boards of directors, auditors, rating agencies, politicians, and regulators include ""we just didn't know,"" ""we couldn't have predicted,"" or ""it was just a few bad apples."" Economists, as well, may react to corporate scandals and crises with their own version of ""we just didn't know,"" as their models had ruled out certain possibilities. Effective governance of institutions in the private and public sectors should make it much more difficult for individuals in these institutions to get away with claiming that harm was out of their control when in reality they had encouraged or enabled harmful misconduct, and ought to have taken action to prevent it."
M14|Types of Organizational Culture in Private Jordanian Hospitals|Organizational culture (OC) is vital to an entity’s survival and success. This study explores preferred and dominant kinds of OC based on four types: (1) Clans, (2) adhocracies, (3) markets, and (4) hierarchies - in private Jordanian hospitals that implemented quality standards in 2016. The author employed a questionnaire using the OC assessment instrument and distributed it to 442 employees of accredited hospitals, with an overall response rate of 79%. The author concluded that OC in private Jordanian hospitals comprises a mix of the four types mentioned above. Furthermore, the author found that hierarchy culture is the most dominant, while clan culture prevails the least. In terms of the types of OC that employees prefer, they most frequently choose adhocracies, followed by clans, then hierarchies, then markets. Finally, the findings demonstrate that hospitals need to have facilitators, entrepreneurs, team builders, innovation, and a less demanding workplace
M14|The Relationship Organizational Culture and Organizational Commitment on Public Service Quality; Perspective Local Government in Bandung, Indonesia|Literature studies prove the importance the role of organizational culture (OC) and organizational commitment that contribute to organizational performance, but it is a few links to the quality of public services. This study was conducted to contribute in cultural studies’ organizations and organizational commitment to public service. The research object of government organizations in the city of Bandung, Indonesia with a sample of 187 employees with proporsionate cluster random sampling technique. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling partial least squares. The results showed that OC and organizational commitment significantly influence the quality of public services. This suggests that policy makers in Bandung local goverment, Indonesia should be able to improve OC and organizational commitment to public service that is accepted by society can run optimally
M14|The role of board gender and foreign ownership in the CSR performance of Chinese listed firms|China's recent promotion of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has coincided with a marked increase in the number of Chinese listed firms attracting female board members and foreign equity investors. Using Rankins' (RKS) ratings over the 2009 to 2013 period, we show that greater gender balance in top-management supports stronger CSR performance. This finding broadens gender-based accounts emphasizing social networks (Westphal and Milton, 2000), Critical Mass Theory (Kramer et al., 2006; Bear et al., 2010; and Soares et al., 2011) and team dynamics (Woolley et al., 2010; and Hoogendoorn et al., 2013). Findings also reveal stronger CSR performance in firms where a female officer is present at the CEO and/or vice-CEO level. Female leadership thus appears to be just as important as gender mix in driving CSR change. Our findings shed new light and add further dimension to the nascent literature on gender and CSR-engagement in China (Lau et al., 2016; and Liao et al., 2016).
M14|Corporate social responsibility and capital allocation efficiency|We investigate the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and firm-level capital allocation efficiency. Using seminal investment-Q framework, we provide evidence that CSR distorts investment sensitivity to Q. We further determine that this effect of CSR is moderated by the assumed level of agency conflict, stakeholder engagement, as well as financial slack. We also document that CSR negatively affects the sensitivity of external finance to Q and aggravates investment sensitivity to cash flow. In addition, we find that the distortion in the firm-level capital allocation efficiency is reflected in firm performance. Our findings are robust to alternative variable measurement as well as tests for endogeneity.
M14|Do financial constraints matter when firms engage in CSR?|Studies in corporate social responsibility find that financial performance (ROA and ROE) is associated with the corporate social performance (CSP). Margolis et al. (2007) observed that “the mechanisms connecting prior corporate financial performance (CFP) to subsequent CSP” is an important issue for further investigation. In this study, we examine whether different states of cash flow liquidity impact the extent of a firm’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. If firms perform well in CSP, we assume they have greater cash flow liquidity as measured by the KZ index and Altman’s Z-score. We posit that firm engagement in CSR is negatively linked with financial constraint dummies, which are computed as above 20% on the KZ index, or an Altman’s Z-score below 1.81. In this study, we compute the ratio of CSR strengths to concerns for each firm, which allows us to assign a specific CSR ‘Focus’ for each sample firm. Based on data from MSCI ESG STATS ratings, all firms are divided into seven focuses: an Environment Focus (ENV), a Community (COM) Focus, an Employee (EMP) Focus, a Diversity (DIV) Focus, a Product (PRO) Focus, a Governance (CGOV) Focus and a Human Rights (HUM) Focus. Furthermore, a multiple logit regression is conducted based on these seven focuses to examine the impact of financial constraints/liquidity proxies on firms with different CSR focuses. Our results confirm a significant negative association between CSR activities and the degree of financial constraints/distress. Our finding confirms the view of Campbell (2007). For the CSR focuses, we find that in general firms facing financial constraints do not engage in any CSR activities, especially when the degree of financial constraints is assessed by the KZ index. Our findings are robust using various CSR measures and financial constraint measures, and potentially useful to market participants when making investment decisions. Our findings also provide greater understanding of the characteristics of CSR firms.
M14|Environmental and Financial Performance of Fossil Fuel Firms: A Closer Inspection of their Interaction|We investigate the relationship between environmental and financial performance of fossil fuel firms. To this extent, we analyze a large international sample of firms in chemicals, oil, gas, and coal with respect to several environmental indicators in relation to financial performance for the period 2002–2013. We find that these firms have significantly higher scores on environmental performance efforts than other firms. We use a simultaneous equations system to identify the direction of the relationship between environmental and financial performance of the firms. We find that environmental outperformance has no impact on financial performance for chemical firms, reduces returns and risks for coal companies, has a mixed impact on returns in oil and gas, and reduces financial risks for oil and gas firms. Financial outperformance reduces environmental performance in all fossil fuel (sub)industries investigated. Our findings mainly support the opportunistic view regarding the impact of financial returns, which holds that financial performance negatively impacts social performance. Regarding financial risk, we find support for the stakeholder perspective where good environmental performance is beneficial from a finance perspective. We conclude to substantial differences in the environmental-financial performance relationship along fossil fuel firms in different subindustries.
M14|Does family involvement explain why corporate social responsibility affects earnings management?|We investigate how family involvement in the ownership, management, or governance of a business affects its engagement in earnings management both directly and indirectly through its corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. Using a sample of S&P 500 companies, we find that family firms tend to have higher CSR performance, which can help them to maintain legitimacy and preserve socio-emotional wealth. Family firms also engage in less accrual-based earnings management, although they are indistinguishable from non-family firms in terms of real earnings management. In contrast to previous research, we find that CSR performance is not significantly associated with either accrual-based or real earnings management behavior after we account for the effect of family involvement. Our findings suggest that the association between CSR performance and family involvement is the primary driver of the relation between CSR performance and earnings management documented in previous research.
M14|Effects of Top Management Team Characteristics on Corporate Charitable Activities: Evidence from the Board for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in China|Employing data from Chinese companies listed on the board for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the research examines the relationship between top management team (TMT) characteristics and corporate charitable activities in China. My findings confirm: 1) Firms less engaged in charitable activities are likely to have TMTs characterized by more educational specialty in science and engineering, and more functional background in output functions; 2) TMT age heterogeneity has a significant and positive effect on corporate charitable activities, while TMT educational specialty heterogeneity has a negative influence on corporate charitable activities; 3) TMT age, tenure, educational level and these heterogeneities of tenure, educational level and functional background have little or no influence on corporate charitable activities. Based on the upper echelons theory, the study can provide evidence for further research on top management teams and corporate social responsibility in an emerging economy.
M14|Functional and Linguistic Bridging in Multinational Corporations: Moderating Effect of Cultural Identity Integration|In this study, we explore the role of functional and linguistic bridging in multinational corporations (MNCs) using a sample of 200 Japanese employees working in Japanese overseas subsidiaries. We draw on the social network theory and Job Demands- Resources (JD-R) model to advocate the idea that bridging roles (functional and linguistic bridging) influence team-member exchange (TMX) and emotional exhaustion positively via the mediating role of occupational social capital and role conflict. We found that employees who possess low cultural identity integration were more versatile in moderating between a bridging role, team member relationships, and emotional outcomes. Our findings make a theoretical contribution in exploring bridging roles from both the positive and negative sides of international business. We suggest that although bridge individuals can lead to positive team member relationships, they can also signal emotional burnout stemming from role conflict. We also offer suggestions on how to recognize cultural identity integration as a resource in elaborating on bridging roles and mitigating negative emotional outcomes.
M14|Over the top: Team composition and performance in Himalayan expeditions|Using a large sub-sample of expeditions from the “Himalayan Database”, we analyze the impact of a climbing team’s cultural value diversity on various performance outcomes. Irrespective of an already large (and still growing) body of theoretical and empirical research on the diversity-performance link, the study of the multifaceted concept “culture” under rather extreme conditions has hitherto been largely ignored. We extend the literature by focusing on the effects of the cultural value diversity of a commercial climbing team on expedition outcomes. We test our hypotheses using data from 1,168 expeditions that took place between 1990 and 2014 involving mostly “amateur” climbers from all over the world. We find that the probability of team success is positively influenced by a culturally more heterogeneous team composition. Individual-level analyses further reveal that an increase in a team member’s cultural distance increases the probability of individual success, but also the probability of experiencing an injury or death. This result shows that the higher collective performance in culturally diverse teams is driven by the isolation of single team members.
M14|The Impact of Gender Composition of Boards on Firms Financial Performance in Poland|The so far conducted studies have not been able to answer the question of whether there is a relationship between gender composition of the board and the firms financial performance. Because of the tendency to legally regulate the gender balance of boards of directors as it was, among others, planned in the draft of the EU Directive on improving the gender balance among non-executive directors of companies listed on stock exchanges, which admittedly has been rejected, however, indicates the existence of certain trends among decion-makers, the issue of determining the relationship between gender composition of the boards and firms performance becomes an extremely important issue. The paper aims to answer the question on the number of women in the highest organizational bodies in Polish enterprises and whether there is a relationship between the compositions of boards due to gender of their members and financial results achieved by the companies. For the analysis companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange were analyzed. Following indicators: debt ratio (DR), debt to equity ratio (D/R) and the long-term debt to total assets ratio were chosen. Using statistical analysis the financial indicators were juxtaposed with the number of women on boards. The paper provides insight into the composition of boards in Polish companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange due to gender. It shows that boards of these companies are highly masculine. Nevertheless the paper tries to show if there are any dependencies between the amount of women on boards and the financial performance of the companies.
M14|Zastosowanie standardow spolecznej odpowiedzialnosci w Polsce i na swiecie|Research background: Spoleczna odpowiedzialnosc (SR – social responsibility) jest koncepcja zarzadzania, ktora ksztaltuje sie podobnie do zarzadzania jakoscia czy zarzadzania srodowiskowego. Jak kazda koncepcja posiada portfel narzedzi, ktore mozna wdrazac w organizacjach majacych potrzebe posluzenia sie dana koncepcja w swoich dzialaniach. W chwili obecnej katalog narzedzi SR stale sie rozrasta i ulega kolejnym modyfikacjom. Purpose of the article: Celem artykulu jest analiza zastosowania znormalizowanych narzedzi SR. Najpierw przyblizono istote SR oraz scharakteryzowano zestaw znormalizowanych narzedzi. Stan ich zastosowania poddano analizom empirycznym. Methodology/methods: Postawiono dwa pytania badawcze: Jak wyglada zastosowanie standardow SR na swiecie wedlug aktualnych danych? Jak wyglada zastosowanie standardow SR w poszczegolnych krajach oraz w Polsce wedlug aktualnych danych?Do odpowiedzi na powyzsze pytania posluzono sie oficjalnym danymi pochodzacymi od organizacji formalnie odpowiedzialnych za analizowane standardy, uznano je za wiarygodne i kompletne. Z uwagi na to, ze dane pochodza z roznych zrodel analizy maja charakter pogladowy. W analizach uwzgledniono ISO 14001, SA 8000, AA 1000AS i G4, nie uwzgledniono ISO 26000 ze wzgledu na charakter normy (nie przeznaczona do certyfikacji) i w zwiazku z tym brak odnosnych danych. Findings: Najczesciej stosowanym standardem SR jest ISO 14001, kolejne standardy sa juz duzo rzadziej stosowane. Z jednej strony to pocieszajace, ze dobrowolna norma z zakresu ochrony srodowiska jest relatywnie czesto stosowana, z drugiej jednak dziwi fakt, ze narzedzia z innych zakresow tematycznych (warunki pracy, raportowanie zrownowazonego rozwoju i stosunki z interesariuszami) maja znikome zastosowanie. Jezeli chodzi o zastosowanie znormalizowanych narzedzi SR w roznych krajach to widac silna tendencje wsrod krajow spoza rozwinietych i stabilnych gospodarek do stosowanie analizowanych narzedzi, swiadczy to o ich wiekszej motywacji do poprawy konkurencyjnosci z wykorzystaniem takze koncepcji SR. Niestety w Polsce taka tendencja nie istnieje a analizowane standardy praktycznie nie sa stosowane, pewnym wyjatkiem jest ISO 14001.
M14|Profitability of corporate social responsibility in network industries|Abstract The present paper shows that, when firms compete in a non-cooperative way on the level of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in network industries, the conventional result of the prisoner’s dilemma structure of the game in standard industries—i.e. to have social concerns is the Nash equilibrium, but it is harmful for firms’ profits—vanishes and, for sufficiently intense network externalities, the equilibrium in which both firms have social concerns is more profitable than simple profit-seeking. Moreover, we show that—when firms cooperate in choosing the profit-maximising level of social concerns—a profit-maximising CSR level does exist, provided that network effects are sufficiently strong. Therefore, in network industries, firms may obtain higher profits engaging in—cooperatively as well as non-cooperatively—CSR activities, showing that firms’ social concerns may be motivated by the owners’ selfish behaviour. Finally, a counter-intuitive result as regards consumer’s surplus and social welfare is obtained: those are always higher under competitive than cooperative choice of CSR because the level of CSR activities is higher in the former case. However, given that firms gain their largest profits with the cooperative choice of CSR, a Pareto-superior outcome is not reached.
M14|Gender, Communication Styles, and Leader Effectiveness|We study gender differences in the behavior, communication, and effectiveness of randomly selected leaders in a laboratory experiment using the turnaround game. Leaders can send nonbinding pre‐play text messages to try to convince followers to coordinate on the Pareto‐efficient equilibrium. The treatment variations consist of the gender of the leader, and whether the communication is one‐way (only leaders send messages) or two‐way (first followers send messages to their leader, and subsequently the leader sends messages to the group). We find that male leaders communicate more assertively. Communication with the followers induces female leaders to express significantly more often that they are part of the group, rather than standing above the group. Despite the different paths in communication, both men and women are equally likely to request the highest effort contribution. Men and women are equally effective leaders.
M14|Men and Women Are Equally Effective Leaders|We study gender differences in the behavior and effectiveness of randomly selected leaders in a laboratory experiment using the minimum effort coordination game. Leaders can send non‐binding numeric messages to try to convince followers to coordinate on the Pareto‐efficient equilibrium. The treatment variations consist of the gender of the leader, and whether participants know or do not know the gender of the leader in their group. We find that female leaders choose more often to send a riskier high message in the beginning of the game, which hurts their effectiveness especially if gender is not revealed. However, if gender is revealed, both male and female leaders make more careful choices, and thus we do not observe any significant gender difference in leader effectiveness.
M14|Gender Diversity In The Hermes Paris Boardroom And Risk Management|The reason for this review tried to look at the general execution of Hermès Paris with particular hazard elements and macroeconomic variable on gainfulness execution. The information acquired from yearly report of Hermès Paris beginning from 2011-2015. The estimation of liquidity proportion and working proportion used to see the generally speaking execution of Hermès Paris in 5 years which purportedly past benchmark. The extra estimation is the benefit measure, this variable has a negative and no huge association with liquidity hazard. To see the relationship of dangers elements to the benefit, this paper is using liquidity (current proportion), GDP and working proportion. Information was broke down by using relapse and bivariate relationship. The relapse examination and bivariate connection indicates just a single element of productivity is huge to working proportion which is ROA with the most astounding effect to the gainfulness. Be that as it may, the liquidity and GDP is not noteworthy to productivity with low effect to the gainfulness.
M14|“Factors of Workplace Environment that Affects Employee Performance in an Organization”: A study on Greenwich University of Karachi|Nowadays, organizations are aware of the fact that employee performance is one of the key factors behind any business’s success, which is why the management is usually finding ways to increase the level of employee performance through various methods. It is the mission of organization to get people together to accomplish tasks and objectives by utilizing the resources effectively and efficiently. The basic objective of this study is to measure the impact of working environment factors on performance of employees working in Greenwich University (GU), through identifying the variables which includes leadership, organizational culture, training and development, rewards and incentives and stress. This study is quantitative in nature and is aimed to find out the relationship between the above mentioned variables and employee’s performance of Greenwich University (GU) and the sample size is of 50 current employees. The hypothesis will be proven will by using Multiple Regression Analysis which is in SPSS software the reason for using MLR is that the research contains 5 independent variables and their affects have to be seen on employee’s performance which is single dependent variable. The purpose of the study is to see the existing literature and theories in order to have a constructed framework of factors affecting employee performance. It was observed through the validity of the results that these environmental factors do have an impact on employee performance.
M14|Eco-Firms and the Sequential Adoption of Environmental Corporate Social Responsibility in the Managerial Delegation|This article investigates the strategic environmental corporate social responsibility (ECSR) of polluting firms in the presence of eco-firms. When the firms decide to adopt ECSR sequentially within the framework of the managerial incentive design and then face simultaneous price competition, we show that firms will adopt ECSR and purchase abatement goods to mitigate competition if the products are more substitutable, but the late adopter chooses lower ECSR and thus earns higher profit. It can partially explain the current expansive adoption of ECSR as an industry-wide wave.
M14|The Relationship between Female Representation at Strategic Level and Firm's Competitiveness: Evidences from Cargo Logistic Firms of Pakistan and Canada|The comparative study investigates the impact of various attributes such as feminine leadership style, gender diversity, and autonomy linked with the female representation at strategic level on the performance and competitiveness of the Cargo Logistic Firms in the contrasting economies; Pakistan and Canada. Previous studies offered limited insight due to unidimensional while this study takes multivariate approach, considering; variable of interest examined in terms of economies and gender. Cross-sectional research design following semi-structured questionnaire circulated among targeted audience by combining of stratified (probability) and convenience, purposive, and snowball (non-probability) sampling technique at layers of management. The combined sample size is 631 employees. The results showed that females prefer more flexible leadership style in comparison to males. Organisations having high gender diversity and female representation at strategic level are more progressive and innovative. Interestingly, in developing economies, rapid career growth chances are higher for females. Females are more people oriented while male are more task-oriented. Males have high desire for autonomy at workplace.
M14|Impact of Organizational Culture on the Pakistani Hotels Workforce's Job Satisfaction: Qualitative Report|The influence of organizational culture on the level of job satisfaction depends on the ability to cope up with the stress and working environment. This investigation tackle the purpose of Denison’s prototypical for searching the organizational culture and Spector JGS assessment to inspect workforce job gratification in the course of 5 points Likert Scale. The investigation studied 220 hotel employees from middle range 3 star hotels in Pakistan. For interpretation, researchers chiefly used MS Excel for classifying, coding, and fractionizing raw facts into processed meaningful themes. Current investigation demonstrates that employee’s job satisfaction chiefly dependent on organizational culture. The study undertakes in the direction of achieving organizational goals by initiating fortify strategies towards building the strength to obtain the objective. Moreover if organizations built a strong environment of learning as a part of their culture than it boosts the commitment level of employees. Further, it also helps employees to unfolding their career achievements. On the other hand, it is observed that females are occupied with higher level of job satisfaction while males have lower. Although, high level of job satisfaction exists but its more evident by this research that premiums, bonuses, and other types of incentives aid employees to lead from low level of job satisfaction to reach on their higher apex level of job satisfaction.
M14|Human Capital Flows in Failing Organizations: An Integrated Conceptual Framework|Purpose – The paper examines the dynamics of human capital accumulation and human capital depletion in the processes leading to business failure. Design/methodology/approach – Building on the human capital theory, strategic human resource and business failure literature, this paper develops a conceptual framework which links the inward and outward dimensions of human capital flows in the business failure process. Findings – The analysis sheds light on why some highly skilled individuals may opt to flee declining firms to avoid being stigmatised whilst others become motivated to joint such firms. Research limitations/implications – The paper suggests that understanding the nature and dynamics of both flows are essential when seeking to avert collapse. Originality/value –In spite of a growing body of research on business failure and intense competition for top talent, much of the existing literature has circumvented the relationship between them. This study develops a unified model towards enhancing our understanding of the human capital flows.
M14|Profitable and desirable corporate environmentalism in a delegation contract under incentive subsidy on abatement technologies|This study investigates corporate environmentalism in a managerial delegation contract and shows that a well-designed subsidy scheme can enhance business profitability and thus, an environmental policy could lead to both social and private benefits. This analysis allows us to better understand the Porter’s concept of environmental policy and firm’s profitability.
M14|Les déterminants de l’entrepreneuriat féminin à Dakar Sénégal<BR>[The determinants of female entrepreneurship in Dakar Senegal]|The purpose of this paper is to understand the determinants of women's entrepreneurship in the informal sector in Dakar (Senegal). It aims mainly at a better knowledge of women's involvement in economic activities through the informal sector. The paper does this in three ways: first, by defining the informal sector and the female entrepreneur through a literature review; second, by adapting theoretical models in entrepreneurship to the Senegalese informal sector and by defining the concept of entrepreneurial culture ; third, by making a discriminating factorial analysis and a barycentric analysis, based on primary data collected from 153 women in Dakar, to describe a woman’s belonging to a category of creation: creation in the formal or large informal sector, creation in the small informal sector and non-creation. The results show that the woman entrepreneurial activity from one sector to another depends on her human, social and cultural capital and confirm the importance of social capital in the female entrepreneurship of the developing countries where the informal sector is highly developed.
M14|Codetermination: the Presence of Workers on the Board. A Depth Analysis|We show the most relevant literature regarding the corporate governance system of Codetermination, which includes the presence of workers' representatives on the board. The aim is to thoroughly analyse the topic and to fill a gap present in the current literature, the absence of an updated and extensive literature review, which analyses both the theoretical and empirical perspective. This particular analysis allows one to see a clear picture of this sensitive issue of governance, mainly present in the German world, but expanding to other countries especially in northern Europe, also as a result of the recent European Union directives.
