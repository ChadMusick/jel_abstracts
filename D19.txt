D19|Impact of Crude Oil Price Changes on Household Consumption Expenditure in Oman (1990 -2016)|Objective - The preceding three years (2014, 2015, and 2016) saw a drop in the price of oil which has impacted all parts of Omani macroeconomic life. This study aims to identify the association between oil price changes and aggregate household consumption expenditure in the Sultanate by analyzing the long term relationship between the variables of interest. Methodology/Technique - The (ARDL) Autoregressive Distributed Lag bound test of co- integration is used with 27 annual observations obtained between 1990 and 2016. Finding - The statistical results show that there is a long term, positive relationship between the two variables. Novelty – As Oman is heavily dependent on oil, any fluctuation in the price of oil will undoubtedly cause instability in the economy (macroeconomic variables) demonstrating the presence of a robust correlation between consumption and oil prices. The bound test of the ARDL approach demonstrates this relationship. This study is therefore useful for Muscat officials to identify ways to reduce the dependency on oil.
D19|Interpolation of Japan's Household Consumption during World War II|This paper reconstructs a comparable series of Japan's household consumption in the 1940s, using historical records about household outlays and black-market transactions, and interpolating missing values in the existing statistics. Specifically, nominal outlays of urban and farm households are estimated, and then converted into real outlays by effective price indexes containing black-market transactions. Household outlay per capita is then computed by taking the average of urban and farm household outlays using population shares as weights. Real outlay in 1945 is estimated at a little less than 50 percent compared to that in 1940, although statistics are missing for 1945. Even considering alternative estimates using other records, real outlay in 1945 is a little more than 50 percent compared to that in 1940. Thus, it is concluded that Japan's household consumption in 1945 declined to the level in 1875-1880.
D19|Human networks and toxic relationships|We devise a theoretical model to shed light on the dynamics leading to the so called toxic relationships. We want to investigate what policy interventions people could advocate to protect themselves and to reduce suffocant assuefaction so to escape to the trap of physical or psychological abuses either in family or at work. By assuming that the toxic partner's behavior is exogenous and that the main source of addiction is income or wealth, and solving a dynamical system of differential equations we find that an asympotically stable equilibrium with positive love is always possibile for enough high level of appealing unless subsides to reduces assuefaction are introduced. Also the existence of a third uncondicionally reciprocating part as a benckmark (which represents not only the real presence of another partner but also the support from family, friends and overall private organizations. These last may help victims of domestic abuses or private organizations by offering economic and psychological support as well as legal counseling to victims of bullying at workplace and placement offices which e ectively help to find soon another job)plays an important role in reducing the toxic partner's appealing. By solving our model we outline the condition for a best mixed policy where both monetary subsides and alternatives are at work
D19|"""Gold Miss"" or ""Earthy Mom""? Evidence from Thailand"|"This paper investigates the impact of Thai women's education on their marriage behavior and fertility. It first uses the panel data set from the Socio-Economic Survey to estimate the effect of education on the marriage market. The result from applying the individual fixed effect estimation indicates that obtaining a university degree decreases the probability of women's marriage, emphasizing the rise of the ""Gold Miss"" phenomenon in Thailand. The cross-sectional data set from the Labor Force Survey examines the effect of education on fertility. By applying both the instrumental variable using the compulsory education reform as an instrument and pseudo-panel approaches to take into account the endogeneity of schooling, the result shows that education causally reduces fertility, which provides a convincing sequential explanation for the dramatic decline in fertility in Thailand."
D19|Mothersâ€™ and childrenâ€™s employment in Europe. A comparative analysis|This paper presents a comparative analysis using EU-SILC data of the correlation between mothersâ€™ employment during adolescence and their childrenâ€™s probability of being workless (i.e. either unemployed or inactive) at about 30 years of age in 19 European countries. By estimating various multilevel logit models, the paper shows that, on average, having had a working mother is associated with a reduction in the probability of being workless of about 25 to 35 percent for daughters and 20 to 25 percent for sons. Cross-country differences in these correlations are much larger for daughters than for sons, in particular for daughters with children, and do not reflect the usual country groupings. Our results suggest that mothersâ€™ employment not only influences preferences for labor market participation, but also some attitudes or skills that favor their childrenâ€™s successful integration into the labor market. Moreover, the observed correlation between mothersâ€™ employment and their daughtersâ€™ labor market outcomes is lower in contexts where the burden of childcare falls more on women, highlighting that the presence of constraints on womenâ€™s choices may conceal mothersâ€™ influence on daughtersâ€™ preferences.
D19|Impact of social comparison on DSM in Poland|Poland’s energy strategy prioritizes long-term energy security, energy efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The country’s progress toward sustainable development requires in-depth analyses of possible solutions. In our study we investigate consumers’ preferences for Demand Side Management programs for electricity usage in Poland. We apply a discrete Choice Experiment framework for various electricity contracts implying the external control of electricity usage. The main objective of the study is to investigate the value of potential disutility of Polish households from the energy management. Additionally, we elaborate on the effect of social comparison between households’ electricity use on the acceptance of new electricity contracts. The results suggest that people require substantial compensations to accept the external control of electricity in extreme cases and in weekdays during certain hours. Turning to the social comparison, we were expecting that people with a higher electricity usage per person in a household will require lower compensations, however we observe the opposite result. The respondents who were informed that they use more electricity than an average person in his administrative district seem to feel higher discomfort from the external electricity control. This suggest that the effect of social comparison might be overbalanced by the differences in perceived utility from electricity usage.
D19|¿Afecta la distancia de residencia a los centros urbanos la calidad en la cartera de creditos? Caso aplicado a una entidad financiera de Colombia|Este documento busca determinar la relación existente entre la distancia del lugar de residencia y el centro urbano más cercano frente al comportamiento de pago de las obligaciones financieras (créditos de consumo). Usando información de una entidad financiera que otorgó créditos a individuos que residían en 345 municipios de Colombia, se encuentra que la distancia resulta significativa. Entre más alejado habite el individuo de un centro urbano, su probabilidad de incumplimiento es menor. Adicionalmente, variables como el género, la edad, el estado civil, el nivel de escolaridad, los ingresos, el valor de la cuota, el monto desembolsado y la presencia de instituciones financieras en los municipios de residencia, resultan relevantes al momento de determinar la probabilidad de que un crédito llegue a incumplimiento. El resultado sugiere que los individuos que habitan en municipios alejados de los centros urbanos representan un menor riesgo de crédito sobre sus obligaciones financieras.
D19|Job Displacement, Family Dynamics and Spousal Labor Supply|We study the effectiveness of intra-household insurance among married couples when the husband loses his job due to a mass layoff or plant closure. Empirical results based on Austrian administrative data show that husbands suffer persistent employment and earnings losses, while wives’ labor supply increases moderately due to extensive margin responses. Wives’ earnings gains recover only a tiny fraction of the household income loss and, in the short-term, public transfers and taxes are a more important form of insurance. We show that the presence of children in the household is a crucial determinant of the wives’ labor supply response.
D19|Cash transfers, polygamy, and intimate partner violence: Experimental evidence from Mali| Cash transfer programs primarily targeting women in Latin America and East Africa have been shown to reduce intimate partner violence (IPV), but knowledge gaps remain on how impacts differ by program features and context. Using a randomized control trial, we investigate the IPV impacts of Maliâ€™s national cash transfer program (JigisÃ©mÃ¨jiri), which primarily targets men in a West African context where nearly 40 percent of households are polygamous. The program causes significant decreases in IPV in polygamous households â€“ where physical violence decreases by 7 percentage points, emotional violence decreases by 12 percentage points, and controlling behaviors decrease by 16 percentage points but has limited effects in nonpolygamous households. Evidence on mechanisms suggests that the program led to significant decreases in menâ€™s stress and anxiety among polygamous households, and larger reductions in disputes in polygamous households compared to non-polygamous households.
D19|Parental Beliefs about Returns to Child Health Investments|Childhood obesity has adverse health and productivity consequences and poses negative externalities to health services. Its increase in recent decades can be traced back to unhealthy habits acquired in the household. We investigate whether parental beliefs play a role by eliciting beliefs about the returns to a recommended-calorie diet and regular exercise using hypothetical investment scenarios. We show that perceived returns are predictive of health investments and outcomes, and that less educated parents perceive the returns to health investments to be lower, thus contributing to the socioeconomic inequality in health outcomes and the intergenerational transmission of obesity.
D19|Negotiating a Better Future: How Interpersonal Skills Facilitate Inter-Generational Investment|Using a randomized control trial, we examine whether offering adolescent girls non-material resources – specifically, negotiation skills – can improve educational outcomes in a low-income country. In so doing, we provide the first evidence on the effects of an intervention that increased non-cognitive, interpersonal skills during adolescence. Long-run administrative data shows that negotiation training significantly improved educational outcomes over the next three years. The training had greater effects than two alternative treatments (offering girls a safe physical space with female mentors and offering girls information about the returns to education), suggesting that negotiation skills themselves drive the effect. Further evidence from a lab-in-the-field experiment, which simulates parents’ educational investment decisions, and a midline survey suggests that negotiation skills improved girls’ outcomes by moving households’ human capital investments closer to the efficient frontier. This is consistent with an incomplete contracting model, where negotiation allows daughters to strategically cooperate with parents.
D19|Predicting Retirement Savings Using Survey Measures Of Exponential‐Growth Bias And Present Bias|In a nationally representative sample, we predict retirement savings using survey‐based elicitations of exponential‐growth bias (EGB) and present bias (PB). We find that EGB, the tendency to neglect compounding, and PB, the tendency to value the present over the future, are highly significant and economically meaningful predictors of retirement savings. These relationships hold controlling for cognitive ability, financial literacy, and a rich set of demographic controls. We address measurement error as a potential confound and explore mechanisms through which these biases may operate. Back of the envelope calculations suggest that eliminating EGB and PB would increase retirement savings by approximately 12%. (JEL D91, D14)
D19|The Consequences of Academic Match between Students and Colleges|We consider the effects of student ability, college quality, and the interaction between the two on academic outcomes and earnings using data on two cohorts of college enrollees. Student ability and college quality strongly improve degree completion and earnings for all students. We find evidence of meaningful complementarity between student ability and college quality in degree completion at four years and long-term earnings, but not in degree completion at six years or STEM degree completion. This complementarity implies some tradeoff between equity and efficiency for policies that move lower ability students to higher quality colleges.
D19|Intimate Partner Violence and the Business Cycle|We examine the impact of business cycle variation on intimate partner violence using representative data from thirty one developing countries, through 2005 to 2016. We distinguish male from female unemployment rates, identifying the influence of each conditional upon the other. We find that a one percent increase in the male unemployment rate increases the incidence of physical violence against women by 0.50 percentage points, or 2.75 percent. This is consistent with the financial and psychological stress generated by unemployment. Increases in female unemployment rates (corresponding to decreases in women's employment opportunities), conditional upon rates of male unemployment reduce the incidence of violence; a one percent increase being associated with a decrease in the probability of victimization of 0.52 percentage points, or 2.87 percent. This is consistent with 'male backlash'. These patterns of behaviour are stronger among better educated women and weaker among women who have had at least one son.

D19|Relationship between dimensions of Brand Equity and 4Ps of Marketing Mix - Place, Product, Promotion, & Price: Coca Cola - Consumer Based Qualitative Survey|The relationship between dimensions of brand equity (brand association, brand awareness, perceived quality, and customer's loyalty) and 4Ps of marketing mix (product, place, price, and promotion) are examined in this paper. Cross sectional research design while following inductive approach I have explore the relationship between research variables from consumer's perspective. Total 129 participants took part in this survey. Respondents were identified and approached through convenience sampling technique. Survey questionnaire contained 16 total questions (4 demographic and 12 attitudinal and behavioural) questions with matrix based 5-Points LIKERT SCALE. Questionnaire was self designed and administered personally. Findings showed that there is significant relationship between dimensions of brand equity and 4Ps of marketing mix. The most significant dimension in terms of Coca Cola is brand association and least effective dimension has been customer's loyalty. Furthermore, most effective marketing mix tools for Coca Cola has been its product and pricing strategies while least effective has been promotional strategies. It is also found that despite being brand image with high dependability and reliability image, there is low customer's loyalty towards Coca Cola. The paper is significant because it explores the relationship from consumer's perspective. Further, it examines the association between all dimensions of brand equity and considered marketing mix feature from qualitative perspective. The limitations of research are discussed at the end of research paper.
D19|Analyzing Factors Affecting Financial Literacy and its Impact on Investment Behavior among Adults in India|Financial literacy is essential for making key financial decisions related to saving, borrowing and investment. Although numerable studies have been conducted to find elements of financial literacy, most of them focus on developed countries. This study aims to determine characteristics that affect levels of financial literacy in India and the impact of financial literacy on investment behavior. Primary data from 309 respondents across India was collected for the purpose of the study and was analyzed using empirical methods such as ordinary least square (OLS) regression and t-test. It was found that financial literacy among respondents was low and significant differences existed based on sociodemographic and economic factors. Unexpectedly, financial literacy was found to have no effect on investment behavior. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is among the first, if not the first, of its kind to be conducted in India. The findings have significant implications for financial education and public policy programs.
D19|Transfer Of Behavioral Traits From Parents To Children: An Experimental Approach|It is commonly believed that parents transfer their behavioral traits to their offspring. But where does one draw the line between nature and nurture? Most of us have received our first lessons in lying, trust, generosity and even selfishness from our parents. These non-cognitive skills, like patience, ambition, tenacity etc. are all thus malleable traits if we come to prove that they are transferred from parent to their child. A field experiment was conducted at a private school in Lahore, Pakistan. These experiments measured two key non-cognitive skills that literature believes are passed onto the offspring via their parents: patience and trust. To measure the correlation between parents and children, an ordered probit analysis was employed. Our findings show that there is a strong negative relationship between child’s patience to that of her parent. Child and parent trust display no significant relationship. However, a positive significant relationship was analyzed between child reciprocity and parent reciprocity.
D19|The Effects of Maternal Depression on Nine-Year-Old Childrenâ€™s Behavior, Physical Health, and Cognition|This paper investigates the effects of maternal depression, including its occurrence and chronicity, on nine-year-old childrenâ€™s behavior, physical health, and cognition, as well as the extent to which five mechanisms explain the association between maternal depressionâ€™s chronicity and these outcomes. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), we conduct this analysis with ordinary least squares (OLS), instrumental variable (IV), and Lewbel IV regression models. We find that maternal depression significantly negatively impacts childrenâ€™s behavior and physical health at age nine, while its relationship to their cognition remains ambiguous. These demonstrated effects increase in magnitude and significance with depressionâ€™s chronicity. Estimates indicate that economic hardship explains a significant portion of the association between maternal depression and all three categories of child outcomes, while mothering behaviors, co-parenting, and maternal health also play an important role for some outcomes. These findings provide support for potential policies for identifying depression early in its course, making appropriate treatment more financially viable for all individuals, and assisting children at-risk for or already suffering from behavioral and physical health problems.
D19|Borrower-Specific and Institutional Factors Leading to the Forced or Voluntary Exit of Microfinance Borrowers|Microfinance borrowers tend to have no properties to offer as loan security (collateral) as they are poor and low-income, and thus would constitute a considerable risk to lenders once they default. MFIs, therefore, have to device a system to ensure that loan defaults are as low as possible in order to maintain their financial sustainability, without which they would resort to higher interest rates that would only defeat the original intent of their microfinance lending philosophy.This paper seeks to identify factors that affect the voluntary exits or forced eviction of Philippine borrowers from microfinance lending networks focusing on indicators that are (a)internal to the borrowers? personal circumstances and business operating environments; and(b)those that capture the microfinance institutions? loan delivery operations. The analysis will analyze data compiled by the Social Enterprise Development Partnerships, Inc. (SEDPI) on micro-insurance borrowers in the Philippines from 2000 to 2010. Econometric analysis will employ Heckman selection techniques to determine significant determinants of either the forced eviction or the voluntary exit of MFI borrowers. Two versions of the Heckman equation system will be developed. The first version defines the selection equation to select MFI borrower observations who were forced to leave the program (FORCED=1; VOLUNTARY=0) for the outcome equation that identifies significant factors behind such MFI action. The second version?s selection equation focuses on the voluntary borrower exits (VOLUNTARY=1; FORCED=0) so that the outcome equation will determine significant factors behind such borrowers? decisions. Explanatory variables will capture personal, business, Centre-related, and macroeconomic factors. Expected results will shed light on how sudden changes in personal circumstances of certain borrowers (physical and economic), business viability issues (often associated with macroeconomic conditions), and institutional factors affecting borrower servicing and other borrower-lender relationship issues may lead to either the MFIs? decision to evict certain borrowers or individual borrowers voluntarily deciding to exit from the MFI lending system. This study offers important implications on achieving a proper balance of financial sustainability and social outreach goals of microfinance operations. This balancing of goals has been a difficult challenge for most MFIs globally. The Philippine microfinance experience may help shed light on possible remedies to this elusive balancing goal.
D19|Matching for Social Mobility with Unobserved Heritable Characteristics|We analyse the intergenerational transmission of ‘innate ability’, focusing on the role of marital sorting. The heritability of ability induces a concern for the ability of potential spouses independently of a concern for their earning capacity. Marriages form on the basis of beliefs about ability (since it is not observed) as well earning capacity (which is observed). Beliefs are informed by earning capacity, but crucially also by family background. We show how the intergenerational transmission of ability becomes sensitive to elements of the economic environment once marital sorting is endogenously determined, but also that policy variables (e.g. income redistribution) generally have no impact. The analysis also reveals a novel ‘status motive’ for parental investment and channel through which the fortunes of grandparents and prior generations persist.
D19|Time and money transfers: social networks and kinship in migration|This study investigates transfers given by different donors to parents in need for help whose children migrated abroad. We develop a formal model of time and money transfers given to the elderly parents by kin and non-kin individuals taking into account the elderly’s social network and proximity between transfer’s donor and recipient. We find that migrant children specialize in money and non-migrant children in time transfers, provided that the difference in wages and proximity between siblings is substantial, and parental social networks do not compress. The dynamics in the size and composition of parent’s social network triggered by child’s migration affects the transfers received by parents not only from children, but also from other individuals. The overall effect on total time transfers might be positive even if donors decide to decrease their transfers of time, provided that the set of donors is enlarged.

D19|Population density, fertility, and demographic convergence in developing countries|Whether the population tends towards a long-run stationary value depends on forces of demographic convergence. One such force is the result of fertility rates being negatively affected by population density. We test the existence of such an effect in 44 developing countries, matching georeferenced data from the Demographic and Health Surveys for half a million women with population density grids. We find a causal relationship from population density to fertility such that a rise in density from 10 to 1000 inhabitants per square kilometer corresponds to a decrease in fertility of about 0.7 children. The corresponding half-life for population dynamics is of the order of four–five generations.
D19|Explicit vs implicit proprietorship: Can endowment effect theory explain exchange asymmetry?|Plott and Zeiler (2007) manage to extinguish exchange asymmetry—but as a result of failing to control for whether the items are presented sequentially or simultaneously. This study examines the effect of timing. It finds that exchange asymmetry emerges when the timing is sequential, even when we follow the Plott/Zeiler methodology, i.e., use lottery.
D19|Family Welfare and the Cost of Unemployment|This paper calculates the cost of an unemployment shock in terms of family welfare. We find that, overall, families face an average annualized expected dollar equivalent welfare loss of $1,156 when the unemployment rate rises by 1 percentage point. The average welfare loss for married families is greater than for single families and increases with education. We then estimate that a 1.8 percent shock to purchasing power would generate the same amount of overall welfare loss as a one-percentage-point rise in the unemployment rate.
D19|Economic Impacts of Workfare Reforms for Single Mothers: Benefit Substitution and Labour supply responses|We analyse the economic impacts of Norwegian nationwide reforms on the state benefit programme targeting single mothers and derive the net fiscal impacts of the reforms on both the affected single mothers and public expenses. Our analysis accounts for behavioural reform responses by single mothers in terms of benefit substitution and labour supply. We find that for each 100-NOK reduction in benefit payments from the programme, single mothers replace approximately 60 NOK through benefit substitution. In the short term, we find a sizeable positive reform effect on single mothers’ labour supply and earnings. However, the positive labour supply response diminishes drastically in the long term. The reforms increase single mothers’ disposable income in the short term, but in the long term, we find no or even negative effects on disposable income. In terms of the net fiscal impact on public expenses, the reforms are successful. We estimate a total net gain of 3.56 billion NOK (37 million EUR) in public expenditures covering the 1998–2008 period.
D19|Self-employment and parenthood|Studies from a multitude of countries suggest that women become self-employed after having children to facilitate the work-family balance. In Sweden, generous parental leave and heavily subsided childcare is available, facilitating for parents to hold salaried jobs. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether having children increases the likelihood of individuals being self-employed. One major contribution is that this study covers the whole population, including men, with a quantitative analysis, instead of a sample through interviews and/or surveys. The results suggest that most individuals are less likely to be self-employed after having children, thus contrasting most other studies.
D19|Early and Late Human Capital Investments, Borrowing Constraints, and the Family|This paper investigates the importance of family borrowing constraints in determining human capital investments in children at early and late ages. We begin by providing new evidence from the Children of the NLSY (CNLSY) which suggests that borrowing constraints bind for at least some families with young children. Next, we develop an intergenerational model of lifecycle human capital accumulation to study the role of early versus late investments in children when credit markets are imperfect. We analytically establish the importance of dynamic complementarity in investment for the qualitative nature of investment responses to income and policy changes. We extend the framework to incorporate dynasties and use data from the CNLSY to calibrate the model. Our benchmark steady state suggests that roughly half of young parents and 12% of old parents are borrowing constrained, while older children are unconstrained. We also identify strong complementarity between early and late investments, suggesting that policies targeted to one stage of development tend to have similar effects on investment in both stages. We use this calibrated model to study the effects of education subsidies, loans and transfers offered at different ages on early and late human capital investments and subsequent earnings in the short-run and long-run. A key lesson is that the interaction between dynamic complementarity and early borrowing constraints means that early interventions tend to be more successful than later interventions at improving human capital outcomes.
D19|Grandchildren and their grandparents' labor supply|Working-age grandparents supply large amounts of child care, an observation that raises the question of how having grandchildren affects grandparents' own labor supply. Exploiting the unique genealogical design of the PSID and the random variation in the timing when the parents of first-born boys and girls become grandparents, we estimate a structural labor supply model and find a negative effect on employed grandmother's hours of work of about 30% that is concentrated near the bottom of the hours distribution, i.e., among women less attached to the labor market. Implications for the evaluation of child care and parental leave policies are discussed.
D19|The economies of scale of living together and how they are shared: estimates based on a collective household model|Abstract How large are the economies of scale of living together? And how do partners share their resources? The first question is usually answered by equivalence scales which assume equal sharing of resources within the household. Recent evidence based on collective household models rejects this equal sharing assumption. This paper uses data on financial satisfaction to simultaneously estimate the sharing rule and the economies of scale in a collective household model. The estimates indicate substantial scale economies of living together. Furthermore, wives receive on average almost 50 % of household resources, but the estimated shares vary between 30 and 60 %. Female resource shares increase with the ratio of female to male wages. Consumption inequality is underestimated by 16 % if unequal sharing is ignored.
D19|Child Work and Schooling in Rural North India: What do Time Use Data Say about Tradeoffs and Drivers of Human Capital Investment?|This study examines time use data for 1244 children in the age-group 6-12 years in 274 villages in eight states in rural north India to understand the tradeoffs between time spent in school, time spent at work, time spent on home study and leisure. [IGIDR WP-2013-023].
D19|Child Labour: what do the survey results in Georgia show|The child labour is very important problem in the world. The statistical findings based on the survey results, providing details on child labour phenomenon in Georgia, its dimensions and scope, including characteristics and results. According to the survey 5.8% of children aged 5-17 are economically active. The boys account for 76.5% of employed children aged 5-17. Children engaged in economic activities constitute 1.6% in urban and 11.4% in rural areas. The educational level of parents of children in child labour is relatively low compared to the educational level of non-working children. Poverty and low income are among the main causes of child labour.
D19|Financial Capacity: Do students know what they need to know?|This paper reports a survey aimed at assessing students’ financial awareness and knowledge in the fields of banking and personal, corporate and public finance. The survey on the financial capability of students at the Gdansk University of Technology employed a questionnaire containing 64 questions. It lasted 6 months (June – November 2015) and involved 414 students. It was designed to collect comprehensive information regarding financial capability including knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviour. The present study has shown that the greatest shortcomings of students’ financial knowledge are in the areas of personal finance and corporate finance and they lack satisfactory skills in the fields of public finance and corporate finance. This means that we should now pay attention to the associated learning outcomes. Furthermore, university policy should be geared toward encouraging employers to notify universities of their expectations. On this basis, universities can change their programmes to help engineers make the right financial decisions. This study conducted among the students at the Gdansk University of Technology has allowed us to take a comprehensive look at many issues which could also be the subjects of study in other socioeconomic groups. On the basis of this study we are able to indicate some proposals for desirable changes of direction in the field of research concerning the financial knowledge, skills and awareness of students, and also the possibility of developing them in educational programmes.
D19|Attitudes towards Intimate Partner Violence against Women in Latin America|In this paper we analyze the factors that explain attitudes towards intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) in 23 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Analyses of IPVAW in LAC are relatively scarce although there is growing concern about this problem in the region. We aim to assess the effect of individual and country characteristics using data from common sources for all countries. This work contributes to the sparse literature dealing with methods that attempt to assess the effect of macro variables. We perform a two-step procedure. We first estimate a logit model at the individual level, we calculate a measure of relative approval of IPVAW at country level and we use this measure as a dependent variable to estimate the effect of macro variables. Our study finds that most LAC patterns at individual level are similar to the international ones: approval of IPVAW is higher among women, people in rural areas, people in a disadvantaged socio-economic situation and individuals with some particular cultural characteristics. Unlikely international evidence, attitudes do not differ between ages. Our findings at country level show that approval of IPVAW increases with poverty, fertility rate and equal gender outcomes. It decreases with internet access and, with a lesser degree of robustness, with the time elapsed since the enactment of women’s suffrage. The most novel contribution of our work is the study of the variables at country level.
D19|Does a spouse's health shock influence the partner's risk attitudes?|The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a spouse's health shock on own risk attitudes. A spouse's health shock (i.e., the occurrence of a severe disease) can influence own expectations about the probability of falling ill. Moreover, an indisposition of the spouse, which may disrupt the ability and efficiency in sharing the everyday responsibilities, can increase mental and financial pressure, and thus would lead to a reduction of own risk willingness. On the other hand, a health shock may act as a wake-up call to enjoy life and may increase risk willingness. Using German Socio Economic Panel data, this study reveals that a health shock suffered by the spouse decreases own risk willingness. The effect is more pronounced the more serious the health shock is. The findings have implications for health insurance decisions and policy evaluations.
D19|School of Thought: The Role of Formal Education in Shifting Opinions of Female Genital Cutting in Burkina Faso| Gender-biased harmful practices are prevalent across many parts of the world. Once these practices have become part of the cultural landscape, they are very difficult to alter without external stimuli. Whether those stimuli can be targeted toward individuals or they must be targeted toward the community as a whole is heavily debated. I study the effect of an individual-level intervention on the perceptions of an entrenched, gender-biased, cultural practice. Specifically, I study the effect of education on the perpetuation of female genital cutting (FGC) in Burkina Faso. Using a pseudo panel of 36,000 women born between 1949 and 1995, I find that educated women are 30 percent more likely to oppose the practice than uneducated women. Additionally, women who support the practice are more than twice as likely to have a daughter who has undergone FGC, and I find suggestive evidence that education raises a woman’s bargaining power in the household. Together, my findings suggest that an individual-level intervention could reduce the prevalence of an entrenched cultural practice in the subsequent generations.
D19|Diferencias de género en la edad del primer matrimonio: una evidencia desde los modelos de búsqueda marital para Colombia|Este estudio pretende establecer de qué manera la decisión de casarse se ve afectada por un entorno socioeconómico familiar que favorece la acumulación de capital humano y por la transición hacia el rol económico de la adultez. Se evalúa si las diferencias de género en las características de entrada al matrimonio disminuyen a medida que se reducen las diferencias en el estatus económico de hombres y mujeres. Con este propósito, se estima un modelo de duración de la búsqueda marital para evaluar si estas variables explican la decisión de hombres y mujeres colombianos de casarse o comenzar uniones de hecho a determinada edad. Mayores posibilidades de educación e inserción laboral femenina reducen las diferencias en el comportamiento matrimonial entre hombres y mujeres generando incentivos a postergar las uniones.
D19|Employment and the risk of domestic violence: does the breadwinner’s gender matter?| This article studies the effect on the risk of female victimization of the employment status of the woman and her partner. We use individual-level data from the violence against women surveys for Spain, which also provide information on income and a rich set of sociodemographic characteristics. To address the potential endogeneity of the binary employment indicators, we exploit exogenous geographical information on the employment and unemployment rates by gender and age, within a multivariate probit framework. Our estimation results show that male partner employment plays a major role in the risk of physical violence, while female employment only lowers it when her partner is employed too. The lowest risk appears for more egalitarian couples in which both partners are employed.
D19|Reprint of “The relationship between siblings’ college choices: Evidence from one million SAT-taking families”|Recent empirical work has demonstrated the importance both of educational peer effects and of various factors that affect college choices. We connect these literatures by highlighting a previously unstudied determinant of college choice, namely the college choice made by one's older sibling. Data on 1.6 million sibling pairs of SAT-takers reveals that younger and older siblings’ choices are very closely related. One-fifth of younger siblings enroll in the same college as their older siblings. Compared to their high school classmates of similar academic skill and with observably similar families, younger siblings are about 15–20 percentage points more likely to enroll in 4-year colleges or highly competitive colleges if their older siblings do so first. These findings vary little by family characteristics. Younger siblings are more likely to follow the college choices of their older siblings the more they resemble each other in terms of academic skill, age and gender. We discuss channels through which older siblings’ college choices might causally influence their younger siblings, noting that the facts documented here should prompt further research on the sharing of information and shaping of educational preferences within families.
D19|Understanding the spectrum of residential energy-saving behaviours: French evidence using disaggregated data|Analysing household energy-saving behaviours is crucial to improve energy consumption predictions and energy policy making. How should we quantitatively measure them? What are their determinants? This study explores the main factors influencing residential energy-saving behaviours based on a bottom-up multivariate statistical approach using data from the recent French PHEBUS survey. Firstly, we assess energy-saving behaviours on a one-dimension scale using IRT. Secondly, we use linear regression with an innovative variable selection method via adaptive lasso to tease out the effects of both macro and micro factors on the behavioural score. The results highlight the impact of five main attributes incentivizing energy-saving behaviours based on cross-variable analyses: energy price, household income, education level, age of head of household and dwelling energy performance. In addition, our results suggest that the analysis of the inverted U-shape impact of age enables the expansion of the energy consumption life cycle theory to energy-saving behaviours.
D19|Doing good but not that well? A dilemma for energy conserving homeowners|In this paper the issue of market capitalization of energy efficient buildings is addressed by considering single-family housing in Sweden and through analyzing as to what extent the market price for a house is influenced by its energy performance. Are Swedish homeowners doing well by doing good?
D19|Are children more paternalistic than their mothers when choosing snacks?|This paper focuses on an experiment in which mothers and their child separately chose between relatively healthy foods (flasks of stewed apples) and relatively unhealthy foods (candy bars). Each participant first filled up a first bag for her/himself, and then, a second one for the other person of the dyad. A simple nutritional message on vitamins and sugar contents of foods was then provided, and subsequently each participant filled up a third bag for her/himself and a fourth one for the other person of the dyad. The results show that before revealing the nutritional message, mothers are, on average, “indulgent”, which means that they choose a lower number of relatively healthy foods for their child than the one they choose for themselves. Children tend to be rather “paternalistic”, which means that they choose a higher number of relatively healthy foods for their mothers than they choose for themselves. The nutritional message leads many mothers and children to significantly increase the number of relatively healthy foods selected for themselves and for the other person. The mothers’ indulgence versus the children’s paternalism, along with the children’s reactivity to the message, suggest that mothers underestimate the children’s acceptance of healthy food.
D19|Family migration and relative earnings potentials|A unitarian model of family migration in which families may discount wives' private gains is used to derive testable predictions regarding the type of couples that select into migrating. The empirical tests show that gender neutral family migration cannot be rejected against the alternative of husband centered migration. Couples are more likely to migrate if household earnings potential is disproportionally due to one partner, and families react equally strongly to a male and a female relative advantage in educational earnings potential. These results are driven by households with a strong relative advantage to one of the partners while results are less clear for small dissimilarities within the couple, suggesting that gender identity norms may play a role when the opportunity costs of adhering to them are small.
D19|Determinants of Generic Substitution in the Czech Republic|Using individual level-data, the paper uncovers patient and drug characteristics that determine the probability of using the original patented products despite the presence of generic substitutes in the Czech Republic in the period 2009-2013. Our results reveal different behavioral patterns for drugs against acute and chronic diseases. The results have direct implications for the design of pharmaceutical policies aiming at an increased consumption of generic substitutes.
D19|How do people pay rent?|Using data from the 2014 Boston Fed Bill Payment Experiment and the 2014 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice (SCPC), we investigate how households pay their rent. We find that the dominant methods for paying rent are cash (22 percent), check (42 percent), and money order (16 percent). Electronic methods are still rarely used, at 8 percent for bank account number payment and 7 percent for online banking bill payment, and less than 2 percent for debit and credit cards. Compared with other large bill payments of more than $200, rental payments are much more likely to be made with paper-based methods than with electronic methods and are much less likely to be automatic, despite the recent attempts by start-ups to make it easier for landlords to accept electronic payments. Check and electronic methods are more frequently used for higher-valued transactions and by those with higher income and education.
D19|The Influence of Religion on Grocery Shoppers’ Behavioural Intentions in Mauritius Supermarkets|"""Objective – Based on Sheth’s (1983) integrative theory of patronage preference as the central theoretical framework, this paper examines religious influences on grocery shoppers’ behavioural intentions in Mauritius. Methodology/Technique – Using stratified random sampling method a 5 point-Likert scale questionnaire was administered. Data from the random sample of 409 grocery shoppers was obtained by a computer aided telephone interview. The sample consisted of 202 Hindus, 71 Muslims and 136 Catholics represent the religious proportion of the Mauritian population. Findings – Results indicate that religious commitment significantly influences store loyalty, and complaint intentions, but have no significant impact on price sensitivity. Religious affiliation was found to have an impact on complaint intentions only. Understanding how to attract more loyal customers should be an underlying strategy for store managers rather than focusing on short-term profits. Novelty – Future research should consider how religious commitment mediates self-congruity, trust, commitment and satisfaction and their influence on behavioural intentions. This research is limited as it only considers the behavioural intentions of grocery shoppers in Mauritius. These findings address the gap in the religion domain and shed light on the value of religiosity wherein the market is highly religious as a potential marketing segmentation tool when formulating marketing tactics and implementing marketing strategies"""
D19|Childcare Use and Its Role in Indigenous Child Development: Evidence from the Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children in Australia|We investigate patterns of childcare use and its influence on the cognitive development of Indigenous children. The influence of childcare on Indigenous children's cognitive outcomes is less well understood than for non‐Indigenous children due to a lack of appropriate data. We focus on a cohort of Indigenous children in Australia who have been followed from infancy and for whom rich information on childcare use and cognitive outcomes is observed. Compared to Indigenous children who never participated in childcare, Indigenous children who participated in childcare performed better on several early cognitive outcomes. Using regression and propensity score matching, we show that this difference is driven by selection into childcare, with children from more advantaged families being more likely to attend formal childcare. However, matching analysis results suggest that relatively disadvantaged children might benefit more from attending childcare, as indicated by the positive estimated effects found for those who never attended childcare.
D19|Locus of control and investment in risky assets|Using representative household panel data, we show that the investment behavior of households is related to the economic locus of control of household heads. A household’s internal locus of control in economic issues is positively related to its decision to hold risky assets as well as its share of risky investments. We find evidence that these relations are due to a lower perception of the risk of investing in risky assets: Those who have an internal economic locus of control perceive less variance in risky assets, which makes these assets more attractive. The relation between investment in risky assets and locus of control cannot be explained by risk and time preferences or by personality traits such as optimism and the Big Five traits. Furthermore, the relation is independent of household socioeconomic background in terms of wealth or knowledge — it holds for sophisticated and unsophisticated households alike.
D19|Effectiveness of promoting energy efficiency in Thailand -- the case of air conditioners|This paper aims to identify the magnitude of energy efficiency improvement, which has been promoted through energy efficiency labeling and the Minimum Energy Performance Standard, and to compare this against the increase in the number of products and the average increase in cooling capacity. Air conditioners (ACs) are one of the major contributors to energy consumption in a household. To assess the magnitude of this factor, we developed a formula to decompose total energy consumption from ACs into the number of ACs, their average cooling capacity, and energy efficiency. In the case of ACs in Thailand, energy efficiency improvement has offset the increase in the average AC cooling capacity. However, energy consumption from ACs increases with the number of ACs.
D19|Is there Swissness in investment decision behavior and investment competence?|Abstract Based on a large international survey, we analyze how German-, French-, and Italian-speaking residents of Switzerland differ in their investment decision behavior and investment competence compared to their closest neighbors abroad who speak the same language. Although language may be closer to the individual self than country of residence, we find that there are greater similarities in the decision behavior of residents of Switzerland speaking different languages than there are between these and their linguistically closest neighbors abroad. These similarities hold also for the ability to avoid investment mistakes, which is stronger in all Swiss regions compared to the linguistically closest regions abroad. The Swissness in investment competence is more likely to be emotionally than knowledge driven and is associated with regional differences in the relationships with investment advisors.
D19|Divorce and the cost of housing: evidence from Iran|Abstract Divorce trend in Iran has become a serious social concern that is suspected of being influenced by rising housing costs in an oil-based economy. Iran has the highest growth rate of divorce among Islamic countries in the Middle East and North Africa region. Using data from 30 provinces of Iran from 2002 to 2010, this paper examines the relationship between housing costs (house prices and rents) and divorce rate, controlling for other macroeconomic variables such as unemployment, inflation, and education in addition to regional, cultural, traditional, and conventional attitudes toward divorce. By applying panel fixed-effects and dynamic generalized methods of moments methods, our results suggest that increases in housing costs erode marital stability in Iran. Our main results are also supported when we focus on the shocks in housing costs, using the Vector autoregressive based impulse response and variance decomposition analyses of divorce rates at the national level from 1982 to 2010.
D19|The schooling repayment hypothesis for private transfers: evidence from the PROGRESA/Oportunidades experiment|Abstract The schooling repayment hypothesis for private transfers predicts a positive relationship between the amount of parental investment in children’s education and the amount that adult children transfer to their parents. We provide evidence on the repayment motive using data from the Mexican conditional cash transfer program PROGRESA/Oportunidades (PO). PO pays a transfer to parents for sending their children to school. Thus, if private transfers from adult children to parents are in part repayment for parental schooling investments made in the past, then PO should decrease these transfers—parents were already exogenously compensated by the government for sending their kids to school and not to work. Exploiting the exogenous variation in the amount of cash transfers a household receives from PO for sending its children to school, we compare the private transfers received in 2007 by parental households who had children 0–16 in 1997 and started receiving the programs’ benefits in 1998 with the transfers received by similar parental households who started receiving benefits in 1999. Results suggest a repayment motive exists. That is, PO is causing adult children to transfer less resources to their parents.

D19|Financing from Family and Friends|Most informal finance comes from family and friends. Existing informal finance theories cannot match two characteristics of family finance: family investors may accept below-market or even negative returns, yet borrowers often prefer formal finance. We argue that social preferences make family finance cheap but create shadow costs that nonetheless discourage its use: Committing family funds to risky investment displaces intrafamily insurance and undermines limited liability. The same characteristics that sustain familial insurance thus render family finance a poor source of risk capital. Even when overcoming capital constraints requires social ties, intermediation and semiformalization may therefore be crucial for promoting risk taking.

D19|From Store To Stovetop: Cooking And Consuming Habits Of Midwestern Residents|Cooking habits and product quality can impact consumer’s in-grocery and at-home food decisions. On February 12, 2016, a survey was launched; data collection concluded two weeks later for a total sample of 1,265 respondents. Household demographic information was collected, as well as information about cooking habits, where respondents learned healthy eating, and acceptance of damaged food items. Males made up 48% of the sample, with those aged 45 to 64 years old representing the largest age group (38%) in the sample. In terms of method of learning healthy eating, learning from family was selected by 56% of the sample. A majority of the sample was willing to accept or buy food past the sale by date (61%), accept or buy damaged produce (53%), and accept or buy dented canned or boxed items (77%).
D19|Choice Overload Paradox And Public Policy Design. The Case Of Swedish Pension System|In this paper we focus on an adverse effect of extensive choice widely known as ‘choice overload’. We draw on the case of Swedish funded pensions for illustration and analyze the consequences of the design that allowed for maximizing the choice set. The analysis shows limitations of employing the rational choice approach to the real choice decisions biased with common psychological factors and demonstrates that government’s responsibility for the privatized pension system does not end with the design. We also emphasize the need for a decent default option, which would mitigate socially harmful results of adverse behavior effects like procrastination, status quo bias or abstaining from choice. After all, privatized pension systems still belong to the sphere of public policy.
D19|Parentsâ€™ Choice Function for Wardsâ€™ School Continuation in Rural India: A Case Study in West Bengal|In this article, we present a choice function of a rural household relating to her/his wardâ€™s schooling. It makes an empirical evaluation on the basis of a simple theoretical framework using a primary data set surveyed from two backward districts of West Bengal. It explores the underlying causes of wardsâ€™ discontinuation of school by examining the choice function of the parents using ordered probit analysis. The likelihood of dropout is higher at the primary level for low-income households and significantly depends on parentsâ€™ attributes, which are mostly endogenous in an educational production function, and other exogenous difficulties in accessing school. It is also triggered by a lack of expectation about the future impact of education on a childâ€™s life. JEL Classification: C25, C80, D19, I21, I25
D19|Remit for what? The Impact of Information Asymmetries in Transnational Households|The main purpose of this paper is to check whether information asymmetry may affect the allocation of a given budget between in-kind consumption-type goods and in-kind investment-type choices. In order to test the model, we use the results of a lab-in-the-field experiment where migrants engage in a dictator game and are asked to earmark a given budget between consumption and investment goods to be delivered to the most closely connected household (MCCH). Three different scenarios of information sharing with the MCCH on the choices made by the migrant are considered – private information, full information sharing and information sharing with a social excuse for investment goods. Empirical results confirm that under private information investment goods are preferred, whereas under full information sharing we observe a significant bias towards consumption goods (about 70 euros more out of a total budget value of 1000 euros, i.e. 7%). This behavior under different information sharing scenarios may be interpreted as evidence of self-interest motives to remit rather than pure altruism.
D19|Gender Discrimination in Education: What motivates parents to invest more in sons?|Gender discrimination exists in many different forms, and in many different countries and contexts. A wide body of empirical evidence suggests the existence and persistence of gender discrimination within the household. Boys receive preferential treatment from parents in terms of health and educational inputs. In this paper I map out and examine the existence and extent of gender discrimination in India among school going children (ages 4-18) and compare outcomes based on different types of household heterogeneities, such as size, income, location etc. I use child-specific data on enrolment and educational expenditures incurred for all children in the household, thereby making comparison both within and across households.While the male bias exists in both the decision to enrol a child in school, and in the amount of money spent on their books, tuition etc, parents particularly favour first born children. Households in urban areas, and those that have fewer children tend to discriminate less in favour of boys. It also striking that as the number of children increases, parents have higher expectations of financial support in the future from their sons, suggesting that this expectation may be exacerbating the preferential treatment to boys.
D19|The role of information/knowledge flow in the clients? purchasing decisions|In the current reality and the conditions under which companies conduct its activity, the role of information/knowledge is gaining in importance. The Internet?s popularization had a big influence on this increasing, as Internet allows not only for information providing but also its generation. Looking further, it has also contributed to the increasing meaning of knowledge, based on a large amount of information perceived by the receivers. In the case of information that was already presented in the traditional supply chain, as one of the subjects of flows - next to products and financial resources, but its role was confined mainly to the improvement of the entire supply chain. Now, information flows that takes place between the company and its client are very important, these flows play a large role in making purchase decisions taken by clients. Because of this decision, whether to buy the product or not, the further development of the company may depend on. Therefore, the main purpose of this article was to verify whether for the clients, information about the products are important and if they play an important role in making purchase decisions. The authors focused on how clients obtain and share information/knowledge about the products offered by the company, and also examined whether for the client the efficient flow of information is important, and whether in their opinion, the company try to improve their information flows directed to its clients.
D19|Consumption in Rural Households of the Elderly (Konsumpcja w wiejskich gospodarstwach domowych osob starszych)|The article is aimed at diagnosing the innovativeness of Polish senior consumers (aged 65 and over). The starting point of the analysis is a short description of the elderly population. It is followed by the issues like: the interest of seniors in innovative goods and services as well as their knowledge of the problem, their inclination to purchase innovation and the related motives and barriers. There is also a discussion of the sources of information on the selected categories of innovative goods and services. The summary presents the segmentation of Polish consumers with regard to their attitudes to innovation and the share of senior consumers in every segment as well as a general assessment of senior consumer innovativeness. The article makes use of the empirical research conducted in 2014 within the Institute for Market, Consumption and Business Cycles Research project entitled “Consumption in an Innovative Economy”.
D19|Cash benefits for poverty relief from the viewpoint of suicide prevention|Abstract A welfare programme can contribute to preventing suicide by granting cash benefits to those experiencing considerable deterioration in their living standards. However, undesirable side effects may arise. Cash benefit beneficiaries might depend heavily on welfare, thus finding themselves caught in an unemployment trap in which they have little incentive to seek work. This problem should be considered when developing a welfare programme aimed at poverty relief. This paper assumes two welfare programmes as polar cases. One programme provides all beneficiaries with the same amount of cash benefits. The other provides each beneficiary with an amount that is proportional to the level of his or her previously earned wage income. This paper assumes that these welfare programmes prohibit beneficiaries from earning extra income and carrying cash benefits over to the next period. I numerically simulate suicidal decision making under each programme. The simulation results show that flat-rate cash benefits can contribute more to suicide prevention than wage-related cash benefits.
D19|The remittance behaviour of Kenyan sibling migrants|Abstract This paper examines the remittance behaviour of multiple-sibling migrants and the motivations of Kenyan siblings in sending remittances to their household of origin. The presence of other siblings is found to decrease the probability of remitting but has no effect on the amount sent. The volume of remittances sent by other siblings is also found to have no statistically significant effect on the amount sent by a sibling. Thus, the evidence obtained offers some mild, though not unambiguous, support for sibling remittances being driven by altruistic as well as independent motives. JEL Classification: B21, D19, J69
D19|Childcare Prices and Maternal Employment : A Meta-Analysis|The literature estimates for labor force participation elasticity with regards to child care prices are extensive and varying. While some estimates imply substantial gains from child care subsidies, others find insignificant effects. To determine the causes of the variance, this paper reviews and analyzes the elasticity sizes using estimates from 36 peer-reviewed articles and working papers in the literature. We start by reviewing the theoretical and empirical aspects related to participation elasticity with regards to child care costs, paying special attention to sample characteristics, methodological aspects and macro level factors. We conclude by providing a meta-regression using control variables based on our review of the literature to explain some of the differences between the estimates. As research builds on and improves the methods and assumptions in prior works, elasticity estimates have become smaller over time. This decline might also be partially explained by changes in labor market characteristics. In countries with high rates of part-time work and very high or very low rates of female labor force participation, we find elasticity rates to be smaller.
D19|Speeding up for a son? Fertility transitions among Migrants to Canada|We use the 2001 and 2006 Canadian Census to study how the sex-ratios at second birth, conditional on both the spacing between the first two children and the gender of the first, vary across place of birth or religious affiliation. We find that South Asian women give birth to a higher proportion of boys after a first-born girl compared to both natives and other immigrant groups with girls and also to South Asians with a first-born boy. Across religious groups, Sikhs present a similar behavior. These abnormal sex-ratios are particularly skewed when the time span between the first two births is short. This seems to indicate sex-selective abortion that happens more frequently after conceptions that occur fairly close to the birth of a first girl. Sex ratios return (close) to normal for these groups if live-births are spaced three years or longer.
D19|Group Decision Making With Uncertain Outcomes: Unpacking Child–Parent Choice Of The High School Track| Predicting group decisions under uncertainty requires disentangling individual members' utilities over the consequences of choice, their expectations for uncertain outcomes, and their choice process as a group. I estimate simple Bayesian models of child–parent choice of high school track with subjective risk and unilateral or bilateral, nonstrategic decisions, by combining families' actual choices with novel survey information about children's and parents' subjective probabilities over choice consequences, their individually preferred choices, and their decision roles. A set of policy counterfactuals confirms the importance of introducing the beliefs and decision roles of individual members in models and policy analysis of group decisions.
D19|Knowledge about aerosol injection does not reduce individual mitigation efforts|Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) is a climate engineering (CE) method that is reputed to be very effective in cooling the planet but is also thought to involve major risks and side effects. As a new option in the bid to counter climate change, it has attracted an increasing amount of research and the debate on its potential gained momentum after it was referred to in the 5th IPCC report (IPCC 2013). One major objection to SAI and the research done on it is that it could undermine commitment to the mitigation of greenhouse gases (Lawrence & Crutzen 2013; Schneider 2001). Policymakers, interest groups or individuals might wrongly perceive SAI as an easy fix for climate change and accordingly reduce their mitigation efforts. This is the first study to provide an empirical evaluation of this claim for individuals. In a large-scale framed field experiment with more than 650 participants, we show that people do not back-pedal on mitigation when they learn that the climate change problem could be partly addressed via SAI. Instead, we observe that people who have been informed about SAI mitigate more than people who have not. Our data suggest that the increase is driven by a perception of SAI as potentially hazardous.
D19|Exploring public perception of environmental technology over time| This paper analyses how new information shapes public perception of a controversially discussed technology over time. The test case analysed in this paper is solar radiation management (SRM), a potentially risky, environmental engineering technology, which aims to fight climate change by the injection of sulphate aerosols into the stratosphere. Using panel survey data, we show that most respondents initially show strong negative emotions towards SRM and reject the technology. However, public perception is not stable over time as emotions cool off and acceptance increases. The increase in acceptance is greater, the longer the cooling-off period between two surveys. Furthermore, we show that the cooling-off effect is more pronounced for more impulsive respondents.
D19|Not in my backyard: CCS storage sites and public perception of CCS|Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technology that counteracts climate change by capturing atmospheric emissions of CO2 from human activities, storing them in geological formations underground. However, CCS also involves major risks and side effects, and faces strong public opposition. Recently, the whereabouts of 408 potential CCS storage sites in Germany have been released. Using detailed survey data on the public perception of CCS, I quantify how living close to a potential storage site affects the acceptance of CCS. I also analyse the influence of other regional characteristics on the acceptance of CCS. I find that respondents who live close to a potential CCS storage place have significantly lower acceptance rates than those who do not. Living in a tourism or mining region also markedly decreases acceptance.
D19|Long‐Lived Working Animals As Capital Assets| A recent review of ERS’s productivity accounts recommended that ERS treat dairy cows, breeding beef cows and other long‐lived working animals as capital assets (Shumway, et. al 2014). BEA was also given the same recommendation in the international guidelines for national accounts, System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008). In ERS’s farm accounts and BEA’s National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA’s), long‐lived working animals are currently treated as an inventory asset. This paper recalculates the farm accounts and NIPA’s when long‐lived working animals are re‐classified as a capital asset. We show that this reclassification raises farm output and GDP for every year – but the increase is larger for earlier years. As a result, real farm output growth and real GDP growth falls slightly when long‐lived working animals are capitalized. Total factor productivity (TFP) growth falls slightly from 1.42% per year to 1.38% per year when year when long‐lived working animals are capitalized.
D19|How Inheriting Affects Bequest Plans|" type=""main"" xml:id=""ecca12164-abs-0001""> We present and test the idea that bequest planning is linked with the experience of inheriting. We consider ‘a family tradition of bequeathing’ as a channel through which the intention to bequeath is moulded by and is positively correlated with the experience of inheriting. Using data from the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we find that the experience of inheriting enhances the intention to bequeath, independently of the positive impact of wealth. We also find that the expectation of inheriting has a positive impact on the intention to bequeath, controlling for the expected increase in wealth on account of future inheritances."
D19|Preference for Redistribution and Inequality Perception in China: Evidence from the CGSS 2006|"In this paper I investigate the conditional correlation between preference for redistribution and the perceived role of ""circumstances"" and ""effort"" using the Chinese General Social Survey. I found very signi?cant correlations, thus validating the hypothesis of ""sense of justice"" for China. The migrant worker group who has dual identity (living/working in an urban area while being registered as a rural individual) is analysed in order to identify a discrimination effect (induced by the Chinese rural-urban segmentation policy) upon attitudes. However, being migrant is an endogenous variable to the attitude variables and the consistent estimate of this effect is much more important than the effect produced by a naïve estimate. The econometric model is a multivariate triangular LDV system with a binary endogenous explanatory variable estimated via a GHK simulator method. To implement the GHK calculations, I propose a parametric constraint to impose the positivity of the 3 × 3 correlation matrix. A generalisation for higher dimension cases is provided."
D19|Ausweitung der in der Rentenversicherung anrechenbaren Kindererziehungszeiten: Mütter pausieren nicht länger vom Job|One reason women normally have lower pensions than do men is that they take breaks from their careers to care for their children. To mitigate this, the statutory pensionis calculated taking into account childcare periods—that is, women acquire pension entitlements even though they are not paying into the pension system. This is to ensure a largely independent pension for mothers. However, the additional pension entitlements earned during childcare periods could also prompt mothers to take longer career breaks following childbirth, or to retire earlier. Thus the pension entitlements for mothers would then be reduced once again. How exactly does increasing the length of the pension benefit-eligible childcare period affect women’s postbirth career breaks? In the study at hand, DIW Berlin investigates this question by examining the effects of the 1992 pension reform, which extended the length of the pension benefit-eligible childcare period from one year to three years. The analysisis based on combined data from the German Pension Insurance and the Federal Employment Agency. The key finding: The reform has not caused women to change theduration of their career breaks. Einer der Gründe, weshalb Frauen meist geringere Rentenansprüche haben als Männer, sind familienbedingte Auszeiten vom Beruf. Um dies abzumildern, rechnet die Gesetzliche Rentenversicherung Kindererziehungszeiten an, während derer Frauen Rentenanwartschaften erwerben, obwohl sie nicht in die Rentenversicherung einzahlen. Dies soll den Müttern eine weitgehend eigenständige Alterssicherung garantieren. Die zusätzlichen Entgeltpunkte aufgrund der Kindererziehungszeiten könnten Mütter jedoch auch dazu veranlassen, längere Erwerbsunterbrechungen nach der Geburt einzulegen oder früher in Rente zu gehen. Auf diese Weise würden die Rentenansprüche für Mütter dann wieder reduziert. Wie genau wirkt sich eine großzügigere Berücksichtigung von Kindererziehungszeiten also auf die Erwerbsunterbrechung von Frauen nach der Geburt aus? Das DIW Berlin hat dies in der vorliegenden Studie anhand der Rentenreform des Jahres 1992 auf Basis kombinierter Daten der Deutschen Rentenversicherung und der Bundesagentur für Arbeit untersucht. Damals wurde die Kindererziehungszeit von einem Jahr auf drei Jahre ausgeweitet. Das zentrale Ergebnis: Die Reform hat nicht dazu geführt, dass Frauen die Dauer ihrer Erwerbsunterbrechung nennenswert verändert haben.

D19|Pension Wealth and Maternal Employment: Evidence from a Reform of the German Child Care Pension Benefit|This paper uses administrative data to investigate how a change in pension wealth affects a mother’s employment decision after child birth. I exploit the extension of the child care pension benefit in 1992 as a natural experiment in a regression discontinuity design to estimate short- and medium-run employment effects. In comparison to most family benefits, the child care pension benefit is accumulated upon child birth but only becomes effective on the verge of retirement. Hence, the employment response depends on how a mother discounts future pension benefits. The results suggest that the change in pension wealth does not affect maternal employment, which is not in line with a forward looking rational behavior. Therefore, the child care pension benefit increases maternal old-age income without causing negative employment reactions.
D19|The relationship between siblings’ college choices: Evidence from one million SAT-taking families|Recent empirical work has demonstrated the importance both of educational peer effects and of various factors that affect college choices. We connect these literatures by highlighting a previously unstudied determinant of college choice, namely the college choice made by one's older sibling. Data on 1.6 million sibling pairs of SAT-takers reveals that younger and older siblings’ choices are very closely related. One-fifth of younger siblings enroll in the same college as their older siblings. Compared to their high school classmates of similar academic skill and with observably similar families, younger siblings are about 15–20 percentage points more likely to enroll in 4-year colleges or highly competitive colleges if their older siblings do so first. These findings vary little by family characteristics. Younger siblings are more likely to follow the college choices of their older siblings the more they resemble each other in terms of academic skill, age and gender. We discuss channels through which older siblings’ college choices might causally influence their younger siblings, noting that the facts documented here should prompt further research on the sharing of information and shaping of educational preferences within families.
D19|Directing remittances to education with soft and hard commitments: Evidence from a lab-in-the-field experiment and new product take-up among Filipino migrants in Rome|This paper tests how migrants’ willingness to remit changes when given the ability to direct remittances to educational purposes using different forms of commitment. Variants of a dictator game in a lab-in-the-field experiment with Filipino migrants in Rome are used to examine remitting behavior under varying degrees of commitment. These range from the soft commitment of simply labeling remittances as being for education, to the hard commitment of having funds directly paid to a school and the student's educational performance monitored. We find that the introduction of simple labeling for education raises remittances by more than 15%. Adding the ability to directly send this funding to the school adds only a further 2.2%. We randomly vary the information asymmetry between migrants and their most closely connected household, but find no significant change in the remittance response to these forms of commitment as information varies. Behavior in these games is then shown to be predictive of take-up of a new financial product called EduPay, designed to allow migrants to directly pay remittances to schools in the Philippines. We find this take-up is largely driven by a response to the ability to label remittances for education, rather than to the hard commitment feature of directly paying schools.
D19|Influence of age of child on differences in life satisfaction of males and females|Using individual-level data for China, Korea, and Japan for 2006, this research examines how life satisfaction for married males and females in East Asian countries is influenced by the age of their children. Our results show (1) the life satisfaction of females who have a child younger than 12 years old is lower than that of females with no children. (2) The greater the marginal effect of child’s age on the life satisfaction, the more developed a nation’s economic condition.
D19|Can’t Pay or Won’t Pay? Unemployment, Negative Equity, and Strategic Default|This paper uses new data from the PSID to quantify the relative importance of negative equity versus ability to pay, in driving mortgage defaults between 2009 and 2013. These data allow us to construct household budgets sets that provide better measures of ability to pay. Changes in ability to pay have large estimated effects. Job loss has an equivalent effect on the propensity to default as a 35% decline in equity. Strategic motives are also found to be quantitatively important, as we estimate more than 38% of households in default could make their mortgage payments without reducing consumption. Received September 29, 2015; editorial decision June 2, 2017 by Editor Philip Strahan. Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University PressWeb site next to the link to the final published paper online.
D19|Intra-household commuting choices and local labour markets|Commuting is the conduit between two markets: labour and housing. While the job search literature recognizes the importance of the spatial distribution of employment, local labour market conditions have been a notable omission from the commuting literature. In the first study of its kind, we introduce local labour market conditions into a model of spouses’ commuting behaviour in the UK. We find male commute times are more sensitive to local unemployment rates than women’s, although both effects are inelastic, and are of a similar magnitude to that of labour income. The more conducive the local labour market is to female employment opportunities, the less time women spend commuting. Local unemployment rates have heterogeneous effects on commuting, e.g. arising from mode of transport, job change, and homeownership. Furthermore, housing market rigidities lead to longer commuting times and thus increase the social costs that a more flexible housing market could alleviate.
D19|Hukou Changes and Subjective Well-Being|The literature on subjective well-being has highlighted the negative effects associated with the restrictions and inequality imposed by the hukou system on China's rural population. However, quantifying the cost of holding a rural hukou has generally been problematic, principally for lack of suitable data or measurements. Thanks to RUMiC, a new longitudinal database on China, this limitation can be overcome by exploiting exogenous changes in hukou status due to expropriation. The results support that granting an urban hukou substantially enhances subjective well-being within the household, especially for the household heads. The results complement a growing literature on subjective well-being focusing on China.
D19|Parent’s Choice Function for Ward’s School Continuation in Rural India: A Case Study in West Bengal|In this paper we present a choice function of a rural household about her/his ward?s schooling. It makes an empirical evaluation on the basis of simple theoretical framework using primary data set, surveyed from two backward districts of West Bengal. It explores the underlying causes of discontinuation of school of wards by examining choice function of the parents using ordered probit analysis. The likelihood of drop out is higher in primary level towards low income category households and significantly depends on parents? attributes which are mostly endogenous in an educational production function and other exogenous difficulties in accessing school. It is also triggered up by lack of expectation about the future impact of child education on life.
D19|Choice overload paradox and public policy design. The case of Swedish pension system|In this paper we focus on an adverse effect of extensive choice widely known as ‘choice overload’. We draw on the case of Swedish funded pensions for illustration and analyze consequences of the design that allowed for maximizing the choice set. The analysis shows limitations of employing the rational choice approach to the real choice decisions biased with common psychological factors and demonstrates that government’s responsibility for the privatized pension system does not end with the design. We also emphasize the need for a decent default option, which would mitigate socially harmful results of adverse behavior effects like procrastination, status quo bias or abstaining from choice. After all, privatized pension systems still belong to a sphere of public policy.
D19|Introduction of a Debt Management Procedure for Natural Persons in Hungary|Excessive indebtedness makes support for rehabilitation necessary for millions of households. Hungary – mainly using the experiences of European countries – introduced the institution of personal bankruptcy this year. This paper attempts to compare the European model and the US practice, the former being characterised by a creditor-oriented approach, while the latter focusing on the debtor. On the basis of this, the paper discusses the objectives of the Hungarian personal bankruptcy law in an international context, including the importance of a “new beginning” for the debtor and the main features of the procedure in and out of court. It emphasises that in Hungary as well, the debtor must initiate a debt management procedure – an agreement to be reached through negotiations – first out of court and then in court. The debt remaining at the end of the procedure can be cleared after five years – similarly to European practice. Since the procedure under the new law can be initiated first by debtors who can no longer pay their housing mortgage loans, it is expected to have favourable social and macro-economic effects.
D19|Incidence du travail domestique, des caractéristiques de l’école et du ménage sur les résultats scolaires des filles en Côte d’Ivoire<BR>[Incidence of domestic work, school and household characteristics on educational outcomes of girls in Cote d'Ivoire]|The objective of this paper is to highlight the effects of domestic work of girls, school environment and household characteristics on their school results. From a probit model, the analysis indicates that domestic work favours, meaningfully, the fact of repeating a school year for girls. Besides, the availability of basic services in schools significantly reduces school failure of girls in rural areas. This study recommends that the governments have to improve the school environment in order to promote girls' performance at school.
D19|Intergenerational analysis of the donating behavior of parents and their offspring|Using data drawn from the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we explore the relationship between the donating behavior of parents and that of their children aged less than 18 which gives a direct insight into whether an intergenerational relationship in donating behavior exists. Furthermore, we exploit information relating to whether or not parents encourage their children to donate to charity by talking to them about donating to unveil information related to the intergenerational transmission of philanthropic behavior. Our findings suggest that an intergenerational correlation is only present in the absence of a control for whether the parent talks to the child about donating. The effect from the parent talking to their offspring is associated with an increased likelihood that the child donates by approximately 10 percentage points, a finding which is robust to a number of different estimation strategies.
D19|Social Insurance, Payroll Tax Structure, and Saving Rates: An International Comparison for OECD Countries|The motivation for this research is to examine the debate about the effect of social insurance on private savings, Feldstein [1974] and Leimmer and Lesony [1982]. I use time series data and alternative models to examine the hypothesis. With this objective I use an estimation model, as I describe below. Since programs and demographic among the OECD counties are significantly different, I first analyze and compare them, with special attention to similarities among the members of the European Union, which share common markets and have reciprocity programs for social security. In this context, I compare the basic statistics for wage income thresholds subject to payroll tax, their lower and upper thresholds, the marginal tax rates, and the respective shares of the employee-employer contributions for the countries in the sample. Since some OECD countries allow a maximum contribution and possible additional contributions, and have different provisions for deductibility of the payroll tax, these features of the programs are also compared. Since there are variations in social insurance tax rates for self-employed, we also compare them. Furthermore, we compare age eligibility, work history requirements, and the social security income and health care benefits across those countries. Since some countries have reciprocity for social security program in the European Union, their policies will also be considered. With such fundamental investigations, we then develop the model for empirical investigation, which is a multivariate. Both linear and log-linear specifications are considered. The dependent variable is household saving rates [per National Income and Product Account], during 1992-2011 [will be expand the time as data become available). The independent variables are: social security contributions as percentage of GDPs, (for comparison, the percentage of total tax revenues, in comparison to the OECD average are also considered), and relevant population demographics, macroeconomic factors such as the real rate of interest and the terms of trade, the Gini Coefficient, and expected social security benefits upon eligibility. We pay attention to the possibility of Collinearity and heteroscedasticity in our variables. Our preliminary results reject the hypothesis that social insurance replaces private savings. We have reviewed the relevant literature for theories of saving behaviors and social security. Our research is a new empirical contribution to the literature.
D19|An Estimation of Natural Gas Demand in Household Sector of Iran; the Structural Time Series Approach|Natural gas is one of the most important energy for household sector in entire the world. Iran has rich gas reserves and after Russia, Iran has the largest natural gas reserves in entire the world. A study of natural gas demand is very important and crucial for policy makers of energy sources in Iran. With a good estimation of natural gas demand as a result a good forecasting of natural gas demand, policy makers of energy sources can to plan an accurate energy planning. The aim of this paper is analyzing the effective factors on natural gas demand in household sector of Iran. For do it, we have used structural time series method with Kalman Filter algorithm during 1974-2010 period. Results indicate that time trend as a proxy for technology and non-economic factors is non-linear process and the elasticity of demand to price of natural gas is -0.50. Also, the elasticity of natural gas demand to price of electricity as a substitute commodity for natural gas is 0.48. The elasticity of gas demand to gas splits and real GDP per capita is 2.37 and 0.72 respectively. Conclusion: The elasticity of demand to price of natural gas is -0.50 that it shows that natural gas is an essential commodity for household sector in Iran.
D19|Sukcesja w firmie rodzinnej – droga do rozwoju czy upadku. Studium przypadku|Succession is the process of passing the enterprise on to the next generation. It is a phenomenon sustaining the long-lived life of family businesses and determining whether the company will develop or suffer defeat. Succession in family business is analyzed with regard to the newest scientific literature in this field. The main purpose of this article is to present the process of succession in the case study in one of the suburban businesses. The case study emphasizes that succession is a more complex process than taking possession of property. In addition, succession requires careful and multistage planning as well as should be perceived as a long-term process. Case study was conducted in detail. Various aspects of company’s activities were taken into account in order to show the process of succession in the family business possibly broadest in scope.
D19|Effects of Siblings and Birth Order on Income Redistribution Preferences: Evidence Based on Japanese General Social Survey|Experiences in childhood are hypothesized to influence preference formation for redistribution in adulthood. For example, eldest male children who suffer loss because of parental redistribution are less likely to endorse government-mandated redistributions as an adult. In contrast, younger children enjoy benefits from parental redistributions as a result of having a large number of older siblings. Younger children are therefore more likely to prefer redistribution. The Japanese General Social Survey was used to determine how individual preferences for income redistribution are affected by number of siblings and birth order. The important findings were as follows. (1) The first-born child was less likely to prefer income redistribution when the child was male. However, such a tendency was not observed when the child was female. (2) The larger the number of elder brothers, the more likely an individual preferred income redistribution. However, the number of elder sisters did not affect the preference. (3) The number of younger siblings did not affect the preference for redistribution regardless of the sibling’s sex.

D19|All in the Family: How Do Social Capital and Material Wellbeing Affect Relational Wellbeing?|We use a unique dataset from Italy to investigate the impact of socioeconomic characteristics and social capital on family wellbeing and satisfaction. We assess wellbeing using four dimensions of satisfaction with family life: satisfaction with decision making processes, with relationships with partner and children, and with time spent with children. Social capital is measured through information about membership in organizations, trust, and interactions with others. We find that while socioeconomic characteristics in general do not have strong effects on family wellbeing, social capital matters for family life satisfaction.

D19|Crime and the transition to teenage parenthood|Age-graded social control theory suggests that parenthood can have a preventive effect on crime among adults, but it is unclear whether and how this applies to teenagers, as teenage parenthood and affiliation with crime can have mutual confounding causes. Using individual-level Norwegian administrative register data on the total population of fifteen to nineteen year olds, we assess the relationship between teenage parenthood and criminal activity. We find that teenage parents have an elevated risk of offending compared to non-parents, but that the transition to parenthood is nevertheless related to a within-individual decline in offending. This decline does not seem to be of permanent nature for girls, but for the boys it appears to stabilize on a lower level than before the transition to teenage fatherhood.
D19|Resultados de la Encuesta sobre Alimentación y Bienestar|This paper presents the results of the Food and Wellbeing Survey (2014) conducted in 2014 with people aged 18 or older, living in Montevideo and Metropolitan Area. The main results of the survey are presented in four chapters. The first chapter describes the nutritional status and self-perception of health. The second chapter describes food consumption habits and the actors that influence their food choices. In the third chapter the foods and dishes usually consumed for dinner are described. In the last chapter results for the household food security perception are presented.
D19|Endogenous divorce and human capital production|This paper presents a model of parental decision making where parents care about consumption and the human capital of the children. Preferences over these goods can differ within households. Parents will agree to cooperate (stay married) if the utility they get from coordinating time inputs (ie child care or paid employment) is greater than they would get if they acted independently. The gain to cooperation arises because parental time inputs are not perfect substitutes in the production of the child's human capital, the cost is that when preferences differ, the chosen time allocations under cooperation may be very different to those chosen independently. Our model predicts that the human capital of children can both increase and fall after divorce. Divorce, if it occurs, will be instigated by the parent who cares most about the child, the parent that cares least about the child will never opt for divorce. This can explain the apparent contradiction that mothers are more likely than fathers to initiate divorce beyond infant age even though the traditional household literature presents women as home makers and ever devoted to household production.
D19|Couples' arts participation: assessing individual and joint time use|We exploit time-use data to investigate Italian couples’ arts participation at joint vs. individual level of partners. By using the most recent available diary data on individual time use in Italian households (ISTAT, 2002-03), we distinguish between arts attendance (going to theater, visiting a museum, etc.) and amateur arts practices (playing music, painting, etc.). The main results show the importance of togetherness in the amount of time that couples spend on arts activities, suggesting rewarding and coordination effects. Spouses’ reciprocal influence is also taken into consideration. We highlight a social role of wives especially in joint arts attendance, and an inner role of husbands in favoring wives’ individual arts activities and arts practices. Furthermore, the latter is associated with couples’ higher levels of wellbeing. Overall, time allocated to arts attendance reveals distinct socio-economic patterns with respect to arts practices.
D19|Are Results of Social- and Self-Image Concerns in Voluntary Contributions Game Similar?|Social interactions may encourage the cooperative behaviours by triggering either self-image concerns (when one sees others’ decisions without being seen) or social-image concerns (when one’s decision is seen by others). A laboratory experiment is designed to compare these two concerns directly, using a four-players finitely repeated public goods experiment on two directed star networks, self-image and social-image networks. The comparison of the players voluntary contributions in both types of networks reveals that their contributing behaviours are statistically indistinguishable. However, the players who belong to the self-image network are more willing to conform with the group behaviours, meaning that they will increase (reduce) the contributions if theirs are below (above) their groups average. Furthermore, I also find evidence that the contributing behaviours are more stable in the self-image networks than in the social-image network.
D19|Do Extended Unemployment Benefits Lengthen Unemployment Spells?: Evidence from Recent Cycles in the U.S. Labor Market|In response to the recession of 2007–2009, the maximum duration of U.S. unemployment insurance (UI) benefits was extended to an unprecedented 99 weeks. We exploit variation in the timing and size of the UI benefit extensions across states to estimate their overall impact on unemployment exits, comparing the most recent and prior extension episodes. We find a small but statistically significant increase in labor force attachment due to extended UI in both periods with little or no impact on job finding. Despite these small estimates, extended benefits can account for a substantial share of the increase in long-term unemployment.
D19|The quality of child care: A signaling game with incomplete information|This paper analyzes the e ects of asymmetric information between parents and child care centers about the quality of child care. In a dynamic game of incomplete information the child care center sends a signal about its child care quality. The parents cannot observe the true quality. By updating the information the parents decide whether they enforce high quality. We consider policy measures to increase the ex-post probability of high quality. Some measures turn out to have negative e ects on ex-post quality. Furthermore, we determine the welfare in the perfect Bayesian equilibria and the welfare-maximizing e ort to increase the probability of high quality.
D19|Career, Private Life, and the Well-Being among College-educated West German Women|This paper describes to what extent college-educatedWest German women manage to reconcile a career and a private life. In addition, it explicitly investigates how the concurrence of career and cohabitation/family/motherhood is linked to women’s life satisfaction. I attempt to overcome the difficulties associated with estimating this relation using fixedeffects models. The results suggest that only a small fraction of woman-year observations is categorised as having a career and cohabitation/family/children simultaneously. Considering different birth cohorts and generations of West German women, there are no significant improvements in the reconciliation between career and family. Further, while there are life-satisfaction gains related to both “career” and “cohabitation/family” separately, their interaction terms throughout are negative.
D19|Relative deprivation and labour conflict during Spain’s industrialization: the Bilbao estuary, 1914–1936|What drove social conflict in Spain’s industrial areas in the period before the Spanish Civil War? This paper is concerned with contrasting the determinants of working-class conflict in northern Spain at the beginning of the twentieth century. Our hypothesis is that the key determinant of conflicts in emerging industrial areas during the interwar period was the struggle to obtain satisfactory family income in a context of combined high price fluctuation, unemployment and economic boom and bust. We suggest two new ways to decipher how economic factors interact with labour conflict. We introduce the family as the relevant income unit when considering wage struggles and relative deprivation. And secondly, we study the reactions to short-term variations of income on families by using monthly rather than quarterly or annual data.
D19|Unemployment and domestic violence|Contrary to popular belief, the incidence of domestic violence in Britain does not seem to have risen during the recession. But according to research by Jonathan Wadsworth and colleagues, men and women have experienced different risks of unemployment - and these have had contrasting effects on the level of physical abuse.
D19|Beyond Pay-As-You-Go and Full-Capitalization Pension Systems|"This paper discusses the viability of three alternative pension systems for Latin America: full-capitalization, pay-as-you-go (PAYG) and notional account systems. Making use of a set of simulations, the pros and cons of each option are discussed for an ""average"" Latin American country. The results indicate that a system of individual notional accounts should be an attractive option, for several reasons. With contribution rates constant around 15 percent of wages, the system would be financially sustainable for the ""average"" Latin American country over the projection period (2015-2065), as it would generate surpluses until the early 2040s, which would be used to finance the subsequent deficit. The pay-as-you-go option (which, on average over the period would require approximately the same contribution effort) would imply frequent increases in contribution rates, which would be politically impracticable, and it would not create strong incentives for individuals to contribute as the notional accounts system. The full-capitalization system requires much lower contribution rates and may create the right incentives for workers to contribute but exposes them to high pension uncertainty. Furthermore, full-capitalization imposes a huge fiscal burden which, under most scenarios, could not be fully covered with the funds accumulated in the individual accounts, and would imply significant income redistribution from taxpayers to workers and pensioners and important transfers from the current to future generations."
D19|"""Personal network"" and retirement: Is retirement bad for friendship and good for family relationships?"|What shapes the size of a personal network of family and friends? We concentrates here on the effect of retirement from the work force. Retirement provides time to develop personal relationships; but it deprives from a potential supply of colleague friends. We draw evidence from a new question on the number of confidants in the 4th wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. The survey allows to take into account many potential determinants of personal relations. A first result is that being retired decreases friendship ties, while it increases family ties. Economic resources influence the number of confidants. We estimate that the negative effect of being retired on the number of friends is reduced by one half when we control for permanent income. The differences among countries and cohorts in retirement age regulation provide an instrument to get closer to a retirement effect. We find that the retirement decision can be endogenous. The result from the IV strategy is that the negative effect of retirement on the number of friends is erased for men, not for retired women who do have less friends than employed women, cet. par. . Finally the size of the personal network is found to have a positive but small impact on life satisfaction. Family ties are more important than friends for women and both types of ties seem equally important for men.
D19|Forced Displacement Detrimental to the Health of Children in Colombia|Colombia has the highest number of internally displaced refugees in the world after Syria. The decade-long ongoing armed conflict between the Colombian police and the armed forces, paramilitaries, and guerilla groups has caused 5.7 million people—more than ten percent of the population—to flee their homelands. Many of them are women and children, driven off their lands, in most cases, to the misery of precarious living conditions and poor hygiene in destitute urban districts. A study by DIW Berlin shows that this forced displacement is detrimental to the health of children in Colombia, with displaced infants and toddlers, for example, suffering from malnou¬rishment more frequently than non-displaced children of the same age group. Parents from displaced households also perceived their children’s state of health to be considerably worse. In addition, their probable lack of health insurance hampers access to health services and medicine.
D19|Wasser für Gesundheit in Entwicklungsländern: Herausforderungen am Beispiel Jemen|Improved drinking water supply and sewage disposal are among the top priorities for developing and expanding infrastructures in emerging economies. However, infrastructure projects do not always achieve the desired improvement in water quality for households connected to piped water, for example, if drinking water is contaminated with high levels of bacteria. Yet the lowest possible contamination level is an essential prerequisite for preventing diseases such as diarrhea, which significantly increases the risk of mortality, particularly in children under five. In certain circumstances, the positive impact on the health of the inhabitants that had originally been anticipated as a result of the infrastructure measures fails to materialize and, in the worst case scenario, the situation might even deteriorate. The Provincial Towns Program (PTP) implemented by the Yemeni government and funded through German development cooperation via the German Development Bank (KfW Entwicklungsbank) aimed to improve and expand the water infrastructure. Once the program was completed, an evaluation of its impact on the health of the inhabitants of the two provincial project towns was conducted in cooperation with the University of Göttingen. Data for this study were collected in 2009. As well as assessing the health impacts, the evaluation also examined bacterial contamination along the supply chain. In a third step, determinants of certain types of household behavior with regard to hygiene and drinking water handling practices were also analyzed. In Amran, a town situated in the Yemen’s mountainous region, where water is in short supply, households connected to the water infrastructure reported deterioration in health. For Zabid, on the other hand, a coastal town located in the west of the country, there was no evidence of this negative correlation. The discrepancy in the health effectiveness of this project for the development of water supply and sewage disposal can probably be explained by the frequent interruptions to the water supply to the mountainous areas of the country, resulting in impurities in the pipe system. The problem is further exacerbated by the inadequate hygiene practices of inhabitants and project households. Verbesserte Trinkwasserversorgung und Abwasserentsorgung gehören zu den wichtigsten Zielen im Auf- und Ausbau der Infrastruktur in Entwicklungsländern. Die erwünschte Verbesserung der Wasserqualität innerhalb der angeschlossenen Haushalte wird aber nicht immer erreicht, beispielsweise wenn das Trinkwasser eine nennenswerte Keimbelastung aufweist. Eine möglichst geringe Keimbelastung ist aber eine wesentliche Voraussetzung für die Prävention von Krankheiten wie zum Beispiel Durchfall, die vor allem für Kinder unter fünf Jahren das Sterblichkeitsrisiko deutlich erhöhen. Unter Umständen bleiben die ursprünglich erwarteten positiven Effekte der Infrastrukturmaßnahmen für die Gesundheit der Bewohner aus, schlimmstenfalls ist auch eine Verschlechterung möglich. Ein solcher Aus- und Aufbau der Infrastruktur wurde im Rahmen des Provincial Towns Program (PTP) von der jemenitischen Regierung mit Unterstützung der deutschen Entwicklungszusammenarbeit über die KfW Entwicklungsbank umgesetzt und anschließend gemeinsam mit der Universität Göttingen auf seine Wirkung für die Gesundheit der Bewohner zweier Provinzstädte evaluiert. Die Daten für diese Studie wurden im Jahr 2009 erhoben. Neben den Gesundheitsauswirkungen wurde der Verlauf der Keimbelastung entlang der Versorgungskette getestet. In einem dritten Schritt wurden die Determinanten bestimmter Verhaltensweisen innerhalb des Haushalts in Bezug auf Umgang mit Trinkwasser und Hygiene untersucht. In Amran, einer Stadt im wasserarmen Hochland des Jemens, berichten die an die Infrastruktur angeschlossenen Haushalte von einer Verschlechterung ihrer Gesundheit. In Zabid, gelegen in den feuchteren Gebieten der westlichen Küstenebene, zeigt sich dieser negative Zusammenhang hingegen nicht. Häufige Unterbrechungen der Wasserversorgung im Hochland können den Unterschied in der Wirksamkeit der Maßnahmen zum Ausbau der Trinkwasserversorgung und Abwasserentsorgung vermutlich erklären. Die Wasserunterbrechung zieht möglicherweise Verunreinigungen im Leitungssystem nach sich. Zusätzlich verschärft wird das Problem durch mangelnde Hygienevorkehrungen bei den Bewohnern der Projekthaushalte.
D19|Gewaltsame Vertreibung beeinträchtigt die Gesundheit von Kindern in Kolumbien|Colombia has the highest number of internally displaced refugees in the world after Syria. The decade-long ongoing armed conflict between the Colombian police and the armed forces, paramilitaries, and guerilla groups has caused 5.7 million people—more than ten percent of the population— to flee their homelands. Many of them are women and children, driven off their lands, in most cases, to the misery of precarious living conditions and poor hygiene in destitute urban districts. A study by DIW Berlin shows that this forced displacement is detrimental to the health of children in Colombia, with displaced babies and toddlers, for example, suffering from malnourishment far more frequently than non-displaced children in the same age group. Parents from displaced households also perceived their children’s state of health to be considerably worse. In addition, their probable lack of health insurance hampers access to health services and medicine. Kolumbien ist nach Syrien das Land mit der weltweit größten Anzahl an Binnenflüchtlingen. Der jahrzehntelange und bis heute andauernde bewaffnete Konflikt zwischender kolumbianischen Polizei und den Streitkräften, paramilitärischen Gruppen und Guerillagruppierungen hat 5,7 Millionen Menschen aus ihren Heimatregionen vertrieben – mehr als zehn Prozent der Bevölkerung. Ein Großteil sind Frauen und Kinder, die meist vom Land in die Elendsviertel der Städte geflohen sind und dort unter prekären Lebensumständen und mangelhafter Hygiene leiden. Eine Studie des DIW Berlin zeigt, dass diese gewaltsame Vertreibung die Gesundheit von Kindern in Kolumbien negativ beeinflusst. So waren vertriebene Babys und Kleinkinder signifikant häufiger mangelernährt als nicht vertriebene Kinder der gleichen Altersgruppe.Eltern aus Flüchtlingshaushalten beurteilen den Gesundheitszustand ihrer Kinder zudem deutlich schlechter. Auch sind sie wesentlich seltener krankenversichert, was den Zugang zu Gesundheitsleistungen und Medikamenten erschwert und verteuert.
D19|The Impact of Displacement on Child Health: Evidence from Colombia's DHS 2010|This paper investigates the causal impact of displacement on health outcomes for Colombian children of different age cohorts. It uses the Colombian Demographic and Health Survey 2010, which provides both a number of health outcomes and information about displacement of households. Two different empirical strategies are employed to identify the impact of displacement on child health, namely a linear regression model and propensity score matching. In order to capture different dimensions of health, four health outcomes are used as dependent variables: (i) height-for-age z-scores; (ii) subjective health status; (iii) affiliation to a health insurance; and (iv) having a health problem last month. Overall, a negative relationship between displacement and child health is documented. In line with findings from African and Asian countries, displacement increases the likelihood for malnutrition for young children and primary school children. Moreover, being displaced leads to a lower subjective health status for children from all age cohorts. Yet, displaced children are not affected by health problems significantly more often than non-displaced children. Last, but not least, displaced children from all age cohorts are significantly less likely to have health insurance.
D19|The power of the family: kinship and intra-household decision making in rural Burundi|Abstract In this paper we show that in rural Burundi the characteristics of the female’s kinship are highly correlated with her decision-making power. First, a female whose own immediate family is at least as rich as her husband’s counterpart enjoys a greater say over children- and asset-related decision-making. Second, the size, relative wealth and proximity of the extended family also matter. Third, kinship characteristics prove to be more important than (standard) individual and household characteristics. Finally, we also show that the female’s say over asset-related decision-making is positively associated with males’ education, more than with female’s education per se. All these correlation patterns can inform policies aiming at empowering women or targeting children through women’s empowerment.
D19|Intergenerational analysis of social interaction and social skills: An analysis of U.S. and U.K. panel data|A body of empirical evidence supports a positive relationship between educational attainment and social interaction. We build on this literature by exploring the relationship between the social interaction of parents and their offspring from an empirical perspective. Using two U.K. and U.S. panel data sets, we find robust evidence of intergenerational links between the social interaction of parents and their offspring supporting the existence of positive intergenerational effects in social interaction. These links exist after controlling for an extensive set of factors covering family background including income and wealth as well as attempting to control for issues related to reverse causality and endogeneity. Our empirical evidence indicates that higher levels of parental social interaction are associated with higher levels of child social interaction. Our findings indicate an important influence on this facet of children's human capital, namely social skills, with positive consequences expected for educational attainment.
D19|Estimating base temperatures in econometric models that include degree days|Heating and cooling degree days are in common use in conditional demand models, billing analysis, and large-scale energy forecasts. The implications of either choosing an ex-ante base temperature, or scanning over the base temperatures, as suggested in Fels (1986) and recommended by some evaluation protocols, are infrequently considered. These procedures result in biased estimates of weather-driven loads because of correlated errors-in-variables, and impart a downward bias to the variance of those estimates by a factor of two. A non-linear estimation procedure that corrects for these biases and an ex-ante correction factor for evaluating prior evaluations are offered.
D19|Family Welfare and the Great Recession|The analysis in this paper provides estimates of family welfare losses generated by wage and nonlabor income declines experienced across the Great Recession and by labor market constraints existing postrecession. Welfare losses are greater as families (both married and single) move up the income distribution. Total static welfare losses are estimated to amount to roughly $190 billion, comparing family welfare between 2007 and 2011.
D19|Changes in family welfare from 1994 to 2012: a tale of two decades|The female/male average wage ratio has steadily risen from 1983 to 2012. In earlier work, we found that the falling wage gap from 1983 to 1993 was materially detrimental to the average dual-earner family. The female/male wage ratio continued to rise over the following two decades, accompanied by a growing share of households in which the wife is the principal household income generator. This paper investigates how these two developments affected family welfare. Although family welfare rose during the 1990s, the story of the 2000s is quite different.
D19|Changing norms about gender inequality in education: Evidence from Bangladesh|This paper examines norms about gender equality of the education of children and adults in Bangladesh using a recent household survey for two cohorts of married women. Education norms are found to differ substantially across cohorts, with women from the younger cohort being far more positive about female vs. male education of both children and adults. The effect of education in determining norms spans own and spousal education, as well as that of older educated females in the household, thus indicating sharing of education norms both within marriage and across generations. Detailed decompositions reveal that more than anything else it is the improvement in education across cohorts that has been driving the narrowing of the generational education norms gap in Bangladesh in recent years.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D19|Expropriation with Hukou Change: Evidence from a Quasi-Natural Experiment|We study the labor market outcomes of males aged 18-60 obtaining an urban hukou as a result of land expropriation across a number of provinces in China. Using 2008 and 2009 RUMiC data pooling urban, rural and migrant samples, we find that those obtaining an urban hukou have better labour market outcomes than rural stayers and migrants, and close the gap vis-à-vis native urbanites. We also find that children of families experiencing a hukou change due to expropriation have similar investment in human capital as the children of native urban hukou holders. The results confirm the hukou status as a strong economic determinant of labor market outcomes and as a source of inequality. Differences in educational investment, regardless of the differences in parental background, appear however to disappear for the children of families experiencing expropriation, suggesting that leveling the hukou status amongst children in an urban area may be a first step towards reducing intergenerational inequality.
D19|How Parental Involvement Affects Childhood Behavioral Outcomes|National Educational and Longitudinal Study 1988 (NELS88) data were used to examine the impact of parental involvement measures on the behavioral outcomes of high-school students. Parents’ general sense of involvement with the community, as well as non-school child-helping groups, were used as instruments for whether these parents were educationally involved with their child. The instrumental variables strategy helped quantify the true effect of parental involvement on own-child behavioral outcomes. The results showed that parental involvement led to better child behavioral outcomes at the high school level, and that this effect was strengthened in the instrumental variables results.

D19|Mimetic Herding Behavior and the Decision to Strategically Default|This study examines the herding behavior of individuals in the context of their willingness to strategically default on a mortgage based on the (falsely) observed behavior of those around them. We find that homeowners are easily persuaded to follow the herd and adopt a strategic default proclivity consistent with that of their peers. Herding behavior is stronger when a Maven, or thought leader, is involved and weaker when the person finds strategic default to be morally objectionable. Homeowners appear to herd more for informational gains rather than for social reasons, and do not herd differentially based on signal strength. In a robustness check using a sample of real estate professionals, the strong mimetic herding result continues to hold. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2014
D19|Households' Saving Mobility in Poland|In this paper we analyse the saving mobility of Polish households, e.g. the mobility of households between classes of different saving rates. The analysis is based on the household budget panel data of 3001 Polish households surveyed in the same month during four consecutive years. The panel sample group was selected by authors from 30 000 households' surveyed by Polish Central Statistical Office each year. We apply the Markov mobility matrices. The long term ergodic structure of households with regard to saving rates is estimated. It illustrates the probability of a household to fall into one of the saving rates range. Our results show that during four consecutive years (1997-2000), one third of the households which saved less than 20% of the household disposable income remained in their class. In the class of households that saved more than 20% of the household disposable income half of the households kept these high saving rates. In the long term, the probability of falling into a group of households with lowest saving is 0.2. Groups falling into -20% to -5% and -5% to 5% saving rates would be the least numerous. The highest probability (0.3) was to get into a group that saved more than 20% of the household disposable income. It shows the tendency towards polarization of the households with regard to saving rates.
D19|Is the EITC as Good as an NIT? Conditional Cash Transfers and Tax Incidence|The EITC is intended to encourage work. But EITC-induced increases in labor supply may drive wages down. I simulate the economic incidence of the EITC. In each scenario that I consider, a large portion of low-income single mothers' EITC payments is captured by employers through reduced wages. Workers who are EITC ineligible also see wage declines. By contrast, a traditional Negative Income Tax (NIT) discourages work, and so induces large transfers from employers to their workers. With my preferred parameters, $1 in EITC spending increases after-tax incomes by $0.73, while $1 spent on the NIT yields $1.39. (JEL H22, H23, H24, H31, J22)
D19|The Deterrence Effect of Prison: Dynamic Theory and Evidence|Using administrative, longitudinal data on felony arrests in Florida, we exploit the discontinuous increase in the punitiveness of criminal sanctions at 18 to estimate the deterrence effect of incarceration. Our analysis suggests a 2 percent decline in the log-odds of offending at 18, with standard errors ruling out declines of 11 percent or more. We interpret these magnitudes using a stochastic dynamic extension of Becker?s (1968) model of criminal behavior. Calibrating the model to match key empirical moments, we conclude that deterrence elasticities with respect to sentence lengths are no more negative than -0.13 for young offenders.
D19|Bounded Rationality as Deliberation Costs: Theory and Evidence from a Pricing Field Experiment in India|How might bounded rationality shape decisions to spend? A field experiment verifies a theory of bounded rationality as deliberation costs that can explain findings from previous experiments on pricing in developing countries. The model predicts that (1) eliminating deliberation costs will increase purchasing at a higher price without impacting behavior at a lower price, (2) bounded rationality has certain greater effects on poorer people, and (3) deliberation costs can suppress screening by prices. Each prediction is confirmed by an experiment that sold soap in rural Indian villages. The experiment interacted assignment to different subsidized prices with a treatment that eliminated marginal deliberation costs. The results suggest implications of bounded rationality for theory and social policy.
D19|Income inequality and mortality in U.S. cities: Weighing the evidence. A response to Ash|Deaton and Lubotsky (2003) found that the robust positive relationship across American cities between mortality and income inequality became small, insignificant, and/or non-robust once they controlled for the fraction of each city's population that is black. Ash and Robinson (Ash, M., & Robinson D. Inequality, race, and mortality in US cities: a political and econometric review. Social Science and Medicine, 2009) consider alternative weighting schemes and show that in one of our specifications, in one data period, and with one of their alternative weighting schemes, income inequality is estimated to be a risk factor. All of our other specifications, as well as their own preferred specification, replicate our original result, which is supported by the weight of the evidence. Conditional on fraction black, there is no evidence for an effect of income inequality on mortality.
D19|The New Mexican - Americans: International Retirement Migration and Development in an Expatriate Community in Mexico|If you did a Google search right now on the subject of U.S.- Mexico immigration, you would probably find thousands of resources, documents, and web-pages all dealing with what is often referred to as the immigration problem. The question is generally consistent across many fronts: how to deal with the millions of undocumented Mexican immigrants from Mexico who are seeking a better life in the U.S.? While this kind of immigration between the U.S. and Mexico certainly is important, it is not the only kind of migration between the two countries. While much of what may be deemed dominant migration theory details the migration experiences primarily of so-called labor migrants and South-North migrations between areas of lesser development to more developed regions, important exceptions exist and are notably understudied.
D19|Maintaining Work: The Influence of Child Care Subsidies on Child Care-Related Work|With the passage of welfare reform, parents? ability to not only obtain, but maintain work has become imperative. The role of child care subsidies in supporting parents? job tenure has received little attention in the literature. This article examines the relationship between receiving a child care subsidy and the likelihood of experiencing a child care-related work disruption using two samples and both cross-sectional and longitudinal regression models. Child care-related work disruptions are found to be less likely among subsidy recipients across samples and methods. Program implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.
D19|Coparenting in Fragile Families|Nonmarital childbearing has increased dramatically in the U.S. since the early 1960s, rising from 6% of all births in 1960 to fully 40% in 2007 (Hamilton, Martin, & Ventura, 2009). Whereas similar trends have occurred in many developed nations, the U.S. stands out in the extent to which such births are associated with socioeconomic disadvantage and relationship instability. This has given rise to a new term ?fragile families,? which we define as unmarried couples who have a child together. The increase in fragile families reflects changes not only in the initial context of births but also in the fundamental nature and patterns of childrearing.
D19|Fathers in Fragile Families|Nonmarital childbearing has increased dramatically in the U.S. since the early 1960s, rising from 6% of all births in 1960 to fully 40% in 2007 (Hamilton, Martin, & Ventura, 2009; Ventura & Bachrach, 2000). Whereas similar trends have occurred in many developed nations, the U.S. stands out in the extent to which such births are associated with socioeconomic disadvantage and relationship instability, giving rise to a new term ?fragile families.? The increase in fragile families reflects changes not only in the context of births but also in the fundamental nature and patterns of childrearing, particularly with respect to fathers? roles and involvement with children.
D19|Parenting as a Package Deal: Relationships, Fertility, and Nonresident Father Involvement among Unmarried Parents|Fatherhood has traditionally been viewed as part of a package deal, where a father?s relationship with his child is contingent upon his relationship with the mother. We evaluate the accuracy of this hypothesis in light of the high rates of multiple-partnered fertility among unmarried parents using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a recent longitudinal survey of nonmarital births in large cities. We examine whether unmarried mothers? and fathers? subsequent relationship and parenting transitions are associated with declines in fathers? contact with their nonresident biological children. We find that father involvement drops sharply after relationships between unmarried parents end. Mothers? transitions into new romantic partnerships and new parenting roles are associated with larger declines in involvement than fathers? transitions. Declines in fathers? involvement following a relationship or parenting transition are largest when children are young. We discuss the implications of our results given the high levels of relationship instability and multiple-partnered fertility among unmarried parents.
D19|Children in Fragile Families|This paper uses data from the first four waves of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to examine the following questions: (1) what are unmarried parents? capabilities at the time of their child?s birth, and what is the nature of their relationship at birth and over time? (2) How do family structure and stability affect parental resources (financial and health)? (3) How do family structure and stability affect the level and quality of parental investments in children? And (4) how do family structure and stability affect children?s cognitive and socio-emotional development? We argue that although unmarried parents have ?high hopes? for their relationships at the time their child is born, low capabilities and distrust lead to high rates of union instability and growing family complexity. Instability and complexity, in turn, reduce parental resources by lowering parental resources (financial and health), paternal investments, and the quality of mothers? parenting, all of which undermine children?s cognitive and socio-emotional development. At the aggregate level, these pathways explain how non-marital childbearing contributes to the persistence of disadvantage across generations.
D19|Paternal Psychosocial Characteristics and Corporal Punishment of their 3-Year Old Children|This study uses data from 2,309 biological fathers who participated in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) to examine associations between psychosocial characteristics and levels of corporal punishment (CP) toward their 3-year old children over the past month. Results indicate that 61% of the fathers reported no CP over the past month, 23% reported using CP once or twice, and 16% reported using CP a few times in the past month or more. In multivariate models controlling for important socio-demographic factors as well as characteristics of the child, fathers? parenting stress, major depression, alcohol use, and drug use were significantly associated with greater use of CP, whereas involvement with the child and generalized anxiety order were not. Girls were less likely to be the recipient of CP than boys, and child externalizing behavior problems but not internalizing behavior problems were associated with more CP.
D19|Beyond Absenteeism: Father Incarceration and its Effects on Children's Development|High rates of incarceration among American men, coupled with high rates of fatherhood among men in prison, have motivated recent research on the effects of parental imprisonment on children?s development. We contribute to this literature using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to examine the effects of paternal incarceration on developmental and school readiness outcomes for approximately 3,000 urban children. We estimate cross-sectional and longitudinal regression models that control not only for fathers' basic demographic characteristics and a rich set of potential confounders, but also for several measures of pre-incarceration child development, and family fixed effects. We find that paternal incarceration is positively associated with children's externalizing problems at age five. Results are mixed with respect to attention problems, and we find some evidence that children of incarcerated fathers experience less anxiety than their peers. The observed effects of incarceration on child behavioral problems are significantly stronger than the effects of other forms of father absence, suggesting that children with incarcerated fathers may require specialized support from caretakers, teachers, and social service providers.
D19|Early Childhood Residential Instability and School Readiness: Evidence from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study|This paper assesses the consequences of residential instability during the first five years of a child?s life for a host of school readiness outcomes. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, we examine the relationship between multiple moves and children?s cognitive and behavioral readiness at age five. We further test this relationship for differences among poor, near poor, and not poor children. We find that moving three or more times in a child?s first five years is significantly associated with increases in several measures of internalizing and externalizing behavior. These effects are strongest for children who live in poverty.
D19|Fathers' Religious Involvement and Early Childhood Behavior|Previous research suggests that many men increase their religious involvement after the birth of a new child. This study extends this research by examining whether fathers maintain a higher rate of religious participation as children get older and how fathers' religiosity may influence children's behavior. Results suggest that many fathers maintain a higher level of religious participation during the early years of their child's life. Although fathers' religious involvement does not appear to directly influence children's behavior, there is evidence that fathers' religiosity moderates the influence of other family characteristics on children. Parental relationship quality and mothers' religiosity are associated with fewer problem behaviors among children when fathers believe that religion is important to family life. Results also suggest that being raised by a non-religious father is associated with increased externalizing problem behavior among young children. Overall, this study suggests that religious communities may be a source of support that encourages fathers to be more active in their family life and promote positive development among children.
D19|Religious Heterogamy and Relationship Stability: A Comparison of Married and Cohabiting Unions|Many studies have explored dynamics within religiously heterogamous marriages, but little is known about religiously heterogamous cohabiting unions. Using data from the Fragile Families Study, this study examines the influence of religious heterogamy on union stability among married and cohabiting couples. Results suggest that religious heterogamy is more common in cohabiting unions than marriages. Results also suggest that cohabiting unions are more likely to dissolve than marriages, and the risk of separation is higher for religiously heterogamous cohabiting unions (especially those in which one partner is religious and the other is not) than religiously heterogamous marriages. Finally, there is evidence showing that some religiously heterogamous cohabiting couples have a higher risk of relationship dissolution than religious heterogamous married couples due to lower relationship quality. Overall, this study extends the religion and family literature by showing that religious differences may lead to greater instability for cohabiting relationships than marriages.
D19|Mothers' Investments in Child Health in the U.S. and U.K.: A Comparative Lens on the Immigrant 'Paradox'|Research on the immigrant paradox healthier behaviors and outcomes among more socioeconomically disadvantaged immigrants is mostly limited to the U.S. Hispanic population and to the study of birth outcomes. Using data from the Fragile Families Study and the Millennium Cohort Study, we expand our understanding of this phenomenon in several ways. First, we examine whether the healthier behaviors of Hispanic immigrant mothers extend to other foreign-born groups, including non-Hispanic immigrant mothers in the U.S. and white, South Asian, black African and Caribbean, and other (largely East Asian) immigrants in the U.K, including higher SES groups. Second, we consider not only the size of the paradox at the time of the child's birth, but also the degree of its persistence into early childhood. Third, we examine whether nativity disparities are weaker in the U.K., where a much stronger welfare state makes health information and care more readily accessible. Finally, we examine whether differences in mothers' instrumental and social support both inside and out of the home can explain healthier behaviors among the foreign-born. The results suggest that healthier behaviors among immigrants are not limited to Hispanics or to low SES groups; that nativity differences are fairly persistent over time; that the immigrant advantage is equally strong in both countries; and that the composition and strength of mothers? support plays a trivial explanatory role in both countries. These findings lead us to speculate that what underlies nativity differences in mothers? health behaviors may be a strong parenting investment on the part of immigrants.
D19|Increasing Voter Turnout: Is Democracy Day the Answer?|It has often been argued that voter turnout in the United States is too low, particularly compared with turnout in other industrialized democracies, and that a healthy democracy should have higher turnout. One proposal that has been considered by Congress to increase voter turnout is the creation of Democracy Day, making Election Day a national holiday. In this study I evaluate the likely effectiveness of an election holiday in increasing turnout by studying how state regulations making election day a holiday for state employees affects voter turnout among state employees in those states. I exploit these natural experiments in a difference-in-difference context, using various groups of non-state employees as controls. My analysis relies on data from Voting Supplements to the Current Population Survey in November 2004 and 2006. The results are clear. There is no evidence from the natural experiment of states providing an election holiday for state employees that such holidays significantly increase voter turnout. I conclude that having an election holiday, by itself, is not an effective strategy to increase voter turnout.
D19|On Weak and Strong Population Momentum|This paper decomposes total population momentum into two constituent and multiplicative parts called weak momentum and strong momentum. Weak momentum depends on deviations between a population's observed age distribution and its implied stable age distribution. Strong momentum is a function of deviations between a population's implied stable and stationary age distributions. In general, the factorization of total momentum into the product of weak and strong momentum is a very good approximation. The factorization is exact, however, if the observed age distribution is stable or if initial fertility is already at replacement. We provide numerical illustrations by calculating weak, strong, and total momentum for 176 countries, the world, and its major regions. In short, the paper brings together disparate strands of the population momentum literature and shows how the various kinds of momentum fit together into a single unifying framework.
D19|Specialization in the Bargaining Family| We develop a two period family decision making model in which spouses bargain over their contributions to a family public good and the distribution of private consumption. In contrast to most models in the literature, specialization within the couple emerges endogenously from the production of the public good, and is not caused by exogenous differences between the spouses. Increasing marginal benefits of labour market experience make specialization efficient, even if both spouses have equal market and household productivities on the outset. If spouses are not able to enter into a binding contract governing the distribution of private consumption in the second period, the spouse specialized in market labour cannot commit to compensate the other spouse for foregone investments in earnings power. As a consequence, this spouse may withdraw part of his/her contribution and the provision level of the household good is likely to be inefficiently low.

D19|Modelling charitable donations to an unexpected natural disaster: Evidence from the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics|Using household-level data, we explore the relationship between donations to the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami disaster and other charitable donations. The empirical evidence suggests that donations specifically for the victims of the tsunami are positively associated with the amount previously donated to other charitable causes. This relationship exists when we decompose overall charitable donations into different types of philanthropy, with charitable contributions to caring and needy organisations having the largest positive association with donations to the victims of the tsunami. Furthermore, when we explore the impact of donations to the victims of the tsunami on future donations to charity, there is evidence of a positive relationship with the largest association with donations to caring and needy organisations. Hence, there is no evidence to suggest that unplanned spending on donations to an unforeseen natural disaster diverts future expenditure away from donations to other charitable causes.
D19|Exposure to foreign media and changes in cultural traits: Evidence from naming patterns in France|Free trade in audio-visual services has faced opposition on the grounds that foreign media undermine domestic culture, and ultimately, global diversity. Using a long panel of French birth registries, we assess the media-culture link using name frequencies as a measure of tastes. Controlling for the number of people who currently have a name and unobserved name effects, our regressions show that media influences choices via selective imitation. Parents are much more likely to adopt media names that they associate with youth. Using estimated parameters, we simulate our model of name choice to reveal that, absent foreign media, fewer than 5% of French babies would have been named differently. Our simulations also suggest a positive effect of foreign media on the welfare of parents.
D19|Adult height and childhood disease|Taller populations are generally richer populations, and taller individuals live longer and earn more, perhaps reflecting their superior cognitive abilities. Understanding the determinants of adult height has thus become a focus in understanding the relationship between health and wealth. We investigate the childhood determinants of adult height in populations, focusing on the respective roles of income and of disease. Across a range of European countries and the United States, we find a strong inverse relationship between postneonatal (one month to one year) mortality, interpreted as a measure of the disease and nutritional burden in childhood, and the mean height of those children as adults. In pooled birth-cohort data over 31 years for the United States and eleven European countries, postneonatal mortality in the year of birth accounts for more than 60 percent of the combined cross-country and cross-cohort variation in adult heights. The estimated effects are smaller but remain significant once we allow for country and birth-cohort effects. The decline in postneonatal mortality from 1950 to 1980 can account for almost all of the increase in adult height for those born in those years, and explains 20 to 30 percent of the 2 cm shortfall of 30 yearold Americans relative to 30-year old Swedes in 2000. Consistent with these findings, we develop a model of selection and stunting, in which the early life burden of nutrition and disease is not only responsible for mortality in childhood but also leaves a residue of long-term health risks for survivors, risks that express themselves in adult height, as well as in late-life disease. The model predicts that, at sufficiently high mortality levels, selection can dominate scarring, leaving a taller population of survivors. We find evidence of this effect in the poorest and highest mortality countries of the world, supplementing recent findings on the effects of the Great Chinese famine.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D19|Mobility and Housing Satisfaction: An Empirical Analysis for Twelve EU Countries| Using panel data for twelve EU countries, we analyze the relationship between selfreported housing satisfaction and residential mobility. Our results indicate the existence of a positive link between the two variables and that housing satisfaction exerts a mediating effect between residential characteristics and dwellers' mobility propensities. Some interesting cross-country differences regarding the effect of other variables on mobility are also observed. Our results can be used in defining, implementing and evaluating housing and neighbourhood policies. Residential satisfaction is put forward as one of the most appropriate indicators of the success or failure of such policies. Keywords: Housing satisfaction, residential mobility JEL classification: R21, D19
D19|Providing care for an elderly parent: interactions among siblings?| This article is focused on children providing and financing long-term care for their elderly parent. The aim of this work is to highlight the interactions that may take place among siblings when deciding whether or not to become a caregiver. We look at families with two children using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe; our sample contains 314 dependent elderly and their 628 adult children. In order to identify the interactions between siblings, we have specified a two-person discrete game model. To estimate this model, without invoking the 'coherency' condition, we have added an endogenous selection rule to solve the incompleteness problem arising from multiplicity or absence of equilibrium. Our empirical results suggest that the three classical effects identified by Manski could potentially explain the observed correlation between the siblings' caregiving behaviour. Correlated effects alone appear to be weak. Contextual interactions and endogenous interactions reveal cross-effects. The asymmetric character of the endogenous interactions is our most striking result. The younger child's involvement appears to increase the net benefit of caregiving for the elder one, whereas the elder child's involvement decreases the net benefit of caregiving for the younger child.

D19|Endogenous household interaction|Most econometric models of intrahousehold behavior assume that household decision making is efficient, i.e., utility realizations lie on the Pareto frontier. In this paper, we investigate this claim by adding a number of participation constraints to the household allocation problem. Short-run constraints ensure that each spouse obtains a utility level at least equal to what they would realize under (inefficient) Nash equilibrium. Long-run constraints ensure that each spouse obtains a utility level at least equal to what they would realize by cheating on the efficient allocation and receiving Nash equilibrium payoffs in all successive periods. Given household characteristics and the (common) discount factor of the spouses, not all households may be able to attain payoffs on the Pareto frontier. We estimate these models using a Method of Simulated Moments estimator and data from one wave of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We find that both short- and long-run constraints are binding for sizable proportions of households in the sample. We conclude that it is important to carefully model the constraint sets household members face when modeling household allocation decisions, and to allow for the possibility that efficient outcomes may not be implementable for some households.
D19|Clustering households by time use patterns ; an empirical investigation using the German Time Use Survey 2001/2002|Clustering individuals or households on the basis of socio-economic variables has become a widespread practice in German social research over the past few decades. This paper is part of a research project that explores results which may be obtained when time use patterns are chosen as the basis of numerical classification. Over the past few years, results relating to single households were published by the authors. The present paper extends the analysis to families. The investigation uses data from the German Time Use Survey 2001/2002. It is shown that the clustering process fulfils the criteria required by stochastic and qualitative social science. Furthermore, evidence is provided that including cluster memberships as dummy variables into a regressor set increases the predictive capabilities of a common multivariate analysis of correlations between socio-economic variables. Especially concerning health, meaningful interconnections between household styles and health state are detected.
D19|Detection Of Local Interactions From The Spatial Pattern Of Names In France|ABSTRACT Using data on the geographic distribution of names in France, we investigate the social transmission of parental preferences. Drawing on recent work on nonmarket interactions, we develop a linear discrete choice model that relates choices made in one location to those made in nearby areas. We explain the shares of parents that give their children Saint, Arabic, and American‐type names. We also examine the effect of distance between locations on differences in naming patterns. We find that the importance of geographic distance is declining over time while differences in class and national origins have increasing explanatory power.
D19|Impacto del programa familia guardabosques sobre la criminalidad|Existe una relación de doble causalidad entre el narcotráfico y la violencia en Colombia. Este trabajo propone un modelo teórico dinámico de portafolio sobre la actividad criminal, que explica la retroalimentación de los dos fenómenos a través de trampas de criminalidad, ocasionadas por bajos niveles de capital humano y capital social. Una política efectiva para abordar el problema debería lograr efectos tanto sobre el narcotráfico como sobre la violencia, para poder romper estas trampas. Diferentes evaluaciones económicas han aportado evidencia en favor de la eficiencia del desarrollo alternativo para disminuir la incidencia del narcotráfico. Este trabajo estudia el efecto que el programa de desarrollo alternativo Familias Guardabosques ha tenido sobre la violencia. Se encuentra que la vinculación al Programa Familias Guardabosques disminuye la tasa de homicidios por cada cien mil habitantes a nivel municipal en sus fases I y II, mientras que el efecto no es significativo en sus fases III y IV, cuando disminuye el incentivo económico entregado a las familias beneficiarias.
D19|Caracterización del ahorro de los hogares en Colombia|Este trabajo realiza un exhaustivo ejercicio descriptivo y analítico del ahorro de los hogares en Colombia. Con este fin, se construye la variable ahorro a partir de la Encuesta de Calidad de Vida de 1997 y 2003. El trabajo concluye que en Colombia la capacidad de ahorro se centra, casi exclusivamente, en los hogares con mayores ingresos. A su vez, estos son más afectados por la variabilidad del ingreso, y son los que intentan estabilizar el gasto. El resto de la población, en cambio, apenas sí registra variaciones en el ingreso, y son sus gastos los que presentan una variabilidad significativa. El estudio muestra también que la población que ahorra logra su tope cuando el jefe de hogar supera los cuarenta años. Este resultado es consistente tanto si se analiza a la población por cohortes como si se analiza la sección cruzada de la misma.
D19|Preferences for childcare policies: Theory and evidence|We analyse preferences for public, private or mixed provision of childcare theoretically and empirically. We model childcare as a publicly provided private good. Richer households should prefer private provision to either pure public or mixed provision. If public provision redistributes from rich to poor, the rich should favour mixed over pure public provision, but if public provision redistributes from poor to rich, the rich and poor might favour mixed provision while the middle class favour public provision ([`]ends against the middle'). Using estimates for household preferences from survey data, we find no support for the ends-against-the-middle result.
D19|Estimating the causal effect of fertility on economic wellbeing: data requirements, identifying assumptions and estimation methods|This article aims to answer to what extent fertility has a causal effect on households’ economic wellbeing—an issue that has received considerable interest in development studies and policy analysis. However, only recently has this literature begun to give importance to adequate modelling for estimation of causal effects. We discuss several strategies for causal inference, stressing that their validity must be judged on the assumptions we can plausibly formulate in a given application, which in turn depends on the richness of available data. We contrast methods relying on the unconfoundedness assumption, which include regressions and propensity score matching, with instrumental variable methods. This discussion has a general importance, representing a set of guidelines that are useful for choosing an appropriate strategy of analysis. The discussion is valid for both cross-sectional or panel data. Copyright Springer-Verlag 2013
D19|Unreported employment and tax evasion in mid-transition : comparing developments and causes in the Baltic States|This paper compares the prevalence and determinants of unreported employment in the three Baltic States in 1998 and 2002 using a hitherto little used dataset. The prevalence of unreported employment varies substantially across the three countries and across the two sampling years. Microeconometric estimations show that firm-related characteristics, such as sectoral activity, firm size and employment trends, are important determinants of unreported employment in all three countries, whereas the impact of individual factors varies across countries and time. It is shown that only 10ï¿½30 percent of the changes in unreported employment between 1998 and 2002 can be accounted for by changes in individual characteristics and firm-related factors. Provisional calculations suggest that the net gain for individuals undertaking unreported employment is modest, in particular among individuals who regularly engage in such activities
D19|Motives for parental money transfers in Europe|We find a high prevalence of Europeans giving equal financial transfers to their adult children, regardless of siblings’ income differences. This behaviour is sharply different from previously documented for American counterparts and it is not predicted by any conventional model on family transfers. We build a model to explain the motives for European parental transfers which includes concern with fairness and leaves altruism as an additional motive. We show that, in contrast to the prediction of the pure altruism model, parents do not offset income inequality among their children but decide to give equal transfers in order to be “fair”. However, the parents might start to give larger transfers to poorer children if the siblings’ income inequality becomes unbearable from the parent’s view. We find evidence for this behaviour using simulations for parameter’s distributions and also microeconomic data of 9 European countries from the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE).
D19|La pobreza en España en el período 1985-1995. Un análisis transversal y longitudinal|The objective of the article has consisted of a cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of the economic poverty state during the period 1985-1995, using the Panel Household Budget Survey for this period of time. The three aspects of poverty incidence, intensity and inequality in the left tail of the distribution, have been analysed in the cross-sectional approach. This analysis has been carried out through the calculations of poverty indices and the graphical representation of the TIPs curves. The longitudinal analysis, has focussed on the estimation of the risk function and the survival function, which allows us to know the duration in poverty, the transitions out of poverty and to identify those socio-economic and demographic characteristics of household with more influence in the duration of poverty El objetivo del trabajo consiste en un análisis transversal y longitudinal de la situación de pobreza económica experimentada por los hogares españoles en el período 1985-1995, utilizando para ello la Encuesta Continua de Presupuestos Familiares en dicho período. En el enfoque transversal se han analizado los tres aspectos de la pobreza: el aspecto absoluto, el relativo y la desigualdad en la cola inferior de la distribución. El análisis se ha llevado a cabo mediante la construcción de índices de pobreza y la representación gráfica de las curvas TIPs. El análisis longitudinal se ha basado en la estimación de las tasas de salida de la pobreza y la función de supervivencia, permitiendo conocer la duración en el estado de pobreza, las transiciones al estado de “no pobreza” e identificar aquellas características socioeconómicas y demográficas del hogar con mayor influencia en la duración de la pobreza
D19|Dimensions of Well-being and the Millennium Development Goals|Well-being and happiness, individually and collectively, is a main indicator of a good life. This paper attempts to implement empirically some of the multidimensional concepts of human well-being by using data from the ‘Pakistan Living Standards Measurement Survey’ 2006-07. Objective well-being index and subjective well-being index are constructed to study regional disparities in the quality of life. The results reveal that most of the top ranked districts are located in the province of Punjab which tends to indicate that Punjab is ahead of other provinces in terms of objective well-being. Sindh and NWFP districts are dominated in the category of lower medium well-being category. At the lower end of the distribution districts of Balochistan emerged in lowest category of well-being. It is observed that Punjab have highest share of population in top category of well-being while population of Balochistan gets major share in lowest category of wellbeing. It is important to note that those districts which have higher achievements in hard facts of well-being, acquire less subjective well-being in term of satisfaction. Districts of Balochistan, with least developed indicators, perception about the quality of life is evident in their lowest level of satisfaction. Since the underlying premise of the MDGs is still the concept of human development, so priorities is needed to concentrate on least developed districts for achieving the MDGs by 2015.

The main aims were to identify the structure of money attitudes, to identify the specific types of money attitudes, and to indicate its determinants in the scope of individual differences (i.e. temperament, personality and temporal orientation). The statistical analysis consisted on structural equation modelling and cluster analysis. First of all, original polish money attitudes scale was constructed and validated, its structure was tested in the group of n=1792. Then, four types of money attitudes were found. Finally, money attitudes are weakly influences by temperamental features (FCB-TI, n=612), moderately – by personality features (NEO-FFI; n=605). Temporal orientation has the strongest influence on money attitudes (AION-2000; n=722).
D19|Income, Health, and Well-Being around the World: Evidence from the Gallup World Poll|During 2006, the Gallup Organization conducted a World Poll that used an identical questionnaire for national samples of adults from 132 countries. I analyze the data on life satisfaction and on health satisfaction and look at their relationships with national income, age, and life-expectancy. The analysis confirms a number of earlier findings and also yields some new and different results. Average life satisfaction is strongly related to per capita national income. High-income countries have greater life-satisfaction than low-income countries. Each doubling of income is associated with almost a one-point increase in life satisfaction on a scale from 0 to 10 and, unlike most previous findings, the effect holds across the range of international incomes; if anything, it is slightly stronger among rich countries. Conditional on the level of national per capita income, the effects of economic growth on life satisfaction are negative, not positive as would be predicted by previous discussion and previous micro-based empirical evidence. Neither life satisfaction nor health satisfaction responds strongly to objective measures of health, such as life expectancy or the prevalence of HIV infection, so that neither provides a reliable indicator of population well-being over all domains, or even over health.
D19|Optimal Taxation According to Equality of Opportunity: a Microeconometric Simulation Analysis|The purpose of this paper is to introduce and adopt a generalised version of Roemer's (1998) Equality of Opportunity (EOp) framework for analysing optimal income taxation. EOp optimal tax rules seek to equalise income differentials arising from factors beyond the control of the individual. Unlike the pure EOp criterion of Roemer (1998) the generalised EOp criterion allows for alternative weighting profiles in the treatment of income differentials between and within types when types are defined by circumstances that are beyond people's control. An empirical microeconometric model of labour supply in Italy is used to simulate and identify optimal tax rules within classes of two- and three-parameter tax rules. A rather striking result of the analysis is that the optimal tax rule turns out to be the pure lump-sum tax, under Roemer's pure EOp criterion as well as under the generalised EOp criterion with moderate degrees of aversion to within-type inequality. A high degree of within-type inequality aversion instead produces EOp-optimal rules with positive marginal tax rates. When the EOp-version of the Gini welfare function is adopted as Eop criterion, the optimal tax rule turns out to be close to the actual 1993 Italian tax system, if not for the important difference of prescribing a universal lump-sum positive transfer of 3,500,000 ITL, which has no comparable counterpart in the actual system. On the other hand, when using the conventional equality of outcome (EO) criterion, the pure lump-sum tax always turns out to be optimal, at least with respect to the classes of two- and three-parameter rules. We also compute second-best solutions, namely we exclude lump-sum taxes. Overall, the results do not conform to the perhaps common expectation that the EO criterion is more supportive of “interventionist” (redistributive) policies than an EOp approach.

D19|Population Ageing, Taxation, pensions and Health Costs|This paper argues against the policy position that begins with a doomsday scenario of publicly provided health insurance and pension systems threatened with collapse under the stresses imposed by population ageing, and instead contends that the threat of crisis in these systems is policy driven. The central thesis of the paper is that a range of policies lead to the creation of an ageing crisis by inhibiting the efficient reallocation of female labour from the home to the market in response to the decline in fertility. The analysis focuses on family support policies that create large effective tax burdens on female labour supply, by means testing the support on family income, or selectively on the second income. Examples include Family Tax Benefit Part A and Part B, the Medicare Levy and the Medicare Safety Net. The analysis draws on household survey data to show that female labour supply is strongly positively associated with household saving, the purchase of private health insurance and spending on family health generally. Policies that inhibit female labour supply therefore have the effect of reducing the tax base for funding public pensions and health care, while simultaneously reducing the capacity of families to fund them privately.

D19|Culture as Learning: The Evolution of Female Labour Force Participation Over a Century|Married women's labour force participation has increased dramatically over the last century. Why this has occurred has been the subject of much debate. This paper investigates the role of culture as learning in this change. To do so, it develops a dynamic model of culture in which individuals hold heterogeneous beliefs regarding the relative long-run payoffs for women who work in the market versus the home. These beliefs evolve rationally via an intergenerational learning process. Women are assumed to learn about the long-term payoffs of working by observing (noisy) private and public signals. They then make a work decision. This process generically generates an S-shaped figure for female labour force participation, which is what is found in the data. The S shape results from the dynamics of learning. I calibrate the model to several key statistics and show that it does a good job in replicating the quantitative evolution of female LFP in the US over the last 120 years. The model highlights a new dynamic role for changes in wages via their effect on intergenerational learning. The calibration shows that this role was quantitatively important in several decades.
D19|Economic growth and endogenous intergenerational altruism|The recent literature on the endogenous formation of preferences has emphasized that while some preferences are more conducive to growth than others, economic growth also contributes to the formation of particular tastes (Becker, 1996). In this paper, we construct a neoclassical growth model where intergenerational altruism is endogenous and entails costly sacrifices on the part of parents to acquire such trait. While the acquisition of altruistic traits depends on the economic conditions, altruism determines the level of intergenerational bequests and ultimately the accumulation of physical capital and economic growth. We derive three main results from this general equilibrium framework. First, we show that individuals accumulate altruism in the long run whenever the ‘marginal degree of altruism’ is sufficiently high. Second, we find that the endogenous formation of altruism is more likely to occur at later stages of economic growth. Finally, we show that low interest rates are correlated with altruistic behavior; this is in contrast to previous research in a partial equilibrium framework (Mulligan, 1997).<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D19|Households’ saving mobility in Poland|In this paper we examine the mobility of Polish households with regard to saving rates during the years 2007-2010 and compare it with the households’ saving mobility during the years 1997-2000. The analysis for 2007-2010 is based on the household budget panel data from three panels of 15,000 Polish households selected by authors for the years 2007-2008, 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 from the Household Budget Surveys. We use the Markov mobility matrix and estimate the long-term ergodic distribution of households according to the saving rates. Our results show that the long-term households’ distribution reveals a tendency towards polarization of households with regard to saving rates. Comparing the results for 2007-2010 with the authors’ previous research on the households’ saving mobility for a decade earlier during 1997-2000, we prove that between the years 1997-2000 and 2007-2010 the long-term change in the distribution of households was asymmetrical toward the highest saving rate groups. This helps to explain why Polish households could maintain positive and rising savings during the highly uncertain period of the financial crisis in 2007-2010.
D19|Un análisis comparativo de la vivienda en Europa|The goal of this paper is to highlight the differences and similarities of the residential housing in the main countries of the EU. This analysis is approached from a comparative view and is divided into two parts. The first one shows the structure of the regime of possession in each country in different periods of time. While the second one uses a probit binomial model in order to characterise the residential housing in the property market against the renting market. This descriptive analysis shows a first approach to the compared situation of the housing tenure in Europe with the homogenized information of the European Community Household Panel.
D19|The division of parental transfers in Europe|In the extensively studied equal division puzzle, one finds very large shares of equal bequests and unequal inter-vivos transfers given to adult children. However, such puzzle is less evident in Europe as we find a higher prevalence of parents giving equal inter-vivos transfers. We argue that altruistic parents are also concerned with norms of equal division. Thus, parents do not fully offset child income inequality. The parents start to give larger transfers to poorer children if the child income inequality becomes unbearable from the parent’s view. We find econometric evidence for this behaviour using microeconomic data of 12 European countries from the two waves of the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE).

D19|Why Do Individuals Evade Payroll And Income Taxation In Estonia?|This paper employs micro-level data to determine the factors characterizing individuals who evade payroll and income taxation in Estonia. Using logit estimation on three different cross-sectional datasets, we estimate the marginal effects of different individual characteristics on tax evasion. The three datasets give broadly analogous results. Payroll and income tax evasion is most prevalent in small firms and in the construction and agricultural sectors. Evasion is more common among individuals who work part-time, are of non-Estonian ethnicity, have relatively short education, earn a low income and are men. Tax evasion is more frequent among the young and the elderly than among the middle-aged. There are clear regional differences. The overall picture is that the relatively disenfranchised are most likely to evade payroll and income taxation in Estonia.
D19|Individuals' Use of Care While Uninsured: Effects of Time Since Episode Inception and Episode Length|Few studies have addressed how use of care may vary over the course of an episode of being uninsured or across uninsured episodes of varying duration. This research models the probability that an uninsured individual has (a) any medical expenditures or charges, and (b) any office-based visit during each month of an uninsured episode. We find that the ultimate length of an individual's episode of being uninsured bears relatively little on individuals' use of healthcare in any particular month and that the probability of health care utilization rises during the first year of the episode, with more use in the second six months of the year compared to the first six months.
D19|The rationality and reliability of expectations reported by British households: micro evidence from the British household panel survey|This paper assesses the accuracy of individuals' expectations of their financial circumstances, as reported in the British Household Panel Survey, as predictors of outcomes and identifies what factors influence their reliability. As the data are qualitative bivariate ordered probit models, appropriately identified, are estimated to draw out the differential effect of information on expectations and realisations. Rationality is then tested and we seek to explain deviations of realisations from expectations at a micro-economic level, possibly with reference to macroeconomic shocks. A bivariate regime-switching ordered probit model, distinguishing between states of rationality and irrationality, is then estimated to identify whether individual characteristics affect the probability of an individual using some alternative model to rationality to form their expectations.
D19|A regional multiplier approach to estimating the impact of cash transfers: The case of cash aid in rural Malawi|This paper analyses the impact on the local economy of an emergency cash transfer programme in rural Malawi. The results are of interest given the growing use of cash transfers as development aid as well as the increasing popularity of such transfers as a form of social protection across Sub-Saharan Africa. Using a form of social accounting matrix, we find that there are widespread benefits for regional economy as a whole (with multiplier estimates of 2.02 to 2.45) and for certain groups in particular. Small farmers and small businesses gain particular advantage as this is where poorer households’ purchases are focused; education and health also benefit. Such payments can also help to support the regional economy during the most “lean” periods of the year.
D19|Remittances as insurance for idiosyncratic and covariate shocks in Malawi: The importance of distance and relationship|This paper uses Malawian panel data to show the importance of geography and family relationships when studying remittances. We do not test any hypothesis as such, but instead demonstrate the significance of the source of remittances in testing hypotheses. When remittances are viewed from an insurance perspective, geography matters. Covariate (community) shocks tend to be insured further from home than idiosyncratic ones. When viewed from a motivational perspective, family relationship and culture matter. Furthermore, gift exchange amongst unrelated households can be as important as remittance flows amongst members of the same family in insuring shocks. Inter-household remittances are closely linked to social networks, with business and religious groups being particularly important (perhaps due to trust). Remittance flows are often reciprocal – receiving households often being the main senders, emphasizing their insurance nature.

We found that farmers’ and spouses’ off-farm experience and wages are significant factors in explaining the off-farm labor supply decision. Contrary to expectations, farm income variability is not significant in the farmers’ and spouses’ decision to see off-farm work. The off-farm labor supply of farmers and their spouses is negatively correlated with income transfers from the government. It was also found that the spouse is a residual supplier of on-farm and off-farm labor.
