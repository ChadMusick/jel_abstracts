D57|Global Value Chains, Trade Shocks and Jobs: An Application to Brexit|We develop a network trade model with country-sector level input-output linkages. It includes (1) domestic and global value chain linkages between all country-sectors, (2) direct as well as indirect shipments (via other sectors and countries) to a final destination, (3) value added rather than gross trade flows. The model is solved analytically and we use the sectoral World Input Output Database (WIOD) to predict the impact of Brexit for every individual EU country by aggregating up the country-sector effects. In contrast to other studies, we find EU-27 job losses to be substantially higher than hitherto believed as a result of the closely integrated EU network structure. Upstream country-sectors stand to lose more from Brexit due to their network centrality in Europe.
D57|Cadena Productiva de Azúcar, Confitería y Chocolatería Estructura, Comercio Internacional y Protección|Utilizando el concepto de cadena productiva este documento propone una metodología para describir la evolución de las empresas industriales que producen Azúcar, Confitería y Chocolatería para el período 2002 – 2017. Utilizando la Matriz Insumo – Producto del Sector Industrial, el documento identifica los principales etapas y subprocesos que hacen parte del proceso productivo y presenta el flujograma de la cadena productiva. El documento presenta también un conjunto de indicadores que caracterizan la cadena productiva: número de empresas; distribución geográfica y por tamaño empresarial; valor de la producción; concentración geográfica de la producción; nivel de encadenamiento de los eslabones intermedios; exportaciones e importaciones; concentración de las exportaciones e importaciones por socio comercial y eslabones finales; creación y desviación de comercio derivada de los acuerdos comerciales firmados por Colombia; tasa de protección efectiva y nominal; y prospectiva de las exportaciones en mercados estratégicos.
D57|Actualización de la estimación de los indicadores “Razón Precio–Cuenta”|La estimación de las razones de precio – cuenta (RPC) permite valorar los insumos y productos de un proyecto de inversión en términos sociales, mediante la transformación de los flujos financieros en flujos económicos. En 1990 se calculó las RPC para Colombia por primera vez y desde entonces no se ha elaborado una actualización de dichos indicadores, por esto surge la necesidad de hacer este ejercicio con nuevas estimaciones que tengan en cuenta los nuevos datos de la economía del país. La actualización de las estimaciones de las RPC se enfocó en el marco de la matriz insumo – producto de 2014 y los resultados obtenidos evidenciaron una estructura de costos de los insumos sustancialmente diferente a la obtenida en las estimaciones de 1990.
D57|Estimación del precio – cuenta de la mano de obra|En el presente estudio se quiere hacer una actualización del cálculo del precio – cuenta de la mano de obra en Colombia. Para esto se hace una caracterización del mercado laboral, obteniendo las clases de mano de obra sobre las cuales hacer los cálculos, que son el sector calificado y no calificado urbano y el sector rural. Se encuentra que las distorsiones son bastantes importantes, y se reflejan, particularmente, en la mano de obra no calificad urbana y la del sector rural.
D57|Business Cycles and Production Networks|Where do business cycles originate? The traditional view is that a business cycle is the result of shocks correlated across sectors. This view is complemented by a recently emerging literature showing that idiosyncratic shocks to large or highly interconnected sectors contribute to aggregate variation. This paper addresses the relative empirical importance of these two channels of business cycle variation. Results indicate that up to one-third of the business cycle is driven by idiosyncratic productivity variation together with network amplifications.
D57|FIDELIO 3 manual: Equations and data sources|"FIDELIO (Fully Interregional Dynamic Econometric Long-term Input-Output) is a multi-sectoral model developed by the unit B.5 of the Directorate General Joint Research Centre (JRC) â€” the circular economy and industrial leadership unit. Compared to neoclassical CGE models â€” which assume that the perfect flexibility of prices and quantities ensures the full use of the factors of production at all times â€” FIDELIO integrates some new-Keynesian features: consumption adjusts slowly to its optimal level according to an error correction model and wages do not clear the labour market. The assumptions that prices do not clear the markets and market ""imperfections"" exist generate the dynamics of the model that is solved sequentially (recursive dynamic). In addition, FIDELIO is an econometric model since the calibration of most of the behavioural parameters of the model (dynamic adjustment lags of prices and quantities, and elasticities) is based on econometric estimations.This technical report illustrates the third version of the FIDELIO model, FIDELIO 3. The changes introduced in the subsequent versions of the model have two main objectives. The first one is to increase the coverage of the model. The second one is to improve the efficiency and the capacity of the model to evaluate sustainable production and consumption policies. The aim of this report is twofold. First, it contains all the equations of the current version of the model; second, it illustrates the characteristics of the data used by FIDELIO 3."
D57|Measuring bilateral trade in terms of value added|"The increase in the fragmentation of production across countries and the subsequent growth in the trade of intermediate products have raised concerns about the suitability of conventional trade statistics to understand the economic consequences of trade. Several authors have attempted to disentangle value added content of trade. This technical report proposes a novel framework that enables to: 1 fully decompose the factor content of bilateral trade measured at the border; and 2 account for the role of the different countries and industries participating in the global value chain. Furthermore, because of the country and industry detail of this approach, it able to provide a new extension of the standard value added to exports ratio, and also reconcile the ""sink-based"" and ""source-based"" methods commonly used to report the value added in trade."
D57|European NUTS 2 regions: construction of interregional trade-linked Supply and Use tables with consistent transport flows|Economic development is interregional in nature, with economic growth being determined by physical and technological proximity identified by interregional and national cross-border interactions in trade, investments, and knowledge. This report explains the construction of a system of multiregional input-output tables for the EU28 interlinked with trade in goods and services within the same country as well as with regions in other Member States. Taking transhipment locations into account, trade in goods and services is derived from freight transport data, airline data on flights, and business travel data. The methodology is centred on the probability of trade flows and was developed to fit the information available without pre-imposing any geographical structure on the data.
D57|“Who pollutes more? Gender differences in consumptions patterns”|Recent behavioral literature shows that we can identify differences between women and men in diverse domains in a general context, such as empathy, social preferences and reaction towards competitiveness, risk aversion, etc. Regarding the environment, recent studies propose that women have more knowledge and concern about the climate change than men. In this context, however, there is little evidence to what extend these behavioral differences between women and men have been translated into consumption actions more environmental friendly. Within this approach, this paper evaluates different environmental footprints of consumption patterns of women and men. As a case study, we examine Spain during the period 2008-2013. Using data from Spanish input-output tables, environmental air accounts, and household expenditure surveys for the same period, the study give evidence that gender differences take a relevant and significant position according to Weighted Least Square regression.
D57|Are global value chains truly global? a new perspective based on the measure of trade in value-added|Are global value chains (GVCs) truly global or are they more of a regional p henomenon? Opinions concerning this issue are widely divergent in the literature. This p aper provides new perspectives on GVCs using network analysis based on the concept of trade in value-added. By using a multiregional input-output model, we first show that GVC activities can be consistently identified at the country, sector, and bilateral levels according to the number of times that factor contents cross national borders in global p roduction sharing. This allows us to group trade-related, value-added creation activities into three networks, including traditional trade, simple GVC trade, and complex GVC trade networks. Further, we use network analysis tools based on the Asian Development Bank’s Multiregional Input-Output Tables covering 62 economies and 35 sectors between 2000 and 2017 to investigate changes in the topology and structure of different types of G VC networks. Our results show that the characteristics of GVCs largely depend on the viewpoint of the participating country (as a supplier or demander), the type of trade, and the aggregate level of trade in the corresponding networks.
D57|The role of ICT productivity in Korea-Japan multifactor CES productions and trades|In this paper, we examine the economic impact of information and communication technology (ICT) innovation, under the general equilibrium framework, with empirically estimated constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production frontiers. Innovation can generate not only productivity growth and price changes but also changes in the economic structure of production and trade patterns, eventually increasing social welfare. To study such impact of ICT innovation, we construct a bilateral general equilibrium model, spanning 350 commodities and sectors with trades between Japan and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). We estimate all CES parameters from published statistics such as the linked input–output tables and Comtrade databases. A small exogenous productivity shock in ICT is examined in terms of potential price reduction in all commodities in both countries.
D57|Pakistan Input-Output Table 2010-11|This paper develops Pakistan’s first Input-Output table (IOT) that follows the 2008 System of National Accounts. An IOT examines the structural changes in an economy. The present paper provides Pakistan’s IOT 2010-11 in an industry-by-industry format (42*42). The analysis of backward and forward linkages reveals that manufacturing of food products, beverages, textiles, electricity, gas, steam, air-conditioning and accommodation sectors have strong backward linkages while mining and quarrying, wood products, chemicals and chemical products, electricity, gas, steam, air-conditioning, warehousing and support activities for transportation sectors have strong forward linkages. For national economic growth to be sustainable, the government should facilitate economic activities in these sectors.
D57|Extraction-cum-substitution: A KISS approach to mapping the impacts of bilateral trade conflicts|This paper presents a simple yet powerful methodological tool for analysing the impact of a bilateral trade conflict on third countries when trade includes intermediate inputs. Mixing input-output modelling with recent development of trade in value-added analysis, the extraction-cum-substitution approach maps and measures the sectoral and global interactions in global value chains.It can also be used to generate “in silico” a large data set of numerical “observations” that can be further analysed using appropriate exploratory statistical techniques. The paper counts with three parts, besides introduction and conclusion. The first one is theoretical, starting with a formal model of inter-industry trade before describing the empirical application to input-output analysis. The second part is didactic, illustrating the method on a small six-countries/three-industries model.The third part applies the methodology to the bilateral trade conflict that arose between China and the USA in 2018. This section shows also how the method can also be used for generating analytical data and identify modes of insertion in the global economy. The program, written in open-source R language, is shown in annex.
D57|The Employment Effects of Technological Innovation, Consumption, and Participation in Global Value Chains: Evidence from Developing Asia|Global value chains (GVCs) have been a vehicle for job creation in developing Asia, but there is mounting concern that more sophisticated and cost-effective technology could displace workers through automation or reshoring of production. We use the demand-based input–output approach in Reijnders and de Vries (2018) to examine how employment responded to consumption, trade, and technological advances in 12 economies that accounted for 90% of employment in developing Asia during the period 2005–2015. Structural decomposition analysis based on the Asian Development Bank Multiregional Input–Output Tables combined with harmonized cross-country occupation data indicates that, other things being equal, technological change within GVCs was associated with a decrease in labor demand across all sectors, and an increase in the share of nonroutine cognitive occupations. We also find that increased domestic consumption expenditures of goods and services generated an increase in labor demand large enough to offset the negative employment impact of technological change. Finally, we do not find evidence of major shifts in occupational labor demand due to reshoring.
D57|The Evolution of Import Content of Production and Exports in Turkey: 2002-2017|This study explores the evolution of the import content of production and exports in Turkey for the 2002-2017 period. Using 2002 and 2012 input-output tables, we estimate the production and imported input use for the remaining years based on a large data set of production and foreign trade for 20 selected sectors, mostly from the manufacturing industry. Import requirement ratios, comprising both direct and indirect linkages, for each sector are calculated using the Leontief inverse matrix. Our findings indicate that import dependency increases for exports, but stays roughly the same for production over time. In general, the import content of production is below the import content of exports. This divergence can mainly be attributed to the services sector, which has relatively low import dependency, yet a significant share in production. Sectors with the highest import requirements are found to be those with higher capital and technology intensity such as coke and refined petroleum products, basic metals and motor vehicles. Agriculture, forestry, and fishery; service and mining sectors are found to have the lowest import requirements.
D57|Chinese competition and network effects on the extensive margin|I construct a network of input-output linkages in Chilean manufacturing and show that a negative demand shock has an impact on the number of firms producing in sectors that supply the sectors affected by the shock. Approximately one-third of the effect of increased Chinese competition on the extensive margin can be attributed to these network effects. The observed effect is a combination of multiproduct firms dropping varieties and firms leaving the market. I also study whether there is evidence of 'cascading failures' that could amplify the impact of idiosyncratic shocks. I find no evidence of these 'cascading effects'.
D57|Topology and formation of production input interlinkages: Evidence from Japanese microdata|Recent studies emphasize the role of the network structure of production input interlinkages for a wide range of economic outcomes including shock propagation and the emergence of aggregate fluctuations. In most of these studies the input-output architecture is fixed and exogenously given and relatively little work has considered its evolution and the underlying mechanism of network formation. Here we provide evidence on the evolution of production input interlinkages on the most granular level of economic activity, building on a diverse set of more than 80,000 companies sampled across nearly all industries of the Japanese economy. We review the main empirical properties of the Japanese production network level and find that these features are remarkably stable over time. To estimate the mechanism of supplier selection inducing this stability, we employ a stochastic actor-oriented model that sidesteps the econometric problem of mutual dependencies inherent to networked environments. Building on this approach, we find that topological features of the network such as the geodesic distance between the firms and their current number of relationships are a main driver of network dynamics in subsequent periods, and are quantitatively more important than selection based on productivity.
D57|Potential international employment effects of a hard Brexit|We use the World Input Output Database (WIOD) to estimate the potential employment effects of a hard Brexit in 43 countries. In line with other studies we assume that imports from the European Union (EU) to the UK will decline by 25% after a hard Brexit. The absolute effects are largest in big EU countries which have close trade relationships with the UK like Germany and France. However, there are also large countries outside the EU which are heavily affected via global value chains like China, for example. The relative effects (in percent of total employment) are largest in Malta and Ireland. UK employment will also be affected via intermediate input production. Within Germany, the motor vehicle industry and in particular the 'Autostadt' Wolfsburg are most affected.
D57|Productivity Effects Of Internationalisation Through The Domestic Supply Chain: Evidence From Europe|This paper analyses whether indirect effects of internationalisation occur through the domestic supply chain. We investigate productivity effects for a given firm resulting from the import or export of intermediate inputs by domestic upstream and downstream industries. Using a rich sample of manufacturing firms in 19 EU countries, we find evidence that domestic access to intermediate inputs that are also destined to foreign countries is associated with higher levels of revenue productivity. Further, our results highlight two common, but important, misspecification biases: ignoring the dynamic nature of productivity and estimating a value-added instead of a gross-output production function.
D57|From Productivity Shifts to Economic Growth: Intersectoral Linkage as an Amplifying Factor|This paper documents the presence of a positive link between the intensity of using intermediates by a country’s industries and its economic growth. We explain the finding by advancing a framework of endogenous growth in an economy with interconnected industries, whereby sectoral productivity growth is amplified by the interconnection, and the degree of amplification grows in the strength of sectoral connections. We use the framework to derive the optimal growth-enhancing structure of an economy, which is when all industries source their intermediates from a single sector (the star network) characterised by the largest concentration potential – a novel indicator which captures how fast is a sector’s productivity growth and how much it itself relies on intermediates.
D57|Financial dependence and growth: The role of input-output linkages|We widen the understanding of the finance-growth nexus by accounting for the indirect effect of financial development through input-output (IO) linkages in determining the growth of industries across countries. If financial development is expected to promote disproportionately more the growth of industrial sectors that are more in need of external finance, it also favours more the industries that are linked by IO relations to more financially dependent industries. We explore this new channel in a sample of countries at different development stages over the period 1995–2007. Our results highlight that financial development, besides easing the growth of industries highly dependent on external finance, also fosters the growth of industries strongly linked to highly financially dependent upstream industries. Moreover, the indirect effect - propagated through IO linkages - of finance has a higher and non-negligible role compared to the direct effect and its omission leads to a biased and underestimated perception of the role of finance for industries’ growth.
D57|The Economic Consequences of Migration: An Input-Output Approach|The main purpose of this paper is to contribute for a better understanding of the economic consequences of migration. In a first step, the different consumption patterns of nationals and foreigners are measured, using data from a Family Income and Expenditure Survey in Portugal (Inquérito às Despesas das Famílias, 2010/2011). Households are grouped according to the proportion of foreigners and the consumption structures of these groups are determined and compared. This information is useful in assessing the differences in living conditions across national and migrant families. In a second step, the sectoral and macroeconomic impacts (in Gross Output, Value Added, GDP and Imports) of these different consumption structures are simulated, using an Input-Output approach. These results allow us to project the demand led effects of a growing in-migration flow to Portugal, (both of workers and retirees) expected for the coming years. In a third (future) step of this research project, other consequences of migration will also be studied, namely, supply side effects (labor force, wages and profits, productivity), government budget and social security income and expenditure effects, demographic trend effects, etc.
D57|Estimation of NUTS2 Interregional Input-Output Systems for Greece, 2010 and 2013|The aim of this paper is to describe in details the process of estimation of two interregional input-output systems for Greece, for the years 2010 and 2013. Further understanding of the changing structure of the Greek regional economies during the crisis, within an integrated interregional system, is one of the main goals of a broader project underway at the University of SÃ£o Paulo Regional and Urban Economics Lab (NEREUS). With this paper, we make available not only the details of the methodological procedures adopted to generate the interregional systems, but also the database itself to be used by other researchers and practitioners.
D57|Water Content in Trade: A Regional Analysis for Morocco|This paper reports the results of an application using an interregional input-output matrix for Morocco together with regional information on water consumption by sectors. We develop a trade-based index that reveals the relative water use intensities associated with specific interregional and international trade flows. We estimate, for each flow associated with each origin-destination pair, measures of trade in value added and trade in water that are further used to calculate our index. We add to the existing literature on virtual water flows by encompassing the subnational perspective in the case study of a country that shows a “climate divide”: while a great part of the southern territory is located in the Sahara Desert, with serious water constraints, the northern part is relatively more privileged with access to this natural resource. Furthermore, we compare that Trade-Based Index of Water Intensity to similar metrics related to the use of other natural resources.
D57|Job creation and economic impact of renewable energy in Netherlands|This study evaluates the economic impact of a shift towards renewable electricity mix in the Netherlands using the neo-Keynesian CGEM ThreeME (Multi-sector Macroeconomic Model for the Evaluation of Environmental and Energy policy). This scenario has been inspired by the Urgenda's report ‘Energy 100% Sustainable in the Netherlands by 2030’, which have been quantified using the Energy Transition Model (ETM) developed by Quintel. Using the output of the ETM regarding the change in the electricity generation shares as input in ThreeME, we derive the impact in terms of key economic variables (GDP, employment, investment, value-added, prices, trade, tax revenue, etc.). We find that transition to renewable energy may have a positive impact on the Dutch economy, creating almost 50 000 new jobs by 2030 and adding almost 1% of gross domestic product
D57|What is the potential of natural resource based industrialisation in Latin America? An Input-Output analysis of the extractive sectors|Several case studies have analysed the potential of natural resource (NR) based industrialisation, a process based on diversification towards high value-added products, in the Latin American region. However, there is limited evidence on how the development of productive linkages - a key aspect of this strategy - behave at the country level. Based on input-output analysis, this paper provides a clearer picture of the extent and evolution of productive linkages of NR sectors across a sample of middle- and high-income countries in Latin America as well as in other developing and developed regions. The paper focuses on the degree to which extractive industries, i.e. oil, gas, and mining, are connected to the rest of the economy by studying both backward and forward linkages using OECD IO data. It also makes a distinction between local and foreign inputs to account for the level of integration that these sectors have into global value chains and/or import dependence. Furthermore, it tries to identify whether the importance of the extractive sectors in exports and total economic output is related to the level of intersectoral linkages. We find that in most countries intersectoral linkages have become smaller despite the expansion of the extractive sector suggesting a higher level of enclaveness as predicted by the resource curse literature.
D57|A Study on Taiwan s Food Dollar Series| Abstract For understanding the distribution of food dollar which we pay for our expenditure and how much Taiwanese farmers will earn from food dollar in the value added agriculture of Taiwan, this paper examines, with a filter of U.S. ERS food dollar series, Taiwan s food dollar series, including marketing bill series, industry group series, and primary factor series using Input-Output accounts of Taiwan. For sustainable development in Taiwan, it is better to transform from traditional agriculture to value-added agriculture. Since enhancing the competitiveness of agriculture and pursuing inclusive growth, it would be necessary to pay attention to farmers value and consider both farmers and agricultural supply chain to implement the effective and comprehensive agricultural policy.

D57|Labour values and energy values|In the history of economic thought various thinkers have been attracted by the problematic idea of a single cause of economic value. Today such ideas appear mostly in studies on the labour theory of value of Karl Marx. In 1867 his “Das Kapital” tried to explain the values of all commodities by a special common substance, the quantity of abstract labour embodied in them, i.e., the direct and indirect labour time necessary to produce them. Several well-known mainstream economists (for example, Wicksteed, Böhm-Bawerk, Wicksell and Pareto) quickly pointed out that labour was not the only common substance in commodities. Another problem was Marx’s deficient mathematics. In Marx’s system the same commodities can appear on the side of the inputs and on the side of the outputs. Today it is well-known that many analytical problems in such circular systems can be solved by means of simultaneous equations of the input-output type. Here the most original contributions were not made by leading economists mentioned above, but by rather unknown outsiders (Mühlpfordt, Dmitriev, Charasoff, Potron), whose pioneering works were neglected for decades. In December 1927, both Sraffa and Leontief, independently of each other, argued that the reduction of all commodities to labour values was not a unique process; from a formal point of view, it was possible to compute not only labour values, but also wheat values, coal values, etc. For various reasons, their insights of 1927 remained rather unnoticed for several decades. A few decades ago the high impact journal Science published some papers advocating the use of energy values, corresponding to the direct and indirect quantity of energy necessary to produce a commodity. The most conspicuous text of this type is the often cited paper “Embodied Energy and Economic Valuation” by Robert Costanza (published in Science in 1980), claiming that both theory and empiry suggest a close connection between prices and energy values. The energy theory of value is usually discussed outside the networks of orthodox or marxian economics, but the empirical and theoretical studies on energy values and labour values show several remarkable cases of analogous arguments and imperfections, both trying to support the use of a single substance of economic value. My paper considers both theoretical and empirical aspects of such discussions on labour values and energy values. I also use a simple numerical example, to illustrate the computation of both labour values and energy values via two methods: via a system of simultaneous input-output equations and via subsystems (vertically integrated systems that produce only one net output). The two computation methods are well-known from the rich literature on labour values, but comparing energy values and labour values forces me to a generalisation of the notion of a subsystem: in order to define this notion unambiguously, I need to specify not only the net output of the subsystem, but also its net input. If the only net input of the subsystem is energy, I use the expression “energy subsystem”. This concept is needed to establish a percentage formula for the deviation of prices from energy values, analogous to my formula for the deviation of prices from labour values. By generalising Sraffa’s notion of subsystems it is possible to explain why supporters of labour values and energy values both present misleadingly “good” empirical results for their favourite theory. Both groups should be more aware of the non-uniqueness of their exaggerated claims for their one sided theories of value.
D57|An Armington–Leontief model|Abstract We develop a novel linear equilibrium model with an Armington flavor. We provide (1) proof of the solvability of the model and of the existence and non-negativity of the equilibrium solution and of the newly derived multiplier matrix; we also show (2) that the standard Leontief multiplier matrix arises as a special case of this new model and (3) that this model allows the computation of multiplier effects with no external output bias, which is particularly relevant for applied economic analysis.
D57|What place does Luxembourg hold in global value chains?|The paper analyses the place held by Luxembourg in global value chains (GVC) by relying on trade in value added data retrieved from OECD inter-country input-output tables, available over the period 1995-2011. The analysis is multifaceted as the role of Luxembourg in GVC is analyzed across 50advanced and emerging market economies, at the country level, at the sector level and over time. Results show that Luxembourg acts as an important chain-link in GVC as evidenced by its strong upstream and downstream interconnections with other partner countries. Luxembourg is primarily a buyer of foreign value added and less a seller of domestic value added. The major part of Luxembourg’s GVC trading partners is located in Western Europe suggesting that the supply chain network is not global for Luxembourg but rather regional. Notwithstanding this, the share of East Asian and Eastern European emerging countries - albeit relatively low compared to advanced economies - is increasing over the period of analysis. A similar observation prevails for the geographical breakdown of the origin (destination) of foreign (domestic) value added for domestic (foreign) final demand at the end of the value chain. The analysis unveils that Luxembourg possesses a comparative advantage in GVC in the finance and insurance industry. It is from the latter sector that the country retrieves the most important share of valueadded from GVC participation.
D57|EU-UK global value chain trade and the indirect costs of Brexit|Production networks in the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) are highly integrated and Brexit poses a threat to supply and demand linkages across the Channel. In a world of Global Value Chains (GVCs), tariffs might be more harmful than in a world where trade is purely direct. In this paper we highlight the features of GVC-trade between the EU and the UK, disentangling the complex network of bilateral EU-UK value-added flows. Assuming that following Brexit the UK adopts the same Most-Favoured-Nation tariff schedule as the EU, we compute the direct and indirect costs of these tariffs, taking into account the EU-UK GVC-trade patterns. Tariffs would add almost 1 percentage point to the cost of manufacturing inputs in the UK, while the corresponding input cost in the EU would be only marginally affected, despite some heterogeneity at the country-level.
D57|Decomposition of wage inequalities: an input-output approach|Income and wealth inequalities, both between and within the advanced and developing countries,haveattracted much attention in current economic debates. Wage inequalities appear to play akeyrole in the generation of final inequalities in terms of households’ income, consumptionand wealth. In this paper, we propose a decomposition approach based on the input-output analysis that allows us to disentangle the effects on the final inequalities’levels into the contributions of various determinants. So far, the analysis of income and wealth inequalities measured by standard inequality indices, e.g. Gini coefficient, Theil index, has received limited space in the input-output analysis. This does not imply thatissuesof income and wealth inequalities havebeen ignored in this stream of research. The focus of the input-output research has however been directed into distinct aspectsof inequalities. In one way, researchers have put a lot of effort in the understanding how the income and wealthinequalities influence the structure of final demand of households,and eventuallygenerate ambivalent effects on production, value added and employment. Other stream of research in input-output analysis has paid a lot of attention to inequalities that arise from the distribution of income that goes to labour andcapital. We propose to calculate cross-industry and cross-country wage inequalities directly from the input-output tablesandanalyse the final inequality variations through the lens of changes in the inputs. Detailed industry-level data on employees’ wages linked to their hours worked and education attainments, which are covered bythe World input-output database, allow us to illustrate the application of proposed methodology on major advanced and developing countries in the world. The analysis contributes to solving the puzzle around the impactsof human capital and technological progress on income inequality but may shed also more light on the rising global inequalities unfolded by international trade and fragmentation of global value chains.
D57|Great Volatility and Great Moderation|We investigate the sources of the great changes in GDP volatility observed from 1966 to 2000. We develop a general equilibrium model and calibrate it to US data in order to characterize the contribution of micro level productivity shocks, inter-sectoral linkages and households' behavior to aggregate volatility. Our results show that changes in sectoral volatility played an important role in shaping volatility at the aggregate level. Moreover, asymmetries in the economic structure sometimes had an amplifying, and other times a dampening effect on aggregate volatility. We show that the different impact depends on the time-varying correlation between sectoral volatilities and the relative importance of specific sectors in the economy.

D57|Endogenous Growth in Production Networks|We investigate the interplay between technological change and macroeconomic dynamics in an agent-based model of the formation of production networks. On the one hand, production networks form the structure that determines economic dynamics in the short run. On the other hand, their evolution reflects the long-term impacts of competition and innovation on the economy. We account for process innovation via increasing variety in the input mix and hence increasing connectivity in the network. In turn, product innovation induces a direct growth of the firm's productivity and the potential destruction of links. The interplay between both processes generate complex technological dynamics in which phases of process and product innovation successively dominate. The model reproduces a wealth of stylized facts about industrial dynamics and technological progress, in particular the persistence of heterogeneity among firms and Wright's law for the growth of productivity within a technological paradigm. We illustrate the potential of the model for the analysis of industrial policy via a preliminary set of policy experiments in which we investigate the impact on innovators' success of feed-in tariffs and of priority market access.
D57|The Measurement of Labour Content: A General Approach|This paper analyses the theoretical issues related to the measurement of labour content in the context of general technologies with heterogeneous labour. A novel axiomatic framework is used in order to formulate the key properties of the notion of labour content and analyse its theoretical foundations. Then, a simple measure of labour content is uniquely characterised, which is consistent with common practice in input-output analysis and with a number of recent approaches in value theory.
D57|The network of inter-industry flows in a SAM framework|The networks of nominal flows between industries in a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) framework are studied. The flows of the SAM submatrices of production (or output of goods and services) and intermediate consumption, are identified, which are constructed from the supply and use tables of the National Accounts. From these flows, the inter-industry networks are induced. The structure of these networks are analysed, as well as, the underlying generation of income. An application to Portugal illustrates the approach.
D57|Multi-sectoral value chain in a bilateral general equilibrium|The information and communication technology (ICT) is a key engine of economic growth. In this paper, we examine the impact of ICT innovation using a multifactor constant elasticity of substitution (CES) general equilibrium model. Innovation not only leads to productivity growth and thus influence prices, it also changes output and trade patterns, and welfare. To examine trade values, we construct a bilateral multifactor CES general equilibrium model between Japan and the Republic of Korea using linked input–output tables. We estimate elasticities of substitution and productivity growths of the ICT sectors, to assess the effects of ICT improvement on the two countries.
D57|A global multi-sectoral model in local currencies|Economic agents make their decisions by focusing on the economic performance of their economies in their currencies rather than in a foreign currency. This shows that a multi-country economic model in local currencies is suitable to analyze global economic issues. However, international input-output tables are denominated in a specific currency such as the US dollar. Employing the OECD Intercountry Input-Output Tables, this paper presents a method to convert the international input-output tables in U.S. dollars and current prices to those in local currencies and constant prices. In addition, the structure of a global model with economies of scale and imperfect competition is illustrated. A numerical example is also demonstrated in order to show the applicability of the model.
D57|Producer Price Inflation Connectedness and Input-Output Networks|We analyze the transmission of producer price in inflation shocks across the U.S. manufacturing industries from 1947 to 2018 using the Diebold-Yilmaz Connectedness Index framework, which fully utilizes the information in generalized variance decompositions from vector autoregressions. The results show that the system-wide connectedness of the input-output network Granger-causes the producer price inflation connectedness across industries. The input-output network and the inflation connectedness nexus is stronger during periods of major supply-side shocks, such as the global oil and metal price hikes, and weaker during periods of aggregate demand shocks, such as the Volcker disinflation of 1981-84 and the Great Recession of 2008. These findings are consistent with Acemoglu et al. (2016)'s conjecture that supply shocks are transmitted downstream, whereas demand shocks are transmitted upstream. Finally, preliminary results show that Trump tariffs caused an increase in the system-wide inflation connectedness in the first half of 2018, due to shocks mostly transmitted from tariff-targeted industries, namely, basic metals, fabricated metals and machinery.
D57|Global Value Chains and Vertical Specialization: The case of Portuguese Textiles and Shoes exports|This paper evaluates the growing participation of the Portuguese economy, and especially of the textiles, leather, and shoes industry, in the so-called Global Value Chains (GVCs).We use the 2016 edition of the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) to empirical assess the changes in the geography of imports and exports of the Portuguese textiles, leather and shoes industry as well as quantify the growing vertical specialization in this sector. We also measure value added, import and employment coefficients for the Portuguese economy and the Portuguese textiles, leather, and shoes sector. The results show that Portuguese textiles, leather, and shoes trade have been more concentrated in Spain, Italy, India and China and less concentrated in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. This sector is more relevant in the Portuguese economy than in any other Eurozone economy in terms of output, employment and value-added, and it has been recovering its relevance in the Portuguese economy since 2009.Textiles, leather, and shoes is the manufacturing industry with the higher potential to generate new jobs in Portugal. Despite the negative contribution of the financial crisis, vertical specialization of Portuguese textiles, leather, and shoes exports have been increasing ever since.
D57|The Role of Exporters and Domestic Producers in GVCs: Evidence for Belgium based on Extended National Supply-and-Use Tables Integrated into a Global Multiregional Input-Output Table|For a finer analysis of global value chain integration and competitiveness, we develop and apply a method for a micro-data based breakdown of manufacturing industries in the 2010 Belgian supply-and-use tables into export-oriented and domestic market firms. The former are defined as those firms that export at least 25% of their turnover. We then derive export-heterogeneous national input-output tables which we integrate into a global table. Our analyses reveal that: a) export-oriented manufacturers have lower value-added in output shares and import proportionally more of the intermediates they use; b) exports of export-oriented manufacturers generate substantial value added in other Belgian firms, in particular providers of services; c) Belgium’s backward participation in global value chains is mainly due to export-oriented manufacturers and its forward participation is due to other firms, d) export-oriented manufacturers participate in value chains that comprise, on average, a greater number of upstream and downstream production stages and of which a greater share is located abroad.
D57|Accounting for Firm Heterogeneity within U.S. Industries: Extended Supply-Use Tables and Trade in Value Added using Enterprise and Establishment Level Data|This paper presents experimental tables created by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis comparing industry-specific shares of the components of total output of globally engaged firms located in the United States that are part of a multinational enterprise with those of firms that are part of an enterprise entirely located in the United States. Recent research has shown both the importance of accounting for trade in value added when estimating bilateral trade flows and that multinational enterprises located in the United States account for the lion’s share of U.S. trade in goods and services. However, trade in value added is typically accounted for using input-output tables that are aggregated across all types of firms. The experimental tables are consistent with other research showing that value added as a share of output is lower for foreign-owned firms compared with domestic-owned firms and that exports and imports as a share of output is larger for foreign-owned firms. We also find heterogeneity in the composition of output among different types of domestic-owned firms. Future work will analyze this heterogeneity in more detail using establishment-level data on production and trade.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
D57|The Persistent Statistical Structure of the US Input-Output Coefficient Matrices: 1963-2007|The paper finds evidence for the existence of a statistical structure in the US input-output (I-O) coefficient matrices A = f{aij} for 1963-2007. For various aspects of matrices A we find smooth and unimodal empirical frequency distributions (EFD) with a remarkable stability in their functional form for most of the samples. The EFD of all entries, diagonal entries, row sums, and the (left and right) Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors are well described by fat-tailed distributions while the EFD of column sums and eigenvalue moduli are well explained by the normal distribution and the Beta distribution, respectively. The paper provides several economic interpretations of these statistical results based on the recent developments in the I-O analysis and the price of production literature. Our findings question some probabilistic assumptions conventionally adopted in the stochastic I-O analysis literature and call for a statistical approach to the discussion of the structure of I-O matrices.
D57|Eigenvalue distribution, matrix size and the linearity of wage-profit curves|Brody (1997), while experimenting with random matrices, conjectured that the relative size of the second eigenvalue with respect to the first tended to fall as a random matrix got larger. Bidard and Schatteman (2001) proved that in a random matrix with independently and identically distributed entries the speed of convergence increases with the size of the matrix because the relative size of all subdominant eigenvalues tends to zero as the matrix size approaches infinity. Schefold (2010) then showed that zero subdominant eigenvalues imply linear wage-profit curves for any given numeraire. Our concern is with actual input-output matrices. We successively aggregate the US 2002 matrix from 403 to 10 industries and observe the distribution of the moduli of eigenvalues at each level of aggregation. The random matrix hypothesis predicts that both the size of ratio of the modulus of second eigenvalue to the first and the average size of all moduli will fall toward zero as matrix size increases. At an empirical level, we find that the eigenvalue ratio rises while the average size of eigenvalue moduli falls towards a positive constant. These findings do not support the applicability of Brody’s conjecture for real input-output tables, and by implication do not support the hypothesis that wage-profit curves will become strictly linear in the limit. It is still possible to reconcile our findings with empirically observed near-linear wage-profit curves.
D57|Water Content in Trade: A Regional Analysis for Morocco|This paper reports the results of an application using an interregional input-output matrix for Morocco together with regional information on water consumption by sectors. We develop a trade-based index that reveals the relative water use intensities associated with specific interregional and international trade flows. We estimate, for each flow associated with each origin-destination pair, measures of trade in value added and trade in water that are further used to calculate our index. We add to the existing literature on virtual water flows by encompassing the subnational perspective in the case study of a country that shows a â€œclimate divideâ€ : while a great part of the southern territory is located in the Sahara Desert, with serious water constraints, the northern part is relatively more privileged with access to this natural resource. Furthermore, we compare that Trade-Based Index of Water Intensity to similar metrics related to the use of other natural resources.
D57|Less Is More: Capital Theory And Almost Irregular-Uncontrollable Actual Economies|Capital theory and the price effects consequent upon changes in the distributive variables hold center stage when it comes to the internal consistency of both classical and neoclassical theories of value. This paper briefly reviews the literature and then focuses on the detected skew eigenvalue distribution of the vertically integrated technical coefficients matrices of actual economies. The findings prompt the use of the Schur triangularization theorem for the construction even of a single industry from the input–output structure of the entire economy. Such a hyper-basic industry, in combination with hyper-non-basic industries, embodies properties that may capture the behavior of the entire economic system. Thus, we can derive some meaningful results consistent with the available empirical evidence, which finally suggest that actual economies tend to respond as ‘irregular-uncontrollable’ systems.
D57|Ricardo’s Theory of Value is Still Alive and Well in Contemporary Capitalism|The purpose of this article is, on the one hand, to shed light on some significant aspects of Ricardo's theory of value and on the other hand to show that Ricardo's insights about the explanatory power of the relative labour times on the movement of relative prices were in the right direction. For this purpose, Ricardo's theory of value is cast rigorously and in modern terms such that by using detailed intertemporal data from input-output tables of two major economies to show that Ricardo's insights are absolutely consistent with the facts.
D57|What Place does Luxembourg hold in Global Value Chains?|The paper analyses the place held by Luxembourg in global value chains (GVC) by relying on trade in value added data retrieved from OECD inter-country input-output tables, available over the period 1995-2011. The analysis is multifaceted as the role of Luxembourg in GVC is analyzed across 50 advanced and emerging market economies, at the country level, at the sector level and over time. Results show that Luxembourg acts as an important chain-link in GVC as evidenced by its strong upstream and downstream interconnections with other partner countries. Luxembourg is primarily a buyer of foreign value added and less a seller of domestic value added. The major part of Luxembourg’s GVC trading partners is located in Western Europe suggesting that the supply chain network is not global for Luxembourg but rather regional. Notwithstanding this, the share of East Asian and Eastern European emerging countries - albeit relatively low compared to advanced economies - is increasing over the period of analysis. A similar observation prevails for the geographical breakdown of the origin (destination) of foreign (domestic) value added for domestic (foreign) final demand at the end of the value chain. The analysis unveils that Luxembourg possesses a comparative advantage in GVC in the finance and insurance industry. It is from the latter sector that the country retrieves the most important share of value added from GVC participation.
D57|Dissecting the Input-Output Structure of the Greek Economy|Using input-output table data and a system of basic and derivative indices, the analysis in this paper provides a dissection of the Greek economy for the years 2005 and 2010. The findings suggest that: (i) the structural features of the economy have been shaped well before the emergence of the so-called Greek (or PIIGS) crisis; (ii) a well-targeted effective demand management policy could be mainly based on the service and primary production sectors; and (iii) industrial policy would be necessary and could primarily focus on nine highly import-dependent commodities of the industry sector. Therefore, it seems that a change in the intersectoral structure of the Greek economy is necessary.
D57|Productivity and Misallocation in General Equilibrium|We provide a general non-parametric formula for aggregating microeconomic shocks in general equilibrium economies with distortions such as taxes, markups, frictions to resource reallocation, and nominal rigidities. We show that the macroeconomic impact of a shock can be boiled down into two components: its “pure” technology effect; and its effect on allocative efficiency arising from the associated reallocation of resources, which can be measured via changes in factor income shares. We also derive a formula showing how these two components are determined by structural microeconomic parameters such as elasticities of substitution, returns to scale, factor mobility, and network linkages. Overall, our results generalize those of Solow (1957) and Hulten (1978) to economies with distortions. To demonstrate their empirical relevance, we pursue different applications, focusing on markup distortions. For example, we operationalize our non-parametric results and show that improvements in allocative efficiency account for about 50% of measured TFP growth over the period 1997-2015. We also implement our structural results and conclude that eliminating markups would raise TFP by about 40%, increasing the economywide cost of monopoly distortions by two orders of magnitude compared to the famous 0.1% estimates of Harberger (1954).
D57|Value Chains: Production Upstreamness and Downstreamness Revisited|Measures devised to quantify value chain position have been used increasingly in recent years. While the constructs underlying these measures are meaningful, this paper identifies an overlooked implementation problem. Proposed algorithms have been applied as though the underlying data represent flows. Implementation data are drawn from modern input-output accounting frameworks that recognize secondary production explicitly. Unadjusted Use matrices are not conventional flows matrices because they do not identify the industries from which commodities originate. We demonstrate logical inconsistencies that arise, provide correct flow matrix formulations for upstreamness and downstreamness measures, and present empirical comparisons of correct and incorrect formulations.
D57|Microeconomic Origins of Macroeconomic Tail Risks|Using a multisector general equilibrium model, we show that the interplay of idiosyncratic microeconomic shocks and sectoral heterogeneity results in systematic departures in the likelihood of large economic downturns relative to what is implied by the normal distribution. Such departures can emerge even though GDP fluctuations are approximately normally distributed away from the tails, highlighting the different nature of large economic downturns from regular business-cycle fluctuations. We further demonstrate the special role of input-output linkages in generating tail comovements, whereby large recessions involve not only significant GDP contractions, but also large simultaneous declines across a wide range of industries.
D57|Productivity and Misallocation in General Equilibrium|We provide non-parametric formulas for aggregating microeconomic shocks in economies with distortions such as taxes, markups, frictions to resource reallocation, financial frictions, and nominal rigidities. We allow for arbitrary elasticities of substitution, returns to scale, factor mobility, and input-output network linkages. We show how to separately measure changes in technical and allocative efficiency, thereby generalizing Solow (1957) and Hulten (1978) to inefficient economies. We also show how to compute the social cost of distortions. We pursue applications focusing on firm-level markups in the US. We find that improvement in allocative efficiency, due to the reallocation over time of market share to high-markup firms, accounts for about half of aggregate TFP growth over the period 1997-2015. We also find that eliminating the misallocation resulting from the large and dispersed markups estimated in the data would raise aggregate TFP by about 15%, increasing the economy-wide cost of monopoly distortions by two orders of magnitude compared to the famous 0.1% estimate by Harberger (1954). These exact numbers should be interpreted with care since the data is imperfect and requires substantial imputation.
D57|Análisis insumo-producto y la inversión pública: una aplicación para el Caribe colombiano|Este artículo busca identificar los sectores con mayor impacto intersectorial en la economía de los departamentos del Caribe colombiano, con el objetivo de ubicar actividades estratégicas para orientar la toma de decisiones de inversión pública. A través del análisis insumo-producto regional, usando los coeficientes de localización FLQ en su versión modificada y un método de extracción hipotética, se encuentra que la industria es el sector con mayor efecto multiplicador sobre el producto, empleo e ingreso. A pesar de ello, se evidencia una baja interconexión entre la mayoría de los sectores, en especial en los departamentos periféricos de la región. ***** This paper tries to identify sectors that have a greater multiplier effect on the economy in the departments located on the Caribbean region of Colombia. The purpose of this is to locate strategic sectors that can guide territorial governments’ investment-making decisions. Through regional input-output analysis, and by using the modified FLQ formula and the hypothetical extraction method, we identify that industry has the greatest impact on output, employment, and household income. However, we found low interconnection between most sectors, especially in peripheral areas of the region.

D57|Updating USAGE: Baseline and Illustrative Application|USAGE is a dynamic, CGE model of the U.S. economy created at CoPS in collaboration with the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC). The model has been used by and on behalf of: the USITC; the U.S. Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Energy, Transportation and Homeland Security; private sector organizations such as the Cato Institute and the Mitre Corporation; and the Canadian Embassy in Washington DC. To keep the model relevant for policy analysis, it must be updated periodically. This paper describes a major update of USAGE undertaken for the USITC. In accordance with the CoPS contract with the USITC, the update task was to: 1. build a NAICS-based database at the 400-industry level for USAGE using the 2007 BEA benchmark input-output tables; 2. update this database to 2014; 3. create a baseline projection starting from the base year of 2014 and proceeding at 5 year intervals to 2024; and 4. conduct an illustrative USAGE policy simulation around the baseline. At the completion of this work in August 2016, the ITC requested a fifth task: 5. update from 2007 to 2015 rather than 2014 and create a baseline from 2015 to 2020. This paper describes how we undertook the five tasks.
D57|The National and Regional Consequences of Australia's Goods and Services Tax|The major political parties support the tenet of the original GST agreement that GST change requires unanimous state approval. However, GST change could differentially affect state economies, and thus influence support from individual states. We investigate the potential for GST change to differentially affect state economies. We do this by developing a multi‐regional model of the Australian economy that contains details of the legislated features of the GST. In this model, when we change any element of the GST, the economic effects are informed by regional differences in economic structure and their interactions with the details of our GST theory.
D57|Green versus brown: Comparing the employment impacts of energy efficiency, renewable energy, and fossil fuels using an input-output model|Global carbon emissions have reached unsustainable levels, and transforming the energy sector by increasing efficiency and use of renewables is one of the primary strategies to reduce emissions. Policy makers need to understand both the environmental and economic impacts of fiscal and regulatory policies regarding the energy sector. Transitioning to lower-carbon energy will entail a contraction of the fossil fuel sector, along with a loss of jobs. An important question is whether clean energy will create more jobs than will be lost in fossil fuels. This article presents a method of using Input-Output (I-O) tables to create “synthetic” industries – namely clean energy industries that do not currently exist in I-O tables. This approach allows researchers to evaluate public and private spending in clean energy and compare it to the effects of spending on fossil fuels. Here we focus on employment impacts in the short-to-medium term, and leave aside the long-term comparison of operations and maintenance employment. We find that on average, 2.65 full-time-equivalent (FTE) jobs are created from $1 million spending in fossil fuels, while that same amount of spending would create 7.49 or 7.72 FTE jobs in renewables or energy efficiency. Thus each $1 million shifted from brown to green energy will create a net increase of 5 jobs.
D57|The Automotive Value Chain in Thailand|A country's participation in global value chains (GVCs) is increasingly becoming important as a strategy for economic development. However, participation in GVCs alone is not sufficient. Industrial deepening - or the formation of backward linkages by creating robust supplier bases - is necessary to sustain economic growth. This paper explores how the automotive value chain has evolved in Thailand since the 1990s. Trade in value-added analysis is applied to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Inter-Country Input-Output data. Moreover, the concept of value chain mapping is introduced to illustrate upstream and downstream transactions of goods and services along the value chain. Results show that international linkages were strengthened because of the expanding production networks in Southeast Asia. On the other hand, domestic linkages and domestic content started to decline after a certain point. These results suggest that the benefits of specialisation and exchange have outweighed those of agglomeration in recent decades.
D57|Intangible Capital and Measured Productivity|Because firms invest heavily in R&D, software, brands, and other intangible assetsâ€”at a rate close to that of tangible assetsâ€”changes in measured GDP, which does not include all intangible investments, understate the actual changes in total output. If changes in the labor input are more precisely measured, then it is possible to observe little change in measured total factor productivity coincidentally with large changes in hours and investment. This mismeasurement leaves business cycle modelers with large and unexplained labor wedges accounting for most of aggregate fluctuations. Intangible investments are introduced in a multi-sector general equilibrium model with income and cost shares matched to data from the U.S. input and output tables, which now include some intangible investments along with final goods and services. I use MLE methods and observations on sectoral business receipts and per capita hours to estimate processes for latent sectoral TFPs--that have common and idiosyncratic componentsâ€”-and a time-varying labor wedge. I find that the modelâ€™s common TFP component accounts for most of the variation in the observed series, including the downturn of 2008â€“2009, while the time-varying labor wedge accounts for almost none. The correlation of the modelâ€™s common TFP component and measured U.S. TFP is roughly zero.
D57|The Organization of Global Supply Networks|In this contribution, we introduce a network approach for the organization of global production across national borders, beyond the sequential industry-level metrics proposed in the previous literature. First, we show and argue that several characteristics of global production processes would be lost in the analysis when assuming that they could be proxied as linear sequences. Hence, we propose an index that assesses the relevance of any input for the target output, including its role as an input of inputs. Thereafter, we exploit an own-built firm-level dataset of about 20,489 U.S. parent companies integrating more than 154,000 affiliates worldwide. Results show that the technological relevance of an input in a directed supply network is also a good predictor for: i) the probability that an input industry is actually integrated within a firm boundary; ii) the number of affiliates that are controlled by the parent company and active in that input industry.
D57|Multifactor CES elasticity and productivity growth : a cross-sectional approach|Sector-wise productivity growth is measured, along with the sectoral elasticity of substitution, under the multifactor CES framework by regressing the growth of factor-wise cost shares against the growth of relative factor prices. We use linked input–output tables for Japan and Korea as the data sources for factor price and cost shares in two temporally distant states. We then construct a multisectoral general equilibrium model using the system of estimated CES unit cost functions and evaluate the economy-wide distribution of exogenous productivity gains in terms of welfare. Further, we examine the differences between models based on a priori elasticities such as the Leontief and the Cobb–Douglas systems.
D57|Topology of global value chains : focus on the manufacturing industry, 2000-2015|The increasing presence of global value chains (GVCs) has been considered one of the most important phenomena of 21st century international trade. A better understanding of GVCs is crucial for both trade policy making and business practices. This study applies various network analysis tools to the new GVC accounting system in which gross exports are decomposed into value-added terms through various GVC routes based on the ADB Multi-Regional Input–Output Tables (2000–2015). Using the proposed decomposition framework, the study helps divide manufacturing-related GVCs into sub-networks with clear visualization of countries’ participation patterns. The empirical results show that GVCs are not always like “chains”, but complex networks of hubs and spokes; GVCs are not very “global”, but still remain to be “regional”. These findings can significantly improve our understanding of the interdependency of countries in GVCs, which are normally invisible in traditional trade statistics.
D57|Genuine output and genuine productivity of China's provinces : a multiregional input-output analysis|This paper recalculates value added, capital formation, capital stock, and related multifactor productivity for China's provinces by expanding on the genuine savings method proposed by the World Bank. Specifically, we construct China's time-series multiregional input?output tables to account for the natural resource depletion and environmental damage that affect genuine output when considering inter-provincial trade. The results show that although the loss of natural capital in China's provinces in terms of value added and investment has declined, the impact on productivity during the past decades is still significant and has even increased during the past decades.
D57|Economic shocks and changes in global production structures: Methods for measuring economic resilience|Conventional studies on the impacts of economic shocks using global input-output tables (sensitivity analyses) assume stable production structures and thus, only reveal the marginal impacts of changes in final demand. However, when economic shocks occur, whether at home or abroad, economic agents are expected to react to reduce the negative impact or amplify the positive effects. The ability of a country to contain economic losses can be defined as the resilience to economic shocks. Using the OECD's annual Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) tables, 1995 to 2011, this paper investigates the relationship between changes in final demand and production structures for 61 economies. Our findings are summarised as follows. Production and final demand structures tend to change to reduce the negative feedbacks from final demand shocks. During economic downturns, structures tend to change so that the dependence on domestic services increases, while the dependence on domestic demand for goods, and the dependence on foreign demand for domestic goods and services, both decrease. Therefore, the domestic service sector seems to play a key role in temporarily containing the negative feedback. Countries that are able to prop up their economy by domestic service sectors instead of domestic goods and foreign sectors are more resilient to negative economic shocks.
D57|Japan–Korea Trade Liberalization Revisited: The Role of Armington Elasticities|The elasticity of substitution between foreign and domestic products, i.e., Armington elasticity, is measured by way of two-state calibration according to the temporally distant observations of the market shares, and associated price changes. Along with the sector-wise multifactor CES elasticity estimated using the linked input-output tables, we integrate domestic production of the two countries (Japan and the Republic of Korea) with bilateral trades and construct a bilateral general equilibrium model. Thereupon, we perform an economic assessment of trade liberalization between the two countries.

D57|On the Geography of Global Value Chains|This paper studies the optimal location of production for the different stages in a sequential global value chain. We develop a general-equilibrium model featuring a proximity-concentration tradeoff: slicing global value chains across countries allows to better exploit agglomeration economies, but such fragmentation comes at the cost of increased transportation costs. We show that, other things equal, it is optimal to locate relatively downstream stages of production in relatively central or well-connected locations, while upstream stages of production are optimally assigned to more remote locations. We illustrate this result by working out the optimal location of production for a few basic topologies featuring a low number of countries and stages. Exact solutions to the problem for a larger number of countries and stages are computationally complex, but can be obtained using combinatorial optimization tools. We apply the model to study the optimal specialization within chains in eleven countries in Factory Asia.
D57|Productivity and Misallocation in General Equilibrium|We provide a general non-parametric formula for aggregating microeconomic shocks in general equilibrium economies with distortions such as taxes, markups, frictions to resource reallocation, and nominal rigidities.

We also derive a formula showing how these two components are determined by structural microeconomic parameters such as elasticities of substitution, returns to scale, factor mobility, and network linkages. Overall, our results generalize those of Solow (1957) and Hulten (1978) to economies with distortions.

For example, we operationalize our non-parametric results and show that improvements in allocative efficiency account for about 50% of measured TFP growth over the period 1997-2015. We also implement our structural results and conclude that eliminating markups would raise TFP by about 40%, increasing the economywide cost of monopoly distortions by two orders of magnitude compared to the famous 0.1% estimates of Harberger (1954).
D57|Regularities in Prices of Production and the Concentration of Compositions of Capitals|Recent developments in price of production models have proposed a hypothesis on the structure of the input coefficient matrices to explain the empirical near-linearity and monotonicity found in prices as a function of income distribution - the tendency towards zero of subdominant eigenvalues. The objective of this paper is twofold: First, based on the behavior of observed eigenvalues, the paper shows that they cannot explain by their own the regularities found in prices of production. Second, it is shown theoretically and empirically the existence and relevance of an additional force acting on the input matrix and the labor coefficient vector: the concentration of industries' vertically integrated compositions of capital around their average. It is argued that the combined effect of these two factors produces the empirical regularities in relative prices. The tendency of the vertically integrated labor to means of production proportions to cluster around their average reveals the existence of an economic force acting on the structure of technology of observable economies and calls for an explanation. The paper relies on the US 1987- 2007 Input-Output accounts, at the highest disaggregation level (between 370-466 sectors), for the empirical evidence in this paper.
D57|Economic shocks and changes in global production structure : methods for measuring economic resilience|Conventional studies into the impacts of economic shocks using global input-output tables (sensitivity analyses) assume stable production structures and thus, only reveal the marginal impacts of changes in final demand. However, when economic shocks occur, whether at home or abroad, economic agents are expected to react to reduce the negative impact or amplify the positive effects. The ability of a country to contain economic losses can be defined as the resilience to economic shocks. Using the OECD's annual Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) tables, 1995 to 2011, this paper investigates the relationship between changes in final demand and production structures for 61 economies. Our findings are summarized as follows. Production and final demand structures tend to change to reduce the negative feedbacks from final demand shocks. During economic downturns, structures tend to change so that the dependency on domestic services increases, while the dependency on domestic demand for goods, and the dependency on foreign demand for domestic goods and services, both decrease. Therefore, the domestic service sector seems to play a key role in temporarily containing the negative feedback. Countries that are able to prop up their economy by domestic service sectors instead of domestic goods and foreign sectors are more resilient to negative economic shocks.
D57|An approach to the structural features of the socio-economic activity of a country based on a Social Accounting Matrix.Evidences and multiplier effects on distribution of income|A Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) is presented as a tool to study the socio-economic activity of a country. This activity involves the monetary or nominal flows that are measured by the National Accounts, as well as production (organized in factors, industries and goods and services) and institutions (organized in households, general government, non-financial and financial corporations, non-profit institutions serving households, and rest of the world). In order to contribute to the definition of a methodology that can contribute to improving the knowledge of the different aspects of this activity, the potentialities of a SAM for its reading and interpreting are explored, as well as for carrying out experiments regarding its functioning. Through a SAM-based approach, how to construct more or less complex networks of linkages of the above-mentioned flows is shown, from which structural features can be evidenced and the associated multiplier effects studied. Following an application to Portugal, it is shown that a numerical version of a SAM, enables an empirical description of the origin, use, and distribution of income, whereas, an algebraic version of a SAM allows one to carry out, for example, a deeper study of the multiplier effects associated with the institutional distribution of income. The crucial role of the factors of production accounts is identified in this study, namely when they establish the link between the generation and the distribution and use of income. In this process, the important role the complementary details that the Input-Output Matrix (IOM) can add is also identified. Thus, being the generation of income the result of the output of goods and services and the associated costs, on the one hand, an industry-by-industry IOM can add details regarding domestic and imported intermediate consumption by and between industries and, on the other hand, a product-by-product IOM can add details regarding the domestic and imported intermediate consumption of goods and services.
D57|An Analytic Estimation of the Multiplier Effect of Public Consumption in the Dominican Republic: 2007-2012|This study estimates the multiplier effect of public consumption in the Dominican Republic via an analytic methodology that works with input-output tables using data on the years 2007-2012. This study finds that the public sector has an employment multiplier of 1.5, which means that for every 10 jobs that are created within the public sector because of public consumption, 5 jobs are created within the private sector. Also, the study finds that around 20\% of imports are directly and indirectly caused by the effect of public consumption. The proportion of GDP explained by public consumption is also estimated around 20\%. However, when one takes into account (and discounts) the effect that the money directed to public spending would've had if it had been spent by the private sector on consumption and investment, the impact is reduced by at least a quarter.
D57|Examination of Seasonal Volatility in HICP for Baltic Region Countries: Non-Parametric Test versus Forecasting Experiment|The aim of this paper is to examine the problem of existing seasonal volatility in total and disaggregated HICP for Baltic Region countries (Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, Germany, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden). Using nonparametric tests, we found that in the case of m-o-m prices, including fruit, vegetables, and total HICP, the homogeneity of variance during seasons is rejected. Based on these findings, we propose an exponential smoothing model with periodic variance of error terms that capture the repetitive seasonal variation (in conditional or unconditional second moments). In a pseudo-real data experiment, the short-term forecasts (nowcasting) for the considered components of inflation were determined using different specifications of considered models. The forecasting performance of the models was measured using one of the scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts called logarithmic score. We found instead that while the periodic phenomenon in variance was statistically significant, the models with a periodic phenomenon in variance of error terms do not significantly improve forecasting performance in disaggregated cases and in the case of total HICP. The simpler models with constant variance of error term have comparative forecasting (nowcasting) performance over the alternative model.
D57|Using Input–Output Analysis Framework to Explain Economic Diversification and Structural Transformation in Bangladesh|Existing literature on economic growth and structural change relies on trade data to make pronouncements about a country’s competitiveness and long-term growth prospects through the acquisition of capabilities. However, insufficient data give us a limited view of what is happening within the domestic economy, and how the development of manufacturing through links in the production process leads to the export of intermediate or final products. Using input–output data, this paper devises an agglomeration indicator to measure economic diversification and to compare Bangladesh with other key economies. In the process, we shed light on the symbiotic relationship between manufacturing and services as the country develops. Despite Bangladesh’s astounding growth over the past 15 years, diversification has been somewhat slower than expected for its level of development.
D57|Can we put a price on extending the scope of the GPA? First quantitative assessment|The aim of this paper is to analyse the impact of domestic preferences elimination in government procurement agreement (GPA) parties. For this purpose, in a first attempt, I use the newly created public procurement database and modelling extension of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model. The shock design of the modelling scenarios is based on insights from empirical literature and is calculated as a difference between private and government sector import penetration. Depending on the scenario, the GPA parties’ GDP increases between $4-5 billion. Implications with regard to economic welfare, however, are more important, the equivalent variation measure points to welfare gains in the range of $8-10 billion. The current research, being the first modelling application paper of the newly created database, and model suggest that further expansion of the scope and coverage of the GPA can bring sizeable economic benefits.
D57|Panel estimation of sectoral substitution elasticities for CES production functions|"This paper provides a broad range of estimates of substitution elasticities for sectoral nested CES production functions, using panel data techniques, with the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) as the main data source. Although the related empirical literature has been growing over the recent years, there is still no single study focused on a large-scale estimation of various sectoral elasticities with a use of a common database and methodology. This paper constitutes an attempt to fill this gap. The obtained estimates may be subsequently used by Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modellers in their applied research. A significant heterogeneity in estimated elasticity values is observed between various industries/products, as well as between various nests of the production function. This constitutes a strong argument against the arbitrary use of Leontief and/or Cobb- Douglas specifications in CGE models. It also turns out that, in most cases, obtained long-run elasticities are higher than in the short run. In addition, the analytical specification of estimated equation and time series properties of panel data (stationarity and cointegration) play a crucial role in determining the ""correct"" type of dynamic model (autoregressive distributed lag model, error correction model or model for differenced series) for a particular sector-nest combination and, in turn, in determining the preferred values of elasticity estimates."
D57|Gross versus value added trade balances of the Central and Eastern European countries|The making available in the early 2010s of databases containing world input-output tables (e.g. WIOD) was a significant advancement in research on international trade. It allowed to compile statistics of value added flows between countries. The concept ?trade in value added? accounts for the value added of one country directly and indirectly contained in final consumption of another country. The typical question would be: How much value added of other countries is contained in the consumption of the country under examination?. The trade statistics in value added term eliminate the multiple calculation of such goods in trade ? first as components (intermediate goods) and then as parts of final goods. Thus, those statistics are better to assess the benefits derived by particular countries from foreign trade. The aim of this paper is to present changes of trade balances in bilateral trade of the Central and Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia ? CEECs) in 1995-2011. The illustration of these changes is based on trade statistics both in value added terms and in gross terms. The data are downloaded from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD Release 2013). The research study shows that trade deficits and trade surpluses when measured in value added terms tend to become smaller as compared to gross trade figures. The key to understanding of this pattern is trade in intermediates. The differences between trade balances in gross and value added terms differ among the CEECs. The largest are in the Central European countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia). These countries are strong integrated with the global value chains.
D57|Interstate Input-Output Matrix for Brazil: An Application of the IIOAS Method|This paper presents the process of estimation of an interregional input-output system for the 26 Brazilian states and the Federal District, in conditions of limited information, using the IIOAS method. IIOAS is consistent with the national input-output matrix and can be built for any country that publishes its SUTs, and has a regionalized sectoral information system. Subsequently, the commercial relations and productive structures of each state were analyzed. SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro were the most self-sufficient states. Roraima and Tocantins were the ones that presented the lowest levels of self-sufficiency. Regarding regional interdependence, Roraima and Acre were the states whose production showed less dependence on the final demand of other states, whereas Amazonas, EspÃ­rito Santo and Mato Grosso were the states in which the final demand of other states and exports exert most influence in the local production.
D57|Disaggregation of the 2010 UK Social Accounting Matrix to report household income quintiles|Social Accounting Matrices (SAM) are used as the main data source for Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models, which in turn can be used to simulate economic shocks and study their economy-wide impact. However, SAMs usually include highly aggregated categories of final consumers, therefore preventing the use of CGE models to study the impact of economic shocks on economic agents with specific characteristics. For this type of analysis, it is necessary to disaggregate the economic agent of interest in the SAM. This paper presents an approach by which it is possible to disaggregate the households in the UK SAM in quintiles based on their gross weekly income. The necessary steps to disaggregate the households are presented in detail, along with the supporting datasets and variables required to replicate the disaggregation approach for future SAMs.
D57|The displacement and attraction effects in interurban migration: An application of the input-output scheme to the case of large cities in Korea|In this paper, two migratory impact-assessment schemes are constructed within the framework of Ghoshian and Leontief input-output analysis. These schemes are designed to estimate the rural-to-urban migration-induced and the urban-to-rural migration-induced effects on interurban migration, where the former effect is termed the replacement effect, while the latter the attraction effect. The established input-output schemes are empirically applied to the 2012 data on interregional migration in Korea. The results show that an arrival of migrants to and/or a departure of residents from the 20 largest cities in Korea induce direct and indirect ripples of population flow between those cities. A combination of the displacement and the attraction effects yields a classification of cities by which the 20 largest cities are grouped into four different types.
D57|Оценка общественной эффективности инвестиций в промышленно-логистический парк Новосибирской области. The Estimation of Economic Efficiency of Investments in the Industrial Park of the Novosibirsk Region|Описывается метод оценки общественной эффективности инвестиций, основанной на модели затраты-выпуск. Предлагаемый метод развивает известные приемы cost-benefits analysis и применяется для оценки эффективности бюджетного финансирования создания Промышленно-логистического парка (ПЛП) в Новосибирской области (НСО). Оценка осуществляется на основе модели затраты-выпуск, разработанной для НСО. Общественные выгоды оцениваются исходя из прироста валовой добавленной стоимости (ВДС). При этом учитывается ряд потерь ВДС, например, потери из-за вытеснения существующих производителей, потери из-за закупки импортных ресурсов и т. д. Общественные затраты оцениваются как полный выпуск экономики, необходимый для создания и функционирования инвестиционного проекта. The author describes a method for estimation the economic efficiency, based on the input-output model. The proposed method develops the author of well-known methods of cost-benefits analysis. The method is used to assess the effectiveness of budget financing the establishment of Industrial logistics Park (PLP) in the Novosibirsk region (NSO). The estimation is based on the input-output model developed for the NSO. Economic benefits are assessed on the basis of growth in gross value added (GVA). This takes into account a number of losses GVA, for example, losses due to the displacement of existing producers, losses due to the purchase of imported resources, etc. Economiccosts is estimated as a fulloutput of the economy, necessary for the establishment and operation of the investment project.
D57|The Euro Area north-south structural economic divide: an input-output approach|The great recession of 2008/2009 and the subsequent sovereign debt crises highlighted the existence of deep structural imbalances in the Euro Area: the large differences of competitiveness and growth potential between its northern and southern countries. In this paper, an input-output approach is used to study several facets of this phenomenon, namely the connection between current account (trade) imbalances and domestic final demand levels, as well as the sectoral specialization of tradable goods and services production. In the uncompetitive (current account deficit) economies of southern euro area, domestic final demand levels are in excess of its equilibrium values and the opposite occurs in the strong, competitive economies of the north. These external imbalances are parallel to, and in good measure explained by, a different geographic pattern of specialization favourable to the northern euro-area countries (sectors with higher value added and more intensive technological activities). The external dependency and value added generation capacity of the productive sectors of these economies are also quantified, with a new treatment of inter-industry output multipliers which follows closely Amaral et al (2011). The (gross) output growth potential given by the column sums of the Leontief inverse matrix (backward linkage indicators) results from three terms: inter-industry flows, value added and imported inputs. After a convenient arrangement of these terms, the evolution of backward linkage indicators can be used to detect structural changes, particularly quantifying a (net) growth effect (more value-added generation) and an external dependency effect (more imported inputs), and to classify the productive sectors accordingly. The empirical results of the paper are based on input-output tables for several years: 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2008, available in the World Input Output Database. The northern euro-area group is formed by Germany, Netherlands, Finland and Ireland. The southern is the so-called GIPS group (Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain).
D57|Regional Economic Impact Assessment with Missing Input-Output Data: A Spatial Econometrics Approach for Poland|We propose a method of constructing multisector-multiregion input-output tables, based on the standard multisector tables and the tools of spatial econometrics. Voivodship-level (NUTS-2) and subregion-level data (NUTS-3) on sectoral value added is used to fit a spatial model, based on a modification of the Durbin model. The structural coefficients are calibrated, based on I-O multipliers, while the spatial weight matrices are estimated as parsimoniously parametrised functions of physical distance and limited supply in certain regions. We incorporate additional restrictions to derive proportions in which every cross-sectoral flow should be interpolated into cross-regional flow matrix. All calculations are based on publicly available data. The method is illustrated with an example of regional economic impact assessment for a generic construction company located in Eastern Poland.
D57|The world’s economic geography: evidence from the world input–output table|Abstract The principal aim of this paper was to analyse the world’s economic structure, the degree of interaction between the economic systems of countries, and its temporal evolution. The analysis is carried out on the basis of the world input–output table for the period between 1995 and 2011 and using a functional approach able to detect the intensity of the direct and indirect links among the countries considered. The purpose was therefore to identify, on the one hand, the most important economic systems and, on the other hand, those attracted by the former. The main results obtained show a high degree of globalization of local economic systems and the growing role of the German economy in Europe and the Chinese economy in Asia.
D57|Note on Sustainability Prices When Sectoral Growth Rates Differ|Abstract A dynamic Leontief-type model is considered. The sectoral growth rates differ. This note shows that the dual of the (vector) equation connecting sectoral products and sectoral consumptions is a (vector) price equation representing sustainability prices, i.e. prices assuring profits that are consistent with the cost of sectoral capital adjustments. In this economy the sectoral price levels depend on the sectoral growth rates and the sectoral profit-capital rates differ.
D57|Integración de Uruguay a las cadenas globales de valor: análisis por sector y productos|En el trabajo se identificaron sectores y productos en Uruguay en donde exista y/o pueda desarrollarse una mayor profundización de cadenas globales de valor a escala regional (Sudamérica). Se midieron tres tipos de indicadores: encadenamientos intersectoriales domésticos (hacia atrás y adelante); integración vertical con la economía internacional (índice de Hummels); grado de proximidad a la demanda final (upstreamness). Como toda economía pequeña con un alto grado de especialización productiva, Uruguay registra un alto índice de contenido importado de las importaciones (18% directo y 32% total). Con estos criterios se seleccionaron seis sectores: la industria agroalimentaria (alimentos procesados (8)), otro de las materias primas de origen agropecuario (papel (15)) y cuatro de la manufactura (química básica (17), otros químicos (18), plásticos (20) y automotriz (30)). Se trata de sectores en donde hay un contenido importado alto, típicamente alejados de la demanda final y que tiene una inserción regional importante. En estos sectores se seleccionaron una canasta de los principales productos de exportación. Empleando información del régimen de admisión temporaria se pudo determinar los insumos importados por esas exportaciones. Por último, se estudio la oferta exportable de esos productos en los países de la región. Con toda esta información se caracterizaron los cuatro tipos de cadenas a desarrollar en función del origen del insumo y el destino del producto.
D57|The Role Of The Education Industry In The U.S. Extended Income Circular Flow|The aim of this work is to design policies for public and private education systems in the U.S. Such policies are determined by assessing the importance of public and private education as industries. The role of public and private education industries is evaluated both in terms of their capability of being stimulated by, and of stimulating the other industries, the primary factors, and the institutional sectors. The analytic framework suitable to address this problem is a multisectoral model based on the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) approach. Policy design is based on both traditional multiplier and Macro Multiplier approaches. Policy simulation consists in the evaluation of the short-term multiplier effects of education-oriented policies expressed by shocks on final demand. Observed results show compatibility between targets of generalized output growth in almost all the sector of the economy and of output growth in both public and private education industries.
D57|Trade in Carbon and the Effectiveness of Carbon Tariffs|Carbon-based import tariffs are discussed as policy measures to reduce carbon leakage and increase the global cost-effectiveness of unilateral CO2 emission pricing. We assess how the potential of carbon tariffs to increase cost-effectiveness of unilateral climate policy depends on the magnitude and composition of carbon embodied in trade. For our assessment, we combine multi-region input-output (MRIO) analysis with computable general equilibrium (CGE) analysis based on data from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) for the period 1995 to 2007. The MRIO analysis confirms that carbon embodied in trade has sharply increased during this period. Yet, the CGE analysis suggests that the effectiveness of carbon tariffs in reducing leakage and improving global-cost effectiveness of unilateral climate policy does not increase over time, whereas the potential to shift the economic burden of CO2 emissions reduction from abating developed regions to non-abating developing regions increases substantially.

D57|Comparative advantage of the EU in global value chains: How important and efficient are new EU members in transition?|We suggest original modifications and extensions of the recently presented methodological developments in ex-post accounting framework in global value chains in order to obtain empirical results both for the analyzed group of ten CEE economies as well as at acountry-and-sector-specific level. The empirical results confirm that the role of the selected CEE economies in transition in creating value added with respect to the total value added in the European Union in the GVC framework was biggest in the cases of agriculture-, wood-products-, metal-production, and travel-and-tourism-related sectors. We also found that, after two decades of transition, the measures of productivity in the examined economies in 2009 were still much lower as comparedto the EU average for most of the sectors. Moreover, in the transition period, these indexes were increasing, especially after EU accession. In contrary, after two decades of transition, the measures of capital efficiency in the ten CEE economies in 2009 were comparable to the EU average for most of the sectors. Moreover, during this period, the growth rates of these indexes were, in general, positive. However, their growth rates dropped after EU accession.
D57|Who’s Going Green? Decomposing the Change in Household Consumption Emissions 2006 – 2012|We update the analysis of Allan et al. (2015) and re-examine whether New Zealand households have become greener consumers using newly available data. We combine input-output data from 2006 and 2012 with detailed data on household consumption from the 2006 and 2012 Household Economic Surveys (HES) to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions embodied in household consumption. We confirm many of our previous findings; that emissions increase less than proportionately with expenditure, and that there is significant variation in expenditure elasticities across consumption categories. We test for a change in household emissions over time and decompose this change into improvements in production efficiency and changes in households. We find that average household emissions fell by 11% between 2006 and 2012. We attribute 1.7 percentage points of this decrease to changes in households, with the remaining 9.3 percentage points from changes in emissions intensities. The majority of the change due to households is a result of changes in household behaviour rather than a change in household characteristics. Emissions from household energy fell markedly between 2006 and 2012, driven by a reduction in the emissions intensity of electricity and a decrease in household electricity consumption.
D57|Impactos Económicos Regionales del “Shale Gas” en la Reforma Energética de México|El estudio tiene como objetivo estimar los impactos económicos de algunos aspectos de la Reforma Energética de 2013 en el Noreste de México, particularmente los relacionados con los recursos de gas de esquisto (lutitas) o de “shale gas”. En específico, el reporte presenta estimaciones preliminares de los efectos de los nuevos proyectos de construcción y operación de gasoductos en la región Noreste. Para medir dichos impactos se construyeron matrices insumo-producto y de contabilidad social regionales. Para ello, se partió de las matrices nacionales del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía para el año 2012. Al análisis tradicional de insumo-producto se le ha añadido información de cuentas sociales que presentan las transacciones no sólo entre sectores industriales sino que además incluyen a instituciones como los hogares, las sociedades y los trabajadores por cuenta propia.
D57|Determination Of Key Sectors In Turkish Economy By Using Input-Output Analysis|The purpose of this study is to determine the key economic sectors by using Leontief input-output analysis in the deriving backward and forward linkages for all sectors in the Turkish economy for the year 2011. It is important to contribute to public policies aimed at development of the national economy according to the results reached in our study. The key economic sectors, according to their direct or indirect forward and backward linkage indices, are Textiles and Textile Products, Chemicals and Chemical Products, Basic Metals and Fabricated Metal, Electricity, Gas and Water Supply, Other Supporting and Auxiliary Transport Activities; Activities of Travel Agencies. Investments primarily in these sectors may increase economic mobility.
D57|Análisis input-output de encadenamientos productivos y sectores clave en la economía mexicana|Este artículo busca identificar las industrias clave de la economía mexicana. Para este propósito, se aplican las siguientes metodologías basadas en el análisis input-output: a) el método Chenery-Watabane (1958) para el cálculo de encadenamientos productivos directos; b) los métodos Rasmussen (1963) para el cálculo de encadenamientos productivos totales; c) el enfoque de demanda de Leontief (1985) para cuantificar los encadenamientos hacia atrás directos y totales; d) el enfoque de oferta de Ghosh (1958, 1968) para la cuantificación de los encadenamientos hacia delante directos y totales. Finalmente, los resultados de estas aplicaciones muestran que los sectores clave de México son las industrias de bienes intermedios y bienes de capital.******This article seeks to identify the industrial sectors that are key to the Mexican economy. To this end the following methodologies are employed, all based on input-output analysis: a) the Chenery-Watabane Method (1958) for calculating direct productive linkages; b) the Rasmussen Methods (1963) for calculating total productive linkages; c) Leontief’s demand focus (1985) for the quantification of direct and total backward linkages; and d) the supply focus of Ghosh (1958, 1968) used to quantify direct and total forward linkages. Finally,
D57|Has EU Accession Caused Structural Change in New Entrants? Intersectoral Linkage Analyses on Bulgaria and Romania|The European Union (EU) countries, especially the founders and earlier entrants (EU-15) are among the most-developed, post-industrial and innovationdriven economies in the world. Countries with different structures are expected to have progressive structural changes after their accessions to the EU by means of the intra-EU policies on socio-economic integration and monetary (Euro) adoption. Starting from this convergence premise, this study aims to explore whether the latest member states, Bulgaria and Romania, that joined the EU in 2007, have experienced significant changes in their economic structures. To this end, with a general equilibrium approach and using input-output data of the countries, we conduct intersectoral linkage analyses covering all economic activities aggregated to 34 sectors for the years of 1995, 2002, 2007 and 2011. Backward and forward linkage coefficients calculated from inverse matrices based on the Leontief model and the Ghosh model reveal that there is no strong evidence found supporting the structural change experiences in the 5th year of the EU accession for both countries
D57|The Changing Energy Intensity in Indian Economy: A Sector-level Analysis Based on Input-Output Model| This paper is an attempt to analyze changing energy intensities in the Indian economy. The hybrid input-output model at constant prices has been used to address the problem of homogenous pricing of energy inputs across sectors of the economy. Results reveal that the indirect rather than direct energy use is an important source of energy consumption. In such scenario, conservation measures should be pegged in upstream suppliers through technological improvements, fuel substitution or input replacements. Finally, the paper argues that improvements in energy efficiency in the production chains are likely to be more effective than changes within the production process.
D57|The database–modeling nexus in integrated assessment modeling of electric power generation|Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are playing an increasingly important role in long-run sustainability analysis. At their core is a set of global economic and environmental accounts which capture a complete set of inter-industry and inter-regional relationships in the global economy in a consistent manner. While much attention is focused on the raw data and parameterization required to expand or add sectoral detail to IAMs, only rarely is there discussion of how different matrix balancing methods (i.e. translating disparate raw data sources into the consistent database) affect modeling results. This article offers an in-depth look into the database–modeling nexus in IAMs, focusing on the electric power sector which is both a major source of CO2 emissions and a critical vehicle for climate change mitigation. Comparisons of the prevailing matrix balancing algorithms show how the choice of database reconciliation methodology affects modeling results using policy-relevant simulations in the context of the electric power sector. The resulting insights can be applied to the disaggregation of other, technology rich sectors in the economy. We conclude that appropriate selection of database reconciliation methodologies can reduce the deviation between bottom-up and top-down modeling.
D57|Análisis estructural de la economía mexicana para el año 2008|Identificar sectores productivos, capaces de impulsar la economía, es fundamental para diseñar políticas. Este trabajo analiza la estructura de la economía mexicana con modelos lineales de equilibrio general, que están basados en una matriz de contabilidad social.

The Federal Planning Bureau constructed this table in 2015 in cooperation with the statistical authorities of the country's three Regions (IBSA, SVR and IWEPS). The following standard IO analyses based on applying the Leontief model to the interregional IO table are presented here: the derivation of multipliers for each region and the estimation of regional value added and regional employment generated by domestic final demand and exports.
D57|On the emergence of scale-free production networks|We propose a simple dynamical model for the formation of production networks among monopolistically competitive firms. The model subsumes the standard general equilibrium approach à la Arrow–Debreu but displays a wide set of potential dynamic behaviors. It robustly reproduces key stylized facts of firms׳ demographics. Our main result is that competition between intermediate good producers generically leads to the emergence of scale-free production networks.
D57|Endogenous Growth in Production Networks|We investigate the interplay between technological change and macroeconomic dynamics in an agent-based model of the formation of production networks. On the one hand, production networks form the structure that determines economic dynamics in the short run. On the other hand, their evolution reflects the long-term impacts of competition and innovation on the economy. We account for process innovation via increasing variety in the input mix and hence increasing connectivity in the network. In turn, product innovation induces a direct growth of the firm's productivity and the potential destruction of links. The interplay between both processes generate complex technological dynamics in which phases of process and product innovation successively dominate. The model reproduces a wealth of stylized facts about industrial dynamics and technological progress, in particular the persistence of heterogeneity among firms and Wright's law for the growth of productivity within a technological paradigm. We illustrate the potential of the model for the analysis of industrial policy via a preliminary set of policy experiments in which we investigate the impact on innovators' success of feed-in tariffs and of priority market access
D57|A new approach for the input-output price model|This paper proposes a new approach to measure the impact of a sector's price shock on price indices. It works based on table adjustments to trace the effects of any initial price shock through an iteration process. It has the same accuracy and all the capabilities of the popular Standard Leontief Price (SLP) model. A distinct advantage of the new approach compared with the SLP model, however, is its ability to measure the impact of the initial price shock on all value-added components if and when it is required. This capability enables researchers to use interindustry price analysis to tackle problems of a more real-world nature. Other advantages of this approach are its simple computational implementation, especially relevant for larger size interindustry tables, the unified way to deal with all kind of different price issues, and the yielding of an adjusted interindustry table reflecting all endogenous price adjustments in response to the initial price shock.
D57|A new approach for the input–output price model|This paper proposes a new approach to measure the impact of a sector's price shock on price indices. It works based on table adjustments to trace the effects of any initial price shock through an iteration process.

D57|Identifying Industry Clusters In Colombia Based On Graph Theory|This paper presents a new way to identify and understand the industry clusters in the Colombian economy. The analysis relies on a recent methodology proposed by Duque and Rey (2008) where intricate input-output linkages between industries are simplified using network analysis. In addition to other techniques for cluster identification available in the literature, this novel methodology allows us not only to classify each industry in a given cluster, but also to understand how industries are related to each other within their clusters. This methodology offers a conciliatory approach to two radically different views about the economic unit from which policy makers should design their strategies for resource allocation: Porter’s cluster strategy versus Hausmann’s industrial targeting

D57|Technological Integration and Income Gaps|Resumen: Leontief (1963) sostiene que los países subdesarrollados son pobres porque son en gran medida, económicamente menos diversificados. Este artículo muestra que un modelo de equilibrio general con una estructura de insumo-producto estable y con una externalidad de la productividad generada por diversificación de factores, puede ser consistente con la hipótesis de Leontief. Una versión del modelo en economía abierta permite la posibilidad de violar el teorema de la igualación del precio de los factores, permitiendo así que las economías desarrolladas obtengan una alta remuneración de capital y un alto nivel de ingreso. Se presenta alguna evidencia empírica sobre la relación entre la integración tecnológica y el ingreso real.
D57|Technological Integration and Income Gaps|Leontief (1963) claimed that underdeveloped countries are poor because they are by far less economically diversified. This paper shows that a general equilibrium model with a stable input-output structure and a productivity externality due to input diversification may be consistent with Leontief´s hypothesis. An open economy version of the model yields the possibility of breaking the factor price equalization theorem so that developed economies enjoy higher capital remuneration and higher income level. Some empirical evidence on the relationship between technological integration and real income is provided.
D57|The Construction of Input-Output Coefficients Matrices in an Axiomatic Context: Some Further Considerations| Kop Jansen & ten Raa (1990) established a purely theoretical solution to the problem of selecting a model for the construction of coefficients on the basis of make and use tables. In an axiomatic context, they singled out the so-called commodity technology model as the best one according to some desirable properties. The aim of this paper is to delineate the restrictions on the relevant data sets that ensure fulfilment of the desirable properties by other models used by statistical offices.
D57|An Applied General Equilibrium Model to Assess the Impact of National Tax Changes on a Regional Economy|This paper presents two versions of an applied general equilibrium model for the regional economy of Andalusia, Spain, that differ in the closure rule adopted to describe the behavior of the public sector. We use the model with to analyze the impact that the reform of the personal income tax (Act 40/98) implemented in Spain as a whole would have had on the Andalusian region in particular. The model is of the neoclassical variety and includes not only the productive sectors of the economy but also the foreign sector and the government, which are usually absent from theoretical general equilibrium models. Both versions of the model are calibrated by using a Social Accounting Matrix of Andalusia for 1995. The analysis shows that the reform is not selfâ€ financing, not even partially, despite governmental claims. It also indicates that there is a positive but smaller than anticipated economic stimulus. In welfare terms, we find that the category of Urban Salaried consumers is the one that benefits the most in real income terms.
