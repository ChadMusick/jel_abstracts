H54|Termination Fees and Contract Design in Public-Private Partnerships|We study the eï¬€ects of granting an exit option that enables the private party to early terminate a PPP project if it turns out to be loss-making. In a continuous-time setting with hidden information about stochastic operating proï¬ ts, we show that a revenue-maximizing government can optimally trade-oï¬€ direct subsidies for capital investment against the right of opting out the PPP. In particular, the exit option, acting as a risk-sharing device, can soften agency problems and increase the value-for-money of public spending, even while taking into account the budgetary resources needed to resume the project in the event of early termination by the contractor.

H54|Financing low-carbon generation in the UK: The hybrid RAB model|Decarbonising electricity is a critical first step in mitigating climate damage but low/zero-carbon generation is very capital intensive. Its cost depends critically on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Three factors combine to make a low WACC both desirable and feasible in the UK. First, the Stern Report argues for a low social discount rate (1.4% real) for investments in climate mitigation. Second, global and UK real interest rates have been falling steadily - UK gilt index-linked 20-year rates have fallen from +4% in 1995 to -2% (negative) in 2019. CCS and nuclear have long lifetimes over which to recover their capital cost, longer than commercial finance would accept without guarantees, in contrast to renewables where off-take contracts have proven sufficient. Nuclear power faces the additional investment challenge of lengthy uncertain construction. No nuclear plant has ever been built privately without substantial regulatory guarantees. The Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model can address these financing problems for long-lived low-carbon assets. The benefits of placing risk on developers to motivate cost control are small compared to the extra costs of a higher weighted average cost of capital (WACC). A hybrid RAB model (like that used for the Thames Tideway Tunnel)—with excess cost sharing and a cost cap—can reduce risk to deliver an adequately low WACC by accessing infrastructure funds that do not require extensive specialised project knowledge. If the risk of excess costs is spread over the 27 million households and other customers taking two-thirds of electricity, each would bear minimal risk and the cumulative cost would be significantly lower. The levelized cost at the WACC (3.5% real) is £53/MWh if on time and budget, which should be compared with a counterfactual in which all the risk is placed on the company requiring a contract-for-difference with a strike price of £96/MWh for the life of the project (equal to the levelized cost). The levelised cost to consumers if on time and budget would be £50/MWh and in the worst case with a 48% cost over-run, £64/MWh.
H54|The Personnel Requirements and Costs of New Military Space Organizations|In this report, CBO considers five ways in which the Department of Defense (DoD) might be reorganized to increase its focus on space. The Administration has proposed three of themâ€”creating a new military service within the Air Force, a new combatant command, and a new development agencyâ€”but has provided few details.
H54|Federal Investment, 1962 to 2018|The federal government pays for a wide range of goods and services that are expected to be useful some years in the future. Those purchases, called investment, fall into three categories: physical capital, education and training, and research and development. In 2018, the federal government spent $492 billion on investment, which represented 12 percent of federal spending and 2 percent of GDP.
H54|Priority roads: The political economy of Africa's interior-to-coast roads|Africa's interior-to-coast roads are well suited to export natural resources, but not to support regional trade. Are they the optimal resourse to geography and comparative advantage, or the result of suboptimal political distortions? We investigate the political determinants of road paving in West Africa across the 1965-2012 period. Controlling for geography and the endogeneity of democratization, we show that autocracies tend to connect natural resource deposits to ports, while the networks expanded in a less interior-to-coast way in periods of democracy. This result suggests that Africa's interior-to-coast roads are at least in part the result of suboptimal political distortions.

H54|The Impact of EU Funds on Regional Economic Growth of the Czech Republic|This research paper aims to estimate the impact of European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) on economic growth of the Czech Republic during the period 2004-2015 using panel data regression techniques. ESIF are instruments of European economic and social cohesion policies. The primary goal of these policies is to foster economic growth and convergence among the member states of the European Union through the reallocation of financial resources from ESIF. During 2004-2015, the Czech Republic was involved in three programming periods in which projects of an approximate value of 939 billion CZK were supported and implemented. The contribution from ESIF was approximately 757 billion CZK while 182 billion CZK were allocated from national resources. Besides the standard panel data regression techniques like pooled OLS or FE, a spatial panel data econometric method is employed. Evidence of this research shows a positive relationship between ESIF and economic growth of NUTS3 regions of the Czech Republic. Furthermore, the results also suggest economic convergence among NUTS3 regions of the Czech Republic.
H54|Economic and Political Factors in Infrastructure Investment: Evidence from Railroads and Roads in Africa 1960--2015|Transport investment has played an important role in the economic development of many countries. Starting from a low base, African countries have recently initiated several massive transportation infrastructure projects. However, surprisingly little is known about the current levels, past evolution, and correlates of transportation infrastructure in Africa. In this paper, we introduce a new data set on the evolution of the stocks of railroads (1862-2015) and multiple types of roads (1960-2015) for 43 sub-Saharan African countries. First, we compare our estimates with those from other available data sets, such as the World Development Indicators of the World Bank. Second, we document the aggregate evolution of transportation investments over the past century in Africa. We confirm that railroads were a ``colonial'' transportation technology, whereas paved roads were a ``post-colonial'' technology. We also highlight how investment patterns have followed economic patterns. Third, we report conditional correlations between 5-year infrastructure growth and several geographic, economic and political factors during the period 1960-2015. We find strong correlations between transportation investments and economic development as well as more political factors including pre-colonial centralization, ethnic fractionalization, European settlement, natural resource dependence, and democracy.

H54|Wohnungsmarkt und Wohnungspolitik in Deutschland: Situation und Optionen|Die Situation am deutschen Wohnungsmarkt ist aktuell Gegenstand einer gesellschaftlichen Diskussion. Ein deutlicher Nachfrageüberhang, der sich vorwiegend â€“ aber nicht ausschließlich â€“ auf urbane Räume konzentriert, hat in den letzten Jahren zu einem deutlichen Preisanstieg sowohl bei den Immobilien als auch bei den Mieten geführt. Da die Mehrheit der Menschen in Deutschland zur Miete wohnt, betrifft diese Entwicklung eine große Gruppe. Mit den Zielen den Ausgleich am Wohnungsmarkt zu befördern und Wohnraum sozialverträglich, d.h. allen Bevölkerungsgruppen unter Berücksichtigung der Leistungsfähigkeit, zugänglich zu machen, gibt es in Deutschland eine Reihe wohnungspolitischer Maßnahmen und Eingriffe. Die Passgenauigkeit dieser Interventionen ist vor dem Hintergrund der Wohnungsmarktentwicklung der letzten Jahre kritisch zu überprüfen. Mit dem vorliegenden Aufsatz soll eine Bestandaufnahme über die Entwicklung und gegenwärtige Situation am Wohnungsmarkt gegeben werden. Hierbei liegt der Fokus zum einen auf der Herausarbeitung angebots- und nachfrageseitiger Ursachen, zum anderen werden die wesentlichen wohnungspolitischen Instrumente (Subventionen, Steuern, Preiseingriffe) im Hinblick auf Ziele und Wirkungen erläutert. Aufbauend auf dieser Bestandsaufnahme werden acht wohnungs(markt)politische Implikationen abgeleitet und zur Diskussion gestellt.
H54|The impact of cumulative tonnes on track failures: An empirical approach|Cost-benefit analysis is often used in appraisal of rail infrastructure investments. A corresponding decision support is, however, not available for rail infrastructure maintenance and renewal. To for example decide whether to renew or continue to maintain an infrastructure asset, a relationship between cumulative traffic and infrastructure failures is required. This relationship is established in this paper, using an empirical (top-down) approach on Swedish data for years 2003 to 2016. It is shown that the average elasticity for track failures with respect to cumulative tonnes is 0.32, and that the elasticity varies for different levels of traffic and for different infrastructure characteristics. The results in this paper can for example be used to calculate the impact cumulative tonnes have on train delay costs, which together with a relationship between cumulative traffic and infrastructure maintenance costs are essential in an economic optimization of maintenance and renewal activities.
H54|How Do Parents Respond to Regulation of Sugary Drinks in Child Care? Evidence from California|To reduce sugar intake in children, California regulates the provision of sugar-sweetened beverages and juice by child care facilities. The regulation may reduce children's consumption of sugary beverages in the short run and weaken their preferences for sugary drinks in the long run. Whether these objectives are achieved depends on how parents respond to the regulation by providing sugary drinks at home. Using detailed scanner data of grocery purchases, we find that affected California households increased their juice purchases right after the regulation became effective. However, this increase disappears after one year. Moreover, we find no increase in the purchases of sugary substitutes. Our findings suggest that parents provide more juice for their children after child cares limit their juice provision, but such offsetting behavior disappears after one year. Regulating the consumption of sugary drinks in child cares may be an effective policy to lower children's preferences for sugary drinks.

In particular, we study how a targeted public investment policy could protect the most female labour-intensive sectors from increased competition from European products. Using a computable general equilibrium approach, we show that an increase in public investment in the sectors most affected by the implementation of the EPA has a positive impact on women's unemployment rate and wage rates.
H54|Development Charges in Ontario:Is Growth Paying for Growth?|Ontario’s Development Charges Act (DCA) provides the legal framework within which municipalities recover growth-related capital costs from the new development giving rise to such costs. While the purpose of the DCA is to ensure that growth pays for itself, the way the DCA is designed prevents it from achieving its obvious goal. Because of its overly prescriptive and complex provisions, and because it forces municipalities to charge existing ratepayers for some of the costs of growth, the DCA undermines municipal efficiency, equity, and accountability. One barrier to legislative reform of the DCA is the absence in the literature of a rigorous economic rationale for funding growth-related capital works with development charges. This paper develops such a rationale by comparing development charges to alternative methods of cost recovery for growth-related capital works. A review of the shortcomings of the DCA leads to a recommendation that the DCA be replaced by a new development charges section in the Municipal Act and City of Toronto Act that would enhance municipal efficiency, equity, and accountability, and ensure growth really does pay its own way
H54|Liquidity, the government balance sheet, and the public sector discount rate|This paper provides a review of the modern finance literature examining how liquidity affects the private sector demand for real assets and financial securities. This literature shows that when firms evaluate risky investments they distinguish fundamental earnings risk and liquidity risks, and choose discount rates that link the discount rates they use to the liquidity and structure of their balance sheets. The government can mimic their behaviour by adopting a procedure that (i) ranks projects by discounting their expected costs and benefits by a low ‘fundamental earnings’ discount rate, perhaps 4 – 5 percent; and (ii) imposes a second ‘liquidity’ discount based on the government’s balance sheet structure and debt objectives that simultaneously determines the quantity of investments. By more closely copying private sector practice, this approach will directly link the quantity of investments that a government makes to the discount rates it uses. It will also enable the New Zealand government to reduce the discount rates it uses to evaluate long horizon investments without compromising its aim of ensuring the public and private sectors adopt a common method of evaluating investment projects.
H54|The Welfare Effects of Transportation Infrastructure Improvements|We develop a general equilibrium geographic framework to characterize the welfare effect of transportation infrastructure investments. We tackle three distinct but conflating challenges: First, we offer an analytical characterization of the routing problem and, in particular, how infrastructure investment between any two connected locations decreases the total trade costs between all pairs of locations. Second, we characterize how this cost reduction affects welfare within a standard general equilibrium geography setup where market inefficiencies arise due to agglomeration and dispersion spillovers. Finally, we show how our framework admits analytical characterizations of traffic congestion, which creates a critical --albeit tractable--feedback loop between trade costs and the general equilibrium economic system. We apply these results to calculate the welfare eects of improving each of the thousands of segments of the U.S. national highway network. We nd large but heterogeneous welfare eects with the largest gains concentrated in metropolitan areas and along important trading corridors
H54|Public Infrastructure Provision in the Presence of Terms-of-Trade Effects and Tax Competition|This paper analyses and compares the performance of carbon taxes and capital taxes in financing public goods with positive effects on private firm productivity. It is motivated by Franks et al. (2017), who ask whether using carbon taxes could be motivated on fiscal grounds rather than by environmental ones, arguing that the advantage of the carbon tax consists in its potential to reap foreign resource rents. I employ an analytical general equilibrium framework of n identical countries, where local firms use internationally mobile capital and imported fossil fuel and in production as well as local public infrastructure. The latter is financed solely by either taxing the input of fossil fuels (carbon tax) or capital. The choice of the policy instrument is exogenous to policy makers and symmetric across countries. I find that the effect of policy on the fossil fuel price (terms-of-trade effect) leads to higher public good provision under carbon taxation. However, tax-competition could cause either policy instrument to yield higher provision depending on how strongly either tax base reacts to changes in the tax rate. And finally, I conclude that the ranking of the two policy scenarios is ambiguous when considering tax competition and the terms-of-trade effect simultaneously. A numerical exercise shows cases for higher provision of either policy.
H54|Public investment and economic activity in Mexico, 1925-1981|Mexican economic historiography recognizes the key role that public investment played in the country's economic performance from the post-revolutionary period until the beginning of the economic liberalization that began in the mid-1980s. However, there is no concrete empirical evidence that this was the case. In this study, the authors construct a historical database of public investment - both total and broken down into its main components - for the period from 1925 to 1981, in order to measure the impact it had on economic activity. Given the possible presence of crowding-out effects between public investment and private investment, in their analysis the authors control for the latter. The results suggest that public investment had a significant impact on output one which varies depending on the category of public investment considered.
H54|10 Jahre Schuldenbremse: Ein Konzept mit Zukunft?|"Aus historischer Perspektive war die Einführung der Schuldenbremse vor 10 Jahren begründet worden. Im Vergleich zu Anfang der 60er Jahre hatte sich die Schuldenstandquote trotz Konso-lidierungsbemühungen unaufhaltsam von rund 20 auf 80 Prozent mehr als vervierfacht. Zudem war aufgrund eines Zinses für Staatsanleihen oberhalb der Zuwachsrate des Bruttoinlandspro-dukts anzunehmen, dass öffentliche Kreditfinanzierung eine intergenerative Umverteilung zu-lasten künftiger Generationen zur Folge hatte. Auf den ersten Blick scheint diese Art der finanziellen Selbstbindung erfolgreich zu sein, denn die Schuldenstandquote näherte sich in den vergangenen Jahren der Maastricht-Grenze von 60 Prozent an. Ob die Schuldenbremse durch verstärkte Konsolidierungsbemühungen tatsächlich dazu beigetragen hat, ist jedoch fraglich, denn die Staatskonsumquote ist heute auf gleichem Niveau wie zu ihrer Einführung. Vielmehr erscheinen die sinkende Zinsenlast, ein Anstieg des realen Steueraufkommens je Einwohner sowie der beachtliche Beschäftigungsaufbau der letz-ten Jahre für fiskalische Spielräume gesorgt zu haben. Mit dem günstigen Zinsumfeld haben sich die Bedingungen für die öffentliche Verschuldung seit der Wirtschafts- und Finanzkrise 2009 grundlegend geändert. Eine intergenerative Umvertei-lung zulasten künftiger Generationen ist deshalb derzeit und absehbar nicht mehr gegeben. An-gesichts eines unübersehbar großen Investitionsbedarfs mindert die Schuldenbremse den poli-tischen Handlungsspielraum und entbehrt einer ökonomischen Grundlage. Im Sinne der ""Gol-denen Regel der Finanzpolitik"" sollte sie daher innovations- und wachstumspolitisch umgesetzt werden. Eine Möglichkeit hierzu bestünde in der Auslagerung kreditfinanzierter gesamtstaatlicher Inves-titionen in einen bundesstaatlichen Vermögenshaushalt. Zudem sollte eine bessere Finanzaus-stattung der Gemeinden den kommunalen Investitionsrückstand adressieren. Außerhalb der In-vestitionsausgaben bliebe es bei der Schuldenbremse, d.h. beim grundsätzlichen Verbot der Kreditfinanzierung mit konjunkturpolitisch symmetrischer Öffnung."
H54|A retrospective study on the regional benefits and spillover effects of high-speed broadband networks: Evidence from German counties|There is still hardly any empirical evidence on how divergent broadband technologies, and, by extension, bandwidth levels, influence GDP growth, or on the extent of spatial externalities at a regional level. Our study aims to assess the economic benefits of high-speed broadband networks within and across neighbouring counties in Germany. Utilizing a balanced panel dataset of 401 German counties with data from 2010-2015 as well as different panel estimation techniques, we find that the availability of high-speed broadband (which enables transfer rates of 50 Mbit/sec and higher) has a small but significant positive effect on regional GDP growth in the average German county, when compared to normal broadband availability. Furthermore, we find that broadband deployment in German counties induces substantial economic benefits in terms of direct effects and regional externalities. According to our main estimation results, an increase in bandwidth coverage of 50 Mbit/sec and higher by one percentage point induces arise in regional GDP of 0.05%. This effect is almost doubled if we also take regional externalities into account and is of particular relevance for urban counties. Furthermore, our cost-benefit analysis suggests substantial efficiency gains, as the total economic benefits of subsidy programs to encourage broadband expansion substantially exceeded their associated costs.

H54|Making the most of tourism in Indonesia to promote sustainable regional development|Tourism has boomed in Indonesia in recent years and is already one of the main sources of foreign-currency earnings. Indonesia has rich and diverse natural assets, whose tourism potential remains underutilised. The government has an ambitious target of attracting 20 million tourists by 2019, up from nearly 14 million in 2017. The main destination will continue to be Bali. Using Bali as the preferred development model, the government wants to develop other destinations, particularly through infrastructure programmes to improve connectivity, which is a longstanding challenge for tourism as well as for regional development more generally. Enhancing the tourism-related skills of local populations will provide them with expanded job opportunities. This calls for reforms to vocational education and training. Moreover, recent efforts by the authorities to improve the business environment need to continue, including through helping firms embrace digitalisation. Tourism may be growing too fast in some destinations without adequately taking into account sustainability issues, both for the environment and local communities. Better planning and co-ordination at all levels of government and across relevant policy areas can facilitate more sustainable tourism development.This Working Paper relates to the 2018 OECD Economic Survey of Indonesia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-indonesia.htm).
H54|Améliorer l’efficience de l’investissement public en France|L’investissement public a le potentiel de stimuler la demande à court terme, et des infrastructures appropriées peuvent aussi entraîner des gains de productivité et contribuer à rendre la croissance économique plus inclusive en garantissant une égalité d’accès au marché du travail, à l’éducation et aux soins de santé. Les investissements publics de la France sont élevés, et son stock de capital public est important. En particulier, le réseau d’infrastructures de la France est bien développé, et très bien classé si on le compare à celui d’autres pays. Pour autant, dans certains secteurs, le manque d’investissements d’entretien et de modernisation a sans doute nui à l’efficacité du capital investi dans les infrastructures existantes. Pour pouvoir bénéficier pleinement de ses investissements publics, la France doit renforcer et développer l’ensemble de sa stratégie pour relever plusieurs défis, consistant notamment à promouvoir les considérations d’efficience socio-économique dans le choix de ses projets d’investissement, à harmoniser les procédures s’étalant sur toute la durée de vie des investissements entre les différents secteurs et niveaux administratifs, et à concentrer les investissements de certains secteurs sur l’entretien et la qualité du stock de capital. En outre, comme les collectivités locales sont responsables de la plupart des investissements publics, il sera utile de poursuivre les efforts visant à répartir clairement les responsabilités entre les différents échelons administratifs pour pouvoir bénéficier d’économies d’échelle et de gamme. L’investissement public devrait aussi viser à atteindre les objectifs fixés dans les domaines de l’environnement, du numérique, de la recherche et de l’innovation pour permettre à la France de respecter ses engagements nationaux et internationaux et garantir une croissance plus vigoureuse et plus durable. Les choix opérés devront faire une place à l’investissement privé pour permettre la réalisation de ces objectifs et stimuler la croissance potentielle, notamment en développant une liste de projets prêts à financer et en ajustant de manière dynamique le soutien public aux politiques en matière d’énergie et de changement climatique. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE de la France 2019 (http://www.oecd.org/fr/economie/france-en-un-coup-d-oeil/)
H54|Tracking finance flows towards assessing their consistency with climate objectives|Achieving a low-greenhouse gas (GHG) development requires making finance flows consistent with this objective. In order to measure progress to date as well as inform future public action in this area, this paper calls for further efforts to track gross primary investments flows in new infrastructure and equipment and the refurbishment of such assets, as well underlying sources of finance. The proposed scope focuses on tangible fixed assets with a direct and significant impact on GHG emissions.
H54|Renegotiations and corruption in infrastructure: The Odebrecht case|In 2016, Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht was fined $2.6 billion by the US Department of Justice (DOJ). According to the plea agreement, between 2001 and 2016 Odebrecht paid $788 million in bribes in 10 Latin American and two African countries in more than 100 large projects. The DOJ estimated that bribe payments increased Odebrechtâ€™s profits by $2.4 billion. Judicial documents and press reports on the Odebrecht case reveal detailed information on the workings of corruption in the infrastructure sector. Based on these sources we establish five facts. First, for projects where Odebrecht paid bribes, renegotiations amounted to 71.3 percent of initial investment estimates, compared with 6.5 percent for projects where Odebrecht paid no bribes. Second, Odebrechtâ€™s bribes were of the order of one percent of a projectâ€™s final investment. Third, the profits Odebrecht obtained from bribes as well as its overall profits were small, somewhere between 1 and 4 percent of its sales. Fourth, the creation of the Division of Structured Operations (DSO) by Odebrecht in 2006 led to major reductions in the firmâ€™s costs of paying bribes and recipientsâ€™ costs of hiding the illegal proceeds. Fifth, following the creation of the DSO, Odebrechtâ€™s sales increased more than three-fold while its profits remained small. We build a model where firms compete for a project, anticipating a bilateral renegotiation at which their bargaining power is larger if they pay a bribe. Conditional on paying a bribe and cost dispersion among firms being small, firmsâ€™ profits are small in equilibrium. When one firm unilaterally innovates by reducing the cost of paying bribes, its market share increases substantially while profits, which are proportional both to the cost advantage and to the magnitude of bribes, remain small. A parametrization with the DOJâ€™s data suggests that Odebrecht enjoyed a substantial cost advantage in bribing, of the order of 70 percent.
H54|The impact of blackouts on the performance of micro and small enterprises: Evidence from Indonesia|Reliability of electricity supply is one of pressing challenges to many micro and small enterprises (MSEs) in developing countries. MSEs play a pivotal role in employment generation in these countries, but productivity of MSEs is relatively low. Little is known about how blackouts affect performance of MSEs. This paper is the first study to estimate the impact of power blackouts on productivity of manufacturing MSEs and to discuss the role of the government in addressing problem. We employ a pseudo-panel dataset covering six firm cohorts within 21 Indonesian national electricity company working areas from 2010 to 2015. Our identification strategy involves first examining blackouts determinants and then using these determinants as instruments in an IV dynamic panel fixed effects estimation while controlling for factors potentially affect productivity and correlated with blackouts. We find that electricity blackouts reduce the average labor productivity and the resultant loss amounts to approximately IDR 71.5 billion (USD 4.91 million) per year in Indonesia. Therefore, it is crucial to improve electricity supply reliability in developing countries. We find that introducing a captive generator as a way to cope with power outages, is positively associated with productivity, and MSEs that have captive generators benefit more when the power supply is poor. Our findings will assist policy makers to prioritize addressing power blackouts relative to other constraints MSEs face.
H54|Digitalization and the performance of micro and small enterprises in Yogyakarta, Indonesia|The world is going digital. Little is known about how this digitalization affects the performance of micro and small enterprises, one of the major foundations of the economy in developing countries but with relatively low productivity. This paper examines the causal impact of internet utilization, as a part of digitalization, on enterprise performance. We conducted a field survey among micro and small enterprises in Yogyakarta, the densest micro and small enterprise population province in Indonesia. The identification strategy exploits the fact that the differences in geographic topography produce conceivably exogenous variations in the strength of cellular signal that micro and small enterprises in various areas can receive to connect to the internet. We find that internet utilization has enabled micro and small enterprises to engage in the digital economy and has improved labor productivity and exports.
H54|Airport charges and marginal costs for Spanish airports before the process of partial privatization|Airport pricing is considered as one of the most relevant issues for policymakers. According transport policy, pricing schemes should be at least partially based on marginal costs. This article aims at comparing the most relevant aeronautical airport charges with their corresponding marginal costs for the Spanish airports in the period before the partial privatization process. To that end, we have built very detailed airport charge variables, and then, have estimated a flexible short-run variable cost function system using a panel of thirty-five airports over a 6-year period. The results show that the evolution of aeronautical airport charges does not follow the trend of marginal costs. Moreover, these charges are set above the shortrun marginal costs with the exception of the smallest and insular airports. Finally, we find the existence of non-neutral technological change and excess of capacity for the Spanish airports.
H54|The role of institutions in private participation in infrastructure revisited|This paper aims to examine institutional effects on the private participation in infrastructure (PPI) projects during the recent period for 2002-2017 with 117 sample economies, by using the PPI and the Worldwide Governance Indicators database of the World Bank. The study contributes to enriching the evidence by updating the sample time-horizon and by widening the coverage of sample economies. The main findings of this study are summarized as follow: the institutional role in promoting the PPI projects are clearly identified in terms of government governance indicators such as government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and control of corruption; in particular, the control of corruption, which is the controversial issue in the previous studies, is confirmed to be one of the important factors to boost the PPI projects; and the macroeconomic stability is also a significant contributor for the PPI projects.
H54|Influence of US Presidential Terms on S&P500 Index Using a Time Series Analysis Approach|This paper examines the influence of US presidential terms on the stock market by focusing on the S&P500 index. Fractional integration techniques, which are more general than other standard methods, are used and the results obtained produce interesting findings. It was found that during the second presidential terms, stock markets are less efficient and present higher degrees of persistence in their volatilities. This is observed independently of the political affiliations of the president in power. The volatility, in general, reflects the spillover of economic excesses at the end of the first presidential term when seeking re-election into the second term in office. Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies at the end of the first term may create disequilibria in the economy which are amplified in the second term through a transmission mechanism resulting in contractionary interventionist policies in a situation where no incentive for re-election exists by the incumbent
H54|Gasto Público Social, Gobernanza y Desarrollo Humano: Una Aplicación con Datos Municipales de Bolivia: 1994-2008<BR>[Social Public Expenditure, Governance and Human Development: An Application with Municipal Data of Bolivia: 1994-2008]|In this opportunity, we analyze the relationship among public social spending, governance and human development based on cross-sectional sample of data from more than 300 municipalities of Bolivia. Considering the municipal statistical information, we estimate a multiple linear regression model with instrumental variables, using least squares in two stages. We have instrumentalized the public social expenditure variable through an efficiency government index (governance). In the first stage, we have found that government efficiency explains the differences in total social public expenditure per capita executed between 1997 and 2005. In the second stage, we find a positive effect of total social public expenditure per capita executed between 1997 and 2005 on human development, measured in 2005. Therefore, estimates reveal that higher levels of social public spending tend to generate a higher level of human development in municipalities where government efficiency is higher. In quantitative terms, the results reveal that, keeping the rest of the variables constant and considering the importance of government efficiency, if the total social public expenditure per capita executed during 1997 to 2005 had increased by Bs 100 per capita, then human development measured in 2005, it would have increased by 6.6%.
H54|How (Not) to Foster Innovations in Public Infrastructure Projects|The government wants an infrastructure-based public service to be provided. First the infrastructure has to be built, subsequently it has to be operated. Should the government bundle the building and operating tasks in a public-private partnership? Or should it choose traditional procurement, i.e. delegate the tasks to different firms? Each task entails unobservable investments to come up with innovations. It turns out that depending on the nature of the innovations, bundling may either stimulate or discourage investments. Moreover, we find that if renegotiation cannot be prevented, a public-private partnership may lead the government to deliberately opt for a technologically inferior project.
H54|Impact of Road Infrastructure Investments on the Structural Competitiveness of the Burkina Faso Economy|This article assesses the impact of road infrastructure investments on the structural competitiveness of Burkina Faso's economy. After retaining the period from 1980 to 2015, the estimate of the Model to Error Correction (ECM) revealed that investment in road infrastructure positively and significantly affects the structural competitiveness of the economy. However, this incidence varies over time. In fact, the elasticity of structural competitiveness compared to road investments is 0.06 in the short term and 0.32 in the long term. In view of these results, it appears that the implication of economic policy that emerges is that an increase in investment in road infrastructure is a policy of gaining structural competitiveness of the country's economy.
H54|Non-linear effects of investment in road infrastructure on the structural competitiveness of the economy: the case of Burkina Faso|This paper assesses the non-linear effects of road infrastructure investment on the structural competitiveness of Burkina Faso's economy. After retaining the period from 1980 to 2015, the quadratic and spline estimation revealed a non-linearity between the structural economy competitiveness and investment in road infrastructure. Indeed, the quadratic estimate identified non lineary U-shaped inverted with an optimal threshold of 10.11%. With regard to the spline estimation, it also highlighted this nonlinearity and gave an optimal interval of [5%;15%]. The economic policy implication that emerges from these results is that in order to benefit from optimal structural competitiveness, the investment’s share in road infrastructure in the total investment budget must be between5% and 15%.
H54|Public Infrastructure Provision and Ethnic Favouritism: Evidence from South Africa|Does ethnic favouritism in administrative governments affect public infrastructure provision? While previous literature has studied the effects of ethnic favouritism on economic growth and development determinants, there has been limited empirical evidence on ethnic favouritism in public infrastructure provision, particularly in South Africa. We study the effects of ethnic favouritism on provision of water and electricity infrastructure. Using municipal-level data for 52 district municipalities from 1996 to 2016, we find that coethnic municipalities are associated with higher growth in infrastructure relative to non-coethnic municipalities. The results remain robust to time and municipal fixed effects, as well as dynamic specifications. Additionally, we construct a counterfactual scenario to confirm our results.
H54|Cost Benefit Analysis of a Regional Arterial PPP Toll Road Project: A Case Study of the Proposed R-1 Toll Road|Road infrastructure is of vital importance for the economic development of a country. Roads facilitate the movement of people, goods, services and resources. Traditionally, public infrastructure such as roads has been provided using national budgetary resources. Over time the participation of the private sector has increased in the procurement and provision of road infrastructure. Public authorities have been partnering with the private sector due to the limitation of capital to undertake such projects. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) of various forms have been used extensively in road transportation projects as an alternative to state and local government procurement and provision of road infrastructure. The objective of this study is to undertake an integrated investment appraisal of a proposed PPP toll road project in the Southern African country of Zimbabwe using Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA).
H54|The Welfare Effects of Transportation Infrastructure Improvements|We develop a general equilibrium geographic framework to characterize the welfare effect of transportation infrastructure investments. We tackle three distinct but conflating challenges: First, we offer an analytical characterization of the routing problem and, in particular, how infrastructure investment between any two connected locations decreases the total trade costs between all pairs of locations. Second, we characterize how this cost reduction affects welfare within a standard general equilibrium geography setup where market inefficiencies arise due to agglomeration and dispersion spillovers. Finally, we show how our framework admits analytical characterizations of traffic congestion, which creates a critical – albeit tractable – feedback loop between trade costs and the general equilibrium economic system. We apply these results to calculate the welfare effects of improving each of the thousands of segments of the U.S. national highway network. We find large but heterogeneous welfare effects, with the largest gains concentrated in metropolitan areas and along important trading corridors.
H54|Quality Infrastructure Investment: Ways to Increase the Rate of Return for Infrastructure Investments|Private–public partnerships in infrastructure have been advocated for many years. Investors currently receive a low rate of return on infrastructure investment. This is because the main sources of revenue from infrastructure investment are user charges. For example, user charges for a water supply cannot be increased since water is a necessary good for everyone. However, a water supply can help to develop regions. For example, new apartments can be constructed, and new businesses can be created in the region where the water is supplied. From this, property tax, corporate income tax, and income tax revenues will rise. In the past, these increased tax revenues have gone to the government rather than being returned to infrastructure investors. If these increased tax revenues were to be returned to investors, the rate of return would rise significantly. Hometown investment trust funds can also provide financing for start-up businesses along with the new infrastructure investments. Land acquisition creates huge difficulties for completing infrastructure investment. Land trusts will solve the issue of owners not wanting to sell their land by giving them the option to keep it and instead lease the land to infrastructure companies and receive long-term rent income, for example for 99 years. In this way, land trusts will smoothen the use of land and transfer the usage rights to infrastructure companies.
H54|Public Investment Fiscal Multipliers: An Empirical Assessment For European Countries|This paper aims to estimate fiscal multipliers in eleven Eurozone countries. To do this, we make use of yearly data provided by the OECD for the 1970–2016 period. By using the Local Projections approach on a panel dataset and considering different model specifications, we estimate the magnitude assumed by fiscal multipliers in order to assess whether an increase in government investment generates a ‘Keynesian effect’ on the level of the GDP. Our findings suggest that fiscal multipliers tend to be larger than one and an increase in public investment engenders a permanent and persistent effect on the level of output. Additional model specifications suggest that government investment fiscal multipliers are lower when the post-crisis period is excluded by our sample and are larger in Southern countries than Northern ones.
H54|Alienating Marx(ists) from the Cold War into Surveillance Capitalism|Marx?s Machine Age theory of capitalism ascribes a unique driving role for alienation and argues new modes of production emerge from past modes of production. Presently so-called surveillance capitalism is superseding Machine Age capitalism and distributing wealth unequally to a 1% global elite. There are debates about what alienation is at work in this changed epoch. Premised on Marx?s idea that modes of production are born in the previous epoch along with the alienation that works with them, a hypothesis about how today?s Internet enables both endless free speech, while inversely and simultaneously, enabling endless spying with impunity is presented here. The hypothesis is a conceptualization of alienation labeled as ?known unknown.? The adaption of the term ?known unknown alienation? stems from the discourse in the film, ?The Unknown Known? which highlights aspects of known unknown alienation, in the form of so-called national security experts who are mentally divided about what they can and can not know (or talk about) and also the divide between the expert and the taxpayer, who does not qualify to have access to the same information that the expert has. This personal internal contradiction and social alienation is compounded because Americans are proud of US constitutionally protected free speech rights (which according to The Citizens United Act allows corporations to be individuals); these contradictions help drive surveillance capitalism. The historical-comparative argument is: ?Communist hunting? intelligence agents, scientists, and contractors, backed by neoliberal economists, built a military-industrial-complex that obligated them to both known and not know, or in the case of the CIA be ?witting? of national security secrets, which alienated them from US constitutional free speech. Their alienation manifest in their interactive inventions - the Internet, pc and cell phone - devices that today dialectically give customers the ability to express free speech endlessly in electronic memory form, while inversely giving spies unlimited access to that speech with impunity. This process works in tandem: enabling appropriation of data for government surveillance and service fee payments for corporations.
H54|Neither crowding in nor out: Public direct investment mobilising private investment into renewable electricity projects|Rapid structural change towards a low-carbon energy supply requires significant additional investments into innovative but high-risk low-carbon technologies. Mobilising greater private investments requires applying the right policy instruments, but while fiscal measures and regulation have been well researched, systematic quantitative evidence about the effect of public direct investment is lacking. Absent empirical evidence, contradictory theoretical arguments claim that such public (co-)investments either â€˜crowd outâ€™ or â€˜crowd inâ€™ private investors. In this paper we show that the macroeconomic concept of crowding out/in is inapplicable to sectoral studies such as of renewable electricity. Instead, both neoclassical microeconomics and evolutionary economics suggest public direct investment to have a positive effect due to either externalities or market creation effects. We also provide the first quantitative estimate of the effect of public direct investment on private investment into renewable electricity technologies for 17 countries in the period 2004-2014. Using feasible generalised least squares (FGLS) and static and dynamic generalised method of moments (GMM) estimators, we find that public investments not only have a positive but also consistently the largest effect on private investment flows relative to feed-in tariffs, taxes and renewable portfolio standards in general, and for wind and solar technologies separately. Implications for policy aimed at accelerating the low-carbon transition are discussed.
H54|Potential Effects of Scaling-up Infrastructure in Peru: a General Equilibrium Model-based Analysis|This study assesses the potential economic impacts of investments dedicated to filling infrastructure gaps in Peru. By using a national database at the firm level, we start by empirically estimating the positive externalities of Peruvian infrastructure on private activities’ output. In the second step, these estimates are introduced in a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model used to conduct counterfactual simulations of various investment plans in infrastructure over a 15-year period. These simulations show to what extent scaling-up infrastructure could be a worthwhile strategy to achieve economic growth in Peru; however, they also show that these benefits depend on the choice of funding schemes related to such public spending.
H54|Autonomous, Connected, Electric Shared vehicles (ACES) and public finance: an explorative analysis|This paper discusses the implications of autonomous-connected-electric-shared vehicles (ACES) for public finance, which have so far been widely ignored. In OECD countries, 5-12% of federal and up to 30% of local tax revenue are currently from fuel and vehicle taxation. The diffusion of ACES will likely reduce these important sources of government revenues, while also affecting transport-related government expenditures. We argue that the realization of socioeconomic benefits of ACES depends on the implementation of tailored public finance policies. In particular, the introduction of road tolls in line with ‘user pays’ and ‘polluter pays’ principles will become more attractive. Moreover, innovation in taxation schemes to fit the changing technological circumstances may alter the (relative) importance of levels of governance in transport policy making, likely shifting power towards local (in particular urban) governmental levels. We finally argue that due to path-dependencies, and the risk of lock-in effects in sub-optimal public finance regimes, further research and near-term policy action regarding ACES is required.
H54|Productivity effects of an exogenous improvement in transport infrastructure: accessibility and the Great Belt Bridge|Most studies of the effects of transport infrastructure on the performance of individual firms have focused on marginal expansions of the rail or highway network over time. In this paper, we study the short-run effects of a large discrete shock in the quality of transport infrastructure, viz. the opening of the Great Belt bridge connecting the Copenhagen area with a neighboring island and the mainland of Denmark. We analyse the effect of the opening of the bridge on the productivity of firms throughout the country using a two-step approach: we estimate firm- and year-specific productivity for a large panel of individual firms, using the approaches developed by Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) and De Loecker (2011). Then, controlling for firm-fixed effects, we relate productivity to a calculated measure of accessibility that captures the effect of the opening of the bridge. We find large productivity effects for firms located in the regions near the bridge, especially for relatively small firms in the construction and retail industry. Estimation results further suggest statistically significant but small positive wage effects throughout the country, even in regions far from the bridge. Finally, there is some evidence that the bridge has stimulated new activities in the Copenhagen region at the expense of firms disappearing on the neighboring island Funen.
H54|The Economic Impact of public private partnerships (PPPs) in Infrastructure, Health and Education: A Review|This paper summarizes what is known about the impact of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure (energy, transport, water and sanitation, and telecommunications), education, and health. It reviews evaluations of the effectiveness of PPPs and, whenever possible, the implications for coverage and affordability. For infrastructure, there is some evidence of PPPs leading to gains in labor productivity, as most transitions to private participation have entailed significant labor downsizing, but only mixed support for improvements in total factor productivity or quality, coverage, and affordability. Selection issues plague most available studies, calling for caution when considering the conclusions. For education, micro-level studies shows that PPPs have the potential to increase enrollment and respond to a growing demand for education, but that their impact on educational outcomes appears to depend greatly on the institutional details and the scale of the programs considered. Finally, PPPs appear to be likely to increase socio-economic and ethnic segregation in education systems. Finally, there is inconclusive evidence of an impact of PPPs on health service utilization, the quality of services, patient satisfaction and health-related outcomes. The review points to the need to identify the reasons for service under-utilization, such as lack of information on the side of users, poor quality of services, before implementing interventions, and to combine demand- and supply-side policies if needed. Overall, more work appears to be due to rigorously evaluate the impact of PPPs, especially regarding infrastructure and health.
H54|Semi-endogenous growth models with domestic and foreign private and public R&D linked to VECMs|We present semi-endogenous growth models with total-factor productivity as functions of domestic and foreign private and public R&D. In a small country case with a Cobb-Douglas TFP production function, foreign R&D drives steady-state growth and the production function can be a long-term relation in a vector-error-correction model. Marginal productivity conditions can be long-term relations for a vector-error-correction model if the functional form is of a Cobb-Douglas type or a CES function generalised to a VES function. In case of a VES function, steady states exist only for special cases of parameter restrictions.
H54|Sustainable finance for inclusive growth in Thailand|The Partnerships pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development cuts across all the goals focusing on the mobilisation of resources needed to implement the agenda. Thailand’s “sufficiency economy philosophy” encourages the prioritisation of long-term sustainability over short-term benefits. As such, Thailand has a long history of fiscal prudence that has served the country well in times of economic and political instability. However, relying on current fiscal buffers to finance foreseeable expenditure pressures is not sufficient or sustainable. A rapidly ageing population and shrinking workforce will weigh on future public finances and on the ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. To ensure that Thailand is well placed over the medium term to meet growing social, environmental and infrastructure requirements, the government should: (i) increase tax revenues by broadening the tax base and enhancing collection efficiency; (ii) facilitate greater private sector investment in productive infrastructure; and (iii) reform the healthcare and pension systems to increase their efficiency and effectiveness. This Working Paper relates to the Initial Assessment report of the Multi-dimensional Country Review of Thailand. (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/multi-dimensional-review-thailand.htm)
H54|Relancer l'investissement en Tunisie|Depuis le début des années 2000, le taux d'investissement a fléchi, tiré par la baisse de l'investissement des entreprises. Son niveau est faible par rapport à celui d'autres pays émergents. Les principales causes sont : des réglementations excessives sur le marché des produits, associées à des procédures administratives complexes, une fiscalité peu prévisible, des difficultés croissantes pour le passage des biens en douane et le transport maritime des marchandises ainsi qu’un système financier peu favorable aux jeunes entreprises et à celles en forte croissance. La levée de ces contraintes est essentielle pour relancer l'investissement des entreprises et, avec lui, la productivité, la création d'emplois, la compétitivité et le pouvoir d'achat de tous les tunisiens. La nouvelle loi sur l'investissement, en simplifiant le régime des autorisations, est un pas dans la bonne direction mais devra être pleinement mise en oeuvre et accompagnée par d'autres réformes. Il serait aussi souhaitable de mieux cibler les actions de l'État pour soutenir l'investissement, et notamment d'évaluer systématiquement l'impact et les bénéficiaires des incitations fiscales, y compris celles en faveur du logement. Parallèlement, il faut mieux gérer les infrastructures existantes et prioriser les projets d'infrastructure.
H54|Boosting investment in Greece|Aggregate investment has declined markedly over the crisis and has yet to recover. Reviving domestic and foreign investment is crucial to supporting the economic recovery, deepen Greece’s integration into global value chains and raising living standards. This will hinge primarily on improving the business environment, by lifting barriers to product market competition and enhancing the quality of regulation. Other key policies involve fully implementing the recent insolvency reforms, building an innovation system, overcoming problems in the banking sector and enhancing the quality of public investment through a long-term strategy. This Working Paper relates to the 2018 OECD Economic Survey of Greece. (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-greece.htm).
H54|Termination Fees and Contract Design in Public-Private Partnerships|We study the effects of granting an exit option that enables the private party to early terminate a PPP project if it turns out to be loss-making. In a continuous time setting with hidden information about stochastic operating profits, we show that a revenue-maximizing government can optimally trade-off direct subsidies for capital investment against the right of opting out the PPP. In particular, the exit option, acting as a risk-sharing device, can soften agency problems and increase the value-for-money of public spending, even while taking into account the budgetary resources needed to resume the project in the event of early termination by the contractor.
H54| The determinants of private investment in a mining export economy. Peru: 1997-2017| Peru is an economy where about 60 percent of exports are mineral, of which copper, in turn, represents half. What is the weight of international factors and domestic factors in determining private investment in this mining export economy? In this paper, we identify the dominant influence of international conditions on the evolution of private investment in Peru, as well as the enormous individual weight of the price of exports in this evolution. In the period 1997-2017, external factors explained 54, 64 and 44 percent of the variance in the growth rate of total private investment, mining investment, and non-mining investment, respectively; while more than half of the weight of external factors was explained by the price of exports. On the other hand, internal factors explained 46, 36 and 56 percent of the variance in the growth rate of total private investment, mining investment. and non-mining investment; while about 40 percent of the weight of domestic factors was explained by public investment. These findings are important because they show the price of exports to be the main channel connecting private investment in Peru with the world economy, and public investment as the most effective policy variable affecting it.

H54|The wider economic benefits of transport corridors: a policy framework and illustrative application to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor|This article discusses a new policy framework to appraise proposals of large transport infrastructure investmentsâ€”transport corridorsâ€”and applies it to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The framework emphasises the need to focus appraisal on the ultimate benefits that households along a corridor and, more generally, society, can attainâ€”such as increased consumption, better jobs and greater equity. It also emphasises the need to identify and manage trade-offs. The appraisal framework is applied to Pakistanâ€™s portion of the CPEC. Simulations suggest important heterogeneous impacts of CPEC among districts in Pakistan stemming from variations in restrictions on land use and in secondary education across connected districts.
H54|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.
H54|Government Procurement and the Growth of Small Firms|I estimate the causal effects of demand shocks, stemming from government procurement, on the growth of small firms in Ecuador. I assemble a unique dataset using several new administrative sources and, as identification strategy, exploit a governmental procurement process that allocates public contracts through a randomized contest. This paper provides three main contributions to the literature. First, it shows the positive and significant effect of demand shocks on firm growth. On average, an increase in demand of 10% will increase wage expenses by 4% and fixed assets by 5% during the year of the shock. Second, it finds no evidence of spill-over effects from demand shocks on sales to the public or private sector. Finally, as in other studies, it is shown that demand positively impacts firm growth but, contrary to other findings, this effect is temporary and only observed during the year of the shock.
H54|A permanent zero interest rate would maximise GDP|The arguments for government borrowing do not stand inspection, thus the effect of such borrowing is to artificially raise interest rates above their free market level. Since GDP is maximised where prices are at the free market level, absent good reasons for thinking otherwise, it follows that the GDP maximising rate of interest is zero, in the sense that no interest should be offered to those holding base money. It is just possible that there are arguments for a limited amount of borrowing to fund public investments like infrastructure, though conventional thinking on that point is chaotic at the moment. But even if that infrastructure idea is accepted, it does not change the above “permanent zero interest rate” conclusion.
H54|Powering India at Household Level: State Effort, Issues and Concerns|Even after 70 years of independence, a significant proportion of households in India are not having access to electricity. To correct this situation, the Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has announced recently a new scheme, Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, also called ‘Saubhagya’ scheme with an estimated expenditure of Rs. 16,320 crore. This brief note attempts to review this scheme through SWOT analysis along with providing some background to the State Effort in powering India at the household level.
H54|The Decommissioning of the Middle Class|": The euro crisis has threatened the balance of social structures, through the impoverishment of the middle class, in almost all countries of the Old Continent. This trend has not only posed a threat to social cohesion, but it also threats the very nature of the so-called Western-style Democracy. The reason for this is that there is a class that has always been a ""cushion"" that absorbs both the vibrations of competition and the confrontation of the social elite with the socially weak, offering the latter the ability to overcome their misery. In most capitalist economies, the middle class label is based on an economic definition that is largely based on a lifestyle that is based on a certain economic robustness and endurance. With the deepening of the crisis, however, the diversity of the middle class not only has it been jeopardized, but rather, it has gradually been replaced by a new demographic category called the prekariat. This new category consists of a group of people once in the middle class and currently marginalized. All of this leads to generalized uncertainty and totally unstable political attitudes, with intense mobility at the extremes. The rapid rise of right and left-wing populism is an aspect of the threatened subjugation of the middle class strata. The consequences for societies when their layered center is lost are obvious and significant."
H54|Il rapporto tra capitale pubblico e altre variabili macroeconomiche: analisi della letteratura<BR>[The relationship between public capital and other macroeconomic variable: a literature review]|This work critically analyses all the contributions in public investment theory. Particularly I discuss the relationship between the stock of public capital and some macroeconomic variable such as output, employment and the stock of private capital. In other words, how the cited variables have an influence on each other? And if the answer is positive, how much is it? To do this it will be necessary to survey critically the literature developed around this topic beginning from the paper of Aschauer D.A. (1988), which represents the starting point of the debate. In fact, this matter of study explodes after his works. For this reason, we try to explain the main approaches in the literature about this field of research. Then we try to analyse the general question and the most important problems about the definition of public capital and the link with some macroeconomic variables and the private factors of production. Finally, we discuss the most problematic aspects from an econometric point of view. We also synthetize the most popular studies on this topic. We discovered most of these studies found a positive relationship of public capital respect to output, employment and the stock of private capital. There is now more consensus than in the past that public capital has a positive influence on the economic system of a country. However, the impact reported by recent studies is not as big as some earlier papers suggested.
H54|Il rapporto tra capitale pubblico e altre variabili macroeconomiche: un'applicazione empirica<BR>[The relationship between public capital and other macroeconomic variables: an empirical application]|The issue of whether public capital is productive has received a great deal of attention in the last period, especially after the sovereign public debt crisis in some European countries. This work tries to estimate the dynamic effects of public capital on some macroeconomic variables (such as private capital, employment and economic growth measured as GDP), using the vector autoregressive methodology (especially the VECM – Vector Error Correction Model) for a set of some OECD countries with similar economic features (France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom and United States of America). The empirical analyses of public capital productivity is limited to a small sample of countries for which official capital stock estimates are available. The lack of data is always a big problem in the analyses of this problem. For this reason, we built a new database that provides internationally comparable capital stock estimates for the countries mentioned above. The empirical results suggest that there is evidence for positive output effects of public capital but not exactly the same for the other variables, employment and private capital.
H54|Econometric modelling of the link between investment and electricity consumption in Ghana|The study examines the long run effect of investment (proxied by gross fixed capital formation) on electricity consumption for Ghana, for the period 1971-2011, by employing annual time series secondary data from World Bank database (World development indicator). The Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Kwiatkowski-Philips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests were used to analyse the stationarity features of the data used in levels and in their first differences. The empirical verification was done using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag model (ARDL). The findings of the study indicate the data used are non-stationary in levels, however, stationary in their first difference. Investment and electricity consumption are cointegrated according to the cointegration test performed. There are both stable short run and long run relationship between investment and electricity consumption. Investment is an appropriate policy tool for electricity consumption management in both short run and long run. Further studies in the area of stationarity with structural breaks, cointegration with structural breaks, causality analysis, and multivariate modelling of investment-electricity consumption link is worth doing since the current study did not consider these issues.
H54|Enabling sustainable and inclusive irrigation development in Cambodia|Cambodia’s 16% of the total cultivated area (2.7 million hectare) is irrigated by 950 irrigation schemes most of which were developed by the government. Financing irrigation development in Cambodia has two problems: (a) shrinkage of funds for construction of ongoing or new canal network, leading to delay in completion of projects; (b) crunch for operation and maintenance. This paper, focuses on status of financing irrigation development laying stress on identifying options to fund the irrigation development more aggressively and sustainably. Further, possible approaches, governance reforms required in water sector, and supportive policy and legal aspects are discussed.
H54|Co-investments and African infrastructure deficit: Understanding and mitigating political risks in Conflicts Affected and Fragile States|This article through a qualitative assessment identifies political risks confronted by FDI in infrastructures project in African Conflicts Affected and Fragile (CAF) States and studies the structure for infrastructures financing which allows lessening political risks. Outside hydrocarbon sector which remains attractive even in a worse political context, African CAF regions infrastructures sector as other sectors remain unattractive to foreign investors. By considering global investors’ weak preferences for CAF countries infrastructures assets, due to high levels of political risks, we argue that: to fill the CAF States’ infrastructure gap and addressing at the same time political risks concern, an optimal solution is located in a strategic tricky balance between African SWFs as kick-started, Multi-Development Banks (MDBs) (like MIGA agency under the World Bank Group) and long-term institutional investors like foreign SWFs. In the initial phase, MDBs with both their flexibility and experience ought to help finance the riskiest phases of infrastructure projects after African SWFs have to identified bankable projects. In the second period, MDBs ought to disengage and transfer their mature green infrastructure projects to secure the path for a workable involvement of long-term institutional investors such as sovereign wealth funds. With the aim to foster a vast African infrastructure bonds’ markets in which the African CAF States could play a pivotal role, strengthening rules of law (regulatory and legal frames) should begin straightaway
H54|Impacts of Public Infrastructure Investment in South Africa: A SAM and CGE-Based Analysis of the Public Economic Sector|This paper assesses the general equilibrium impacts of public infrastructure investment in the South African economy by making use of complementary general equilibrium models, such as the social accounting matrix (SAM) multiplier, the Structural Path Analyses (SPA) and the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models. Both the SAM and CGE analyses indicate that increasing public economic infrastructure can be an effective way of stimulating the economy in a way that has a positive impact on labour. SPA shows that the main and most important path of influence is a direct influence of the public economic sector on each of the formal labour categories. However, because the public economic sector does not employ informal labour, this labour account is only connected indirectly via intermediate consumption of the construction sector output. This is an important outcome for South Africa, as the results suggest that an increase in public economic infrastructure could help address the problem of unemployment as well as that of low income levels that exacerbate poverty
H54|Digital Government: ICT and Public Sector Management in Africa|This study examines the effect of information and communication technologies (ICT) on public sector management in Africa for the period 1995–2015 using panel GMM model and Toda-Yamamoto causality tests. The empirical evidence shows that ICT has a positive and statistically significant effect on public sector management, meaning that an increase in ICT is associated with improved public sector management. There is also a bi-directional causality between ICT and public sector management, suggesting that ICT spurs public sector management which, in turn, spurs ICT even further. The public sector, civil society and international actors therefore have the responsibility to collaborate at developing policies and applications that will maximize the potentials of digital government to every level of public sector in Africa.
H54|Hazard Analysis on Public–Private Partnership Projects in Developing Asia|Developing Asia’s infrastructure gap results from both inadequate public resources and a lack of effective channel to mobilize private resources toward desired outcomes. The public–private partnership (PPP) mechanism has evolved to fill the infrastructure gap. However, PPP projects are often at risk of becoming distressed or worst being terminated because of the long-term nature of contracts and the many different stakeholders involved. This paper applies survival time hazard analysis to estimate how project-related, macroeconomic, and institutional factors affect the hazard rate of the projects. Empirical results show that government’s provision of guarantees, involvement of multilateral development banks, and existence of a dedicated PPP unit are important for a project’s success. Privately initiated proposals should be regulated and undergo a competitive bidding to reduce the hazard rate of the project and the corresponding burden to government. Economic growth leads to successful project outcomes. Improved legal and institutional environment can ensure PPP success.
H54|Deriving Macroeconomic Benefits from Public–Private Partnerships in Developing Asia|The provision of infrastructure and related services in developing Asia via public–private partnership (PPP) increased rapidly during the late 1990s. Theoretical arguments support the potential economic benefits of PPPs, but empirical evidence is thin. This paper develops a framework identifying channels through which economic gains can be derived from PPP arrangement. The framework helps derive an empirically tractable specification that examines how PPPs affect the aggregate economy. Empirical results suggest that increasing the ratio of PPP investment to GDP improves access to and quality of infrastructure services, and economic growth will potentially be higher. But this optimism is conditional, especially on the region’s efforts to further upgrade its technical and institutional capacity to handle complex PPP contracts.
H54|Public–Private Partnership Development in Southeast Asia|Infrastructure development in Southeast Asia has been financed mainly by public funds, which leave wide gaps in majority of countries. Governments have tried to attract the private sector by offering various schemes under public–private partnership (PPP). Typically, PPP contributes less than 1% of gross domestic product, while public finance greatly varies from about 2% to 10% of a country’s gross domestic product. Among major factors supporting PPP implementation, the following features are critical: coherent policy, public sector capacity to manage PPP appropriately, public sector willingness to have mutual relation with private partners, and leadership. Private participation is still continuously growing; and its implementation is not limited to hard infrastructure only, but also to social infrastructure.
H54|An Empirical Analysis of the Factors that Influence Infrastructure Project Financing by Banks in Select Asian Economies|A recent Asian Development Bank publication estimates the large infrastructure financing requirement in Asia for the period 2016–2030, which establishes the strong need to encourage private sector participation to meet investment requirements. This paper analyzes a critical aspect of expanding private finance to infrastructure by examining the role of bank lending to public–private partnership (PPP) projects through the project finance modality. The key empirical results suggest that project financing by banks to infrastructure PPP projects is still in its infancy in several Asian markets, and banks are guided more by macroeconomic factors and by the strength of their balance sheets. The key policy implications to unlock bank finance for infrastructure PPP projects lie in reducing macroeconomic risk factors and having well-capitalized banks. The latter assumes significance, given the higher capital requirements that banks are expected to fulfill, following the adoption of Basel III capital standards.
H54|Rationale and Institution for Public–Private Partnerships|Private–public partnership (PPP) methods are considered to be an effective way to narrow the gap between demand and supply of social infrastructure. If successfully pursued, PPP can deliver benefits to users, governments, and the private sector, or the so-called triple wins. Enhancing efficiency by reducing cost and time overruns is beneficial to users and governments, and better quality of service is expected via PPP. It will also examine the factors that have been important for shaping the county’s PPP landscape, including fiscal soundness, unsolicited project proposals, and the refinancing and renegotiation of PPPs. PPPs are not a must-have solution but an option for building and upgrading infrastructure. In conclusion, PPPs are being promoted because it can mobilize needed resources from the private sector, maximize value for money, bring creativity and efficiency to a project, and be a source of fiscal stimulus. That said, countries should be clear on why they are promoting the PPP modality for infrastructure.
H54|Traditional Procurement versus Public–Private Partnership: A Comparison of Procurement Modalities Focusing on Bundling Contract Effects|This paper studies the optimal structure of procurement contracts between public and private sectors by mainly comparing two typical procurement types: traditional procurement and public–private partnership (PPP). We first set up a principal–agent model focusing on bundling effects of procurement based on Hart (2003), and Iossa and Martimort (2015) to see under which conditions PPP has advantages over traditional procurement and vice versa. Then, we consider if the Republic of Korea’s PPP structure in practice is well designed to maximize efficiency regarding the theoretical model. By reviewing the data on major investors and equity transactions of the Republic of Korea’s PPP projects, we show that the bundling effects of PPP contracts, which is one of the main sources of efficiency, is limited under the current economic and political environment and derive policy implications for developing countries implementing PPP projects in the region.
H54|The Regional Economic Impacts of University Research and Science Parks|This paper focuses on the regional economic impacts of U.S. university research and science parks. Motivating this focus is the fact that the landscape for private-sector research is changing, and future research might well emphasize America’s “new geography of innovation.” Thus, university research and science parks might face, if they are not already doing so, pressure to retain current tenants and competition for future tenants. We find that only 11 of 146 research and science parks in the United States have, in the spirit of public accountability, conducted an economic impact study. One reason for the paucity of such studies is that universities are unfamiliar about how to conduct as well as how to interpret the findings from such a study. We offer an economic impact method for park administrators to follow if they proceed to document the regional economic impact of their park.
H54|A Juxtaposition Of Tax Expenditures And Direct Expenditures: Case Study Of The Manufacturing Sector Of Pakistan|Augmentation of investment is a primary goal for any government. To attain that objective it can resort to either tax or direct expenditures. In order to analyze which is a more efficient method in the case of Pakistan, the current study uses data from the country?s Manufacturing Sector. The time series data set since 1972 to 2013 is used. Bounds testing approach to cointegration used in the structure of Autoregressive Distributed Lag is employed for understanding the behavior of the different variables, applying Neo-Classical Investment theory. The results show the importance of tax expenditure policy, in the short run, through the cost of capital, as a determinant to boost private investment in the economy, under circumstances of low inflation. On the other hand, in high inflation periods, the direct expenditure is found to be more potent. The empirical evidence shows a strong role of direct expenditure in influencing both the short-run and the long-run behavior of investment in the economy.
H54|Institutional Economics: A Sketch of Economic Growth Policy|No abstract is available for this item.
H54|La realizzazione del Piano di Investimenti per l'Europa|The Investment Plan for Europe - which is known as the Juncker Plan and is aimed at European economic recovery â€“ is estimated to provide a relatively large amount of financial resources for SMEs and different areas of public infrastructure. This estimate was based on a high value of the multiplier that was forecasted and applied to the guarantees of the approved projects. At the end of the first period (2015-2017), it was considered appropriate to review some of the international scientific literature on this Plan, in order to analyse if the results achieved up until that point coincide with its initial objectives. The main outcome of this analysis - in contrast to the success attributed to the Plan by the European Commission - is that verification is substantially unattainable, since even the quantitative results thus far disseminated for the Juncker Plan have been obtained by estimates, which have never been illustrated in a comprehensive manner.
H54|Lo stock di capitale comunale: indicazioni per le politiche di intervento infrastrutturale di Regione Lombardia|Partendo dalle spese per investimento dei comuni lombardi nel periodo 2000-2015 e utilizzando il metodo dellâ€™inventario permanente si Ã¨ ricostruito lo stock di capitale pubblico a livello comunale per la regione Lombardia. Si mostra come alcune variabili come la popolazione e lâ€™altitudine influiscano sullo stock di infrastrutture esistente. Per meglio comprendere le determinanti dello stock di infrastrutture pro-capite comunale, si Ã¨ quindi provveduto ad effettuare una stima di questâ€™ultimo utilizzando la tecnica di regressione ai minimi quadrati. Utilizzando i coefficienti di questa regressione si Ã¨ giunti alla definizione di una formula che permette di distribuire trasferimenti in conto capitale, tenendo conto dello stock di infrastrutture in essere. Infine si Ã¨ confrontata lâ€™effettiva distribuzione degli spazi finanziari, concessi da Regione Lombardia ai sensi della legge n. 243/2012, con una distribuzione teorica derivante dallâ€™applicazione del modello delle infrastrutture standard.
H54|Keeping up with or running away from the Joneses: the Barro model revisited|Abstract This paper reexamines the Barro growth model in a context of interdependent preferences with consumption externality. Agents care about both consumption and social status, which is determined by their relative consumption in society. The results underline the individuals’ preferences for status as a key role in explaining long term growth and welfare. In particular, a higher growth rate may correspond to a lower social welfare if increment in growth is explained by status-seeking accompanied by the keeping up with the Joneses. Furthermore, we discuss two public financing systems from the viewpoint of growth and welfare. If lump-sum tax always implies a higher growth rate, income tax may perform better in terms of welfare when government size becomes sufficiently large.
H54|A Scoping Study of PPP Guidelines|The Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third Conference on Financing for Development underscores sustainable and resilient infrastructure as a pre-requisite to sustainable development. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are expected to deliver infrastructure in furtherance of this Agenda. In view of this expectation, twelve prominent PPP guidelines were reviewed for alignment with the Addis Agenda and key public governance factors. The research found that the PPP guidelines are not sufficiently aligned with the Addis Agenda, have insufficient sustainability content, and do not acknowledge the role of the public in PPPs. It recommends that the next generation of the guidelines address these aspects. This paper is an updated version of the draft paper presented to the expert group meeting of the Inter-agency Task Force in December 2016. The author is grateful for discussion and comments received on the earlier versions of this paper. Some are reflected in the paper without attribution, owing to the Chatham House rule followed at the meeting. The author takes full responsibility for the contents of this report.

H54|Fluctuations in renewable electricity supply: Gains from international trade through infrastructure?|113 countries report producing electricity from non-hydro renewable sources and thereby participate in the global energy transition. This paper shows through a dynamic panel data analysis that imports of electric currents have increased and exports have decreased through the higher share of renewables in electricity production, controlling for other factors. On the one hand more cables have been built recently; but on the other hand some countries are blocking electricity shocks technologically as they suffer from free trade temporarily when receiving supply shocks. This shows that trade currently helps dealing with fluctuations of supply, but temporary losses for recipients of shocks may require payments to leave the borders open.
H54|Public-Private Partnership for Cross-border Infrastructure Development|Cross-border infrastructure networks are critical for improving regional connectivity, their financing has however been challenging. This paper examines whether Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) may contribute to their development and reviews experience with this type of financing arrangements in the energy, transport and telecommunication sectors. By involving several countries, cross-border projects face specific challenges as these projects are by nature more complex, face augmented political risks and necessitate higher level of coordination. To support countries in financing cross-border projects, the paper studies these challenges in detail. It also highlights the policy actions required to achieve enhanced regional connectivity. It stresses, for instance, the importance of supporting intergovernmental platforms where international networks can be planned, regulatory hurdles tackled and financing arrangements structured. Developing guidelines for cross-border projects would also help countries in their efforts to enhance regional connectivity. The paper concludes by recognizing the potential of PPP for these projects, though it acknowledges that supportive policy actions from participating governments will be required for their success as well as a strong high-level political backing.
H54|Public Investment and Growth Accelerations: The Case of Southern Italy, 1951-1995|This paper analyses the contribution of public investment to growth in southern Italy in the second half of the twentieth century (1951-1995). The period saw the only convergence in modern times of the Mezzogiorno towards the Italian average (1951-1973), followed by divergence (1974-1995). Using cointegration analysis we find a statistically significant positive effect of public investment on the growth of the Mezzogiorno in the period 1951-1995. The Bai-Perron tests suggest that economic growth followed two distinct regimes, the first regime of accelerated growth in the years 1951-1973 (average growth rate 5.3%), and the second regime of low growth in the period 1974-1995 (average growth rate 1.6%). This result is confirmed by the testing procedure of Hansen (1992) which indicates a break in the determinants of GDP per unit of labour in 1974. The estimates of the model on time series of the two periods show statistically significant parameters of public investment in the first regime, but not in the second regime, when economic growth is sustained by business investment and technical change. The paper suggests that public capital may have a significant positive role in episodes of growth accelerations if the quality of the institutional environment is high, but it can lose its effectiveness if bureaucratic corruption and rent-seeking strongly affect public policy.
H54|The Spatial Impacts of a Massive Rail Disinvestment Program: The Beeching Axe|Transport investment is a popular policy instrument and many recent studies have investigated whether new infrastructure generates economic benefits and has spatial economic impacts. Our work approaches the question differently and looks at what happens when a substantial part of a national railway network is dismantled, as happened during the 1950s, 60s and 70s in Britain. Part of this disinvestment occurred following controversial reports on railway profitability and structure in the early 1960s - a course of action known colloquially as 'the Beeching Axe' after the author of the reports. The removal of railways is often blamed for the decline of rural areas and peripheral towns in post-war Britain. This rail disinvestment program was targeted at removal of underused and unprofitable lines and not specifically targeted at local economic performance. Even so, we find that there is a relationship between pre-war population decline and the depth of the rail cuts in the post 1950 period. Conditional on these pre-trends, we show that loss of access by rail did cause relative population decline, decline in the proportion of skilled workers, and decline in the proportion of young people in affected areas. The elasticity of population with respect to changes in centrality (or market access) is around 0.3 in our main estimates. Instrumental variables estimates based on the network structure of the cuts yield higher elasticities. An implication of these findings is that rail transport infrastructure plays an important role in shaping the spatial structure of the economy.
H54|Role of bidding method and risk allocation in the performance of public private partnership (PPP) projects|The Public Private Partnership (PPP) model has recently gained a lot of attention in the infrastructure creation literature. Selection of the right private partner in PPP is important for the success of this model. The bidding method along with appropriate risk allocation plays a critical role in this regard. This paper analyses the Indian PPP framework, including its bidding process and the standard concession agreement. The paper argues that the existing bidding method (i.e. premium/grant based method) can result in overvaluation of the projects due to optimism bias. When optimism about high traffic volumes do not materialize in the long run, projects could come under stress or fail, which is quite visible for Indian PPP road projects. This paper discusses an alternative bidding method called least present value of revenue (LPVR) and compares this method for the Indian PPP set-up with the help of Monte Carlo simulations by creating various real-life kind of scenarios. Results show that both methods have their own advantages depending on what was expected and what is actually realized. If expectations are low, then both methods gives more or less competitive results, but as expectations increase the LPVR method starts giving better results with a reasonably high certainty.
H54|Crowding-out or crowding-in? Public and private investment in India|This paper contributes to the debate on the relationship between public and private investment in India along the following dimensions. First, acknowledging major structural changes that the Indian economy has undergone in the past three decades, we study whether public investment in recent years has become more or less complementary to private investment in comparison to the period before 1980. Second, we construct a novel data-set of quarterly aggregate public and private investment in India over the period 1996–2015 using investment-project data from the CapEx-CMIE database. Third, embedding a theory-driven long-run relationship on the model, we estimate a range of Structural Vector Error Correction Models (SVECMs) to re-examine the public and private investment relationship in India. Identification is achieved by decomposing shocks into those with transitory and permanent effects. Our results suggest that while public investment crowds out private investment in India over the period 1950–2012, the opposite is true when we restrict the sample to post 1980 or conduct a quarterly analysis since 1996. This change can likely be attributed to the policy reforms which started during the early 1980s and gained momentum after the 1991 crisis.
H54|Investment Gaps in IDB Borrowing Countries|TWe estimate public investment gaps in a sample of developing countries using a public investment demand function. We then use GDP per capita projections, forecasts of structural transformation, and three SDG targets (poverty, infant mortality and lower secondary school completion) to predict public investment needs in 2030 among IDB borrowing countries. Our estimates suggest that in 2014 the total public investment gap of IDB borrowers was close to $170 billion (3.1 percent of the Region’s GDP) and that the gap is expected to surpass $717 billion (6.3 percent of the Region’s GDP) by 2030 if the SDGs were to be reached.
H54|The efficiency of transport infrastructure investment and the role of institutions: an empirical analysis|In this article we analyze the efficiency of total transport investment in a sample of 34 countries over the period 1996 to 2010. We do so by way of Data Envelopment Analysis that evaluates countries according to their ability to achieve the maximum attainable infrastructure quantity and usage for a given investment volume. We find that the Central European countries, New Zealand and Japan are the most efficient when investing in transport infrastructure while the Eastern European countries, Russia, Turkey and Mexico are the least so. We moreover consider the role played by institutional or government quality when explaining cross-country differences in investment efficiency, based on truncated panel (and bootstrapped) regressions. We confirm the positive impact of institutional quality on efficiency even after controlling for a range of potentially confounding variables. Our analysis generates important policy implications for those concerned with the efficiency of transport infrastructure.
H54|Renewal of water-related infrastructure and user\'s contribution: a few benchmarks|This paper studies the contribution required from the users of collective drinking water networks to finance asset management of infrastructures. We characterize the first-best optimum and we compare it to the social optimum in the presence of preferences heterogeneity, in order to take into account the uses of alternative techniques for certain household needs. These alternatives uses generate negative externalities for the good functioning of the water networks. The first-best optimum thus requires a transfer from the exclusive users of the collective network to the users of the alternatives. Furthermore, Nash equilibrium reveals that the existence of this transfer requires other motivations than the only usage values. Finally, the case of water infrastructure asset management emphasizes how an essential part of inequality that can be associated with it can be attributed to preferences heterogeneity.
H54|Development Economics Meets the Challenges of Lagging U.S. Areas: Applications to Education, Health and Nutrition, Behavior, and Infrastructure|This chapter examines the development economics evidence base for insights into policy reforms that would benefit struggling areas in the United States. My focus is on improving education, physical and mental health, infrastructure, and institutions. First, consistent with findings on education policy effectiveness, I propose raising the legal minimum dropout age (prospectively to 19), providing better information about the benefits of completing high school, supporting targeted paraprofessional tutoring, and providing family financial incentives for attending school and graduating from high school. Second, to improve health outcomes in struggling areas, the focus is using and building on existing effective health and nutrition programs and services, identifying ways to include more families who are eligible for but not participating in these programs. Moreover, the recent development and behavioral economics evidence base has extended our understanding of the psychological, cognitive, and economic behavioral lives of the poor; the literature highlights the ways that poverty can impede cognitive functioning, with implications for policies to uplift lagging U.S. areas. Third, a review of evidence on the benefits of improving lagging rural and urban area transportation infrastructure points to the likely benefits of improved connectivity for lagging U.S. areas: reversing the legacy of past discriminatory policies, encouraging sector-based clusters, and extending access to high-speed internet. Finally, the chapter highlights the relevance of some cross-cutting themes in development economics, including the high returns to reliable household microdata and the importance of improving institutions to enable more inclusive, substantial, and lasting progress.
H54|Revisiting the returns of public infrastructure in Mexico: A limited information local likelihood estimation|This paper revisits the issue of accurately decomposing productivity growth to the impact of public infrastructure at firm level for Mexican industry whether the underlying functional form is a profit or a cost function. Our framework decomposes productivity growth into different components, and in particular the contribution of public infrastructure. We also propose a novel limited information local likelihood (LILL) estimation method that adequately deals with the issue of the endogeneity and model misspecification. The reported evidence shows that public infrastructure enhances productivity growth through profit gains and cost savings in all ten two-digit Mexican industries, though some variability across time exists, notably in the nineties and the 2000s when a shortage of infrastructure is observed.
H54|Maritime, air traffics and economic growth in Togo<BR>[Trafics maritime, aérien et croissance économique au Togo]|The objective of this study is to empirically evaluate the impacts of maritime traffic of goods and passenger air traffic on Togo's long-run economic growth. The empirical methodology used is based on the Dynamic Ordinary Least Square (DOLS) approach proposed by Stock and Watson (1993), based on two log-quadratic models and based on cointegration techniques. The estimates use annual data for the periods 1960-2014 and 1970-2001, respectively. The empirical findings reveal two fundamental conclusions: the impact of maritime freight traffic is negative while that of air passenger traffic is positive on economic growth, all weak and significant in the long-run; furthermore the impact of maritime freight traffic is not suitable for a national level and the destination Togo is not very attractive. Such results raise the question of operational efficiency, the management of port and airport infrastructures as well as the level of Togo's exports, which are inextricably linked to economic policy.
H54|The marginal cost of track reinvestments in the Swedish railway network: Using data to compare methods|In this study, we analyze the difference between survival and corner solution models in estimating the marginal cost of reinvestments. Both approaches describe the reinvestment process in rather intuitively similar ways but have several methodological distinctions. We use Swedish railway data on track segment and section levels over the period 1999-2016 and focus on reinvestments in track superstructure. Results suggest the marginal costs from survival and corner solution models are SEK 0.0041 and SEK 0.0103, respectively. The conclusion is that the corner solution model is more appropriate, as this method consider the impact traffic has on the risk of reinvestment as well as on the size of the reinvestment cost. The survival approach does not consider the latter, which is problematic when we have systematic variations in costs due to traffic and infrastructure characteristics.
H54|Marginalkostnader för reinvesteringar i järnvägsanläggningar: En delrapport inom SAMKOST 3|Reinvesteringar i järnvägsanläggningar påverkas av trafik och utgör därför en komponent i marginalkostnaden för nyttjandet av infrastrukturen. Tidigare studier har traditionellt fokuserat på reinvesteringskostnader i banöverbyggnad. I denna studie skattas separata marginalkostnader för reinvesteringar i Bana (banöverbyggnad, banunderbyggnad, bangårdar), El, Signal, Tele och Övriga anläggningar. Trots att slitage av exempelvis signal- och teleanläggningar inte torde variera med trafik, finner vi statistiskt signifikanta samband mellan trafik och reinvesteringar i samtliga anläggningar. En förklaring är att trafikökningen innebär en ökad störningskostnad, även i frånvaron av ett trafikberoende slitage, och därmed att reinvesteringen tidigareläggs. Analysen visar även att de skattade effekterna främst kommer från jämförelser mellan bandelar, vilket innebär en risk att de (delvis) är korrelationer och inte kausala samband mellan trafik och reinvesteringar. När marginalkostnaderna för anläggningsgrupperna läggs samman hamnar de på 0,0141 kr per bruttotonkilometer och 4,4520 kr per tågkilometer.
H54|Discounting transport infrastructure investments|The main aim of the study is to advice the Swedish national guidelines on cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of transport infrastructure investments, ASEK about the appropriate set of discount-rates (currently 3.5% for all investments). To this end, first a literature review with a theoretical focus along with some new perspectives are provided. Second the conclusions are applied to Swedish infrastructure transport CBA, using the current proposition of a new HSR line as a case. Based on empirical research concerning parameter values new discount rates are estimated, and sensitivity analysis performed. The best estimate of the social discount rate in the present study, for land transport infrastructure investment in Sweden, is about 5.1%.
H54|Marginalkostnader för järnvägsunderhåll: trafikens påverkan på olika anläggningar|En del av banavgiften för nyttjandet av infrastrukturen består av kostnader för järnvägsunderhåll som uppstår som en direkt följd av tågtrafiken. Då nedbrytning och slitage av vissa järnvägsanläggningar och komponenter inte påverkas av trafik, kan det göras gällande att underhållskostnader för dessa inte bör ingå i en marginalkostnadsbaserad avgift. I denna studie skattar vi kostnadselasticiteter med en ekonometrisk metod för att undersöka om och hur trafik påverkar underhållskostnader för olika grupper av järnvägsanläggningar. Resultaten visar att det finns statistiskt signifikanta samband mellan trafik och underhållskostnader för anläggningsgrupperna Bana, El, Signal och Tele. En förklaring till sambanden för exempelvis signal- och teleanläggningar är att mer förebyggande underhåll genomförs för att upprätthålla en viss tillförlitlighet hos anläggningen när trafiken ökar och därmed undvika en ökad kostnad för inställda och försenade tåg – en kostnad som kan öka oavsett om mer trafik orsakar en ökad nedbrytning eller inte.
H54|The Public Investment Multipliers: Evidence from Stock Returns of Narrowly Defined Industry in Japan|This paper provides an evidence on the macroeconomic impacts of public investment. I extract public investment news shocks from the excess return of narrowly defined road pavement firms in Japan and use them as an instrument for future government spending. I found that the extracted news shocks predict the future government spending through changes in future public investment. The result shows that the public investment multiplier is 1.64 a year after the shock and about 5 after four years, which is considerably larger than fiscal multipliers estimated in previous studies. The findings highlight the importance of the types of government spending, in addition to the amount of the spending, in determining the overall effects of countercyclical fiscal policies.

H54|Stock Market Response to Public Investment under the Zero Lower Bound: Cross-industry Evidence from Japan|This research examines the effects of public investment on stock returns using Japanese cross-industry data. We calculate impulse response functions using the local projection method. The empirical results show that public investment shocks have strong and stimulating effects on stock returns when the nominal interest rate is at the zero lower bound (ZLB) while negative responses dominate outside of the ZLB period. Furthermore, the estimated impulse responses for the non-manufacturing industry group are larger than those of the manufacturing industry group. Our results imply that the government should increase public investment when nominal interest rates are near zero to prop up the stock market and cut back once the economy is no longer in a liquidity trap.
H54|The Subsidy to Infrastructure as an Asset Class|We investigate the characteristics of infrastructure as an asset class from an investment perspective of a limited partner. While non U.S. institutional investors gain exposure to infrastructure assets through a mix of direct investments and private fund vehicles, U.S. investors predominantly invest in infrastructure through private funds. We find that the stream of cash flows delivered by private infrastructure funds to institutional investors is very similar to that delivered by other types of private equity, as reflected by the frequency and amounts of net cash flows. U.S. public pension funds perform worse than other institutional investors in their infrastructure fund investments, although they are exposed to underlying deals with very similar project stage, concession terms, ownership structure, industry, and geographical location. By selecting funds that invest in projects with poor financial performance, U.S. public pension funds have created an implicit subsidy to infrastructure as an asset class, which we estimate within the range of $730 million to $3.16 billion per year depending on the benchmark.
H54|Overcoming Wealth Inequality by Capital Taxes that Finance Public Investment|Wealth inequality is rising in rich countries. Capital taxation used simply to finance redistribution may not be able to counteract this trend, but can increased public investment financed by higher capital taxes? We examine how such a policy affects the distribution of wealth in a setting with distinct wealth groups: dynastic savers and life-cycle savers. Our main finding is that public investment financed through capital taxes always decreases wealth inequality when the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is moderately high. Indeed, for all elasticities of substitution greater than a threshold value, at high enough capital tax rates, dynastic savers disappear in the long run. Below these rates, both types of households co-exist in equilibrium with life-cycle savers gaining from the higher capital tax rates. These results are robust with respect to the different roles of public investment in production. We calibrate our model to OECD economies and find the threshold elasticity to be 0.82.
H54|Dynamic analysis of budget policy rules in Japan|We construct an endogenous growth model with public capital and endogenous labor supply and examine quantitatively the welfare effects of fiscal consolidation on the Japanese economy. We consider two modes of fiscal consolidation: the adjustment to a new lower target of the debt-to-GDP and deficit-to-GDP ratios. We find that the debt and deficit reduction rules based only on government consumption and investment expenditure cuts improve households’ welfare. This improvement in households’ welfare becomes large as the speed of fiscal consolidation rises. Further, reductions in the target debt-to-GDP or deficit-to-GDP ratio generate larger welfare gains. We also discuss the welfare effects of fiscal consolidation with tax increases and transfer payment decreases.
H54|Public Spending on Transportation and Water Infrastructure, 1956 to 2017|The Congressional Budget Office regularly documents trends in public spending for transportation and water infrastructure. There are six types of infrastructure that are paid for largely by the public sector: highways, mass transit and rail, aviation, water transportation, water resources, and water utilities.
H54|Federal Support for Financing State and Local Transportation and Water Infrastructure|State and local governments own much of the nationâ€™s transportation and water infrastructure, such as highways, mass transit systems, airports, and water treatment systems. The federal government helps states and localities finance investments in such infrastructure through tax-exempt bonds, tax credit bonds, state revolving funds and infrastructure banks, and direct federal credit programs.
H54|Fiscal Substitution of Investment for Highway Infrastructure: Working Paper 2018-08|The federal government provides grants to state and local governments for their transportation infrastructure.

H54|Lightning the future of education in Brazil: the impact of rural electrification on educational outcomes|We analyze the impact of rural electricity access on different educational outcomes for children by taking advantage of the priorization criteria of the brazilian program Luz Para Todos (LPT) which determines an assignment variable that extracts the exogenous variation in rural electricity access. Using test scores and census data at the school and child level we establish that having electricity access through LPT has a positive and significant effect on Language and Math test scores for 5th and 9th graders, on literacy likelihood and on approval rates. We argument that the effect is driven by an increase in electricity access and use within schools which empirically remarks the importance of electrical device access and technology use on modern education.

H54|Economic Decision Problems in Multi-Level Flood Prevention: a new graph-based approach used for real world applications|Flood prevention policy is of crucial importance to the Netherlands. We assess economical optimal flood prevention where multiple barrier dams and dikes protect the hinterland against sea level rise and peak river discharges. Current optimal flood prevention methods only consider dike rings with no dependencies between dikes. We propose a graph-based model for a cost-benefit analysis to determine optimal dike heights with multiple dependencies between dikes and barrier dams. Our model provides great flexibility towards the modelling of flood probabilities, damage costs and investments cost. Moreover, our model is easy to implement and can be solved quickly to proven optimality. Our model is developed for and applied to important policy decisions in the Netherlands for the Lake IJssel and Lake Marken region. Two barrier dams together with the dikes surrounding these two lakes protect a large part of the Netherlands. The area contains 17 dike ring areas, including the City of Amsterdam. Our model and application shows the importance of taking into account dependencies between dikes and barrier dams. The results of our model were used for major Dutch flood protection policy decisions, i.e. the decision how to control the water levels in Lake IJssel and Lake Marken and what economic efficient flood protection standards apply to barrier dams and dikes. Dependencies between barrier dams and dike rings have a large impact on economically optimal flood standards. On the basis of our model, the Dutch government has decided not to increase the water level of Lake IJssel with up to 1,5 meter. This saved both the current landscape around Lake IJssel and billions of euros in coming decades.
H54|The Political Economy of Public Debt: A Laboratory Study|This paper reports the results from a laboratory experiment designed to study political distortions in the accumulation of public debt. A legislature bargains over the levels of a public good and of district specific transfers in two periods. The legislature can issue or purchase risk-free bonds in the first period and the level of public debt creates a dynamic linkage across policymaking periods. In line with the theoretical predictions, we find that public policies are inefficient and efficiency is increasing in the size of the majority requirement, with higher investment in public goods and lower debt associated with larger majority requirements. Also in line with the theory, we find that debt is lower when the probability of a negative shock to the economy in the second period is higher, evidence that debt is used to smooth consumption.
H54|The Subsidy to Infrastructure as an Asset Class|We investigate the characteristics of infrastructure as an asset class from an investment perspective of a limited partner. While non U.S. institutional investors gain exposure to infrastructure assets through a mix of direct investments and private fund vehicles, U.S. investors predominantly invest in infrastructure through private funds. We find that the stream of cash flows delivered by private infrastructure funds to institutional investors is very similar to that delivered by other types of private equity, as reflected by the frequency and amounts of net cash flows. U.S. public pension funds perform worse than other institutional investors in their infrastructure fund investments, although they are exposed to underlying deals with very similar project stage, concession terms, ownership structure, industry, and geographical location. By selecting funds that invest in projects with poor financial performance, U.S. public pension funds have created an implicit subsidy to infrastructure as an asset class, which we estimate within the range of $730 million to $3.16 billion per year depending on the benchmark.
H54|The Joint Impact of Infrastructure and Institutions on Economic Growth| This paper examines the joint impact of infrastructure capital and institutional quality on economic growth using a large panel data set covering 120 countries and spanning the years 1980-2015. The empirical strategy involves estimating a simple growth model where, in addition to standard controls, infrastructure, institutional quality and their interaction are included as explanatory variables. Potential endogeneity concerns are addressed by means of GMM estimators that utilize internal instruments. We findd that the interaction terms between infrastructure capital and institutional quality have a positive and significant impact on economic growth. These results are robust to a variety of alternative specifications and institutional quality measures. Hence, our results suggest that maximizing returns from infrastructure development requires improving the quality of institutions.

H54|The Impact of Public Libraries on School Achievement: The Case of Medellin| This paper explores the relationship between public libraries and school achievement. Medellin counts on a system of public libraries. However, public library parks are part of a separate system. The library parks are understood as cultural centers for social development that seek to encourage the meeting of citizens and to develop educational activities that involve the digital culture. The project began in 2004 and was consolidated until 2011 with the introduction of 9 different library parks. Using an approach of differences-in-differences and matching techniques, we explore the effect of the library parks in Medellin on school performance. We found a significant effect on the performance of the language test in the students treated, especially in the long-term specification. Key Words: Public libraries, school achievement, impact evaluation, public investment. JEL Classification: C33, H54, H76, I2, I26.
H54|Home Ownership and Political Participation: Longitudinal Evidence Suggests There is No Causal Relationship|The effect of home ownership on political participation is examined using longitudinal data from New Zealand. We study political party membership, and if and how individuals voted in six General Elections, using validated data. There is a positive correlation between being a home owner and ever voting, and between political party membership and the local home ownership rate. Individual home ownership and the home ownership rate negatively correlate with voting for left-wing political parties. But once the longitudinal nature of the data are exploited, using fixed effects specifications, these significant correlations disappear. This change in the results suggests that unobserved factors that predispose people to be a home owner also affect their political participation.
H54|Infrastructural Financing Using Pension Funds Of The West African Monetary Zone’S Member States|This study is pursuant to the directive by the Convergence Council of the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) during its Statutory Meetings held from August 1 - 5, 2016 in Conakry, Guinea, to WAMI to carry-out a comprehensive assessment on the feasibility of using pension funds of the Member States of the Zone for infrastructural financing. The overall objective is to accelerate economic growth by leveraging on pension funds to finance infrastructure in the WAMZ. Infrastructure deficit has been a major challenge to growth of WAMZ economies over the years. Apart from telecommunication infrastructure which has recorded considerable improvement in the last decade, huge deficit exists in basic infrastructure such as road networks, railways, airways, waterways and electricity supply. Infrastructure gaps have existed in the Zone dating back to the colonial era and have widened due to political instability, high population growth rate, poor economic development, poor governance and overdependence on external and public sources for infrastructure funding. Weaknesses in public sector salary and wage policies, and unsustainable rate of debt accumulation resulting in huge interest payments, have led to rising recurrent expenditure, which limited available public funding for investments in infrastructure. Volatile commodity prices also adversely affected public funding of infrastructure due to significant reduction in fiscal revenues. Infrastructure development is critical to economic development as it enhances the productive capacity of the economy. As a capital good, it facilitates the delivery of final goods and services to promote economic growth and prosperity. In particular, infrastructure enhances quality of life including social well-being; and health and safety of citizens. The effect of infrastructure on economic development occurs through diffusion of technology, trade facilitation, division of labour, market competition, and efficient allocation of economic resources across countries and regions. Infrastructure also facilitates adoption of new organizational practices and harnessing of latent resources. While the Zone’s total pension fund assets are estimated at US$24.3 billion in 2016 with potential to increase significantly, allocation of pension assets to infrastructure financing is generally low. The low rate of pension fund investment in infrastructure is partly due to insufficient investment vehicles, as well as the inadequacy of financial instruments to support pension fund investment in infrastructure. The capital markets in the WAMZ are not adequately developed to offer long-term capital needed to support the huge financing outlay for infrastructure development. The enormous challenges experienced by governments in bridging infrastructure funding gaps, have compelled WAMZ countries to formulate new policies and programmes to enhance critical infrastructure financing in their economies. Prominent among the policies is the framework that promotes private-sector participation in infrastructure financing. The advocacy for using pension fund to finance infrastructure is hinged on the following rationale: First, shrinking or grossly inadequate traditional funding sources for infrastructure has made pension fund a viable global alternative. Second is the urgent need to bridge the infrastructure funding gap; third is the characteristics of pension fund as a long term instrument which is appropriate for infrastructure financing; fourth, the steady cash flow nature of infrastructure investments makes it ideal for pension fund investment. International experiences suggest that progress towards improving the management of pension funds rely on good governance. Corollary to that is the widely accepted principle that investment using pension fund assets must be done prudently and cost-effectively with quantitative limits. Global infrastructural gap is undoubtedly huge and the pension fund has provided alternative source of funds for infrastructure financing, without any reported case of default wherever it had been experimented. International experience revealed the need for a comprehensive review of strategy for infrastructure financing in the WAMZ countries. This would require issuing infrastructure bonds, with strong ratings premised on strong project analysis and competencies, and good prospects for repayment on Private-Public-Partnership (PPP) models. The population growth and increasing labour force in the WAMZ creates higher potential for increase in the size of pension funds. The large size of the informal sector in the zone, however, constitutes a serious drag on this potential. Currently, pension fund contributors are predominantly from the formal sectors as the informal sector remains informational opaque. The bulk of the contributions to the pension fund are from the public/civil service and the formal private sector as the information available on the informal sector is low. The size of pension funds in the Zone is growing rapidly. However, utilization of these funds to finance infrastructure projects remains low due to some inhibiting factors. These challenges border on the size of pension fund assets relative to the financing need of infrastructure; regulatory and institutional restrictions; weak enforcement of pension laws; underdeveloped financial markets; capacity gap in managing pension funds for investment in infrastructure; unavailability of suitable investment projects; public institutions acting as custodians and managers of pension fund; multiplicity of schemes handled by the pension fund institutions; and lack of regional platform for exchange and collaboration of the pension sector. Given the myriad challenges affecting the flow of pension funds for financing infrastructure in the WAMZ and the need to address the infrastructure deficit, the following policy recommendations are proposed at the country and regional levels to harness the potentials of pension funds. At the national level, the study advocates for the expansion of the size of pension funds and diversification of investment options, through the formalization of the informal sector, enforcement of existing pension regulations, attracting foreign investors and raising awareness. Furthermore, in order to increase access to long term financing, capital markets should be established in those Member States where they are non-existent and further deepened in those countries where they already exist. Pension fund institutions could invest in financial instruments that are linked to particular infrastructure projects. Such instruments should be tradable in the secondary market and granted liquidity status to attract pension fund investors. Other recommendations include: the need for human capital development considering the evolving nature of this initiative; Member States are encouraged to share risk on the basis of Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) models; Authorities should provide guarantees for institutional investors to mitigate anticipated risk; increase transparency in infrastructure financing using pension funds; and sensitize stakeholders, investors and supervisors on the importance of financing infrastructure with pension fund. Further, Member States should reform their legal, institutional and regulatory frameworks to enhance the use of pension funds for the financing of infrastructure; the regulatory framework and guidelines should inter alia set limits or conditionalities for infrastructure financing. Member States should also establish autonomous agencies to regulate and supervise pension funds in countries where none exists.There is need for a platform for regional collaboration, information sharing and harmonization to raise the level of development of the pension sector in the WAMZ. At the WAMZ level, it would be necessary to establish a collaborative platform where pension fund institutions and supervisors in the Zone could meet for cooperation and information sharing on issues regarding pension funds development and infrastructure investments. This synergy would also help members of the association in mitigating inherent risk in investment projects as well as identify project viability gaps in order to achieve sustainability. Finally, the study finds that regardless of the novelty of the concept in the Zone, pension funds have helped to provide alternative sources of funds for financing infrastructure in most jurisdictions. In addition, there has been no report of default that has resulted in erosion or misplacement of pension funds due to its use in financing infrastructure project. Consequently, using the pension funds of WAMZ Member States in financing infrastructure is feasible. However, Member States are strongly encouraged to put measures in place to adequately address the challenges identified in order to unlock the inherent potentials in pension funds with a view to accelerating growth and development of the sub-region.
H54|Western Balkans EU Accession: Is the 2025 Target Date Realistic?|The European Commission has set a target date of 2025 for Western Balkan EU accession, while also outlining a broader new strategy which includes Brussels taking a more active role in solving political disputes in the region, and upgrading infrastructure as part of the Berlin Process. We welcome these moves economic underdevelopment in the region is closely tied to political fractures. Aside from resolving political conflicts, improved governance in the region will also be necessary. In terms of meeting economic accession criteria, the region faces a host of challenges, but we believe that a focus on upgrading infrastructure and developing a much bigger and more competitive industrial base should be the priorities. While the economic influence of third parties in the region is not as significant as often portrayed, this is not guaranteed to last, particularly in the case of China, which is set to increase its economic presence in the Western Balkans in the coming years. Even if the region takes a great leap forward towards the EU, there are other barriers in the way which could also hold back accession. Nevertheless, while the 2025 target represents a highly ambitious best-case scenario, it could serve as a powerful incentive for countries in the region to speed up their reform agendas. We do not completely rule out at least Montenegro and Serbia joining the bloc by 2025 or shortly thereafter.
H54|Economic Policy Implications of the Belt and Road Initiative for CESEE and Austria|The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a vision to revive the ancient ‘Silk Road’ by means of massive infrastructure investments throughout Eurasia and Africa, was first presented by China’s President Xi Jinping in 2013. China has identified the region of Central East and Southeast Europe (CESEE) as the gateway to Western European markets. This was manifested by the investment in the Port of Piraeus (Greece) and the diplomatic initiative ‘16+1’, comprising eleven EU Member States and five Western Balkan countries, which is interesting for Austria due to its strong economic relations with this region. The Policy Brief analyses the most recent developments in trade and investment activities of China, Austria and the EU in CESEE, which are compared to the state of infrastructure in the region in the areas of transport, energy, information and communication technology as well as finance. Overall, CESEE has a high need for infrastructure investments, particularly in the transport sector. Chinese loans and investments in the region are becoming more important, especially for the Western Balkan countries, which have limited access to EU grants. The paper concludes with seven policy areas for future cooperation between Austria and China. The Policy Note is based on a study conducted for the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Austria. It is available upon request.

H54|Investment in the Western Balkans|New Directions and Financial Constraints in Infrastructure Investment Investment in infrastructure is important to generating long-term productivity gains. The Western Balkans lack infrastructure capacity and investment – particularly in non-traditional sectors such as water, sewerage, waste, health, social affairs and education. Two important regional infrastructure investment initiatives are active in the Western Balkans the European Western Balkans Investment Framework WBIF and the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative BRI. Both are focusing on traditional infrastructure such as energy and transport and both come with a volume of about EUR 8 billion in loans. The European initiative has in addition provided for some EUR 800 million in grants and has an emphasis on Green Economy projects. Overall infrastructure investment needs in the region are huge. Lower bound estimates of additional investment needs only in alternative infrastructure investment for the next five years are at around EUR 800 million. The financial conditions in the region are underdeveloped but improving. Nevertheless, external debt levels have increased substantially since the outbreak of the global financial crisis and thus pose a serious threat to economic stability in a situation when the global interest rates are again on the rise. Thus, substantially hiking up investment in traditional as well as non-traditional infrastructure in the Western Balkans without dramatically increasing the countries’ indebtedness is the primary duty in order to achieve higher long-run productivity growth and provide the population a perspective for a better future without a need to migrate. Short-run pragmatic policy recommendations include Western Balkan governments should rebalance their infrastructure investment mix to support the Green Economy; the new EU IPA III funds should be rearranged to focus more on Western Balkan alternative infrastructure sectors; in order to create the necessary financial leeway for more public investment in non-traditional infrastructure, national governments in the Western Balkans could adopt the Austrian ASFINAG model; similarly, PPP projects might be considered but these need particularly good management; the IFIs should issue GDP-linked loans for crucial investment in the region in order to avoid macro-financial crises in the future. Long-run forward-thinking policy recommendations include a Joint Project Pipeline of a Common Western Balkans Investment Committee with supranational overruling powers representing the infrastructure interests of the whole region; the creation of a Western Balkans Regional Infrastructure Fund with a much bigger volume and much stronger grant component than the current Western Balkans Investment Framework in order to curb the influence of external players in the region and reduce indebtedness; joining the euro area – even if only with limited rights, e.g. without voting rights – before EU accession would be a powerful tool to bring down interest rates and improve the financial conditions for both the private as well as the public sector’s investment. Acknowledging that often political tensions are a barrier to greater connectivity and trade between countries, support for infrastructure investment could be used as a bargaining chip in EU-brokered negotiations to solve long-standing political stalemates in the Western Balkans.
H54|Die „Europäische Seidenstraße“|The English version can be found here. In dieser Studie argumentieren wir für einen „Big Push“ bei den Infrastrukturinvestitionen im größeren Europa. Wir schlagen den Bau einer „Europäischen Seidenstraße“ vor, welche die industriellen Zentren im Westen mit den bevölkerungsreichen, aber weniger entwickelten Gebieten im Osten des Kontinents verbinden und damit für mehr Wachstum und Beschäftigung sowohl kurz- als auch mittel- und langfristig sorgen soll. Im Vollausbau soll die „Europäische Seidenstraße“ auf dem Landweg rund 11.000 Kilometer auf einer Nordroute von Lissabon bis Uralsk an der russisch-kasachischen Grenze und auf einer Südroute von Mailand bis nach Wolgograd und Baku verlaufen. Kernstücke sind im Norden die Strecke von Lyon bis Moskau und im Süden von Mailand bis Konstanza. Die Südroute würde Mitteleuropa mit dem Schwarzmeerraum und den Anrainerstaaten des Kaspischen Meeres verbinden. Eine moderne Autobahn- und Hochgeschwindigkeitszugstrecke mit einer Reihe von Logistikzentren, See-, Fluss- und Flughäfen soll neue europäische Standards unter anderem in der E-Mobilität setzen. Der Vollausbau würde rund 1.000 Milliarden Euro oder rund 8% des Bruttoinlandsproduktes der auf den beiden Routen liegenden Länder ausmachen. Die Kosten relativ zur Wirtschaftsleistung der EU machen rund 7% aus. Über einen Investitionszeitraum von 10 Jahren könnte die „Europäische Seidenstraße“ entlang der Routen nach einer konservativen Schätzung zu einem Wirtschaftswachstum von durchschnittlich 3,5% und einem Anstieg der Beschäftigung von rund 2 Millionen führen. Unter günstigen Umständen und bei weiterhin anhaltenden niedrigen Zinsen kann mit einem Beschäftigungseffekt von über 7 Millionen im größeren Europa gerechnet werden. Alleine auf der Nordroute in den russischen Zentralraum könnte die verbesserte Infrastruktur der Kernstrecke bedeutende Zeitersparnisse von über 8% im Straßentransport bringen. Das wäre im Schnitt und beispielsweise auch ab Wien eine Ersparnis von rund 2,5 Stunden. Damit könnten die Länder entlang der Nordroute ihre Exporte nach Russland um über 11% steigern. Dies würde zusätzliche Exporte von über 12,5 Milliarden Euro bedeuten. Die österreichische Exportwirtschaft würde ganz besonders von diesen Infrastrukturmaßnahmen profitieren. Österreichs Russland-Exporte würden um über 14% ansteigen. Das sind rund 330 Millionen Euro. Die Baumaßnahmen bringen Österreich 34.000 Arbeitsplätze. Unter günstigen Umständen könnten bis zu 121.000 neue Jobs in Österreich geschaffen werden. English Summary A ‘European Silk Road’ The study concludes that Europe should respond to China’s New Silk Road initiative with a coherent infrastructure network and transport strategy of its own to leverage its economic potential. It should not rely on China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to achieve this, but invest itself to ensure that it suits European priorities. Nevertheless, a ‘European Silk Road’ can be seen as complementary to China’s efforts. The study finds that the development of a European Silk Road could create 2-7 million new jobs and could increase GDP on average by 3.5% in Wider Europe over a ten-year period. Eastern Europe in particular needs an upgrading of its transport infrastructure. If this is achieved, the boost to incomes and living standards would be particularly significant in that part of the continent, as a ‘big push’ in transport infrastructure investment has the potential to industrialise broad sectors of the economy.
H54|A ‘European Silk Road’|The German version can be found here. In this study we argue for a ‘Big Push’ in infrastructure investments in greater Europe. We propose the building of a European Silk Road, which connects the industrial centres in the west with the populous, but less developed regions in the east of the continent and thereby is meant to generate more growth and employment in the short term as well as in the medium and long term. After its completion, the European Silk Road would extend overland around 11,000 kilometres on a northern route from Lisbon to Uralsk on the Russian-Kazakh border and on a southern route from Milan to Volgograd and Baku. Central parts are the route from Lyon to Moscow in the north and from Milan to Constanţa in the south. The southern route would link Central Europe with the Black Sea area and the Caspian Sea littoral states. A state-of-the-art motorway and high-speed railway line with a string of logistics centres, seaports, river ports and airports shall set new European standards, among others in e-mobility. The full extension would constitute around EUR 1,000 billion or approximately 8% of the gross domestic product of the countries situated along its two routes. The costs relative to the EU’s economic output amount to about 7%. According to a conservative estimate, the European Silk Road could lead to an economic growth of 3.5% on average and an increase in employment of around 2 million along its routes in the course of an investment period of 10 years. Under favourable circumstances and at continued low interest rates, an employment creation of over 7 million can be expected in greater Europe. The improved infrastructure of the key route could yield significant time savings of over 8% in road transport on the northern route into the central region of Russia alone. On average this would save approximately 2.5 hours, for instance from Vienna. Thus the countries along the northern route would be able to increase their exports to Russia by more than 11%. This would imply additional exports of over EUR 12.5 billion. The Austrian export industry would particularly benefit from these infrastructural measures. Austria’s exports to Russia would rise by over 14%. This corresponds to about EUR 330 million. The construction projects would create 34,000 jobs in Austria. Under favourable conditions, up to 121,000 new jobs could be created in Austria. Summary A ‘European Silk Road’ The study concludes that Europe should respond to China’s New Silk Road initiative with a coherent infrastructure network and transport strategy of its own to leverage its economic potential. It should not rely on China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to achieve this, but invest itself to ensure that it suits European priorities. Nevertheless, a ‘European Silk Road’ can be seen as complementary to China’s efforts. The study finds that the development of a European Silk Road could create 2-7 million new jobs and could increase GDP on average by 3.5% in Wider Europe over a ten-year period.

H54|Infrastructure Investment in the Western Balkans: A First Analysis|This study provides a first analysis of the recent development in infrastructure investment in the Western Balkans. It identifies infrastructure gaps as well as key infrastructure initiatives in the region, outlines the political dimension and provides the respective detailed infrastructure investment data as collected from the Western Balkans statistical offices. The Western Balkans are a good case study also for other regions in the EU neighbourhood that have similar developmental problems. It teaches that (i) intensity of involvement is important; (ii) the composition of the funds matters; (iii) infrastructure funding will not automatically lead to more political cooperation; (iv) infrastructure development funds can also be used as a sort of reward for more political cooperation. These principles could be applied in the EU’s neighbourhood policy for the Eastern Partnership countries as well as the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership countries, according to the local requirements.
H54|High-speed rail and inventory reduction: Firm-level evidence from China|Using a balanced panel of manufacturing firms from China between 2007 and 2013, we estimate that being connected to a high-speed rail system leads to 9.5% reduction in local firms' input inventory spending. The e ect is stronger for downstream industries and private enterprises. A back-of-envelope calculation suggests that each dollar of HSR investment reduces input inventory stock by 12 cents, which is significantly larger than the e ects found in previous studies based on highway or road investment. Declines in transportation and communication cost, as well as agglomeration e ect are identified as plausible mechanisms. Our findings reveal a micro channel through which improved transport infrastructure brings about economic gains, and contribute to the cost-benefit assessment of high-speed rail investment.
H54|"Plädoyer für einen ""Rentenfonds Deutschland"": Warum ein kapitalgedeckter Investitionsfonds ein wichtiger Beitrag zu mehr Generationengerechtigkeit sein könnte"|"The German government has recently adopted a reform package for the statutory pension insurance scheme to ensure that the pension level will not fall below 48% and that the contribution rate will not exceed 20% up to 2025. In addition, there are planned improvements in maternal pensions, pensions for people with reduced earnings capacity and relief for low-income earners. The total extra cost of these measures is estimated at approximately EUR 32bn, to be financed by funds of the statutory pension system and by increased federal subsidies. It is currently unclear how the German pay-as-you-go pension system will be reformed for the period after 2025. The author suggests establishing a ""Pension Fund Germany"" as a capital-backed fund with a highly diversified investment portfolio. A German sovereign wealth fund of this kind could make an important contribution to greater intergenerational equity. Financing could be provided by, for example, retaining part of the solidarity surcharge on German income tax rather than abolishing it entirely, as is currently envisaged."
H54|"Schriftliche Stellungnahme zu einer öffentlichen Anhörung des Bundestagsausschuss für die Angelegenheiten der Europäischen Union - zu der Mitteilung der Europäischen Kommission ""Weitere Schritte zur Vollendung der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion Europas: Ein Fahrplan"" (Ratsdokument 15653/17)"|"Die EU-Kommission hat verschiedene Vorschläge für Reformen der Wirtschaft- und Währungsunion vorgelegt. Während manche Ideen mehr politisch motiviert zu sein scheinen oder anreizspezifische Probleme mit sich bringen, gibt es durchaus Reformvorschläge, die sich ökonomisch begründen lassen und zur gesamteuropäischen Risikominderung beitragen können. Eine Mittelaufstockung für technische Hilfen zur Umsetzung von Strukturreformen ist grundsätzlich zu begrüßen. Eine reine Subventionierung solcher Reformen - nach dem Prinzip ""Geld gegen Reformen"" - droht hingegen starke Mitnahmeeffekte zu erzeugen und das Subsidiaritätsprinzip zu missachten. Dass mit der Schaffung einer neuen Konvergenzfazilität bei der Förderung von Strukturreformen ein besonderer Fokus auf Nicht-Eurostaaten gelegt werden sollte, ist nicht zu rechtfertigen. Die geplante makroökonomische Stabilisierungsfunktion zur Abmilderung der Wirkung asymmetrischer Schocks entbehrt auf europäischer Ebene einer zwingenden ökonomischen Notwendigkeit. Zwar erscheint der Ansatz grundsätzlich nachvollziehbar, dass ein möglicher Fonds nur Kredite vergeben, bei staatlichen Investitionen ansetzen und im EU-Haushalt eng gedeckelt bleiben würde. Doch besteht die Gefahr, dass die Mittelbereitstellung letztlich politischem Druck folgt und die avisierte Ex-ante-Konditionalität aufgeweicht wird. Daher ist dieser Vorschlag abzulehnen. Eine strategische Koordinationsfunktion könnte die EU bei der Organisation der Finanzierung von grenzüberschreitenden Investitionsprojekten einnehmen. Unterfinanzierte Infrastruktur in Grenzgebieten stellt noch immer ein wesentliches Hemmnis für die europaweite Verflechtung von Wertschöpfungsketten dar. Über Projektbonds könnte die Europäische Entwicklungsbank hier einen wichtigen Beitrag zur realen Konvergenz in Europa leisten."
H54|Demand for Off-Grid Solar Electricity: Experimental Evidence from Rwanda|Providing electricity to the unconnected 1.1 billion people in developing countries is one of the top political priorities of the international community, yet the costs of reaching this objective are very high. The present paper examines whether the objective and the associated costs are justified by the value that target beneficiaries assign to electricity. We provide experimental evidence on the revealed willingness-to-pay (WTP) for three types of off-grid solar electricity devices. Our findings show that households are willing to dedicate a substantial part of their expenditures to electricity. In absolute terms, though, the WTP does not suffice to reach cost-covering prices. Different payment schemes, which we randomized across our sample, do not alter the WTP significantly. If universal electricity access is to be achieved, direct subsidies might be necessary. We argue that from a public policy perspective it is more rationale to promote off-grid solar than grid-based electrification because of its better cost-benefit performance.
H54|Rural electrification through mini-grids: Challenges ahead|Recent debates on how to provide electricity to the roughly one billion still unconnected people in developing countries have identified mini-grids as a promising way forward. High upfront costs of transmission lines are avoided, and unlike home-scale solar, mini-grids can provide sufficient electricity for productive uses. This note outlines the challenges the mini-grid sector faces to achieve that potential. To date, few examples of sustainably working mini-grid programs exist. We identify regulatory issues, low electricity demand in rural areas, high payment default rates and over-optimistic demand projections as among the key challenges. Business models that account for high transaction costs in rural areas and are based on realistic demand forecasts could considerably increase the commercial viability of village grids.
H54|Financing Costs and the Efficiency of Public-Private Partnerships|The paper compares provision of public infrastructure via public-private partnerships (PPPs) with provision under government management. Due to soft budget constraints of government management, PPPs exert more effort and therefore have a cost advantage. At the same time, hard budget constraints for PPPs introduce a bankruptcy risk and bankruptcy costs. Consequently, PPPs may be less efficient, although this does not result from PPPs’ higher interest costs.
H54|Quiet Please! Adverse Effects of Noise on Child Development|Noise pollution is detrimental to health and to cognitive development of children. This is not only true for extreme levels of noise in the neighborhood of an airport but also to traffic noise in urban areas. Using a census of preschool children, we show that children who are exposed to intensive traffic noise significantly fall behind in terms of school readiness. Being exposed to additional 10 dB(A) compares to about 3 months in kindergarten. We contribute to the literature and the policy debate by working with administrative data and focusing on everyday exposure to noise. The proposed method is easily applied to other regions. We assess the public costs of different abatement instruments and compare the costs to the benefits. It turns out that the commonly used abatement measures like quiet pavement or noise protection walls in densely populated areas of about 3,000 to 5,000 inhabitants per km2 can be cost efficient, even with a conservative assessment of the benefits.
H54|Public investment in R&D in reaction to economic crises: A longitudinal study for OECD countries|The paper investigates the reaction of public R&D spending on economic crises. We are interested in two counteracting motives: On the one hand, public R&D spending can be seen as a means to fight the crisis, and governments may decide to increase their R&D budgets. On the other hand, a crisis reduces public income and urges governments to cut spending, which may negatively affect public R&D budgets. Using panel data from 26 OECD countries over the period 1995 to 2015, we investigate how public R&D expenditure changes over the business cycle for different types of government R&D expenditure. On average, we find evidence for a strong pro-cyclical effect on public R&D investments. But country heterogeneity matters. Whereas European innovation leaders and non-EU countries pursue a counter-cyclical strategy, innovation followers and moderate innovators behave pro-cyclical. This leads to an increasing innovation gap in Europe. Short-run and long-run financing conditions (budget surplus and government debt levels) also significantly affect public R&D spending. However, there is no evidence that economic crises systematically affect the composition of public R&D spending along different thematic areas or by beneficiaries.
H54|International tax competition: A reappraisal| This paper investigates the interactions between tax policies at the international level (OECD countries). Both contemporaneous and time-delayed tax interactions are considered using Spatial Dynamic Panel Data model from Yu et al. (2008). Moreover, we test if the interdependence between governments exists due to the geographic closeness but also due to the proximity in terms of public investment levels. The results show, on one hand, that there are positive contemporaneous but negative time-delayed interactions. It is compatible with the existence of tax competition in a contemporaneus way, but also with the free-riding phenomena in the time-delayed approach. On the other hand, we show that interactions between countries are higher when they have similar levels of public investment than for the geographical closeness. This last result confirms the theoretical assumption that countries with close infrastructure investment are more likely to achieve tax harmonization. However, the negative time-delayed interactions are not consistent with this hypothesis, proving both tax and infrastructure competition between the OECD countries still exists.

H54|Quasi-fiscal Deficits in the Electricity Sector of the Middle East and North Africa: Sources and Size|The annual electricity investments needed in the Middle East and North Africa region to keep up with demand have been estimated at about 3 percent of the region’s projected gross domestic product. However, in most economies of the region, the ability to make those investments is limited by fiscal and macroeconomic constraints. This paper demonstrates that the solution is readily available: by improving the management and performance of the region’s utilities, more than enough resources could be freed up to make the investments needed. The paper presents the first evaluation of the size and composition of the quasi-fiscal deficit associated with the management of the electricity sector in 14 economies in the Middle East and North Africa region. The estimations are for 2013. They show that the average quasi-fiscal deficit is 4.4 percent of gross domestic product (but goes down to 2.9 percent if Lebanon, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Jordan are excluded). Only five economies have a quasi-fiscal deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Qatar, and the West Bank), and hence would not be able to finance the average investment requirement through elimination of inefficiencies. For most economies, the main driver of the quasi-fiscal deficit is the underpricing of electricity, which costs on average 3.2 percent of gross domestic product (but 2.2 percent without Lebanon, Djibouti, Bahrain, and Jordan). Commercial inefficiency comes next, at an average cost of 0.6 percent of gross domestic product. Technical and labor inefficiencies represent, respectively, 0.4 and 0.2 percent of gross domestic product.
H54|Transport Infrastructure, City Productivity Growth and Sectoral Reallocation: Evidence from China|This paper examines the impact of highway expansion on aggregate productivity growth and sectoral reallocation between cities in China. To do so, I construct a unique dataset of bilateral transportation costs between Chinese cities, digitized highway network maps, and firm-level census. I first derive and estimate a market access measure for cities in China from 1995 to 2005. I then examine the channels through which the highway infrastructure affected economic outcomes. The results suggest that highways promoted aggregate productivity growth by facilitating the entry of new firms and reallocation among existing firms. I estimate the aggregate economic impact of China's national highway system and find that eliminating all highways in China would decrease aggregate productivity by 3.2%. There is also evidence that the national highway system led to a sectoral reallocation between cities in China.
H54|Investing in Human Capital to Boost Growth!|The Italian economy performs well below the EU average. The reason is a dramatic and persistent low rate of investment, always invoked but never supported by national and supra-national institutions. However, investment to increase the quantity and quality of human capital is key to boost economic growth and cannot be achieved without adequate financial resources. At the same time, the educational system needs to relaunch university reforms (including the Gelmini and 3+2 reforms) which have been unsuccessful so far because they were poorly implemented. Last but not least, more and better ties between the educational system and the labor market should be developed as soon as possible.
H54|Fungibility and bandwagon effects of capital transfers in a federal context|The authors quantify the fungibility effect or diversion of resources towards purposes other than investment, by regions receiving conditional capital transfers. To identify this behaviour, they have taken different empirical approaches with frontier techniques that let them quantify whether the regions are investing the maximum available funds, given certain environmental factors. The results show that Spanish regions divert hardly any of their potential investments, and that the most prosperous regions are the ones that let the most resources leak into other uses, especially in economic boom periods. In contrast, in some poor regions the authors can identify the opposite phenomenon, in which resources are dragged along towards investment (bandwagon effect). They identified several factors explaining the fungibility effect: political aspects, poor management or planning associated with the accumulated debt, the political cost of tax collection, and other variables such as the level of economic development, population density, and the economic cycle.

H54|The road mileage user-fee: Level, intensity, and predictors of public support|The road mileage user-fee is viewed as a promising alternative to the fuel tax, which in recent years has proven to be an inadequate means of financing road infrastructure. Public opposition is often thought to be a barrier to the political feasibility of the road mileage user-fee. We use a nationally representative public opinion survey to investigate the level and intensity of support for replacing the fuel tax with a general mileage user-fee and with three specific modes of administration of the fee. Our results confirm that public opposition to the adoption of mileage user-fees to address the growing revenue inadequacy of fuel taxes is high, with the number of opponents exceeding the number of supporters by a ratio of 4-1. Furthermore, public support is somewhat sensitive to respondents' belief in the user-pays principle and perceptions of the characteristics of the mode of administration. Additionally, relative to supporters, those who oppose the mileage user-fee are more likely to state that they are willing to take political action against the adoption of mileage user-fees.
H54|The American paradox: ideology of free markets and the hidden practice of directional thrust|The USA presents a paradox. The US state has practised production-focused industrial policy from the early years of the republic, with benefits that by any plausible measure far exceed costs. But since the 1980s, the exchange-focused idea that ‘the free market is what works, and having the state help it is usually a contradiction in terms’ has been at the normative centre of gravity in public policy discourse. With ‘industrial policy’ rendered toxic, the state has disguised its production-focused practice, to the point where even non-ideological academic researchers claim that the USA does industrial policy not at all, or badly. This essay reviews the history of US industrial policy, with an emphasis on ‘network-building industrial policy’ over the past two decades. At the end, it draws a lesson for policy communities in other countries and interstate development organisations such as the World Bank and IMF.
H54|Highways, Market Access, and Spatial Sorting|We design a spatial model featuring workers embodied with heterogeneous skills. In equilibrium, locations with improved market access become relatively more attractive to the high-skilled, high-income earners. We then empirically analyze the effects of the construction of the Swiss highway network between 1960 and 2010 on the distribution of income at the local level, as well as on employment and commuting by education level. We find that the advent of a new highway access within 10km led to a long-term 19%-increase of the share of high-income taxpayers and a 6%-decrease of the share of low-income taxpayers. Results are similar for employment data decomposed by education level, as well as for in- and out-commuters. Highways also contributed to job and residential urban sprawl.
H54|Harmonization of R&D Tax Credits across the European Union: Nonsense or common sense?| We examine the relevance of R&D tax credits as incentives to spur investment in R&D throughout the European Union (EU) and discuss the relevance and feasibility of harmonizing these tax-based policy instruments across Member States. Based on a thorough investigation of the instruments implemented in five selected European countries (Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK), we argue that the main obstacle to harmonization lies in the great diversity of instruments and eligibility conditions that currently prevail across the EU. We conduct a subsidiarity test, which suggests that, if the EU decides to move towards a harmonized R&D tax credit framework, it should at least impose a minimal level of tax rebate at the EU level, possibly complemented by additional country-level incentives. We highlight that the recent proposal of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) goes further than this minimal EU-level tax credit, by suggesting to implement a “super-deduction” that would allow EU-based firms to deduce more than 100% of their R&D expenditures from their tax base. We also discuss, as far as the harmonization of R&D tax credits is concerned, possible implication of Brexit both for the UK and for the EU. To complement our reflection and discussion, we develop an econometric analysis on our five selected countries. The super‐deduction proposed by the European Commission (EC) has its roots in the conviction that economic growth in Europe can only be knowledge-based, and that the current level of R&D investment in the EU is too low. The EC hopes that the super‐deduction will boost R&D investment across Europe, which is assumed to be conducive to more innovation and, ultimately, more growth. Our econometric analysis allows us to test whether this hope is empirically grounded, by examining whether the R&D tax credits implemented in the five aforementioned EU countries have spurred R&D and innovation (measured by patenting intensity) between 1980 and 2007. We find that the R&D conducted when a tax credit is available is associated with more R&D in the future in all five countries, and with more innovation in three countries out of five. However, we do not find any causal effect of the tax credit on innovation.
H54|Does the Literature Support a High Willingness to Pay for Green Label Buildings? An Answer with Treatment of Publication Bias|Increasing attention is being paid to the building sector due to its importance in the climate change debate. In recent years, a growing literature on the price premium paid by consumers to access more energy efficient and sustainable buildings has emerged as a common topic in hedonic model estimations. In this paper, we aim to provide a summary of this literature by conducting a meta-analysis of more than 50 studies from around the world. In this way, based on a random effects models and weighted OLS robust clustering estimations, we offer an average estimation of the price premium accepted by economic agents (in terms of sale prices) in order to enjoy energy efficient and sustainable buildings. This supports the argument that investing in building refurbishment is worthwhile and economically relevant. However, our data seem to show a major publication bias. Correcting for this bias leads us to halve the original estimation (from 8 % to 4 %). In addition, we analyze the sources of result dispersion by performing a meta-regression using different moderators (type of publication, bibliometric variables, sample analysis period, econometric method, etc.). We also carry out different statistical tests and use alternative selection criteria in order to check whether our estimations are robust. Finally, we make recommendations for future hedonic studies as well as for upcoming meta-analyses of the green building premium.
H54|So, Why Didn’t the 2009 Recovery Act Improve the Nation’s Highways and Bridges?|Although the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act) provided nearly $28 billion to state governments for improving U.S. highways, the highway system saw no significant improvement. For example, relative to the years before the act, the number of structurally deficient or functionally obsolete bridges was nearly unchanged, the number of workers on highway and bridge construction did not significantly increase, and the annual value of construction put in place for public highways barely budged. The author shows that as states spent Recovery Act highway grants, many simultaneously slashed their own contributions to highway infrastructure, freeing up state dollars for other uses. Next, using a cross-sectional analysis of state highway spending, the author shows that a state’s receipt of Recovery Act highway dollars had no statistically significant causal impact on that state’s total highway spending. Thus, the amount of actual highway infrastructure investment following the act’s passage was likely very similar to that under a no-stimulus counterfactual.
H54|Working Paper 01-17 - Public Investment in Belgium - Current State and Economic Impact|Belgian government investment, and specifically the part spent on infrastructure, is relatively low both in historical terms and compared to neighbouring countries. A simulation with the European Commission's Quest III model suggests that increasing government investment permanently by 0.5% of GDP leads to a growth in GDP, private consumption and private investment. The impact of alternative financing mechanisms is compared. Finally, a budget neutral shift of investment in favour of infrastructure is found to yield significant benefits in terms of GDP and its main components already in the medium run.
H54|Infrastructural Development and Poverty Alleviation in Indonesia (Municipal Panel Data 2002 – 2013)|"""Objective – This study attempts to provide comprehensive findings on the impact of several kinds of infrastructural developments and government budgets on specific purposes, as well as agricultural and non-agricultural productions, on poverty alleviation in Indonesia between 2002-2013. Methodology/Technique – This study uses macroeconomic data at a municipal level to provide more precise findings when comparing provincial and national level data. The study uses an adaptation of the theory of international development. Findings – This research shows that electricity and sanitation are more effective at eradicating poverty than water infrastructure. In addition, household access to infrastructure is more effective in combatting poverty than the government budget for infrastructure development. The study also performs correlation matrices, dividing the data into the western and eastern parts of Indonesia, to provide more robust findings. Agricultural production is more effective in the western part of Indonesia, yet non-agricultural production is more relevant towards poverty reduction in the eastern part of Indonesia. Novelty – This study yields some empirical results and conclusions for economic development in Indonesia, finding that the key problem lies in the effectiveness of budget arrangement within the framework of fiscal decentralization."""
H54|Public-private partnerships from budget constraints: Looking for debt hiding?|The use of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to realize and operate public infrastructures is often associated with fiscal-circumventing motivations. Using data at the municipal level, this paper investigates whether budget-constrained public authorities adopt PPPs in order to hide public debt. The results show that financial difficulties often lead to a preference for PPPs instead of traditional forms of public procurement, but this behavior is not explained by the possibility of debt-hiding. Explanations for these findings are discussed.
H54|The role of economic analysis for investment priorities in Sweden’s transport sector|Beginning as a planning tool within the national road administration in the early 1970s, benefit-cost analysis (BCA) became a pillar of national transport policy because of strategic choices made by the national parliament. The Transport Policy Act of 1979 established marginal instead of average cost as the overarching principle for pricing of transport. The subsequent 1988 Act separated rail infrastructure from train-service provision. Both policy updates made it necessary to widen the analysis of costs to include also externalities and a foregone conclusion was that efficient investment priorities should be made based on BCA. But no one asked whether the political decision makers or the BCA models were apt to that task. This paper reviews the current state of BCA for transport infrastructure investment and considers design issues that have been and still are debated, also providing a benchmark description of how these issues have been addressed elsewhere. Moreover, the role of BCA as a platform for prioritization of investment project is reviewed.

H54|Building resilience to natural disasters: An application to small developing states|We present a dynamic small open economy model to explore the macroeconomic impact of a major natural disaster. In addition to permanent damages to public and private capital, the disaster causes temporary losses of productivity, inefficiencies during the reconstruction process, and damages to the sovereign's creditworthiness. We use the model to study the debt sustainability concerns that arise from the need to fully rebuild public infrastructure over the medium term and analyze the feasibility of ex ante policies, such as building adaptation infrastructure and fiscal buffers, and contrast these policies with the post-disaster support provided by donors. Investing in resilient infrastructure may prove useful, in particular if it is viewed as complementary to standard infrastructure, because it raises the marginal product of private capital, crowding in private investment, while helping withstand the impact of the natural disaster. In an application to Vanuatu, we find that donors should provide an additional 50% of pre-cyclone GDP in grants to be spent over the following 15 years to ensure public debt remains sustainable following Cyclone Pam. Helping the government build resilience on the other hand, reduces the risk of debt distress and at lower cost for donors.

H54|Public Investment and Golden Rule of Public Finance in an Overlapping Generations Model|This paper develops an overlapping generations model with debt-financed public investment. The model assumes that the government is subject to the golden rule of public finance and that households are Yaari-Blanchard type. It is shown that the growth-maximizing and utility-maximizing tax rates do not satisfy the Barro tax rule, which is equal to the output elasticity of public capital. Furthermore, we show that both tax rates positively depend on longevity, with an aging population increasing debt per GDP. This result captures a tendency of increasing debt per GDP under population aging in the real world.
H54|The Dynamics of Corruption and Unemployment in a Growth Model with Heterogeneous Labour|This paper presents an overlapping generations growth model with heterogeneous labour, endogenous unemployment, and public sector corruption. Unlike most previous studies, the model does not separate public officials and private individuals into two distinct groups. Instead, taking up bureaucratic appointment as a public servant is modelled as an occupational choice, which then allows for the endogenous determination of the proportion of public oÂ¢fficials, the share of corrupt officials among them, and the public investment efficiency of the economy within the dynamic system. Parameterised for Nigeria, the dynamics of endogenous corruption and unemployment, as well as their policy tradeoff, are studied using numerical policy experiments based on relevant themes in the country, which include public sector downsizing and social intervention schemes.
H54|Infrastructure Investment, Labor Productivity, and International Competitiveness: The Case of Portugal|This study analyzes the effects of infrastructure investment on labor productivity at the industry level using a newly developed data set for infrastructure investments in Portugal. We consider twenty-two sectors and twelve infrastructure assets. We focus on the differential effects on traded and non-traded sectors. We find, first, that investment in national roads have positive effects, particularly large for public services, while the effects of investments in municipal roads are mixed, and investments in highways have mostly benefited the non-traded sectors. Second, we find that railroad investments, and to a lesser extent airports have clearly biased labor productivity gains toward the non-traded sectors, while the effects of port investments are more muted and mixed. Third, for social infrastructure investments, the effects tend to be large and again particularly favorable to the non-traded sectors. Fourth, for public utilities the effects are in general small, with the exception of investments in telecommunications, which have large positive effects mainly on non-traded sectors. We conclude that infrastructure investments have contributed to the growth of labor productivity in Portugal but have done so in a way that has benefitted mostly non-traded goods sectors. This may be a matter of concern for a small open economy in a currency union and with a development model greatly reliant on exports.
H54|Is All Infrastructure Investment Created Equal? The Case of Portugal|In this paper we analyze the effects of infrastructure investment on economic performance in Portugal using a newly developed data set. We employ a vector autoregressive approach to estimate the elasticity and marginal products of investments on twelve different types of infrastructure investment on private investment, employment and output. We find that the largest long-term accumulated effects come from investments in railroads, ports, airports, health, education, and telecommunications. For all of these infrastructures, the output multipliers are sizable enough to suggest that these investments would pay for themselves in the form of additional tax revenues. We find also that for investments in airports and health infrastructures the bulk of the effects are short-term demand side effects while for railroads and health the bulk of the effects come from long-term supply side effects. Finally, investments in health and airports show a clear pattern of decreasing marginal returns with railroads, ports, and telecommunications showing a relative stable pattern. In terms of the other infrastructure assets, we find that the economic effects of investments in municipal roads, highways, and electricity and gas are not significant or relevant. Investments in national roads, waste and waste water, and refinery infrastructures have positive economic effects but not large enough to also have a positive budgetary effects. Clearly, not all infrastructure investments are created equal along several and rather relevant dimensions from a policy perspective.
H54|Why Virtuous Supply-Side Effects and Irrelevant Keynesian Effects are not Foregone Conclusions: What we Learn from an Industry-Level Analysis of Infrastructure Investments in Portugal|We use the industry-specific effects of twelve different infrastructure investments in Portugal to inform about the mechanisms through which such investments affect economic activity. Our main findings are as follows. First, demand-side effects that are approximated by adding the short-term and long-term construction effects are very important. They are over 60% of total effects for airport investments, ports, refineries, and water, and over 45% for national roads, municipal roads, telecommunications, health and education. Second, site-location effects that are approximated by real-estate effects are also very significant, in particular for national roads, highways and railroads, with 30%, 35% and 64% of the total effects, respectively. They are negative for water and electricity, and zero for municipal roads, airports, and refineries, and negligible for ports, i.e., all these are cases in which we would expect adverse or small location effects. Third, the functional channel relating to internationally-traded goods, approximated by the effects on the primary sector, on manufacturing, and on transportation, is much less significant, although we estimate meaningful effects on heavy industry from investments in all types of road infrastructures, ports, health, and education, as well as on light industry from ports. Fourth, a functional effect affecting non-traded industries, mostly private and public services is much more relevant. It accounts for more than 30% of the effects in the cases of municipal roads, airports, and refineries, and in excess of 20% for highways, railroads, telecommunications, health and education. The fact that most functional effects accrue to non-traded industries is likely to affect international competitiveness adversely. Naturally, these results cannot be automatically generalized, as the nature of the effects of infrastructure investments crucially depends on the level of development of the country in question, on the maturity of its existent infrastructure systems, and on the rigor of all decisions pertaining to infrastructure investment. Nevertheless, they establish that, as infrastructure investments are concerned, the dominance of virtuous supply side effects is not a foregone conclusion and, conversely, the relevance of Keynesian effects cannot be dismissed.
H54|Infrastructure Investment in Portugal and the Traded/Non-Traded Industry Mix|Using a newly-developed data set for Portugal, we analyze the industry-level effects of infrastructure investment. Focusing on the divide between traded and non-traded industries, we find that infrastructure investments have a non-traded bias, as these shift the industry mix towards private and public services. We also find that the industries that benefit the most in relative terms are all non-traded: construction, trade, and real estate, among the private services, and education and health, amongst the public services. Similarly, emerging trading sectors, such as hospitality and professional services stand to gain. The positive impacts on traded industries are too small to make a difference. These results highlight that infrastructure-based strategies are not neutral in terms of the industry mix. Moreover, with most of the benefits accruing to non-traded industries, such a development model that is heavily based on domestic demand may be unsustainable in light of Portugal’s current foreign account position
H54|On the Effects of Infrastructure Investments on Industrial CO2 Emissions in Portugal|We estimate how infrastructure investments affect industrial CO2 emissions in Portugal. Using empirical evidence on the economic effects of twelve types of infrastructure investments at the industry level, we consider twenty-two industries and the respective CO2 emission factors. Our conclusions are as follows. First, given the current emission factors for each industry, almost all types on infrastructure investments help the emissions intensity of the economy. Only for investments in airports and in health facilities are such positive effects absent. Second, the relevance of the economic effects of the different types of infrastructure investments on the electrical power industry is central in determining the overall effects on emissions. This is not surprising, given that electric power accounts for nearly 35% of CO2 emissions in Portugal and the extremely high emissions factor of this industry amplifies even small economic effects. Third, under an alternative scenario in which the emissions from the electric power industry have been eliminated – due to the use of renewable energy in production, for example – , or are otherwise ignored, we still see that most infrastructure investments lead to a decline in the CO2 emissions intensity. In this case, however, investments in national roads leave the emissions intensity essentially unchanged, while investments in health infrastructure have adverse effects on emissions. There are several important policy implications of these results when we consider infrastructure investment strategies that are mindful of their CO2 emission effects. Consider, for instance, transportation infrastructures. Given the present electric power generating mix, investment in national roads would be an appropriate policy recommendation from an environmental perspective, while investments in airport infrastructure should be avoided. Under a scenario of aggressive use of renewable energy sources in the production of electricity, however, the best investments would be in railroads and airports, two industries highly dependent on the use of electricity
H54|Health Care Investments and Economic Performance in Portugal: An Industry Level Analysis|We analyze how public and private health care investments affect economic performance in Portugal. With a newly-developed data set for twenty-two industries, we use a vector autoregressive model to estimate the elasticities and marginal products on investment, employment and output. First, every €1 million invested in health care yields significant positive spillover effects, boosting investment and GDP by €24.74 and €20.45 million, respectively, and creating 188 net jobs. Adversely, net exports deteriorate, as most of the new capital goods are imported. Second, while only 28.2% of the total accumulated increase in GDP occurs within a year, investment is front-loaded with a corresponding 73.8%. Over this period, 68 workers are displaced for every €1 million invested. Third, at a disaggregated level, real estate, construction, and transportation and storage are the three industries where output shares increase the most. Employment shares increase the most in professional services, construction, and basic metals. These results have important policy implications. Health investments enhance long-term performance, but are unhelpful counter-cyclically. Also, they will change the industry mix: construction and professional services are the non-traded industries that will benefit the most, while the traded industries of non-metallic minerals, basic metals, and machinery and equipment benefit much less.
H54|Financing Urban Infrastructure in Canada: Who Should Pay?|The poor state of municipal infrastructure is the subject of frequent complaint in Canada. Roads are congested, transit systems are in need of major investments, bridges are crumbling, and water treatment plants need to be replaced. Municipalities continue to seek financial assistance from the federal and provincial governments, but are transfers really the best way to pay for municipal capital investments? This paper provides an overview of how municipal infrastructure is funded in Canada with an emphasis on the extent to which the users of infrastructure pay the costs. The paper concludes that although user fees are increasing in Canadian municipalities, better pricing is needed to link those who benefit with those who pay for municipal infrastructure.
H54|The Effect of Fibre Broadband on Student Learning|We estimate the impact of ultra-fast broadband on schools’ academic performance using a difference-in-difference study of a new fibre broadband network. We show that fibre broadband increases primary schools’ passing rates in standardised assessments by roughly one percentage point. Estimates are robust to alternative specifications, such as controlling for time-varying covariates. We find no evidence that gender, ethnic minorities or students enrolled in remote schools benefit disproportionately. However, we find some evidence of a larger benefit within schools that have a greater proportion of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds
H54|Consequences of the Clean Water Act and the Demand for Water Quality|Since the 1972 U.S. Clean Water Act, government and industry have invested over $1 trillion to abate water pollution, or $100 per person- year. Over half of U.S. stream and river miles, however, still violate pollution standards. We use the most comprehensive set of files ever compiled on water pollution and its determinants, including 50 million pollution readings from 240,000 monitoring sites and a network model of all U.S. rivers, to study water pollution’s trends, causes, and welfare consequences. We have three main findings. First, water pollution concentrations have fallen substantially. Between 1972 and 2001, for example, the share of waters safe for fishing grew by 12 percentage points. Second, the Clean Water Act’s grants to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which account for $650 billion in expenditure, caused some of these declines. Through these grants, it cost around $1.5 million (2014 dollars) to make one river-mile fishable for a year. We find little displacement of municipal expenditure due to a federal grant. Third, the grants’ estimated effects on housing values are smaller than the grants’ costs; we carefully discuss welfare implications.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H54|The political economy of transportation investment|Will politics lead to over-building or under-building of transportation projects? In this paper, we develop a model of infrastructure policy in which politicians overdo things that have hidden costs and underperform tasks whose costs voters readily perceive. Consequently, national funding of transportation leads to overspending, since voters more readily perceive the upside of new projects than the future taxes that will be paid for distant highways. Yet when local voters are well-informed, the highly salient nuisances of local construction, including land taking and noise, lead to under-building. This framework explains the decline of urban mega-projects in the US (Altshuler and Luberoff, 2003) as the result of increasingly educated and organized urban voters. Our framework also predicts more per capita transportation spending in low-density and less educated areas, which seems to be empirically correct.
H54|What explains Regional Imbalances in Infrastructure?: Evidence from Indian States|The literature on regional growth suggests that divergences in infrastructure is a major factor behind the wide and persistent regional growth imbalances in India. Using a state infrastructure-expenditure function, the paper examines the possible factors that determine infrastructure expenditure and its implication for regional imbalance in infrastructure creation across 14 major Indian states. We, in the present study, find that factors such as resource mobilization, per capita income, and population density may result in unequal infrastructure expenditure across states. We also find that factors such as more spending by the infrastructure-deficit states, political stability, and positive spatial dependence in infrastructure expenditure among states have a balancing effect on infrastructure creation across regions. These results suggest the need for augmenting the financial capacity of the infrastructure-deficit states and strengthening the positive spatial dependence among states through creation of interstate infrastructure networks (railways, national highways etc.) and conducive investment climate, which could boost competition among states for better infrastructure creation.
H54|Support to fisheries: Levels and impacts|The OECD Fisheries Support Estimate (FSE) database collects and classifies information on budgetary transfers to the fisheries sector in 31 countries that together account for 35% of global fisheries landings. In 2015, the most recent year, it inventories policies and programmes totalling USD 7 billion. Most of this support is found to be directed towards general services to the fishing sector, mainly in the form of fisheries management costs, but also for, inter alia, infrastructure, research and stock enhancement. Approximately USD 500 million per year is used for programmes that deliver funds directly in the hands of fishers. The share of this form of support has been decreasing over time. Payments based on the use of variable inputs are found to be the most likely to provoke increased fishing effort, while payments based on fixed capital formation are most likely to encourage increased capacity levels. Payments based on fishers income are less likely to increase effort or capacity and may be more effective at improving the welfare of fishers. Payments to general services for the sector are least likely to increase effort or fishing capacity.
H54|Enhancing public sector efficiency and effectiveness in the Czech Republic|Spending on public administration itself is relatively low and so are indicators of its performance. Challenges include wastage in public procurement, insufficient management of the investment cycle and high levels of staff turnover. This paper considers ways of building on recent reforms, including better procedures for EU-financed projects and the new Civil Service Act, to raise the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector. Performance monitoring is underused but could help drive improvements in service delivery. The structure of local government, which includes over 6 200 municipalities, exacerbates the challenges of the public administration by complicating co-ordination and stretching capacity. Accordingly, the second part of the paper focuses on ways of improving the efficiency and quality of public service delivery and realising greater benefits from decentralisation. Rendre le secteur public plus efficient et fonctionnel dans la République tchèque Les dépenses consacrées à l'administration publique proprement dite sont relativement faibles, et il en va de même de ses performances. Parmi les défis à relever, on peut citer notamment des gaspillages dans les marchés publics, une gestion insatisfaisante du cycle d'investissement et une rotation rapide des personnels. Le présent article est consacré aux moyens qui permettraient de prolonger les réformes récentes, en s’appuyant par exemple sur une amélioration des procédures qui régissent les projets financés par l'UE et sur la nouvelle loi sur la fonction publique, qui vise à rendre le secteur public plus efficace et plus efficient. Le suivi des résultats est peu pratiqué alors qu'il pourrait entraîner des progrès dans la prestation des services. La structure des collectivités locales, avec plus de 6 200 communes, aggrave les problèmes d'administration publique en compliquant la coordination et en dispersant les capacités. La deuxième partie de l’article porte donc sur les moyens d'améliorer l'efficience et la qualité de la prestation de services publics ainsi que de mieux tirer parti de la décentralisation.
H54|Climate-resilient infrastructure: Getting the policies right|Climate change will affect all types of infrastructure, including energy, transport and water. Rising temperatures, increased flood risk and other potential hazards will threaten the reliable and efficient operation of these networks, with potentially large economic and social impacts. Decisions made now about the design, location and operation of infrastructure will determine how resilient they will be to a changing climate.This paper provides a framework for action aimed at national policymakers in OECD countries to help them ensure new and existing infrastructure is resilient to climate change. It examines national governments’ action in OECD countries, and provides recent insights from professional and industry associations, development banks and other financial institutions on how to make infrastructure more resilient to climate change.
H54|Managing disaster-related contingent liabilities in public finance frameworks|Natural disasters have caused, and continue to cause, a significant amount of economic costs. The costs of disasters are often, and to a large extent, shouldered by governments, especially in economies where private insurance markets are not well developed. Governments are asked to provide financing for explicit commitments made prior to a disaster, and are often under pressure to make payments for which no such commitments were made earlier. Ex-post costs to governments take the form of contingent liabilities within national budgeting and government balance sheet frameworks. Disasters can thereby cause both downside risks to government revenue as well as to expenditure. There is little evidence, and hence limited policy advice, on how disaster-related contingent liabilities are managed by governments. This paper sets out to clarify the concept of contingent liabilities and the channels through which they can impact government balance sheets, including fiscal risks. It provides a framework for identifying and quantifying disaster-related contingent liabilities with a view to inform country case studies for comparative policy analysis.
H54|Government borrowing cost and budget deficits: is investment spending different?| Abstract The reasons for and underlying composition of government budget deficits are often disregarded both by the academic literature about the links between fiscal policy and interest rates and by the policy debate about fiscal sustainability. However, we show that, from the perspective of financial markets, not all budget deficits are created equal: bond markets do discriminate between deficits that are the result of higher government current spending and those that stem from higher government investment, penalising the former significantly more than the latter. To do so, we apply a reduced-form regression approach to a panel of 31 OECD economies from 1960 to 2014 with data from the European Commission on the decomposition of the government budget deficit into its current spending, investment spending and revenue components. Quantitatively, based on our preferred specifications, a higher deficit solely due to higher government investment would in fact decrease long-term government bond yields. These findings suggest that austerity policies should focus more on current spending than investment spending and that fiscal rules in individual countries and monetary unions should distinguish budget deficits that are the result of investment from those that are not.
H54|Global Infrastructure Projects as the Factor of National Economies’s Development (the case of the Turkish Stream Gas Pipeline)|The current stage of the economy’s development differs from the past ones in that the role of global infrastructure projects acquires ever more importance and that forming and designing of such programs becomes now a much more sophisticated process, all of this has led to a situation where we have to revise our system of economic methods of the evaluation benefits of a global infrastructure project for all involved countries. The existing methods and ways of evaluation influence global infrastructure projects on socio-economic development of the participating countries are to be complemented by new approaches reflecting the market changes and the advent of new financial instruments and stratagems. The aim of the paper is to evaluate influence the global infrastructure project on socio-economic development of the participating countries in the globalized world economy with respect to its main economic and social consequences and synergy effects (the case of the Turkish Stream gas pipeline). The aim of the paper is to evaluate influence the global infrastructure project on socio-economic development of the participating countries in the globalized world economy with respect to its main economic and social consequences and synergy effects (the case of the Turkish Stream gas pipeline). The authors crated methodological approach to the study of infrastructure projects influence on socio-economic development of the members based on the identification, evaluation and prediction of the influence of factors external and internal environment on the changing economic potential of the infrastructure projects participants. Adequate investment in the development of infrastructure is an important driver of long-term economic growth. Traditionally, infrastructure has been funded mostly through public investment. However, in view of scarcity of budgetary resources and lack of capacity within the government to implement these ambitious programs, the strategy of the government relies significantly on promoting investment through a combination of public investment and private participation (include foreign investors). The presented methodological approach allows to define and early diagnose the global infrastructure projects which facilitate a multiplication effect within the national economy.

H54|Does Experience Exert Impact on a PPP Performance?|Researchers traditionally assume that learning is a product of experience. In general it means that learning can only take place through the attempt to solve a problem and therefore only takes place during activity (Arrow, 1962). On the ground of organizational theory it has two implications. First we can agree that repeated activity requires less effort. Second we can argue that firms undertake activities, with which they have been the most successful in the past and that they expect to be the most successful in the future. The aim of the research is twofold. Firstly, this article aims to investigate if we can identify a relationship between the experience in PPP projects and the performance of initiatives of this kind. Secondly, the article aims to provide an interpretation of the relationship between experience and PPP performance. This research investigates factors influencing the survival of PPP projects in Poland over the period 2009-2015. Cox proportional hazard model is utilized to distinguish between PPPs that succeeded to the operation phase and those that were cancelled on the procurement stage. The research confirms the existence of a positive relationship between experience in PPP and the outcome of a PPP development.
H54|UK Infrastructure Investment and Finance from a European and Global Perspective|This study provides an overview of UK infrastructure investment and finance in an international context, yielding interesting facts and insights for both investors and policy makers worldwide. The UK is one of the leading countries in terms of private sector involvement in infrastructure, with several decades’ experience in regulating privatized utilities and in developing public-private partnerships (PPP). It has attracted substantial European and global capital, and London is a major market place for the infrastructure and green business. However, the UK has also seen decades of weak spending by the state (and taxpayers) on infrastructure. The country needs more investment when public budgets are already stretched. The question is whether private capital will be so easily available in future, especially from institutional and foreign investors.
H54|Cost-benefit analysis for flood risk management and water governance in the Netherlands; an overview of one century|The Netherlands is a global reference for flood risk management. This reputation is based on a mix of world-class civil engineering projects and innovative concepts of water governance. For more than a century, cost-benefit analysis has been important for flood risk management and water governance in the Netherlands. It has helped to select the most effective and efficient flood risk projects and to coordinate and reconcile the interests of various policy areas, levels of government and private stakeholders. This paper provides for the first time an overview of this well-developed practice. This includes the cost-benefit analysis in the 1901 act for enclosure of the Zuiderzee, van Dantzig’s famous formula for the economically optimal strength of dikes and a whole set of cost-benefit analyses for More room for rivers and the Delta Program for the next century. Dutch practice illustrates how cost-benefit analysis can support and improve flood risk management and water governance; other countries may learn from this. Rough calculations indicate that investing in cost-benefit analysis has been a highly profitable investment for Dutch society.
H54|Trends and Features of Research on Foreign Aid: A Literature Review|This paper reviews the economics literature on foreign aid. Aid supporters tend to emphasize results, while its detractors tend to highlight the incentives it provides (although they may still acknowledge some of aid’s positive results, particularly on public health). Like the modes to deliver it, research on foreign aid has evolved over the years. From the traditional aid-growth regressions research has refocused towards micro issues, including institutional inefficiencies or sector-specific bottlenecks. This tendency is positive, in so far as it can lead to useful policy advice that improves the way aid is given. Great gaps in knowledge remain, though. Notably, the aid market is poorly understood in aspects such as donors’ interaction with the recipient government or donors’ coordination. In terms of political economy, recipient countries’ decision making with regards to aid fungibility or the incentives provided by new types of aid (notably China’s) have been largely unexplored. Moreover, the types of public goods that improve households’ living standards are little understood. The scarcity of research on these questions is greatly due to lack of data – or even data opacity; if aid is to be better understood and improved, far greater efforts must be made in terms of collecting and sharing data.
H54|Investissement public et croissance économique en République Démocratique Du Congo<BR>[Public investment and economic growth in Democratic Republic of Congo]|The purpose of this article is to study the effect of public investment on economic growth. To achieve this objective, we used the method of Hansen (1996). The results of the econometric tests indicate an optimal threshold of public investment of 22% of the GDP, threshold above which the public investment has a positive and significant effect on the economic growth of the Democratic Republic of Congo over the period 1981-2015 . Indeed, any public investment below this threshold has no effect on economic growth. But any public investment beyond this threshold stimulates economic growth in the DRC.
H54|Prioritization of Public Investment Projects in Vietnam|Recently enforced Public Investment Law (PIL) provides a strong basis for the enhancement of the PIM system’s efficiency, however, the implementation of the PIL is progressing slowly. Quang Ninh province has been selected for an analysis of the practical difficulties authorities face in complying with PIL requirements, particularly in the preparation of investment intention reports. Discussions with provincial authorities revealed two major constraints: 1. lack of an investment intention report template and guidelines; 2. absence of methodologies and guidelines on the preliminary assessment of the socio-economic effectiveness of PIPs. The efficiency of the PIM system in Vietnam can only be improved if the investment intention reports prepared by project promoters are to form the basis for technical analysis of PIPs. The major component of technical analysis is an evaluation of PIP socio-economic returns. This evaluation should be done using CBA methodologies formulated from basic principles of applied welfare economics. The results of technical analysis must drive the project approval (or rejection) process, in sharp contrast to the current practice of approving projects to be included in regional development master plans before due diligence has been carried out.
H54|Public Investment, Time to Build, and the Zero Lower Bound|We study the effectiveness of public investment in stimulating an economy stuck in a liquidity trap. We do so in the context of a tractable new-Keynesian economy in which a fraction of government spending increases the stock of public capital subject to a time-to-build constraint. Public investment projects typically entail significant time-to-build delays, which often span several years from approval to completion. We show that this feature implies that the spending multiplier associated with public investment can be substantially large --- nearly twice as large as the multiplier associated with public consumption --- in a liquidity trap. Intuitively, when the time to build is sufficiently long, and to the extent that public capital raises the marginal productivity of private inputs, the resulting disinflationary effect will occur after the economy has escaped from the liquidity trap. At the same time, the increase in households' expected wealth amplifies aggregate demand while the economy is still in the liquidity trap. Using a medium-scale model extended to allow for the accumulation of public capital, we quantify the multiplier associated with the spending component of the 2009's ARRA, which allocated roughly 40% of the authorized funds to public investment. We find a peak multiplier of 2.31. Our results also indicate that failing to account for the composition of the stimulus by overlooking its investment component would lead one to underestimate the spending multiplier by about 50%.

H54|The Role and Impact of Infrastructure in Middle-Income Countries: Anything Special?|We examine the evolution of infrastructure, and the impact of infrastructure investment, in middleincome countries (MICs). We document how different types of infrastructure stocks, as well as infrastructure investment, vary with the level of development and growth performance. We then use the two-stage approach of Corsetti, Meier, and Müller (2012) to identify exogenous public investment shocks and investigate the macroeconomic impact of these shocks. We find that the provision of infrastructure varies across development stages; there is a focus on basic infrastructure, such as transport, water, and sanitation, during early stages, and an emphasis on “advanced” infrastructure, such as power and especially information and communication technology, in later stages. Better-performing MICs tend to invest more in infrastructure. They also have more information and communication technology infrastructure. Finally, we find a more significant and sustained impact of exogenous public investment shocks on output in MICs than in low-income countries.
H54|Infrastructure and Urbanization in the People’s Republic of China|The recent experience of infrastructure investment in PRC suggests an intertwined relationship between investment, urbanization, and economic growth. In one mechanism, urbanization generates demand for infrastructure investment, which then drives economic growth via various channels including reducing transaction costs and raising productivity. Another mechanism emphasized in this paper is that infrastructure investment can promote urbanization through facilitating economic agglomeration toward hub cities. This agglomeration process also raises productivity in the economy. The lessons from the PRC have implications for infrastructure financing. On the one hand, recent reforms have allowed the market to play an increasingly important role in funding infrastructure investment, helping improve the efficiency of infrastructure investment and the productivity of the economy. On the other hand, evidence in the PRC suggests a cross-province spillover effect of road infrastructure, supporting the central government’s role in infrastructure financing. Although the current infrastructure investment system is still distorted by local governments’ incentives and decisions, there is no evidence of over-investment in infrastructure at the aggregate level. Nevertheless, there is strong evidence that the marginal return to infrastructure investment in the PRC has been rapidly declining. Hence, it is urgent for policy makers to reform the existing system to base their investment decisions on the economic returns to infrastructure. The interregional flow of goods and production factors (labor and capital) is a fundamental force that drives urbanization, but the market may not be efficient in financing and infrastructure construction. This paper analyzes infrastructure-related institutions and the interrelation between infrastructure and urbanization. It addresses the following issues: What is the relationship between infrastructure, growth, and urbanization? How efficient have investment and financing been for infrastructure construction? How can we evaluate the performance of infrastructure development? How and to what extent should the government be involved in infrastructure construction?
H54|Government Spending With Public Debt, Economic Growth And Fiscal Balance: Evidences From India|This paper has examined the impact of public expenditure on economic growth and viability of fiscal policy when the public expenditure is financed by public borrowing. The ratio of gross fiscal deficit to net national product and the ratio of gross fiscal deficit to total expenditure have been considered as indicators of solvency in fiscal balance. The study is based on theoretical framework and results of econometric analyses. The basic argument of this paper is that if public expenditure is financed by government borrowing, but expenditure fails to generate sufficient growth in income, it will be difficult to repay the loan and fiscal balance will deteriorate. As a result, the viability of the fiscal policy will be under question. The data in the Indian context show that revenue expenditure has increased significantly over time. Since revenue expenditure includes many non-developmental and less productive components, it may not be helpful for economic growth. The results of time series analysis show that the ratio of gross fiscal deficit to net national product (NNP) has increased with increase in total expenditure of the government indicating non-sustainability of fiscal balance. The study also shows that private capital has significant positive impact on NNP but the effect of fiscal deficit on economic growth is not clear.
H54|Estimating production functions for the US states: the role of public and human capital|Abstract This paper estimates production functions for the 48 contiguous U.S. states over the 1970–2000 period employing recently developed panel estimators that tackle simultaneously parameter heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence and non-stationarity. The findings suggest that labor, private capital and, when controlling for cross-sectional dependence, average schooling years exert a positive and significant effect on state income. In contrast, the income effect of public capital stock is negative. The state-specific coefficients indicate that this effect likely stems from the negative elasticity of income with respect to public capital in the states located primarily in the Snow Belt region.
H54|Regional Economic Growth in Turkey: The Effects of Physical, Social and Financial Infrastructure Investments|This paper explores the roles different categories of infrastructure investment play in promoting economic growth across regions in Turkey. Two different approaches, namely partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and heteroskedastic panels corrected standard errors (HPC-SE) are used to compute regional physical, social and financial infrastructural indices and their impacts on income. Overall, the results reveal that differences in infrastructural endowments across Turkish regions explain a significant portion of regional disparity in per capita income. While financial infrastructure has a positive direct effect only, physical and social infrastructures contribute both directly and indirectly. We suggest that policy makers focus primarily on investing in physical infrastructure in order to mitigate the regional income disparity. Secondly, improving education, health and housing facilities as well as financial activities would contribute further diminishing income disparity across regions.
H54|The Impact of Road Development on Household Welfare in Rural Papua New Guinea|In this paper we estimate the impact of road development on household welfare in rural Papua New Guinea over the period between 1996 and 2010, using two cross-sectional household surveys and corresponding road maps. To deal with endogenous placement of road infrastructure programs we employ a correlated random effects model that corrects for location-specific changes in road quality. We also use a newly developed quantile regression method to investigate whether road works are pro-poor. Estimates show that investments in sealing roads to nearest towns led to higher consumption levels and housing quality, and to less reliance on subsistence farming. Effects are stronger among poor, less educated, and female-led households.
H54|Renegotiating Public-Private Partnerships|The renegotiations of public–private partnership (PPP) contracts are commonly considered to be one of the pitfalls of PPPs, as they tend to undermine their (ex ante) efficiency. A renegotiation occurs when specific events change the conditions of a concession, frequently leading to a financial claim from the private sector on the public sector. This paper examines the Portuguese experience with PPP renegotiations by means of a unique panel data of 254 renegotiation events from 1995 to 2012. We find evidence of opportunistic bidding for PPP contracts, which is ex post – after the contract is won and the competition eliminated - leading to renegotiations to increase revenues. Renegotiations last on average 1.8 years. Majority governments are more prone to renegotiate and have more political clout to limit the renegotiation duration. There is no evidence of more renegotiations in election years or when there is a change in government. A better institutional framework, defined as a low country risk, a strong rule of law, and lower corruption, tends to reduce the probability of renegotiations. There is also evidence that at times of higher corruption, more renegotiations occur. The project’s leverage decreases the renegotiation duration. Strong initial bidder competition for a PPP contract leads to long subsequent renegotiations between the winning private party and the government.

H54|Applying the Growth Identification and Facilitation Framework to Nepal|This paper analyzes opportunities for growth in Nepal by applying the policy tool of New Structural Economics â€“ Growth Identification and Facilitation Framework (GIFF). Drawing on firm level surveys, stakeholder interviews, and existing datasets it aims to contribute to policy discussions in Nepal and to demonstrate the use of the GIFF for other least developed countries. The report argues that Nepal should seek to capture industrial transfer from China to establish a foothold in global value chains, create employment and catalyze structural transformation. The report identifies product-level advantages arising from preferential market access and sector-specific binding constraints, and proposes how to use Special Economic Zones to mitigate identified constraints to set Nepal on a path of structural transformation.
H54|Social protection investments, human capital, and income growth: Simulating the returns to social cash transfers in Uganda|In this paper we assess the short- and mid-term effects of two cash transfer programmes in Uganda in terms of child underweight, school attainment, and the monetary returns to these indirect effects. Using a micro-simulation approach we test how the scale-up of these pilot interventions could affect human capital indicators and income growth. We first use panel data to estimate the links between income, child health, and school attainment. Thereafter we insert the estimates in a micro-simulation model to predict how cash transfer programmes could generate income returns through higher education attainment and compare programmes in terms of their rates of return.
H54|Valuing Public Goods More Generally: The Case of Infrastructure|We examine the relationship between local public goods, prices, wages, and population in an equilibrium inter-city model. Non-traded production, federal taxes, and imperfect mobility all affect how public goods (or “amenities” more broadly) should be valued from data. Reinterpreting the estimated effects of public infrastructure on prices and wages in Haughwout (2002), we find infrastructure over twice as valuable with our more general model. New estimates based on more years, cities, and data-sets indicate stronger wage and positive population effects of infrastructure. These imply higher values of infrastructure to firms, and also to households if moving costs are substantial.
H54|Saving Soviet Science: The Impact of Grants When Government R&D Funding Disappears|I estimate the impact of a historic grant program, funded by George Soros, that provided grants to over 28,000 Soviet scientists shortly after the end of the USSR. Exploiting a discontinuity in the grant eligibility formula, I show that the grants more than doubled publications on the margin, significantly induced scientists to remain in the science sector, and had long-lasting impacts. While existing evidence shows negligible impacts of scientific grants, I show that funding for science can have high marginal returns when funding levels are low relative to the stock of human capital.
