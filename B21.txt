B21|Your money and your life: risk attitudes over gains and losses|Prospect theory is the most influential descriptive alternative to the orthodox model of rational choice under risk and uncertainty, in terms of empirical analyses of some of its principal parameters and as a consideration in behavioural public policy. Yet the most distinctive implication of the theory – a fourfold predicted pattern of risk attitudes called the reflection effect – has been infrequently studied and with mixed results over money outcomes, and has never been completely tested over health outcomes. This article reports tests of reflection over money and health outcomes defined by life years gained from treatment. With open valuation exercises, the results suggest qualified support for the reflection effect over money outcomes and strong support over health outcomes. However, in pairwise choice questions, reflection was substantially ameliorated over life years, remaining significant only for treatments that offered short additional durations of life.
B21|La conception de l'homme dans la théorie de l'Echange Composite de François Perroux : entre homo economicus et homo religiosus|Cet article réexamine les fondements, analytiques, conceptuels et philosophiques sur lesquels repose la conception de l'homme que Perroux promeut pour définir l'Echange Composite par rapport à l'homo œconomicus propre à l'Echange Pur. Une première partie montre que l'Echange Composite constitue -i- une critique du rationalisme des modèles d'Echange pur marginalistes et d'équilibre général -ii- que cette critique repose sur une série de concepts qui ont contribués à définir le système que Perroux a toujours défendu (effets de domination, luttes-concours, conflits-coopérations, coûts de l'homme, dons et transferts contraints). Une seconde partie met en évidence que ces concepts trouvent leur origine dans une philosophie spécifique à la fois spiritualiste et communautariste qui s'inscrit dans l'oecuménisme chrétien de Perroux et qui fonde sa conception de l'homme.
B21|How Law and Economics Was Marketed in a Hostile World: L'institutionnalisation du champ aux États-Unis de l'immédiat après-guerre aux années Reagan|Cet article met en relief l'implication des fondations d'entreprises dans le développement de la Law and Economics aux Etats-Unis des lendemains de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale aux années Reagan. Il s'appuie notamment sur l'analyse de trajectoires individuelles ou collectives, qu'il s'agisse des programmes de recherche menés à l'université de Chicago par Aaron Director autour de l'antitrust, des programmes de formation des juges portés par Henry Manne ou encore des travaux académiques et du parcours administratif de Robert Bork. Il met l'accent sur le rôle de fondations d'entreprises pro-marché dans l'essor de la Law and Economics et sur son impact sur les manières de juger.
B21|From Disequilibrium to Equilibrium Macroeconomics: Barro and Grossman's Trade-off between Rigor and Realism|During the 1970s, Keynesian macroeconomics was challenged by the New Classical Economics of Robert Lucas. This involved a battle between disequilibrium and equilibrium macroeconomics. My article contributes to explain why the equilibrium approach came to dominate. My case study is Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman. In 1971, Barro and Grossman elaborated the basic disequilibrium model. In 1976, they wrote the first book on disequilibrium macroeconomics – i.e., Money, Employment, and Inflation. However, at the end of the 1970s, they came to advocate for equilibrium models à la Lucas (1972, 1975). My article traces how and why
B21|Does Marginal Productivity Mean Anything in Real Economic Life ?|The equality between factor pay and marginal product is a major component of the neoclassical paradigm. The paper begins with a brief historical review of this principle. Follows a questioning about the relevance of this law as an argument in the social debates: does marginal product represent the very contribution of the agent and if so, is it a legitimate reference for the setting of remuneration? Our answer to the first part of the question is irresolute; to the second, it is negative. But most of the article is devoted to analysing the economic realism of the said law, both empirically and theoretically. We review some statistical studies present in the literature, with particular attention for the debate regarding the regressions of Cobb and Douglas. Evidence does not strengthen the neoclassical law of retribution. The paper analyses the factors that hinder either the determinateness of marginal product or the equalisation between it and factor's remuneration. Are analysed: - the restrictions inherent in the law of marginal productivity: constant returns to scale and perfect competition - an alternative explanation of interest: the Austrian theory - incentive wage theories: efficiency wage and tournament theory. The article then considers the particular case of the CEO's remuneration.
B21|Introduction : Malaise dans la science économique ?<BR>[Introduction: Economics and Its Discontents]|"This is the introductive chapter to the book ""Wassily Leontief and Economics"", published in February 2019 (ENS editions). Economists produce their statements and forecasts from devices articulating abstract theories with mathematical models and statistical instruments of measurement. What is the empirical significance of these theories, models and instruments? We consider this question from the reflection of Wassily Leontief, 1973 Nobel Prize winner, on the role of mathematics and statistical analysis in economics. His perspective makes it possible to reconsider why, in economics, ""the connection does not go by itself"" between the theory and the observation, according to the expression of Alain Desrosières. We reconstruct Leontief’s methodology of economics as an empirical science. From there, we show how the input-output device paves the way to empirical and disaggregated macroeconomics."
B21|Corporate Governance Index And Its Determinants In Samsung Company|The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between Corporate Governance Index and with its dependents. This Samsung Company had been chosen as the focus of our studies. Five years of data were collected from Samsung’s annual reports and websites from the year 2014 until the year 2018. The data collected is used to calculate the descriptive analysis which will be shown in the reports. Based on our studies, the dependent variables were the Corporate Governance Index. And for the independent variables, We had chosen Return on Asset (ROA), Return On Equity (ROE), Tobin’s Q, and Altman Z as the Internal factors and for the data like GDP per capita, Unemployment rate, and Exchange rate had been chosen as the external factors. The Stepwise method is used to claiming the results for the Correlations, regression results and etc to observe the most significant with the corporate governance index. Only the unemployment rate shows the most influence on the Corporate Governance Index.

B21|20 Years of Research in Microfinance: An Information Management Approach|In the last 20 years, microfinance has moved from a promise to reality, although with ups and downs. This paper reviews 1,874 papers published from 1997 to 2017 to perform a scientometric analysis of the microfinance field. The literature review is based on bibliometric data: keyword co-occurrence networks and citation networks were exploited for knowledge mapping. Data analysis shows the two research traditions: papers focusing on clients (welfarists) and papers focusing on microfinance entities themselves (institutionalists). Institutionalism, which had little presence in the early research in microfinance, now exhibits great strength. A chronological analysis reveals the evolution of the topics most interesting to researchers: the first stage described the innovations of the microcredit practices and their impact; the second and very expansive stage in which microfinance institutions’ peculiarities were analyzed; and nowadays the sector is mature but with negative aspects arising, such as mission drift. The keywords analysis discovers emerging research topics, shows the use of sophisticated techniques, and recognizes an emerging trend of the sector: achieving financial inclusion.
B21|Gordon Tullock on Majority Voting: the Making of a Conviction|This paper participates in the formation of the history of public choice theory. In particular, it will focus on the role of Gordon Tullock and the analysis of the simple majority decision-making process promoted in the famous Calculus of Consent, written along with James M. Buchanan. This paper shows that Tullock has already think about the issue of majority voting prior to the writing of his common book with Buchanan. Between 1959 and 1961 in particular, while Tullock was a postdoctoral fellow at the Thomas Jefferson Center for Studies in Political Economy and Social Philosophy at the University of Virginia and later Assistant Professor in the Department of International Studies at the University of South Carolina, he had an interesting interaction with Anthony Downs about majority decision-making process in a democracy. This interaction that consists in a correspondence between Tullock, Downs and their editors can be found for a part in the Gordon Tullock papers of the Hoover Institution Archives. It gave birth to some major articles by the two authors such as The Problem of Majority Voting by Tullock in 1959, Why the Government Budget is Too Small in a Democracy by Downs in 1960, Problems of Majority Voting: In Defense of Majority Voting by Downs and Problems of Majority Voting: Reply to a Traditionalist by Tullock in 1961. Our purpose is to highlight the interaction that forms the basis of these publications and shows the way Tullock matured his view about the majoritarian rule – one of the cornerstones of the public choice theory – at this time.
B21|Corruption in Tax and Taxing the Corruption|Most of the countries in the world face corruption and struggling against to it in many aspects. Due to various loopholes and institutional inefficiencies it continues to be pressing issues which affects public in various dimensions. The long existence of corruption around the world made an illusion to the policy makers and public as it is unavoidable and adjustable. This creates an intuition to esquire into what makes the corruption market successful all over the world for many centuries and what Economic theory is operate behind it. In this paper an inquiry is made into how the corruption market works effectively without any intervention. It also explore the possibility of the Ronald Coase theory’s to control the corruption and justifies what intervention is needed to achieve optimal amount of corruption. It concludes that to achieve the optimal amount of corruption in the society all farms of corruptions has to be internalized by introducing a permit and tax for corruption.
B21|The Allais Paradox: What It Became, What It Really Was, What It Now Suggests to Us|"Whereas many others have scrutinized the Allais paradox from a theoretical angle, we study the paradox from an historical perspective and link our findings to a suggestion as to how decision theory could make use of it today. We emphasize that Allais proposed the paradox as a normative argument, concerned with ""the rational man"" and not the ""real man"", to use his words. Moreover, and more subtly, we argue that Allais had an unusual sense of the normative, being concerned not so much with the rationality of choices as with the rationality of the agent as a person. These two claims are buttressed by a detailed investigation – the first of its kind – of the 1952 Paris conference on risk, which set the context for the invention of the paradox, and a detailed reconstruction – also the first of its kind – of Allais's specific normative argument from his numerous but allusive writings. The paper contrasts these interpretations of what the paradox historically represented, with how it generally came to function within decision theory from the late 1970s onwards: that is, as an empirical refutation of the expected utility hypothesis, and more specifically of the condition of von Neumann-Morgenstern independence that underlies that hypothesis. While not denying that this use of the paradox was fruitful in many ways, we propose another use that turns out also to be compatible with an experimental perspective. Following Allais's hints on ""the experimental definition of rationality"", this new use consists in letting the experiment itself speak of the rationality or otherwise of the subjects. In the 1970s, a short sequence of papers inspired by Allais implemented original ways of eliciting the reasons guiding the subjects' choices, and claimed to be able to draw relevant normative consequences from this information. We end by reviewing this forgotten experimental avenue not simply historically, but with a view to recommending it for possible use by decision theorists today."
B21|Pouvoirs économiques privés et ordre concurrentiel : Une application à l’économie numérique|This paper analyses how competition law and economics tackles the issue of private economic power. Through a historical approach based on the evolutions of the economic thoughts and courts decisional practices, we stress a tension between recommendations based on a definition of the competitive order as a guarantee of access to market or of pluralism, and normative prescriptions based the consumer welfare maximisation, as the competition law enforcement unique criterion. We illustrate this debates with examples provided by digital markets and we open the discussion to the media sector.

La première partie étudie les critiques que Perroux adresse aux modèles marginalistes, néo-marginalistes, d’équilibre général et d’optimalité parétienne pour définir l’Echange Composite. La seconde partie apprécie les concepts qui caractérisent l’Echange Composite (effet de domination, luttes-concours, conflits-coopérations, coûts de l’homme, dons et transferts contraints). Nous étudions les enjeux de ces concepts par rapport aux formes de justice distributive que Perroux envisage pour définir l’Echange Composite par rapport aux théories de la justice de Walras et de Rawls.
B21|Does the Federal Constitutional Court Ruling Mean the German Financial Market is Efficient?|Following the landmark ruling by the German Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe on 7th February 2014 in which they endorsed the efficient market hypothesis, we present evidence on the efficiency of the German financial market. Introducing a new variance bound test based on the Component-GARCH model of volatility to analyse the long- and short-runs effects on the efficiency of the German financial market, we test the price volatility of four markets: DAX stock index, German sovereign debt index as provided by Barclays and Bloomberg, Euro gold index by the World Gold Council and Euro currency index by the Bank of England. Our use of the Component-GARCH-T model highlight two key contributions, the first being the analysis of the efficiency of the market in the long and short runs. However, a more important contribution is the result of our variance bound test highlight the relatively strong acceptance of the efficient market hypothesis in both the short and long runs in all the observed financial markets. It must be stated our research is of importance to researches in both applied finance and portfolio management. The influencing question of what moves specific markets is crucial to market participants seeking market alpha for their investments strategies and portfolio optimisations.
B21|The Sound of Silence: A Review Essay of Nancy MacLean's Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America|This essay reviews Nancy MacLean's Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America, which triggered a huge controversy that virally spread on the internet and in various journals. We will evaluate MacLean's almost biographical account of James Buchanan, which portrays the 1986 Nobel Prize laureate as the mastermind behind today's attacks, by the foot soldiers of the radical right, on American democracy. This essay develops three main points. One, MacLean's general narrative puts too much emphasis on Buchanan and largely neglects the many other important characters who contributed to the intellectual criticism of government intervention. Two, MacLean's account is marred by many misunderstandings about public choice theory, for instance about the role that simple majority rule plays in constitutional economics. Third, in the midst of abundant archival material, her historical narrative is, at best sketchy, and is replete with significantly flawed arguments, misplaced citations, and dubious conjectures. Overall, MacLean tends to overinterpret certain aspects in Buchanan's life and thought, while she overlooks others that are equally important in understanding his work and influence. In particular, we stress that Buchanan was, first and foremost, a scholar, not a political activist, who gave significant attention to ethical considerations in his analysis of markets.

B21|Pouvoirs économiques privés et ordre concurentiel. Une application à l'économie numérique|Il s’agit d’interroger la façon dont l’économie du droit de la concurrence se saisit de la question des pouvoirs économiques privés. Au travers d’une analyse historique, les prescriptions de la science économique et les pratiques décisionnelles américaine et européenne sont interrogées. Nous mettons en évidence une tension entre les recommandations qui découlent d’une défense de l’ordre concurrentiel conçu comme une garantie d’accès au marché et de pluralisme, et celles qui assignent à ce dernier le seul et unique objectif de la maximisation du bien-être du consommateur. Nous illustrons notre propos par une analyse de ces enjeux pour les marchés numériques et par une application au secteur des médias.
B21|Keynes on the Sequencing of Economic Policy: Recovery and Reform in 1933|On December 31 1933, The New York Times published an open letter from John Maynard Keynes to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In it Keynes encouraged FDR to expand public works through government borrowing. He also criticized FDR’s exchange rate policy, and argued that there was a need for lower long-term interest rates. But perhaps the most interesting feature of this letter is that Keynes made comments on the sequencing and speed of economic policies. He argued that “recovery” policies should precede “reform” measures. In this paper I analyze this particular aspect of the open letter, and I argue that for Keynes exchange rate stability was a key component of what he considered to be the appropriate order of policy. I also provide a comparison between Keynes’s views on sequencing and those developed in the 1980s and 1990s.
B21|Riflessioni intorno al tema della razionalità in economia|A partire dagli anni settanta, il concetto di razionalità proprio dell'economia subisce una revisione critica che porta alla nascita dell’economia comportamentale e sperimentale. Sulla base del riconoscimento dei limiti delle capacità computazionali e di varie anomalie rispetto agli assunti alla base della teoria della scelta razionale, prende piede una letteratura che adotta un maggiore realismo psicologico per fondare modelli teorici e predizioni empiriche. L'articolo riflette da un punto di vista metodologico su questi sviluppi, passando in rassegna i contributi sul tema di Herbert Simon, Daniel Khaneman e Amos Tversky, e Richard Thaler.
B21|Less Is More: Capital Theory And Almost Irregular-Uncontrollable Actual Economies|Capital theory and the price effects consequent upon changes in the distributive variables hold center stage when it comes to the internal consistency of both classical and neoclassical theories of value. This paper briefly reviews the literature and then focuses on the detected skew eigenvalue distribution of the vertically integrated technical coefficients matrices of actual economies. The findings prompt the use of the Schur triangularization theorem for the construction even of a single industry from the input–output structure of the entire economy. Such a hyper-basic industry, in combination with hyper-non-basic industries, embodies properties that may capture the behavior of the entire economic system. Thus, we can derive some meaningful results consistent with the available empirical evidence, which finally suggest that actual economies tend to respond as ‘irregular-uncontrollable’ systems.
B21|Daniel Ellsberg on J.M. Keynes and F.H. Knight:Risk, Ambiguity and Uncertainty|"This paper aims to focus on the life and work of Daniel Ellsberg, with an intensive discussion on its relation to J.M. Keynes and F.H. Knight, the two great pioneers of the economics of uncertainty. Ellsberg seems to be a man in paradox. When he was young, he was an outstanding researcher at Harvard University and the RAND Corporation; at the December Meting of the Econometric Society in 1960, he presented his remarkable paper in which he successfully demonstrated what we may now call Ellsberg's paradox against the traditional expected theory a la Daniel Bernoulli and von Neumann. Although it was published with the title ""Risk, ambiguity and decision"" in the November issue of the Quarterly Journal of Economics, it was not paid due attention for a long time. It was partly because he was so preoccupied in the 1960s and onward by letting the general public know the Pentagon papers that he could virtually have no time left to engage in purely academic activities. In the 21st century, however, the times have changed in favor of Ellsberg: we can see the dramatic return of interest in decision making under ambiguity. Chapter ‡U will deal with uncertainties that are not risks. A focal point of discussion will be the similarity and difference between Keynes and Knight. Kenneth Arrow's skepticism about Knight on uncertainty will also be paid due attention. Chapter ‡V, the main part of this paper, will turn to the concept of ambiguity that was first introduced by Ellsberg. The two-color problem and the three color problem will systematically be examined by help of numerical representations. Chapter ‡W will tell us many alternative ways to solve the so-called Ellsberg paradox. Presumably, the Keynesian approach by means of interval-valued probabilities will be shown to be very simple and highly effective. In our opinion, the most amazing Ellsberg paradox lies in the fact that an accomplished economist specialized in the aversion of risk and uncertainty dared to make a personal choice to risk everything such as degrading his social status and putting him in prison for a long period. Surely, the intellectual legacy of Ellsberg seems to be an intriguing research in paradox."
B21|Utility Matters: Edmond Malinvaud and growth theory in the 1950s and 1960s|The present-day standard textbook narrative on the history of growth theory usually takes Robert Solowâ€™s 1956 contribution as a key starting point, with extensions on the savings decision (done by David Cass and Tjalling Koopmans in 1965) being the next important development. However, such account is historically misleading because it organizes past developments based on theoretical concerns. Our goal is to tell a richer story about the developments of growth theory from the 1950s to the mid 1960s, in the activity analysis literature that started before Solowâ€™s model and never had him as a central reference. We stress the role played by Edmond Malinvaud, and take his travel from the French milieu of mathematical economics to the Cowles Commission in 1950-1951 and back to France as a guiding line. The rise of turnpike theory in the end of the 1950s generated a debate on the choice criteria of growth programs, opposing the productive efficiency typical of these models to the utilitarian approach supported by Malinvaud and Koopmans. The Vatican Conference of 1963, where Koopmans presented a first version of his 1965 model, was embedded in this debate. We argue that Malinvaudâ€™s (and Koopmansâ€™s) contributions were crucial to steer the activity analysis literature towards a utilitarian analysis of growth paths.

Nach einem historischen Überblick über das Konzept von Metaphern wird die Geschichte des dominanten Stranges in der ökonomischen Theorie als Geschichte einer Metapher von der Maschine skiziiert In der Geschichte der ökonomischen Theorie finden sich immer Metaphern, diese können als Formen eines bildhaften Sprachgebrauchs verstanden werden. Eine besondere Rolle hat im Hauptrang der Theorieentwicklung die Metapher von der Maschine gespielt. Nach einem historischen Überblick über das Konzept von Metaphern (Kap. 1) und der Kulturgeschichte der Metapher von der Maschine (Kap. 3) wird die Geschichte der ökonomischen Theorie als achtstufige Geschichte einer Metapher von der Maschine skizziert: Bei Quesnay als einer machine économique mit Bezug auf die Philosophie von Descartes, bei Smith eine natural order mit Bezug auf die Mechanik bei Newton, bei Malthus und Ricardo als Konzept von ökonomischen Gesetzen in Analogie zu Naturgesetzen in einer Neuinterpretation von Newton - ähnlich auch bei John Stuart Mill, bei Jevons und Walras als explizit ausformulierte ""mechanistische Nationalökonomie"", bei Autoren wie Gérald Debreu als Neuformulierung des Ansatzes von Walras als einer Informationsmechanik, sowie bei Friedrich August von Hayek als Konzept von ""dem Markt"" als einem Informationsnetzwerk in Analogie zu einem Telekommunikationssystem."
B21|Intrinsic motivation in economics: A history|If one asks about the introduction of intrinsic motivation into economic analysis, a common response is The Joyless Economy (Scitovsky, 1976) and Frey's articles published in the early 1990s. These works are furthermore seen as the direct sequel to the contributions in psychology which sought to uncover the sources of motivation long before the economists started to think seriously about their economic implications. By adopting a historical perspective, I show that Scitovsky and Frey's works were rather the result of two specific episodes in economics: the revived interest in actual needs and desires for the first and the expansionist ambitions of economists for the second. The behaviors they considered and the interpretations they respectively proposed for intrinsic motivation illustrate the influence of these two episodes. As such, this article proposes a new perspective on the relationship between economics and psychology.
B21|Bayesian Game Theorists and Non-Bayesian Players|Bayesian game theorists claim to represent players as Bayes rational agents, maximising their expected utility given their beliefs about the choices of other players. I argue that this narrative is inconsistent with the formal structure of Bayesian game theory. This is because (i) the assumption of common belief in rationality is equivalent to equilibrium play, as in classical game theory, and (ii) the players' prior beliefs are a mere mathematical artefact and not actual beliefs held by the players. Bayesian game theory is thus a Bayesian representation of the choice of players who are committed to play equilibrium strategy profiles.
B21|Disequilibrium as the origin, originality, and challenges of Clower's microfoundations of monetary theory| Robert W. Clower's article “A Reconsideration of the Microfoundations of Monetary Theory” (1967) deeply influenced the course of modern monetary economics. On the one hand, it questioned Don Patinkin's (1956) project to integrate monetary and Walrasian value theory. On the other hand, it was the fountainhead of the cash-in-advance models à la Robert J. Lucas (1980), one of the most widely used approaches to monetary theory since the 1980s. Despite this influence, Clower's project to integrate monetary and value theory remains an enigma. My paper intends to resolve it. This is a difficult task since Clower never completed the monetary theory outlined in his 1967 article. To overcome this difficulty, I characterise the intellectual context from which Clower's contribution emerged and have recourse to a reconstruction of his project. This reconstruction is based on the analysis of published and unpublished materials, written by Clower before and after the 1967 article. It is argued that Clower sought to elaborate a disequilibrium monetary theory whilst retaining the two pillars of Patinkin's integration, i.e., the introduction of money into utility functions and the real-balance effect. I trace the origins, account for the originality, and discuss the challenges of this project.
B21|Under Risk, Over Time, Regarding Other People: Language and Rationality Within Three Dimensions<BR>[Face au risque, dans le temps, par rapport aux autres : langage et rationalité dans trois dimensions]|This paper conducts a systematic comparison of behavioral economics's challenges to the standard accounts of economic behaviors within three dimensions: under risk, over time and regarding other people. A new perspective on two underlying methodological issues, i.e., interdisciplinarity and the positive/normative distinction, is proposed by following the entanglement thesis of Hilary Putnam, Vivian Walsh and Amartya Sen. This thesis holds that facts, values and conventions have interdependent meanings in science which can be understood by scrutinizing formal and ordinary language uses. The goal is to provide a broad and self-contained picture of how behavioral economics is changing the mainstream of economics.

B21|The London Monetary and Economic Conference of 1933 and the End of The Great Depression: A “Change of Regime” Analysis|In this paper I analyze the London Monetary and Economic Conference of 1933, an almost forgotten episode in U.S. monetary history. I study how the Conference shaped dollar policy during the second half of 1933 and early 1934. I use daily data to investigate the way in which the Conference and related policies associated to the gold standard affected commodity prices, bond prices, and the stock market. My results show that the Conference itself did not impact commodity prices or the stock market. However, it had a small effect on bond prices. I do find that the events associated with the abandonment of the gold standard impacted prices in a significant way, even before the actual monetary and currency channels were at work. These results are consistent with the “change in regime” hypothesis of Sargent (1983).
B21|The Revolution of Information Economics: The Past and the Future|The economics of information has constituted a revolution in economics, providing explanations of phenomena that previously had been unexplained and upsetting longstanding presumptions, including that of market efficiency, with profound implications for economic policy. Information failures are associated with numerous other market failures, including incomplete risk markets, imperfect capital markets, and imperfections in competition, enhancing opportunities for rent seeking and exploitation. This paper puts into perspective nearly a half century of research, including recent advances in understanding the implications of imperfect information for financial market regulation, macro-stability, inequality, and public and corporate governance; and in recognizing the endogeneity of information imperfections. It explores the consequences of recent advances in technology and the policy challenges and opportunities they present for competition policy and policies regarding privacy and transparency. The paper notes the role that information economics played in stimulating other advances in economics, including contract theory and behavioral economics. It reinvigorated institutional economics, showing how institutions mattered, in some cases explaining institutional features that could not be well-understood in the conventional paradigm, and in others showing how institutional responses to market failures might or might not be welfare enhancing. The paper argues that the new paradigm provides a markedly different, and better, lens for looking at the economy than the older perfect markets competitive paradigm.
B21|Neoclassical theories of stationary relative prices and the supply of capital|In the traditional versions of the neoclassical theory of value and distribution, the stock of existing capital—understood as either an amount of value or an endowment of capital goods—was taken as given, together with the available quantities of labour and natural resources. This characteristic of the early neoclassical theories is analysed by the comparison with the modern neo-Walrasian models of stationary equilibrium, in which the stock of capital is not considered among the data. We show that the attempt to put capital on the same footing as labour and land—i.e. to present it as a factor of production—led the early neoclassical author to write the zero netaccumulation condition, which was required by the stationarity of relative prices, in the form of a market clearing condition between supply of and demand for capital. The rate of interest was then understood as the price to determine by this market. However, as is well known, the conception of capital as a factor of production—and of the rate of interest as the price for its use—did not work and involved several problems, some of which are discussed in this paper.

This reconstruction is based on the analysis of published and unpublished materials, written by Clower before and after the 1967 article. It is argued that Clower (1967) sought to elaborate a disequilibrium monetary theory whilst retaining the two pillars of Patinkin’s integration, i.e., the introduction of money into utility functions and the real-balance effect. I trace the origins, account for the originality, and discuss the challenges of this project.

Throughout regarding calibrations, one might see that, despite the existence of some deviations from trend and some Gini 1 and Gini 2 coefficients’ differences, (a) there exists an improvement in the distribution of income until 2011, except for the year 2009 when the global crisis was experienced, but an average deterioration in the distribution for 2011-2015 period is experienced, (b) the geographical regions of the Turkish economy reveal different outcomes. For the period 2006-2015, it is observed that in the regions of Istanbul, West Marmara, Central Anatolia and North East Anatolia, the Lorenz curve has moved away from full equilibrium line, but in the regions of Aegean, Eastern Marmara and Eastern Black Sea, on the average, a convergence towards the equilibrium from the Lorenz curve has appeared. In other three regions, the Gini coefficients improve on average in Western Anatolia, Mediterranean and Western Black Sea regions. The Gini coefficients are increasing in the period 2006-2011 in the Middle East Anatolia and falling in 2015. In the South East Anatolia Region, there is no progress in the period 2006-2011, but, there happens to be a recovery in income distribution in 2015.

B21|The Passage of Time, Capital, and Investment in Traditional and in Recent Neoclassical Value Theory|With the shift from traditional analyses where capital is a single value factor of variable ‘form’ to the neo-Walrasian versions, general equilibrium theory has encountered new problems pointed out by P. Garegnani (1976, 1990): impermanence problem, price-change problem, substitutability problem radically question the right to consider neo-Walrasian equilibria as approximating the actual path of real economies. The paper briefly summarizes these problems and then concentrates on a fourth problem, the savings-investment problem, arguing that neo-Walrasian general equilibrium models assume that investment is adjusted to full-employment savings but cannot justify this assumption. The treatment of investment in intertemporal general equilibrium is subjected to a new criticism: it is shown that the tâtonnement assumes Says’ Law all along the adjustments, and determines investment in a way that would crumble if it were not assumed that consumers determine their demands for consumption goods on the basis of an assumption of full employment incomes, which is not justified outside equilibrium, and was not assumed in traditional analyses. This reinforces the absence of reasons to view neo-Walrasian equilibrium paths as sufficiently approaching actual paths. It is concluded that behind the reference to intertemporal equilibrium as the microfoundation of macro analyses there is a continuing faith in traditional neoclassical time-consuming adjustment mechanisms, based on the old and untenable conception of capital that the shift to neo-Walrasian equilibria intended to do without.
B21|"From the ""planning euphoria"" to the ""bitter economic truth"": The transmission of economic ideas into German labour market policies in the 1960s and 2000s"|This paper compares the interconnections between dominant economic thought and processes of policy-making in the area of labour market reforms in Germany in the late 1960s and the early 2000s. The transition in labour market policies in this period could be described as a change from an active to an activating approach. At the level of economic discourse these policy changes correspond to a paradigm shift from Keynesian to neoclassical/neoliberal economic thought. We investigated these changes by focussing on two distinct reforms of labour market policies and carried out a critical discourse analysis of the relevant public and academic discourse of economists. We find that the paradigm shift in economic thought was accompanied by a shift in economists' discourses on labour market policy issues.

B21|Retrospectives: How Economists Came to Accept Expected Utility Theory: The Case of Samuelson and Savage|Expected utility theory dominated the economic analysis of individual decision-making under risk from the early 1950s to the 1990. Among the early supporters of the expected utility hypothesis in the von Neumann–Morgenstern version were Milton Friedman and Leonard Jimmie Savage, both based at the University of Chicago, and Jacob Marschak, a leading member of the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics. Paul Samuelson of MIT was initially a severe critic of expected utility theory. Between mid-April and early May 1950, Samuelson composed three papers in which he attacked von Neumann and Morgenstern's axiomatic system. By 1952, however, Samuelson had somewhat unexpectedly become a resolute supporter of the expected utility hypothesis. Why did Samuelson change his mind? Based on the correspondence between Samuelson, Savage, Marschak, and Friedman, this article reconstructs the joint intellectual journey that led Samuelson to accept expected utility theory and Savage to revise his motivations for supporting it.
B21|Learning Capitalism the Hard Way--Evidence from German Reunification|We develop a model of firm learning in volatile markets with noisy signals and test its predictions using historical data from the Ifo Institute's Business Climate Survey. We find that firms' forecasts improve as they age. We also exploit German Reunification as a natural experiment where firms in the East are treated with ignorance about the distribution of market states. As theoretically predicted, Eastern firms make larger forecast errors than Western ones, but this gap gradually closes over the decade following Reunification. The slow convergence rate stems from differences in expectations rather than market conditions. We also find evidence for the model's predictions that improvements from learning are faster where market signals are noisier.
B21|Paul Anthony Samuelson and his work (on the hundredth anniversary of his birth)|Aim: The purpose of this article is an attempt to systematise and evaluate the achievements of the American Nobel laureate in economic sciences and co-founder of ‘neoclassical synthesis’ — P.A. Samuelson. Motivation: This economist greatly developed the methodology and theory of economics. Preferring the mathematical method in scientific inquiry and introducing new graphic solutions, he contributed to the mathematisation of economics. He enriched the theory of consumption by revealed preferences, devised the 45° line to determine the Keynesian short-term equilibrium in the goods market, as well as the consumer demand, investment demand, and savings function curves, and he also defined collective goods. He completed the theory of division with the modified Lorenz curve, presented the problem of the allocation of scarce resources by the curve of production possibilities, and generalised — together with R.M. Solow — the Phillips curve. In addition, he created a model of the interdependence of the multiplier and accelerator, and developed the theory of foreign trade by the ‘Stolper-Samuelson effect’ and the statement of the impact of prices of production factors on the allocation of resources. Results: Caring for affordability of the exposition of basic economic knowledge contained in his textbook Economics, he made a revolution in the teaching of economics. Owing to these achievements, P.A. Samuelson earned his inclusion in the circle of the greatest economists of the twentieth century.
B21|The Integration Of Search In Macroeconomics: Two Alternative Paths|Our paper analyzes and compares two attempts at integrating unemployment in macroeconomics. The first, due to Diamond, consists in a search model exhibiting multiple equilibria and wherein cycles may be produced. The second is due to Andolfatto and Merz who, more or less simultaneously, constructed models enabling the integration of the matching function into RBC modeling. In the first sections, we present the methodology upon which our paper is based – Leijonhufvud’s decision-tree insight – and briefly describe these three economists’ motivations and the context in which they were working. We continue with recounting the birth and further development of the search paradigm upon which Diamond’s, Andolfatto’s and Merz’s attempts were based. These preliminaries settled we address the heart of the paper, the critical analysis of their respective contributions. Our interest lies specifically in how they made their way in the development of the field. We explain why Diamond’s model, which ambitioned to rival Lucas’s explanation of business fluctuations, did not live up to its author’s expectations. Andolfatto and Merz’s project was less ambitious yet their model became an established component of the RBC program – but at the price of abandoning several constitutive traits of the search approach.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B21|The Integration of Search in Macroeconomics: Interviews with David Andolfatto, Peter Diamond and Monika Merz|Peter Diamond, Monika Merz, and David Andolfatto must all three be credited for having integrated a search perspective in macroeconomic theory. In a previous paper, “The Integration of Search in Macroeconomics: Two Alternative Paths”, we set ourselves the task of analyzing and comparing their respective contributions. To support our study, we conducted interviews with them. The present paper is an edited transcript of these three interviews.
B21|Choice-based cardinal utility: a tribute to Patrick Suppes| We reexamine some of the classic problems connected with the use of cardinal utility functions in decision theory, and discuss Patrick Suppes’ contributions to this field in light of a reinterpretation we propose for these problems. We analytically decompose the doctrine of ordinalism, which only accepts ordinal utility functions, and distinguish between several doctrines of cardinalism, depending on what components of ordinalism they specifically reject. We identify Suppes’ doctrine with the major deviation from ordinalism that conceives of utility functions as representing preference differences, while being nonetheless empirically related to choices. We highlight the originality, promises and limits of this choice-based cardinalism.

B21|All Frames Created Equal are Not Identical: On the Structure of Kahneman and Tversky's Framing Effects|This paper revisits Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's work on 'framing'. It shows how various conventions from economic theory allow the establishment of different equivalence relations between pairs of problems in framing experiments. Then, an exegesis of their comments on these experiments is conducted regarding the relation between their theoretical explanation through prospect theory and the positive/normative distinction in models of individual behaviors. Throughout, a methodological framework with a distinction between identity, equivalence and equality (borrowed to philosopher Craig Dilworth) is developed for a critical analysis of the relation between external frames (the empirical structure of a decision problem) and internal frames (the psychological representation of the decision problem by decision makers).
B21|A la recherche de la signification perdue du paradoxe d'Allais|"Dans ""Le paradoxe d'Allais. Comment lui rendre sa signification perdue?"" (Revue économique, 2014/5 - Vol. 64), Philippe Mongin propose une image contestable, parce que abusivement rassurante, de la rationalité des sujets participants aux expériences de MacCrimmon et Larsson [1979]. Nous montrons cela en restituant les données des auteurs pour l'effet de conséquence commune et l'effet de rapport commun (deux paradoxes d'Allais), que Mongin assimile bien qu'il distingue ces deux effets. Deux tendances dans les données nous conduisent à rejoindre Mongin pour conclure que ces expériences sont une source d'inspiration fructueuse pour la théorie de la décision, ce que nous illustrons brièvement par le rôle qu'elles ont joué dans l'apparition de l'utilité espérée dépendante du rang et dans le tournant interindividuel en psychologie cognitive de la décision."
B21|Under Uncertainty, Over Time and Regarding Other People: Rationality in 3D|This paper scrutinizes behavioral economics' challenges to the standard accounts of economic behaviors within and across three dimensions: under uncertainty, over time and regarding other people. ‘Within' dimensions means that decision problems are of the form, e.g., ‘a consequence for sure vs. a bigger consequence with uncertainty' or ‘a consequence now vs. a bigger consequence later', by contrast with decision problems that cut ‘across' dimensions as in, e.g., ‘a consequence for sure but later vs. another consequence now but with uncertainty'. The proposed distinction between challenges within and across dimensions is more than conceptual, it also delimits a historical rupture between two periods that are nontrivial regarding the debates between behavioral and standard economics. The classical challenges posed by Kahneman, Tversky, Thaler and others focused on interactions within dimensions, posing problems to standard models. The more recent challenges from interactions across dimensions are posing problems to to both standard and behavioral economists' models. This paper proposes a systematic contrasts between the three dimensions, in both the challenges within and across the three dimensions, i.e., it proposes to ‘see rationality in 3D', in order to further our understanding of the contemporary theoretical, empirical and methodological stakes underlying these debates. Three methodological issues are discussed throughout: one that is not discussed elsewhere in the reflexive literature, namely the role of language in economic rationality, which we try to connect with the two classical ones around behavioral economics, namely, the issue of interdisciplinary between economics and psychology and the positive/normative issue within models of individual behaviors. With respect to the latter, we suggest that there is a slow historical shift from a primacy of risk over time over social preferences in the making of economists' value judgments of rationality and irrationality, to a competing primacy of time over risk over social preferences.
B21|Replication in Labor Economics: Evidence from Data, and What It Suggests|Examining the most heavily cited publications in labor economics from the early 1990s, I show that few of over 3,000 articles, citing them directly, replicates them. They are replicated more frequently using data from other time periods and economies, so that the validity of their central ideas has typically been verified. This pattern of scholarship suggests, beyond the currently required depositing of data and code upon publication, that there is little need for formal mechanisms for replication. The market for scholarship already produces replications of non-laboratory applied research.
B21|The transformations of utility theory: a behavioral perspective|Abstract The aim of this paper is threefold. First, it reappraises the major transformations which the utilitarian approach to human behavior has undergone in economics in search for a representation by utility functions and later by preference orders. Second, in the light of today’s behavioral and human sciences, an attempt is made to restore some elements of early utilitarianism that were abandoned in these transformations. Third, in line with the interest of the early utilitarians in both explaining behavior and elaborating on its moral assessment, the present paper also discusses some normative implications of the suggested restoration of utilitarian theory.
B21|Solving a Longstanding Conundrum: The Uneasy Coexistence of Alternative Equilibrium Conceptions in Walras’s Theoretical System|The evolution of Walras’s theoretical ideas over the last thirty years of the 19th century is highly tormented: from the early outline of Walras’s theoretical system, as sketched in his surviving Geneva lecture notes (1871-72), through the various editions of the Éléments (1st: 1874-77; 2nd: 1889; 3rd: 1896; 4th: 1900), Walras’s exposition of General Equilibrium Theory undergoes a process of ceaseless revisions, which often do not blend with each other, occasionally giving rise to self- contradictory statements. This paper purports to show that such a tortured development can ultimately be traced to the uneasy coexistence in Walras’s approach of two different conceptions of economic equilibrium: a more traditional one, where an equilibrium of the economy is viewed as the outcome of a balancing of forces, themselves unrelated or only barely connected with individual optimizing behavior; and a more innovative conception, resting on the then revolutionary idea that an equilibrium ought to be viewed as a consistent array of optimally chosen individual plans of action. Starting from the first conception, which pre-dates Walras’s discovery of the link between individual demand and utility maximization (fall 1872), Walras strives to progressively enhance the role played by the second, without ever fully succeeding in his attempt. This is the root cause of most of the inconsistencies marring Walras’s Éléments, as well as indirectly affecting the subsequent developments of General Equilibrium Theory.
B21|On the definition of externality as a missing market|Despite its increasing role in economic theory, the concept of externality seems to elude any attempt at rigorous and consensual definition. While problems of definition have emerged with the concept itself in the 1950s, the paper focuses on the definition of externality within the general equilibrium theory. In the Arrow-Debreu framevork, externality is a kind of “missing market” (Arrow 1969) – an unpriced effect that upsets the assumption of the complete system of markets – and its formalization is achieved by introducing a direct interdependence between utility or production functions. The paper shows that this Arrovian definition allows some ambiguities to persist. As witnessed by some authors' positions in the 1970s (Mishan 1971, Baumol and Oates 1975, Heller and Starrett 1976, Laffont 1988), it does not highlight two features associated with the traditional meaning of externalities: whether or not it is an exogenous effect and an unintended effect. This raises, although differently, the issue of the dilution of externality within the larger notion of individual interdependences. Beyond the conceptual importance of clarifying the definition of externality, this issue has also a strong normative content: giving a strict definition of externality amounts, implicitly, to drawing the frontier of legitimate internalisation and economic policy
B21|Theory and Measurement: Emergence, Consolidation and Erosion of a Consensus|We identify three separate stages in the post-World War II history of applied microeconomic research: A generally non-mathematical period; a period of consensus (from the 1960s through the early 1990s) characterized by the use of mathematical models, optimization and equilibrium to generate and test hypotheses about economic behavior; and (from the late 1990s) a partial abandonment of economic theory in applied work in the “experimentalist paradigm.” We document the changes implied by the changing paradigms in the profession by coding the content of all applied micro articles published in the “Top 5 journals” in 1951-55, 1974-75 and 2007-08. We also show that, despite the partial abandonment of theory by applied microeconomists, the labor market for economists still pays a wage premium to theorists.
B21|Frederic S. Lee and His Fight for the Future of Heterodox Economics|Frederic S. Lee (1949-2014) was a dedicated captain of the heterodox economics movement over the past thirty years. In the course of his unfaltering fight for the future of heterodox economics, Lee contributed to both the development of heterodox microeconomic theory and the establishment of a global community of heterodox economists. This short tribute delineates Lee’s unique and important contribution that should be remembered and renewed in order to reproduce heterodox economics.
B21|Price expectations in neo-Walrasian equilibrium models: an overview|Since the late 1960s, the efforts of general equilibrium theorists have been directed towards overcoming the evident limitation of the Arrow-Debreu model, i.e. the assumption that the transactions associated with the future activities of agents are all regulated at the initial date on a complete system of forward markets. Research has thus focused on ‘sequential economies’, in which spot markets are active in each period, and has developed along two paths, both inspired by Hicks’s Value and Capital and stressing the dependence of agents’ choices on their expectations of future prices. The first is temporary equilibrium theory, in which expectations are assumed to be subjective. The second postulates that all agents exactly predict the future prices (sequential economies with perfect foresight). This paper examines the analytical problems that the inclusion of expectations among the determinants of equilibrium originates within each approach. In the light of the studies of the 1970s and 1980s, it first illustrates the difficulties that arise in temporary equilibrium theory due to the subjective nature of individual forecasts. Then it moves on to examine sequential economies with perfect foresight. After illustrating the equilibrium notion on which the analysis of those economies relies, i.e. the ‘equilibrium of plans, prices and price expectations’ introduced by Radner (1972), it indicates, on the basis of recent contributions, that for plausible configurations of the economy the perfect foresight associated with Radner equilibria proves not only unrealistic but also theoretically dubious.
B21|A “Statute of the Firm” as an antitrust law during the Seventies. Guido Carli’s chairmanship of the Italian Industrial Association (Confindustria)|This paper aims to highlight a newsworthy initiative built up by the Italian Industrial Association which tried to give the Italian economy a forerunner “competition law”; however, in the Seventies Italy proved incapable of tying itself with rules of conduct, which were substituted, empowering an “external constraint”. We will firstly provide an economic and historical-institutional framework of that period; we will then describe the making and the contents of the “Statute of the Firm”, together with a critical analysis on it; finally, we will report some critics around the debate on this proposal, and why the Statute was rejected by entrepreneurs themselves.
B21|A Heterodox Theory of the Business Enterprise|The business enterprise directs and controls the social provisioning process. Enterprise decisions on price, investment, output and employment, in particular, directly affect the material basis of society as well as the material standard of living of working class households. The understanding the structure of and changes in the capitalist capitalists system thus requires a theory of the business enterprise that offers relevant and convincing explanations of business decisions and actions embedded in the wider social context. Such a theory must replace the mainstream-neoclassical theory of the firm, which is not only theoretically incoherent but also practically irrelevant since it confines itself to the hypothetical market structure and individual optimizing behavior. With this rationale this chapter attempts to build a heterodox theory of the business enterprises incorporating contributions made by various theoretical traditions in heterodox economics.
B21|Capital theory: Less is more|Capital theory and the associated with it price effects resulting from changes in the distributive variables hold centre stage when it comes to the internal consistency of both classical and neoclassical theories of value. The article briefly reviews the literature and then focuses on the detected skew eigenvalue distribution of the vertically integrated technical coefficients matrices of actual economies. The findings prompt the use of the Schur triangularization theorem for the construction even of a single industry from the input-output structure of the entire economy. Such a hyper-basic industry, in combination with hyper-non-basic industries, embodies properties that may capture the behaviour of the entire economic system. Thus, we can derive some meaningful results consistent with the available empirical evidence.
B21|Může být přirozená úroková míra nulová? Neoklasický přístup<BR>[Can the Natural Rate of Interest Be Zero? A Neoclassical Approach]|Very low real rates of interest observed in modern economies might be caused by the fact that the natural rate of interest declined to a zero level. This article shows that a zero or a negative natural interest can be explained by the Böhm-Bawerkian and neoclassical theory. Firstly, two senses of time preference are introduced in a discounted utility model, and key determinants of the zero interest rate on the side of time preference are discussed in detail. Secondly, a simple general equilibrium model with fixed intertemporal endowment is presented. Within this model, a decreasing shape of the income stream is identified as a major source of zero interest along with a low intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption. Even in the world of zero or negative natural interest, it might be optimal to be a lender. The last section focuses on the role of marginal productivity of capital in the model, stressing the role of this phenomenon on one side and time preference on the other in lowering the natural rate of interest to a zero level.
B21|The Environmental Turn In Natural Resource Economics: John Krutilla And “Conservation Reconsidered”|Environmentalism in the United States historically has been divided into its utilitarian and preservationist impulses, represented by Gifford Pinchot and John Muir, respectively. Pinchot advocated conservation of natural resources to be used for human purposes; Muir advocated protection from humans, for nature’s own sake. In the first half of the twentieth century, natural resource economics was firmly on Pinchot’s side of that schism. That position began to change as the postwar environmental movement gained momentum. In particular, John Krutilla, an economist at Resources for the Future, pushed economics to the point where it could embrace Muir’s vision as well as Pinchot’s. Krutilla argued that if humans preferred a preserved state to a developed one, then such preferences were every bit as “economic”—either way, opportunity costs exist and economic choices must be made.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B21|Nonsubstitution Theorem, Leontief Model, Netputs: Some Clarifications|The nonsubstitution theorem concerns long-period technical choice and relative prices, and was so understood in its first (1951) formulations, but the modern advanced micro textbooks that present it do not make this clear, rendering the theorem impossible to understand for students. These modern presentations derive from a reinterpretation of the Leontief model as a ‘timeless’ economy in Walrasian equilibrium, capable of positive pro-duction in spite of zero initial endowments of all inputs except labour: an unacceptable interpretation, made pos-sible by a use of netputs, to describe the economy’s production possibilities, that is illegitimate in this case even from a strictly neoclassical perspective. The notion of a ‘timeless’ economy disappears from the textbook presen-tations of the Leontief model and of the nonsubstitution theorem, but the result is that the nature of the model and of the prices to which the theorem refers is not clarified, inevitably leaving students utterly confused. This note remembers the true nonsubstitution theorem, points out that it had been correctly enunciated by Samuelson (1961), and suggests that the current inability to present it in a correct way is due to the absence of the notion of long-period prices from the theoretical horizon of contemporary neoclassical value theory. The paper opens with clarifications on the meaning of the Leontief model which prepare the ground for the discussion of the problem with netputs.

B21|The remittance behaviour of Kenyan sibling migrants|Abstract This paper examines the remittance behaviour of multiple-sibling migrants and the motivations of Kenyan siblings in sending remittances to their household of origin. The presence of other siblings is found to decrease the probability of remitting but has no effect on the amount sent. The volume of remittances sent by other siblings is also found to have no statistically significant effect on the amount sent by a sibling. Thus, the evidence obtained offers some mild, though not unambiguous, support for sibling remittances being driven by altruistic as well as independent motives. JEL Classification: B21, D19, J69
B21|Chicago Economics in the Making, 1926-1940. A Further Look at US Interwar Pluralism|The aim of this paper is to unfold a rich body of archival material that can shed new light on the nature and evolution of interwar Chicago economics. Specifically, this paper is based on a scrutiny of the PhD qualifying exams on Economic Theory at Chicago from 1926 to 1940. The qualifying tests (supplemented by the courses’ programs) show the existence of two important turning points in the shaping of Chicago economic training. The first one is in 1927, when John M. Clark, the undisputed leader of the Chicago Department of Economics during the heyday of institutionalism, moved to Columbia, leaving open ground to the restructuring of the courses according to a different and more analytical approach already represented in the Department by Viner and, in a narrower field, by Paul Douglas. The arrival at Chicago of figures such as Knight, Schultz and Simons definitely shifted the balance toward neoclassical theory. A second turning point occurred in 1933 when the qualifying test in Economic Theory was divided into two major fields: price and distribution theory on the one side; money and business cycle on the other. This innovation reveals the importance acquired by monetary theory in economic training at a time that is commonly associated with the nurturing of what was later named as the “Chicago monetary tradition.”
B21|"""Gefangene der Bilder in unseren Köpfen"": Die Macht abstrakten ökonomischen Denkens"|Wie selbstverständlich geht die heutige ökonomische Standardlehre davon aus, dass sie Studierenden eine feste und unveränderliche Sicht auf die Welt vermitteln kann. Doch woher kommt diese Annahme? Walter Lippmann, einer der Begründer des Neoliberalismus, gibt hierauf einen ersten Hinweis: Wirtschaftswissenschaft soll in der Lage sein, Bilder in Köpfen von Menschen zu verankern, die allem Denken und Handeln unbewusst zugrunde liegen, selbst aber nicht schöpferisch veränderbar sind. Anhand dreier Stationen - ausgesuchten Textpassagen von Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill und Léon Walras - zeigt der Beitrag, wie die Wirtschaftswissenschaft hierfür das Denken umformen musste: hin zu einem rein erfahrungsunabhängigen Denken, das seine Inspiration nicht aus der Begegnung mit der Wirklichkeit, sondern allein aus der reinen Mathematik und Mechanik übernimmt. Zugleich zeigt die philosophische Auseinandersetzung mit der Geschichte dieser Wissenschaft, dass diese Umformung selbst weder zwangsläufig noch alternativlos ist. Auch in der Ökonomie lässt sich die schöpferische Kraft des Denkens zurückgewinnen.
B21|Retrospectives: The Marginal Cost Controversy|"From 1938 to 1950, there was a spirited debate about whether decreasing-average-cost industries should set prices at marginal cost, with attendant subsidies if necessary. In 1938, Harold Hotelling published a forceful and far-reaching proposal for marginal cost pricing entitled ""The General Welfare in Relation to Problems of Taxation and of Railway and Utility Rates."" After several years and many pages of discussion, Ronald Coase gave a name and a clear formulation to the debate in his 1946 article ""The Marginal Cost Controversy."" We will tell much of the story of this controversy by comparing the frameworks of Hotelling and Coase, while also bringing in other contributors and offering some thoughts about contemporary relevance. The arguments marshaled by Coase (and his contemporaries) not only succeeded in this particular debate, as we shall see, but more generally served as part of the foundation for various fields of modern economics, particularly institutional, regulatory, and public choice economics as well as law and economics. Yet the underlying issues are quite difficult to resolve, and the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments for marginal cost pricing can turn on specific elements of the industry."

B21|The Origin Of The Sylos Postulate: Modigliani’S And Sylos Labini’S Contributions To Oligopoly Theory|Paolo Sylos Labini's Oligopoly Theory and Technical Progress (1957) is considered one of the major contributions to entry-prevention models, especially after Franco Modigliani's famous formalization. Nonetheless, Modigliani neglected Labini's major aim when reviewing his work (JPE, 1958), particularly his demonstration of the dynamic relation between industrial concentration and economic development. Modigliani addressed only Sylos' microeconomic analysis and the determination of the long-run equilibrium price and output, concentrating on the role played by firms' anticipations. By doing so he shifted attention from Sylos' objective analysis to a subjective approach to oligopoly problem. This paper discusses Sylos' and Modigliani's differing approaches, derives the origin of the Sylos postulate and sets Modigliani's interpretation of Sylos' oligopoly theory in the context of his 1950s research into firms' behaviour under uncertainty.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

On the first trip he met with General Augusto Pinochet, who had led a coup that overthrew Salvador Allende in 1973. During his 1981 visit, Hayek gave interviews that were published in the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio and in which he discussed authoritarian regimes and the problem of unlimited democracy. After each trip, he complained that the western press had painted an unfair picture of the economic situation under the Pinochet regime. Drawing on archival material, interviews, and past research, we provide a full account of this controversial episode in Hayek’s life.
B21|Could innovative teams provide the necessary flexibility to compete in the current context?| [EN] In the modern era firms should look for a sustainable and profitable business model. They operate in highly volatile and competitive markets. Innovation is a key element that allows firms to survive in these complex environments. Accordingly, some companies are developing human resource models that align to the actual competitive context. For instance, they establish democratic systems, flexible work practices, they focus on responsibility and initiative and increase the self-control of team members. In this framework, firms tend to use resources such as creativity, capacity for innovation or development of human talent. Therefore, innovative teams are able to adapt and react to turbulent, complex and dynamic environments, which allow them to handle in a more efficient way several subtasks. This fact gives rise to a higher effectiveness in the activities of firms. This paper analyze the characteristics and performance of multifunctional teams, virtual teams, open-innovation teams and self-managing teams. It also study the case of Semco, a company that is characterized by its innovative practices in human resources management and focus on responsibility and initiative and increase the self-control of team members.
B21|La politique de concurrence comme levier de la politique industrielle dans la France de l'après-guerre|La création en 1953 du Comité Technique des Ententes, lointain prédécesseur de notre actuelle Autorité de la Concurrence, inscrit la politique de concurrence française dans un rapport de contemporanéité avec la loi sur la concurrence allemande et le Traité de Rome. Cependant, comme la dénomination même du Comité l’indique, le premier domaine d’intervention résidait en la répression des comportements collusifs horizontaux, il n’était pas alors question des abus de position dominante individuelle. Qui plusest, les pratiques collusives qui étaient particulièrement visées se nouaient autour de marchés publics liés aux plans de reconstruction, équipement et modernisation. Ainsi, si cette activation des règles de concurrence contrastait avec les traditions dirigistes héritées des expériences des économies de guerre ou l’influence des approches planistes qui étaient favorables aux ententes entre firmes au nom de l’efficience productive, elle ne saurait pour autant participer d’une logique comparable à celle alors à l’œuvre en Allemagne de l’Ouest sous l’influence des ordo-libéraux. Cette lutte contre les cartels peut s’expliquer en regard d’une conception d’une politique industrielle fondée sur une étroite coopération entre les administrations et les grandes entreprises françaises considérées comme des champions nationaux. L’activation du levier concurrentiel a pu participer d’une politique industrielle de nature verticale passant par l’élimination des pratiques collusives entre firmes
B21|Revisiting Methodological Individualism in Game Theory: The Contributions of Schelling and Bacharach|"The purpose of this contribution is to illustrate how both Schelling and Bacharach’s methodologies can help scholars bring a new approach to behavioral game theory in which the nature of usual standard methodological individualism is insufficiently questioned. I aim to show that both Schelling and Bacharach question the nature of interactive rationality. They provide original insight concerning (i) the conditions of possibility of the existence of determinate solutions and (ii) the resolution process of games. Furthermore, their questioning of the methodological implications of the well-known trio of standard game theory (common knowledge, the transparency of reasons and the reduction of ""strategic uncertainty"" to ""physical uncertainty"") offers some ideas on how to build an alternative theory of games. As forerunners, they open an ongoing research program which can still be a fruitful source of methodological innovation regarding interactive rationality and its collective determinants."
B21|The Role of Psychology in Austrian Economics and Game Theory: Subjectivity and Coordination|In this contribution we relate the respective works of two important economists, Friedrich von Hayek and Michael Bacharach, namely one of the main intellectual leaders of the Austrian Schools and one of the most original game theorists. Hayek and Bacharach are two authors - few in number – who do not conceive that economic analysis could be built without the help of psychology. They both considered that subjective perceptions of the real world provide the first stage of decision processes and that, within this stage, psychological factors played a fundamental role. Therefore, they both proposed how perceptions, economic rationality and social coordination could be combined. However economists who really accept to take psychology into account often face new difficulties. The incorporation of subjectivity in economic behaviour can make much more complex the analysis of economic and social coordination. To overtake these new difficulties we will see that both Hayek and Bacharach integrate a specific approach to human cognition and resort to an evolutionary explanation of social coordination. This is the main message we deliver in this contribution.
B21|Is Publication in the Hands of Outstanding Scientists? A Study on the Determinants of Editorial Boards Membership in Economics|This paper aims at casting light on editorial boards of leading journals in economics. This topic has been largely neglected by economists and sociologists of science, although the crucial role played by editors of prestigious journals in steering the discipline. We start our analysis by mapping the content specialization and the level of oligopoly of the contributing institutions within each journal. Then, we assess the impact of editorial boards’ interlocking and turnover on similarity between journals. In the second half of the paper we investigate the determinants of editorial board membership in leading economic journals during the decade from 1994 to 2004. We observe that the scientist’s past productivity is a strong predictor of membership. Nevertheless, other determinants are at play. Among others, we found a significant positive effect of scientist’s social connections with the members of the discipline who are entitled to decide for the appointment as editor.
B21|L'apport de Pellegrino Rossi à la théorie de l'offre et de la demande : une tentative d'interprétation|Cet article réexamine l'apport de Pellegrino Rossi à la loi de l'offre et de la demande par rapport aux contributions de Say, Ricardo ou Smith. Il montre que Rossi développe une théorie de la valeur originale qui emprunte à la fois à la pensée classique anglaise et à la pensée continentale française et fonde sa conception de l'offre et de la demande. L'article met en évidence les mécanismes novateurs que Rossi retient pour expliquer la loi de l'offre et de la demande pour diverses formes de concurrence par rapport à ceux que Say ou Ricardo envisagent pour la seule libre concurrence. On montre que Rossi peut être considéré comme un précurseur du concept de prix de réservation développé par Jules Dupuit et de plusieurs formes de raisonnements à la marge qui l'amènent à proposer une analyse de la loi de l'offre et de la demande originale.
B21|Modeling Economic Growth: Domar on Moving Equilibrium|The paper investigates Evsey’s Domar’s introduction of the rate of growth as a variable in economics in the 1940s and 1950s . Domar investigated the nature of what he called the “moving equilibrium” of ec onomic processes with infinite duration. Reactions to Domar’ s approach at the time brought about methodological assertions on the distinction between models and theories. Domar’s model was an open one, in the sense that his growth equation allowed different closures. A main feature of the model was its relatively stable capital - output ratio, whi ch reflected the terms of the debate about A.H. Hansen’s stagnation thesis in the 1940s and the notion of limits to capital deepening. At the empirical level, Domar referred to some features of time series, such as the positive trend of output per capita. Differently from Harrod, t he real economy was supposed to be stable, although the model itself was not perfectly consistent with that. The estimation of the Residual (a term coined by Domar) by Solow and others led Domar to rethin k aspec ts of his original model
B21|The Empirical Economist's Toolkit: From Models to Methods|"While historians of economics have noted the transition toward empirical work in economics since the 1970s, less understood is the shift toward \quasi-experimental"" methods in applied microeconomics. Angrist and Pischke (2010) trumpet the wide application of these methods as a \credibility revolution"" in econometrics that has nally provided persuasive answers to a diverse set of questions. Particularly in uential in the applied areas of labor, education, public, and health economics, the methods shape the knowledge produced by economists and the expertise they possess. First documenting their growth bibliometrically, this paper aims to illuminate the origins, content, and contexts of quasi-experimental research designs, which seek natural experiments to justify causal inference. To highlight lines of continuity and discontinuity in the transition, the quasi-experimental program is situated in the historical context of the Cowles econometric framework and a case study from the economics of education is used to contrast the practical implementation of the approaches. Finally, signi cant historical contexts of the paradigm shift are explored, including the marketability of quasi-experimental methods and the 1980s crisis in econometrics."
B21|Implementation Rationality: The Nexus of Psychology and Economics at the RAND Logistics Systems Laboratory, 1956-1966|In October 1956, the RAND Corporation establis hed the Logistics Systems Laboratory (LSL) with the goal of using simulation to translate the broad findings of normative microeconomics into detailed, implementable pr ocedures for US Air Force oper ations. The laboratory was housed in the training simulation facilities that had been recently vacated by psychologists working at the RAND Systems Research Laboratory. Economists at the LSL, interwove their marginal cost- benefit analysis with the psychologists’ focus on process, adaptation, a nd group behavior. Over the course of a decade, economists and psycholog ists at the RAND Logistics Systems Laboratory conducted game simulations structured by the f our separate laboratory problems. Economists went from using simulation to demonstrate the superiority of optimal policies derived from deductive economics to using the ex periment as an inductive tool. One of the concerns in this historical case study is with how economics leveraged psychology to grow a regulatory system when individual units pursuing their own interest s did not promote effect ually the interests of society. This dilemma was one of a few stimuli ge nerating a new focal point for rationality, that of efficient implementation. More recently, economists on the BIS Basel Committee on Banking Supervision were engaging in implementation ra tionality through simulation in the form of the Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme ( RCAP). The examination of iterative modeling and solving for rules of action at the LSL and in the RCAP suggest that the explicit narrowing of modeling choices that bind the ratio nality of the individual units w ould be best iterated through a process that takes into account the human factor. Interactions with experimental psychologists opened a door for economists to non-standard mode ling and an iterative, he uristic specification of economizing rules of action that ha d a greater chance of implementation.
B21|Unraveling the R&D-Innovation-Productivity relationship - a study of an academic endavour|This paper accounts for the development of the academic endavour to determine the firm-level relationship between investments in R&D and productivity. The impact of 28 highly cited publications within this line of study is investigated using a combination of bibliometric techniques and citation function analysis. We show how the attention paid to this line of research broadens and deepens in parallel to the diffusion of innovation as a research theme during 2000s. Our findings also suggest that the attraction of scholarly attention is driven by combination of broadening interest in the central research question under study and boundary-pushing methodological contributions made in the key contributions.
B21|Proposal Of A Connection Model For A University Based On The Triple Helix, Propuesta De Un Modelo De Vinculacion Para Una Universidad Basada En La Triple Helice|This work shows a connection proposal based on the triple helix model. This effort was born as a result of a strategic planning exercise at Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon (UANL). To make this proposal we investigated different models of connections of universities of the country, as well as universities in South America and Europe. We generate a proposal where the University supports the development of the region through a strategic collaboration between the Government, industry and the University itself. The results show different modalities to achieve the integration of these three elements for the benefit of the society that contains them
B21|Hayek, the Nobel, and the revival of Austrian economics|This paper re-evaluates the orthodox understanding of the role which the 1974 award of the Nobel Prize in Economics to F.A. Hayek had on the revival of Austrian Economics in the later part of the 20th century. The orthodox view, which focuses exclusively on the sociological role of the award on returning Austrian economists to the conversation among academic economists, omits the critical role of purely doctrinal developments. In particular, the work done in the decade 1937–1948 is argued to be central to the Austrian revival. In this decade, both Hayek and Mises independently developed new clarifications of Austrian thought which represented an extension of the subjectivist tradition in economics: Mises’ emphasis on human entrepreneurial action and Hayek’s exploration of the role of knowledge in the market process. The interest of a generation of younger academics to the ideas developed in that critical decade is thus understood to be the true cause of the Austrian revival, with the award of the Nobel Prize serving a catalytic rather than causative role.

B21|Discovery processes, science, and ‘knowledge–how:’ Competition as a discovery procedure in the laboratory|These edited remarks explore the relationship of the thought of F.A. Hayek to the development of experimental economics and related programs in economic design. Particularly emphasized are the insights of Hayek with respect to competition and their importance to the theoretical justification for, and empirical results derived from, the experimental study of market behavior. These remarks include some personal commentary on experimental methods, from the early double auctions of the 1960s through more recent work exploring the nature of business cycles. Finally, the intellectual history of the market structures examined in Vernon Smith’s work is discussed, comparing the exploration of the double auction to the horse market of Bohm-Bawerk, as well as the general insight of Adam Smith that causality stems from the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange to the discovery of specialization.

B21|On the Samuelson-Etula Master Function and Marginal Productivity: some old and new critical remarks|The paper addresses the ambiguity that surrounds the conception of capital and its role in neoclassical price-and-distribution theory. The difficulties encountered in the various attempts to define the marginal product either of capital or of a capital good are recalled and the conclusion is drawn that neither concept appears theoretically sound. This is combined with critical discussion of the recent attempt by Samuelson and Etula to determine income distribution by means of their ‘Master Function’ and its ‘non-neoclassical’ marginal products. Rather than the existence of a continuum of alternative technical possibilities, Samuelson and Etula assume the simultaneous coexistence of a discrete number of methods of production for the same commodity. Even though each technique employs the inputs in fixed proportions, the coexistence of various techniques permits the full employment of an arbitrarily given vector of input endowments. As is shown here, however, the coexistence of methods required for the differentiability of the Samuelson-Etula Master Function can take place, if capital goods are used in production, neither in the case with stationary relative prices nor in the non-stationary Arrow-Debreu framework.
B21|Redistribution Adjusts Efficiency In Economy; Islamic Paradigm|The main discussion in this study is distribution as the root to be forwarded to another economic activity, it is redistribution concept. The concept of redistribution has always been a debate in every microeconomics discussion. Purpose of this study is to discuss how the concept of Islam regulate distribution also redistribution of wealth, and how this concept break away the inefficiency of economic activity. This study begins with a discussion of the principles of ownership by promoting the concept of multi ownership. The principles include all the basis of human freedom master, possess, use, reproduce, distribute, and redistribute wealth. The redistribution of wealth is ruled in every parties of economic agent, as long as it is human. How the redistribution is ruled is investigated based on Islamic Law of Fiqh. Furthermore, this research is trying to examine how the concept of redistribution benefits the efficiency in economy. This study was conducted using research methods of the literature studies, both of textbooks and handbooks various studies. The literature on the concept of Islamic paradigm and the positive paradigm are managed to produce a comprehensive study. In the final conclusion, this study focused on the Islamic paradigm affirmation of distribution and redistribution benefits and its advantage for the improvement of efficient global economy scale.
B21|Capital theory ‘paradoxes’ and paradoxical results: resolved or continued?|Abstract Capital theory controversies and ‘paradoxes’ showed that, due to price-feedback effects, the wage–production price–profit rate curves may display shapes inconsistent with the requirements of the neoclassical theory of value and distribution. Subsequent findings on a number of quite diverse actual single-product economies suggested that the impact of those effects is of limited empirical significance. This paper argues that, by focusing on the distributions of the eigenvalues and singular values of the system matrices, we can further study these issues and derive some meaningful theoretical results consistent with the available empirical evidence. Consequently, the real paradox, in the sense of knowledge vacuum and, thus, requiring further research, is the distributions of the characteristic values and not really the ‘paradoxes in capital theory’.
B21|Clower's about-face regarding the 'Keynesian Revolution'|Robert W. Clower’s article “The Keynesian Counter-Revolution: A Theoretical Appraisal” (1965) deeply influenced the course of Keynesian macroeconomics by contributing to the transition from IS/LM macroeconomics to fix-price theories. Despite this influence, no scholar proposed to explain its origins, with the notable exception of Roger E. Backhouse and Mauro Boianovsky (2013). They explained that the 1965 piece was the result of an independent research program rooted in the works of Clower during the 1950s. My paper aims to offer an alternative explanation. It is synthesized in the metaphor of an about-face to stress that a theoretical break is at the origin of this contribution. This break, initiated in the early 1960s, is characterized by a double change in perspective (individual equilibrium vs. individual disequilibrium, and compatibility vs. incompatibility between Keynesian and Walrasian theories). The intellectual context, particularly Don Patinkin (1956; 1958), will be invoked to trace the roots of this about-face. Consequently, rather than independency and linearity, I argue that dependency and non-linearity are the two salient features of Clower’s intellectual path.
B21|The origins, development, and fate of Clower’s ‘stock-flow’ general-equilibrium program|Before becoming the hallmark of macroeconomics à la Wynne Godley, the ‘stock-flow’ analysis was already developed in microeconomics and general equilibrium theory. Basically, the goal was to study the formation of economic plans and the determination of market prices when individuals were supposed to consume, produce, and hold commodities. It is acknowledged that Robert W. Clower was a central figure in this theoretical context. Yet, for both his contemporaries and for historians, his contributions remained essentially technical. No attention was paid to the theoretical project underlying the statics and dynamics analyses of his ‘stock-flow’ price theory. My paper aims to fill this gap. In light of his doctoral dissertation, I show that the elaboration of ‘stock-flow’ market models was part of a project aiming at offering sound microfoundations to a Keynesian business cycle model. I analyze the origins of this microfoundation program, trace its development, and discuss its fate.
B21|Homo Economicus and Homo Stramineus|The model of Homo economicus has often been criticized as unrealistic. In particular, it has been found lacking for allegedly assuming that people are selfish, an assumption which is contradicted by both introspection and empirical evidence. The aim of this paper is to show that never in the history of the economic discipline has selfishness constituted the core of the Homo economicus model. In fact, the standard economic model of behaviour which has been used by economists for more than a hundred years is reticent about the motives of behaviour. Critics thus do not criticize Homo economicus but a straw man - Homo stramineus. Three possible reasons for confusing Homo economicus with Homo stramineus are identified: malicious intent, ignorance and an attempt to avoid the tautological model of behaviour.

Within this dynamic retail leader is the Wal- Mart Stores, Inc. transnational The objective of the work is to study through descriptive analysis, how the transnational industry has taken possession, making subordinate the global supply chain. The work is addressed through the systematization of theoretical and practical supply chain, multinational companies and the integration of Wal - Mart and supply chain concepts.
B21|Some Unsettled Issues in a Second Phase of the Cambridge-Cambridge Controversy|The aim of this paper is to clear up some issues in a second phase of the Cambridge-Cambridge capital theory controversies, when the neoclassical argument was chiefly conducted in terms of the Walrasian specification of capital in intertemporal and temporary general equilibrium models. It is held that the response by the neoclassical side in that phase has not been as satisfactory to rebut the implications of reswitching and capital reversing as some neoclassical scholars have argued. The reason for this can be traced in the overlooking of the implications of the redefinition of equilibrium implied in those models.
B21|Kartele w trzech perspektywach: neoklasycznej, behawioralnej oraz etycznej|Celem artykułu jest krytyka podejścia neoklasycznego w studiach nad kartelami oraz ukazanie, w jaki sposób perspektywy behawioralna i etyczna rozszerzają a także uzupełniają optykę neoklasyczną. Główny nurt badań ekonomicznych nad problematyką karteli przyjmuje perspektywę neoklasyczną. Z tej tradycji badawczej wyrasta teoria optymalnego zniechęcania, która stanowi podstawę dla obecnej polityki wobec karteli w rozwiniętych krajach świata. Teoria optymalnego zniechęcania stanowi tu punkt wyjścia dla rozważań teoretycznych. Skonfrontowana jest ona następnie z doniesieniami ekonomistów behawioralnych oraz sądami etycznymi na temat funkcjonowania karteli. Analiza behawioralna pozwala wskazać odstępstwa od zachowań przedsiębiorstw przewidywanych na podstawie teorii optymalnego zniechęcania (zakładającej pełną racjonalność, doskonały egoizm oraz całkowitą samokontrolę decydentów). Te behawioralne odstępstwa wynikają z przyczyn wewnętrznych (dyspozycji decydentów) lub czynników środowiskowych. Analiza etyczna rozszerza optykę neoklasyczną. Rozważania aksjologiczne pozwalają pokazać, że działania kartelowe mają nie tylko wymiar czysto ekonomiczny, ale łamią one normy społeczne i mogą zostać uznane na moralnie złe jako przykłady kradzieży oraz oszustwa.

B21|Joseph Schumpeter: the long run, and the short|Despite the short-run elements in his work, Schumpeter succeeded in drawing economists back in the other direction. This paper examines Schumpeter’s formal, analytical micro-model of entrepreneurship and innovation, which laid the groundwork for a workable micro-model of the long-run growth process. Schumpeter’s enduring work continues to guide effective policy, though concern for the general welfare permits neither the long run nor the short run to be ignored.

B21|Three revolutions in macroeconomics: their nature and influence| Harry Johnson's 1971 ideas about the factors affecting the success of the Keynesian Revolution and the Monetarist Counter-revolution are summarised and extended to the analysis of the Rational Expectations-New Classical (RE-NC) Revolution. It is then argued that whereas Monetarism brought about a revival of the quantity theory of money from the limbo into which Keynesianism had pushed it, RE-NC modelling was responsible for that theory's most recent disappearance. This happened despite the fact that, initially, RE-NC economics appeared to be a mainly technical extension and refinement of Monetarism, rather than a radically new economic doctrine. Some implications of this story for todays' macroeconomics are briefly discussed.
B21|Old lady charm: explaining the persistent appeal of Chicago antitrust| The paper deals with the mysterious persistence of the Chicago approach as the main analytical engine driving antitrust enforcement in American courts. While the approach has been almost completely replaced in contemporary industrial economics by the so-called Post-Chicago view, Chicago arguments still permeate antitrust case law at all judicial levels. Chicago's rise to dominance was allegedly due to the superiority of its economic analysis. Why did the Post-Chicago approach, which is supposed to have a clear analytical edge, fail to do the same? The paper offers a series of explanations: though none is completely exhaustive, each may account for a bit of the story. More generally, the current situation of antitrust case law offers valuable methodological insight on themes such as how economists persuade (i.e., how economic arguments come to be accepted and applied by policy- or law-makers) or the impact of the different professional practices in the diffusion of economic ideas.
B21|Dynamic Model of the Individual Consumer|This paper presents an alternative formulation of consumer theory that allows consumer behavior to be modeled as a dynamic process. Rather than simply predicting the optimal choices a consumer will make, this formulation provides a time dependent process by which the consumer arrives at equilibrium with the market and maintains stability with it. This formulation is built upon multivariate integral (vector) calculus and is formally analogous to the theory of electric fields in classical physics. This approach allows the consumerâ€™s Marginal Rates of Substitution (MRS) to be accepted as a theoretical given, rather than derived from hypothetical quantities such as utility or preference. Using a basic set of axioms, a vector function giving the consumerâ€™s (observable) Marginal Values is defined from his (her) MRS. Using an additional axiom regarding the reciprocity of substitute and/or complementary goods, a scalar Use Value function is defined as the integral of the Consumerâ€™s Marginal Values using Stokesâ€™ Theorem. While functionally equivalent to utility, the consumerâ€™s Use Value is measurable and unique to constants of integration that correspond to observable quantities. With an additional assumption that guarantees convexity of Use Valueâ€™s isotimic surfaces, the formulation developed here is used to solve the traditional consumer choice problem. It is shown that, whenever the consumer holds a bundle of goods that is not his or her â€œoptimalâ€ one, the consumer will undergo a tatonnementâ€“like process consisting of a series of incremental exchanges with the market until her optimal bundle is obtained.
B21|A Certain Amount of ‘Recantation'. On the Origins of Frank H. Knight’s Antipositivism|The aim of this paper is to investigate in some detail the origins of Knight’s antipositism and to assess the main influences that brought him to a change in methodological perspective after 1921. As importantly, what follows is also an attempt to increase our general understanding of the methodological debates taking place during the early decades of the last century and to shed new light on the inherently pluralistic character of US interwar economics. This paper is organized as follows: the first section outlines Knight’s methodological views as presented in his early works; the second section discusses Knight’s “recantation” and his attack on behavioristic social science; the third section analyze Knight’s discussion of the nature and limitations of scientific economics; the fourth section offers a brief digression on Knight’s relationship with American institutionalism; the fifth section deals with the later developments of Knight’s antipositivism; the final section presents some conclusions
B21|Again on the relevance of reverse capital deepening and reswitching|Among the recent interventions in the capital controversy, the debate between Paola Potestio and Kurz&Salvadori has raised important issues. We agree with Potestio’s rejection of the legitimacy of a value endowment of capital but we disagree with her dismissal of the relevance of reswitching and reverse capital deepening: these phenomena are very important because they undermine the demand-side role of the conception of capital as a single factor. For the marginal approach to be plausible, this demand-side role had to imply the stability of the savings-investment market even in shorter time frames than those required by a complete adaptation of the ‘form’ of capital; this was taken by Marshall to authorize doing without a given endowment of value capital, which opened the door to the shift to the modern neo-Walrasian versions of the marginal approach. With proof from Hayek, Hicks, Malinvaud and Lucas we argue that a continuing belief in traditional time-consuming marginalist disequilibrium adjustments based on capital-labour substitution is the hidden reason why the claim, often made by contemporary marginalist economists, that the economy can be assumed to be all the time on the equilibrium-growth path is not found patently unacceptable. The true microfoundation of DSGE macromodels is not intertemporal equilibrium theory, but the adjustment mechanisms on whose basis the marginal approach was born and accepted, and on whose basis monetarism was then able to re-assert a pre-Keynesian view of the working of the economy.
B21|Daniel Ellsberg on the Ellsberg Paradox|Even though Daniel Ellsberg’s 1961 article “Risk, ambiguity and the Savage axioms” is well-known and increasingly quoted in current decision theory, introducing the counterexample to Bayesian decision-making that got the normative value of Savage’s theory into trouble, its philosophical background remains totally unknown. This paper examines Ellsberg’s motivations in presenting his critique first to his fellow decision theorists at Harvard and RAND in the late 1950s and it goes into his reasons for giving a philosophical justification and defence of the paradox in his doctoral thesis of 1962. By concentrating mainly on Ellsberg’s all-encompassing analysis of decision-making in his thesis, the paper shows that a number of relevant issues connected to the paradox can be thrown light on. These range from its historical background to the way to test the normative value of decision theory through experiments, and a taxonomy of decision rules based on alternative probabilistic set-ups. Crucially, the paper argues that Ellsberg subscribed to a generalised version of the Bayesian approach, one that informs the developments of the multiple prior approach in current decision theory, but finds its origins in Keynes’s Treatise on Probability

Der Artikel geht diesen Fragen nach, indem er in historischer Perspektive wesentliche Zusammenhänge zwischen Strategien der Beeinflussung der ""öffentlichen Meinung"" einerseits sowie der Wissenschaft und Lehre andererseits herausarbeitet, wie sie am Neoliberalismus und seinen Protagonisten Walter Lippmann und Friedrich A. Hayek beobachtet werden können. Zudem wird eine Skizze einer grundlegend alternativen Bildungsform, einer Bildung für ökonomische Mündigkeit, entworfen"
B21|Le paradoxe d'Allais. Comment lui rendre sa signification perdue ?|Few problems in decision theory have raised more persisting interest than the Allais paradox. It appears that sufficiently many brilliant works have addressed it from within decision theory proper for history and philosophy of science now to enter the stage. In its historical side, the paper recounts the paradox as it arose, i.e., in 1952, at a Paris conference attended by the main decision theorists of the time. They had drawn renewed confidence in expected utility theory (eut) from the way von Neumann and Morgenstern had axiomatized it in 1947, and Allais devised his puzzle precisely to shaken their confidence. The issues between the two camps were normative, but they became lost in the developments of the 1980s that belatedly brought fame to the « Allais paradox ». These works restricted the paradox to be a straightforward empirical refutation, turning it into a stake of also exclusively empirically oriented non-eu theories. In its philosophical vein, the paper tries to evaluate this shift of interpretation. To an extent, decision theorists were right because their experimental work was thus freed from a major complication and amenable to illuminating results: eut was empirically refuted, the independence axiom of von Neumann and Morgenstern was the main culprit, and the next theoretical stage was to modify this axiom appropriately. However, they were also wrong in not addressing an essential feature of their field: i.e., that observed behaviour is informative only if agents are prepared to endorse it reflectingly, i.e., to endow it with some normative value. As reconstructed here, Allais meant to reserve choice experiments to rational subjects, who were either selected at the outset, or identified as such by the experimental results. The paper tries to flesh out Allais’s intuitions by turning to by now little known works of the 1970s, which under his influence provided experimental renderings of rationality, and it eventually suggests that decision theory might diversify its methods by taking inspiration from these original attempts.

B21|The New Classical Theory And The Real Business Cycle Model|The present paper aims at describing some key elements of the new classical theory-related model, namely the Real Business Cycle, mainly describing the economy from the perspective of a perfectly competitive market, characterised by price, wage and interest rate flexibility. The rendered impulse-response functions, that help us in revealing the capacity of the model variables to return to their steady state under the impact of a structural shock, be it technology or monetary policy oriented, give points to the neutrality of the monetary entity decisions, therefore confirming the well-known classical dichotomy existing between the nominal and the real factors of the economy.
B21|Integrating search in macroeconomics: the defining years|Our paper studies two attempts at integrating unemployment in macroeconomics. The first, due to Diamond, consists in a search model exhibiting multiple equilibria. The second is due to Andolfatto and Merz who, more or less simultaneously, were able to integrate the matching function in RBC modeling. As a common thread of these two attempts is to be based on the search approach as developed in labor economics, we recount the birth and further development of the search paradigm in a first section. We then analyze Diamond’s, Andolfatto’s and Merz’s contributions. Our interest lies specifically in how they made their way in the development of the field. We show that Diamond’s model, which ambitioned to rival Lucas’s Expectations and the Neutrality of Money model, did not live up to its author’s expectations. We propose an interpretation as to the reason this was so. As to Andolfatto and Merz, while their project was less ambitious, we show that they were able to establish what they were striving at, namely an harmonious integration of one particular search model within the RBC paradigm. The price to be paid, however, was to abandon several constitutive traits of the search approach.
B21|The economics of international migration: A short history of the debate|This paper provides a view of progress over the last quarter century in the economics of international migration. I focus on two long established topics and two that have surged in the last decade. Interest in immigrant and assimilation and in the labour market effects of immigration has been kept going by methodological debates and by the diffusion of empirical work from the United States to the wider world. More recently, the difficult politics of immigration policy has fuelled the research agenda and has given rise to a new literature on the forces that drive immigration policy and on the assessment of its effects. Important also is the growth of interest in the causes and consequences of emigration from developing countries. Most notable has been the revival of interest in the brain drain and the wider consequences of the expanding emigrant diaspora.
B21|Da Bentham alla tassazione ottimale|This paper describes the rebirth of the utilitarian approach, with the social welfare function a lÃ Bentham, after the crisis due to the emergence of the ordinalist microeconomic analysis. It is shown that Vickrey in 1945 had already anticipated the themes developed earlier by Harsanyi and later by Mirrlees. After a description of Mirrleesâ€™s work, the paper discusses the situation in which you can use personalized lump-sum taxes, showing that there are critical consequences. The paper criticizes Mankiwâ€™s thesis against the utilitarian approach, concluding with some policy prescriptions.
B21|"Challenging Standard Non-Cooperative Game Theory? From Bacharach's ""Variable Frame Theory"" to ""Team Reasoning"""|"The paper purports to stress how the two major contributions of Bacharach: ""Variable Frame Theory"" (VFT) and ""Team Reasoning"" (TR) improve Standard Non-Cooperative Game Theory in some relevant aspects which I point out. The aims are to show: (i) how Bacharach respectively justifies coordination and cooperation within these theories, and (ii) how these improvements in both VFT and TR involve a new conception of players and their rationality. I underline how coordination and cooperation rely on contextual and social determinants, which challenge and even contradict some pillars of standard individual rationality in terms of subjective expected utility, in games. Even if Bacharach's conceptual and methodological choices within these theories induce numerous difficulties, I try to show that Bacharach’s work underlines some of the implications and related problems induced by the mere foundations of standard non-cooperation game theory."
B21|Reshaping Standard Microeconomics for Political Action: Kenneth J. Arrow and Thomas C. Schelling’s Rand Corporation Projects on Racial Issues|The paper focuses on Arrow statistical discrimination theories and Schelling’s models of segregation, and how their work can be considered as an illustration of “the introduction of the same policy tools [as war game theory] into domestic politics in Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society Program” (Amadae, 2003: 10). In both contributions, abstract and formal theory serves as “a public policy tool” (Amadae, 2003: 9). We underline how (i) certain methods employed within RAND Corp. during the Cold War like its “interdisciplinary approach” or its “system analysis” are applied in Arrow and Schelling’s work on discrimination, and (ii) how certain tools which became the core of neoclassical economics are at the same time pervasive and challenged in Arrow and Schelling’s respective work. In that sense, our analysis is slightly different from Amadae’s one (2003) who sees in their work the illustration of the domination of rational choice theory in neoclassical economics. In our opinion, the two contributions have in common to be embedded in a neoclassical framework and illustrate a movement to amend this general framework for policy purpose. The paper discusses the epistemological status of Arrow and Schelling works, i.e. how they shape a new trend of scientific knowledge, by their specific methodologies, and how their works stress the usual dichotomy between economics as a normative or a positive science. Methods have consequences on political actions and Policy recommendations. The tiny threshold between prediction and explanation in Arrow and Schelling’s works imply a reflection on their epistemological status, especially because their respective amendments to standard theory are driven by the necessity of policy recommendations.
B21|Friedrich Hayek and His Visits to Chile|F. A. Hayek took two trips to Chile, the first in 1977, the second in 1981. The visits were controversial. On the first trip he met with Genera l Augusto Pinochet, who had led a coup that overthrew Salvador Allende in 1973. During his 1981 visit, Ha yek gave interviews that were published in the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio and in which he discussed authoritarian regimes and the problem of unlimited democracy. After each trip, he complained th at the western press had painted an unfair picture of the economic situation under the Pinochet regime. Drawing on archival material, interviews, and past research, we provide a full account of this controversial episode in Hayek's life.
B21|A Brief History of Envelope Theorems in Economics: Static and Dynamic|This paper studies how envelope theorems have been used in Economics, their history and also who first introduced them. The existing literature is full of them and the reason is that most families of optimal value functions can produce them. The paper is driven by curiosity, but hopefully it will give the reader some new insights.
B21|General Equilibrium Theory behind the Iron Curtain: The Case of Victor Polterovich|In this article we address the story of developments in general equilibrium theory in the Soviet Union during the 1970s through the lens of a single biography. The Soviet advances in mathematical economics give an occasion to reflect on the extension of the Walrasian paradigm to nonmarket societies, as well as on the ideological effects of general equilibrium theory and its interpretations in a Soviet context. Our contribution is focused on the development of general equilibrium theorizing in the work of Victor Meerovich Polterovich (b. 1937), who has been one of the leading figures in mathematical economics and general equilibrium theory in the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia. His papers on the abstract models of exchange, dynamic general equilibrium and optimal growth theory, excess demand correspondences, monotonicity of demand functions, and disequilibrium theory were for the most part published in English and gained considerable attention within the field. We reconstruct the political and ideological basis of the general equilibrium concept and show how abstract mathematical models reflected the discursive shift from optimal centralized planning to various forms of decentralization. We argue that the Soviet work on general equilibrium was a part of the global development of mathematical economics but was not integrated into it institutionally.
B21|Where are the big bills? Escaping the endogenizer’s dilemma|The continual expansion of rational choice theory to a greater range of social phenomena—from markets to politics and institutions—is a testament to its success. Each further application, however, simultaneously forecloses a potential source of inefficiency in economic systems. Abdicating efficiency considerations impairs economics’ explanatory power as much as its normative relevance. In this paper I explore the interconnected roles of subjectivism and knowledge problems in accounting for inefficiency. I conclude that the knowledge-generating properties of institutions allow for efficiency comparisons, but only in the embrace of a thoroughgoing subjectivism.

B21|James M. Buchanan: Through an Austrian window|This tribute to the late James Buchanan is an elaboration of themes he developed on the importance of processes in real, experienced time, especially for individual choice. The conventional way of modeling choice is to think of it as the solution to a constrained maximization problem. If, however, we look at choice as a process in time it is inseparable from the evolution and self-development of the individual. Preferences emerge in the process of their becoming. The fundamental characteristic of choice is thus the expression of autonomy and not the satisfaction of given preferences. The implications of this for normative economics are explored.

B21|The empire strikes back: Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, and the Robust Political Economy of empire|Recent scholarship regarding the idea of a U.S. Empire has raised serious questions as to the feasibility and desirability of imperial ambitions. This paper traces the debate over the net-benefit of empire back to the Classical economists. Adam Smith argued that the British Empire was a net cost while John Stuart Mill concluded the same empire was a net benefit. Contemporary arguments about a U.S. Empire map neatly to the divergent views of Smith and Mill. In addition to engaging in an exercise in history of thought, we use Smith’s political economy as a means of adjudicating between the different claims regarding the feasibility of empire. In doing so, we subject the claims of proponents of American Empire against the standard of robust political economy, which holds that intervention must generate desirable outcomes where less than ideal incentive and epistemic conditions hold. In doing so, we conclude that many of the claims made by proponents are fragile under less than ideal conditions. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
B21|Aspects of the Confrontation of Ideas from Romanian Interwar Thinking Regarding Economic Policy|Romanian economic thinking in the interwar period can be treated systemically because it presents in a cohesive form, demonstrating that he was able to develop various trends and currents that defined and expressed, same time society views of those historical moments, translated into political by the circles of thought associations and political groups. From the economic point of view, also, Romania interwar represents same time, a complex novel of and decay's success since World War has put the country at efforts, over the powers of the Romanian nation. However, as a result due to the final outcome of the war, following period has become favorable economic to Romania, providing a substantial economic leap, to the whole society, paving the way domestic market growth, development and prosperity became more basic, later.
B21|Memory and Anticipation: New Empirical Support for an Old Theory of the Utility Function|The paper contrasts early theories of the utility function (starting with Bentham and elaborated by Jevons) with the modern theory (laid down by Fisher and Samuelson). The former include in the utility function not only the sensation of current events but also the memory of past events and the anticipation of future events. The alternative hypotheses are tested by introducing both past and expected future income into the estimated subjective well-being function, using an appropriate data set for China. The tests favour the early theories. Implications are drawn.
B21|"Elasticidad precio de la demanda y perfil de los usuarios de la parada “Pablo de Olavide"" de Metro de Sevilla || Price Elasticity of Demand and Profile of “Pablo de Olavide"" Metro Stop's Users of Seville Metro"|"En el presente trabajo mostramos los resultados más relevantes obtenidos en un proceso de encuestación a 300 usuarios de la estación “Pablo de Olavide"" del metro de Sevilla. El objetivo del trabajo es doble: por un lado, analizar el perfil del usuario (motivaciones por las que usan el metro, intermodalidad y flujos); mientras que, por otro lado, a partir de las disposiciones a pagar con respecto a posibles incrementos en el precio del servicio, estimamos parcialmente la elasticidad precio de la demanda para esta población objetivo tan concreta. El perfil tan específico de los usuarios de dicha parada así como las características propias del metro de Sevilla explican algunos de los resultados obtenidos esperando ayuden a los gestores y administradores de Metro de Sevilla en la toma de decisiones. || In this paper the most relevant results obtained in a survey conducted by 300 users of the “Pablo de Olavide"" Seville metro stop are presented. The aim of the paper is twofold. On the one hand, the user profile is analysed: motivations for using the subway, intermodality and ows, whereas, on the other hand, the price elasticity of demand is partially computed by means of the willingness to pay for that specic user profile. In fact, both the particular user profile and Seville metro's characteristics explain some of the obtained results that hopefully will help managers of Seville Metro in making decisions."
B21|Model Of Evaluation Of The Management Effectiveness Of State Corporate Rights Of Industrial Enterprises In Ukraine|This paper proposes a method for increasing the efficiency of state corporate rights management of industrial enterprises by clarifying the evaluation of the efficiency of their management. This method is a model of comprehensive evaluation of enterprises on the basis of data that resulted in the reporting documents. Three groups of indicators were adopted and included: commercial, non-commercial and managing criteria. Integral performance criterion is the weighted sum of those three groups. Model performance evaluation was built using ordinal regression. Based on this model estimate the efficiency of state corporate rights management of industrial enterprises was obtained more accurately, providing a wide range of estimates.
B21|Aspects regarding the implementation of internal control in mining companies|Internal control is broadly defined as a process, affected by an entity's board of directors, management and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives. Internal control means different things to different people. This causes confusion among businesspeople, legislators, regulators and others. Because internal control serves many important purposes, there are increasing calls for better internal control systems and report cards on them. Internal control is looked upon more and more as a solution to a variety of potential problems. Proper risk management and internal control could help mining companies understand the risks they are exposed to, put controls in place to counter threats, and effectively pursue their objectives. They are therefore an important aspect of a mining exploitation’s governance, management, and operations as is shown next.

It is found that consumer protection may lead to reduced product quality and adverse effects on firm survival.
B21|Economists as political philosophers : a critique of normative trade theory|Economists are political philosophers. This claim is defended based on an investigation of normative arguments made in economics textbooks. The paper aims to explain, reconstruct and contest the neoclassical vision implicit in mainstream economic trade theory. Analyzing arguments made by international economists from the perspective of political philosophy, I show how the contemporary defence of free markets and trade liberalization is linked to a specific normative ideal of the political and social good.
B21|The Hicks-Malinvaud average period of production and 'marginal productivity': A critical assessment| Malinvaud took up the concept of the average period of production introduced by Hicks in Value and Capital and then Capital and Time , in an article of 2003 celebrating Wicksell's contribution to the theory of capital, where he observed that once techniques are ranked according to the average period for a given initial rate of interest, a rise in the rate of interest entails the use of a technique with a shorter average period. After a brief reconstruction of Malinvaud's argument, it is shown that the result is far less encouraging for neoclassical theory than it might seem. The most important problem is not the fact that change in the interest rate affects the average period of production associated with a technique, despite the concern this aroused in Hicks and Malinvaud, but rather that it affects the ranking of techniques. An example with two techniques is used to show that a rise in the rate of interest entails the use of a technique with a shorter average period even in the case of reswitching simply because the ranking of techniques is inverted at the two switch points.
B21|The behaviour of firms: an old debate|The Harvard School began with the early Mason/Bain research about the performance of the firms to get market power. This proposal opened a different field of the neoclassical economic theory valid since Alfred Marshall, whereas the Chicago scholars continued with the traditional paradigm. Nowadays the three main issues of discussion between these two schools of economic thought are the same as those of the 30’s and 40’s: barriers of entry into an industry for the new incumbents, the production function and profits maximization and behaviour of the firms within their industry. This article updates these topics.
B21|Games judges don't play: predatory pricing and strategic reasoning in US antitrust|The paper analyzes the last three decades of debates about predatory pricing in US antitrust law, starting from the literature that followed Areeda and Turner's 1975 landmark paper and ending in the beginning of this century, upon the Brooke 1993 decision. Special emphasis is given to the game-theoretic approach to predation and to the reasons why this approach has never gained attention in the courtroom. It is argued that, despite their mathematical rigor, the sophisticated stories told by strategic models to demonstrate the actual viability of predatory behavior fail to satisfy the criteria guiding court's decisions, in particular their preference for easy-to-apply rules. Predation cases are still governed by a peculiar alliance between Chicago-style price theory--which, contrary to game theory, considers predatory behavior almost always irrational--and a Harvard-style attention to the operational side of antitrust enforcement.
B21|Der kühle Gleichmut des Ökonomen: Leidenschaftslosigkeit als Paradigma der Wirtschaftswissenschaft und die Fragefelder der Sozio-Ökonomie|In der ökonomischen Bildung wird die Wirtschaft aus quasi-naturwissenschaftlicher Perspektive gelehrt, ohne dass diese Perspektive selbst kaum je reflektiert würde. Aufgezeigt wird, wie aus dieser Perspektive heraus angehende Ökonomen angeleitet werden, sich von ihrer eigenen Erfahrungswelt wie auch von ihrer eigenen Kultur stillschweigend zu distanzieren. Sie sollen gleichsam zu Sozialingenieuren werden, welche die Wirtschaft wie eine Maschine von außen zu beherrschen glauben. Weitergehend wird diskutiert, wie die ökonomische Bildung sich selbst grundlegend ändern kann, um junge Menschen wieder Möglichkeiten zu bieten, sich über ihre eigenen Voraussetzungen des Denkens und Handelns zu verständigen. Wie kann ihnen geholfen werden, die herrschende Sprach- und Gefühllosigkeit im Wirtschaftsalltag zu überwinden?
B21|Approaches to well-being, use of psychology and paternalism in economics|This paper discusses three approaches in economics which take a position on the definition of well-being and which use insights from psychology to support their positions: Scitovsky's Joyless Economy, happiness economics, and the constitutional approach to happiness in economics. The paper shows first that the definition of well-being by each approach, which is a normative step, is revealed by the choice of a psychological theory or method rather than resulting from the application of a theory or method. Secondly, this paper demonstrates that personal judgement by the authors is often needed in the positive realm, in order to interpret psychological results and to then translate them into practical recommendations. Both of these issues have implications for those theories that define well-being as something other than the fulfillment of individual preferences whatever their content, and which therefore yield a potential justification for paternalism. This paper argues that the potential paternalistic implications of these approaches are not based on positive science only, but rely on normative choice and personal judgement.
B21|Survey Design and Response Analysis: a Study on Happiness, Life Satisfaction and Well-being in Piedmont, a Region of Italy|In the literature of happiness economics individual subjective utility is measured by directly asking individuals to self-assess their level of utility, usually on a numerical scale, using various terms such as happiness, life satisfaction and well-being, most of the times taking for granted that they are synonymous. Despite the richness of happiness economics literature, several terminological and methodological issues still need to be investigated. This paper presents the results of a field survey conducted in the Region of Piedmont (Northern Italy) by means of 1250 face-to-face interviews, financed by Piedmont Government, in order to assess the level of happiness, life satisfaction and quality of life using three different scales: a verbal one (7 steps from, say, very unhappy to very happy, a unipolar cardinal scale (from 1 to 7) and bipolar cardinal scale (from -3 to 3). We have also examined the effects of wording and scales on those that turned out to be the main determinants of the three notions. We show that wording clearly matters: not only each subject (in most cases) self-reports differently her/his own happiness, life satisfaction and well-being and therefore they may be similar but not equivalent notions, but also their determinants turn out to be different. Moreover, we find that the use of different scales leads to different results. However, a clear pattern does not emerge: therefore we cannot state which numerical scale performs better in representing the verbal self-reported valuations.
B21|An analysis of Rawls’s and Sen’s concepts of freedom|The aim of this paper is to examine the concepts of freedom used by John Rawls and Amartya Sen in the light of two well-known pairs of freedom: the pair freedom of the ancients/freedom of the moderns defined by Constant and the pair negative freedom/positive freedom defined by Berlin. After a reminder of the seminal texts of both pairs, we will show that even if Rawls’s justice as fairness is mainly based on the pair freedom of the ancients/freedom of the moderns, it deals as well with the effectivity of basic freedoms and so with the pair negative freedom/ positive freedom. Similarly, Sen’s works which are principaly focused on the pair negative freedom/positive freedom have close ties with the pair freedom of the ancients/freedom of the moderns – especially in his lastest works which stress the importance of democracy. Finally, this analysis will allow us to investigate Sen’s recent dichotomy between the trascendental and the comparative traditions.
B21|The Influence Of Irving Fisher On Milton Friedman’S Monetary Economics|This paper examines the influence of Irving Fisher's writings on Milton Friedman's work in monetary economics. We focus first on Fisher's influences in monetary theory (the quantity theory of money, the Fisher effect, Gibson's Paradox, the monetary theory of business cycles, and the Phillips Curve, and empirics, e.g. distributed lags.). Then we discuss Fisher and Friedman's views on monetary policy and various schemes for monetary reform (the k% rule, freezing the monetary base, the compensated dollar, a mandate for price stability, 100% reserve money, and stamped money.) Assessing the influence of an earlier economist's writings on that of later scholars is a challenge. As a science progresses the views of its earlier pioneers are absorbed in the weltanschauung. Fisher's Purchasing Power of Money as well as the work of Pigou and Marshall were the basic building blocks for later students of monetary economics. Thus, the Chicago School of the 1930s absorbed Fisher's approach, and Friedman learned from them. However, in some salient aspects of Friedman's work we can clearly detect a major direct influence of Fisher's writings on Friedman's. Thus, for example with the buildup of inflation in the 1960s Friedman adopted the Fisher effect and Fisher's empirical approach to inflationary expectations into his analysis. Thus, Fisher's influence on Friedman was both indirect through the Chicago School and direct. Regardless of the weight attached to the two influences, Fisher' impact on Friedman was profound.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

B21|Asian Disease-type of Framing of Outcomes as an Historical Curiosity|This paper discusses the ways by which a certain type of behavioral deviation from expected utility theory has been handled by psychologists and economists. With respect to the historical background of decision theory in economics, it is argued that there are good reasons for more theoretical developments from this behavioral deviation.
B21|Individual judgments and social choice in Sen's idea of justice and democracy|The aim of this paper is to propose a conceptual reconstruction of Sen’s conception of individual judgments, through a back-and-forth analysis between his democratic theory of justice and social choice theory. Firstly, while this is never explicitly presented in Sen’s work, we highlight the importance of the three following elements in the characterization of judgments: position, objectivity and the sense of otherness. Once combined, these three conditions are necessary in order to characterize positional judgments, which, unlike individual preferences, are relevant for justice issues. Secondly, we identify two forces which, in Sen’s view, drive the evolution of such judgments: a widened informational basis and sentiments. This leads us to conclude that a relevant approach to communication, i.e., one which acknowledges the scope of positional judgments and the forces at the source of their evolution, is a third condition for a fruitful transformation of judgments. This last point constitutes, according to us, a missing element in Sen’s idea of justice.

In its historical side, the paper recounts the paradox as it arose, i.e., in 1952, at a Paris conference attended by the main decision theorists of the time. They had drawn renewed confidence in expected utility theory (EUT) from the way von Neumann and Morgenstern had axiomatized it in 1947, and Allais devised his puzzle precisely to shaken their confidence. The issues between the two camps were normative, but they became lost in the developments of the 1980s that belatedly brought fame to the ""Allais paradox"". These works restricted the paradox to be a straightforward empirical refutation, turning it into a stake of also exclusively empirically oriented non-EU theories. In its philosophical vein, the paper tries to evaluate this shift of interpretation. To an extent, decision theorists were right because their experimental work was thus freed from a major complication and amenable to illuminating results: EUT was empirically refuted, the independence axiom of von Neumann and Morgentern was the main culprit, and the next theoretical stage was to modify this axiom appropriately. However, they were also wrong in not addressing an essential feature of their field, i.e., that observed behaviour is informative only if agents are prepared to endorse it reflectingly, i.e., to endow it with some normative value. As reconstructed here, Allais meant to reserve choice experiments to rational subjects, who were either selected at the outset, or identified as such by the experimental results. The paper tries to flesh out Allais's intuitions by turning to by now little known works of the 1970s, which under his influence provided experimental renderings of rationality, and it eventually suggests that decision theory might diversify its methods by taking inspiration from these original attempts."
B21|Concept of Sustainable Development of Small and Medium Enterprises in Moldova|Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In management science concept of sustainable development is fundamental and there are several approaches to defining this term. Often, the term sustainability means the ability of the company to react to changes in the external environment and internal changes. Sustainable economic development of a society can be achieved through the support and development of small and medium enterprises. Analysis of national and international experience shows that small and medium enterprises have become an important part of the economy and plays a role in all the socio-economic developing countries.
B21|Two-Sided Markets: Theory and Applications|(Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics 2012) The paper provides an overview of major results in the theory of two-sided markets that brought the 2012 Nobel Memorial Prize in economics to Lloyd Shapley and Alvin Roth. We describe the celebrated Gale & Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm and Shapley & Scarf top trading cycles algorithm in applications to marriage and college admissions markets, and provide simple examples to illustrate the basic mechanics of these algorithms. We also explain how Gale & Shapley algorithm can be used to improve efficiency of college admission in Russia.
B21|Abstraction as a Mother of Order? (Historical-Methodological Reflections on the Relation of Economic Science and Economic Policy)|The article deals with the relation between assumptions of economic theories and their political implications. Two canons of economic science are being analyzed according to the degree of abstraction. A hypothesis is that the more abstract formal canon is connected with a liberal kind of economic policy whereas the more concrete canon presupposes an active state intervention in economic affairs. Several attempts at integrating both canons are studied separately (Marshall, Schumpeter, Eucken). Historic evidence is more or less consistent with the hypothesis stated above, but there happens to be one important exclusion: the general equilibrium theory is so abstract that it can imply opposite policies.
B21|Transformation in the Nature of American Economics and Establishing Neoclassical Economic Technology|The study briefly focuses on the processes of gradual, though not linear, establishment of the dominance of Neoclassical view after interwar period, following the history of American economics. It is shown that by that (interwar) period there have already been present historically developed components, needed for the turn in the character of the economic theory and its application. This change is associated with converting effects of external determinants in the development of economics – and general aspects, or instruments, of the method of economics as a whole, into intrinsic features and specific tools of the advancing Neoclassical economics. Basically exploited is Mary Morgan’s (2001) conception of the natural interdependences in the processes of functioning of both sides of economics – the theoretical and the applied one – in the form of Economic technology. In this direction It is suggested, development of American, - and world, - economics from around 1930s-1940s through 2000s to be interpr ted through the prism of the formation and functioning (applying) of grand neoclassical economic technology, component (dominated) part of which appears to be the Keynesian economic technology.
B21|Meat Demand Analysis: A Case Study of Akungba-Akoko Township in Ondo State|This study examined the preference for and consumption pattern of meat types by individual households - Specifically, the study investigated the extent to which household income, household size and other socio-economic factors predicted monthly expenditure on meat. Three Hundred household heads were selected from the area using the simple random sampling technique. Results indicated that beef was the most preferred meat (60.14%), followed by chicken (29.72%) and turkey (26.92%). The proportion of household’s total expenditure on meat was high for low income households (on average 18%) while on average of 9% for middle/high income households. The percentage of household food expenditure expended on meat was high for both low income households and high income households relative to middle income households. The most important factor considered by households while purchasing meat was the taste and habits, followed by nutritional value and prices. Other factors observed were freshness, tenderness and religious sentiments.
B21|First vs. second generation Islamic economists: Deviations and differences in thoughts|The present paper proposes to study differences in thoughts of the first vs. second generation Islamic economists, during the past forty years. It will also investigate deviations that occurred in thought and practice in this period. But first it will try to determine the basis of differentiation between the two generations and their distinguishing features. For our study purpose, we regard as the first generation those scholars who started writing on the subject of Islamic economics between 1950 to 1975, a period highly unfriendly if not hostile to the idea of economics with Islamic perspective. This phase culminated at the organization of the first international conference on Islamic economics by King Abdulaziz University in the Holy city of Islam – Makkah Mukarramah. A new era started after the conference, in terms of the establishment of research and study centers, issue of specialized journals, enrolment to Ph. D. courses, foundation of study departments, set up of financial institutions, organization of conferences and seminars, award of prizes, and creation of employment opportunities. It also attracted attention of some non-Muslim economists. Thus, those who joined the movement of Islamic economics after this conference will be considered as the second generation. In its concluding remarks, the paper would suggest certain steps that could be taken to bridge the gaps, minimize the difference, and train the new generation.

B21|Comparative Analysis of the Value Added Tax Evolution|The impact of indirect taxes is analyzed in the study of evolution, especially the VAT for the economic activity of the company studied. During the reporting period, namely January 2009 – December 2011 the supporting documents were checked which records on VAT deductible and collected were based on, in compliance with legal norms and principles of financial accounting. Also the data processed were the basis for an analysis to compare the evolution of VAT. VAT shall be paid for the entire activity of the company.
B21|Individual judgments and social choice in Sen's idea of justice and democracy|The aim of this paper is to propose a conceptual reconstruction of Sen’s conception of individual judgments, through a back-and-forth analysis between his democratic theory of justice and social choice theory. Firstly, while this is never explicitly presented in Sen’s work, we highlight the importance of the three following elements in the characterization of judgments: position, objectivity and the sense of otherness. Once combined, these three conditions are necessary in order to characterize positional judgments, which, unlike individual preferences, are relevant for justice issues. Secondly, we identify two forces which, in Sen’s view, drive the evolution of such judgments: a widened informational basis and sentiments. This leads us to conclude that a relevant approach to communication, i.e., one which acknowledges the scope of positional judgments and the forces at the source of their evolution, is a third condition for a fruitful transformation of judgments. This last point constitutes, according to us, a missing element in Sen’s idea of justice.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B21|A few remarks on monopoly and monopsony|Sylos Labini’s essay is devoted to the analysis of price determination under condition of monopoly and monopsony. The problem of price indeterminacy in case of bilateral monopoly (associated with monopsony) is thoroughly discussed in relation to the market for goods and factors of production. The various cases are examined by assuming the hypothesis of ‘contracting parties’ ignorance of each other’s price elasticities. In the last two sections of the paper, the A. make use of his analysis of monopoly and monopsony to dismiss the ‘Classical’ argument that a perfect wage flexibility can bring about a full employment equilibrium and offers his own interpretation of Keynes’s underemployment equilibrium grounded not on monetary factors but upon market structures. Sylos Labini offers a fresh perspective on the issues he was about to present in his major work Oligopolio e Progresso Tecnico (1956).
B21|Dynamic Coordination via Organizational Routines|We investigate dynamic coordination among members of a problem solving team who receive private signals about which of their actions are required for a (static) coordinated solution and who have repeated opportunities to explore different action combinations. In this environment ordinal equilibria, in which agents condition only on how their signals rank their actions and not on signal strength, lead to simple patterns of behavior that have a natural interpretation as routines. These routine spartially solve the teamâ€™s coordination problem by synchronizing the teamâ€™s search efforts and prove to be resilient to changes in the environment by being expost equilibria, to agents having only a coarse understanding of other agentsâ€™ strategies by being fully cursed, and to natural forms of agentsâ€™ overcon?dence. The price of this resilience is that optimal routines are frequently not optimal equilibria.

B21|Equilibrio parcial y general: dos problemas inquietantes|A pesar de los múltiples avances y modificaciones que ha sufrido la teoría microeconómicaneoclásica, sus dos modelos canónicos continúan siendo el de equilibrio parcial y el de equilibriogeneral. Contrario a lo que habitualmente se expone, existe abundante literatura que tornainsatisfactorios a ambos instrumentos analíticos. El presente ensayo intenta exponer algunosproblemas de la teoría microeconómica dominante recuperando los trabajos que nos parecencontienen los componentes más esenciales de las críticas desarrolladas hacia ambos paradigmas:los elementos aportados por Piero Sraffa; los Teoremas de Sonnenchein-Mantel-Debreu; yla imposibilidad de la teoría del equilibrio general tanto de poder ofrecer una explicación de laformación de precios como de modelar economías monetarias. Finalmente, la parte final del ensayoaborda brevemente si la teoría de juegos puede ser considerada como una salida satisfactoria a losdefectos de la teoría microeconómica convencional.
B21|Negishi On Edgeworth On Jevons' Law Of Indifference, Walras’S Equilibrium, And The Role Of Large Numbers: A Critical Assessment|In developing their pure-exchange equilibrium models, Jevons [1871], Walras [1874–77], and Edgeworth [1881] make use of some version of a law, called law of indifference (or principle of uniformity) by Jevons and Edgeworth and often referred to as the law of one price in connection with Walrasian economics. Edgeworth, in particular, shares with Jevons the idea that the law of indifference must be regarded as an equilibrium property; unlike his predecessor, however, he denies the validity of the law in all economies with a finite number of traders: for him, price uniformity can only emerge and a Jevonsian or Walrasian or competitive equilibrium can only be established when the traders’ number grows unboundedly large. About one century later, Negishi [1982] resumes the time-honoured discussion about the law, striving to prove that, contrary to Edgeworth’s original conjecture, a competitive equilibrium can be attained even in small economies, provided that the true driving force underlying Jevons’s law of indifference, namely, its implicit arbitrage mechanism, be allowed to operate and carry its effects through. In this paper, after reconstructing Jevons’s, Walras’s, and Edgeworth’s respective positions, we critically discuss Negishi’s critique of Edgeworth’s stance on Jevons’s law of indifference, Walras’s equilibrium, and the role of large numbers, showing that his central claim is unsubstantiated.
B21|Appropriation In A Competitive Theory Of Value|Two perspectives on the price system are examined, as a method of valuation represented by Walrasian equilibrium and as a means of appropriation represented by “perfectly competitive equilibrium.” The stronger requirements of perfectly competitive equilibrium emphasize that valuation is driven by appropriation. Similarities between the full appropriation property of perfectly competitive equilibrium and efficient incentive compatible mechanism design are demonstrated.
B21|Using econometric analysis of willingness-to-pay to investigate economic efficiency and equity of domestic water services in the West Bank|The paper is aimed at providing evidence on economic efficiency, and equity of distribution of domestic water services in the West Bank. The study utilizes the CVM as a means of monetizing public preferences and households’ WTP. In the CVM questionnaire, the dichotomous choice with follow-up debriefing questions format is followed by an open-ended follow-up question was undertaken. A second questionnaire survey was directed to employees from water institutions, which was mainly designed to investigate the reasons behind the full absence of private sector in the provision of water supply. The two samples were selected to ensure a representative samples in accordance with the Palestinian case. The main findings of this paper gauged the WTP with key socioeconomic variables suggested by economic theory and previous CVM studies. These results provide information on economic efficiency and equity of water distribution. The results will allow decision makers to develop new policies that can achieve more efficient and equitable domestic water services.
B21|Implications of behavioural economics for financial literacy and public policy|This paper summarizes and highlights different methodological approaches to behavioural economics in the context of the conventional economic wisdom and the implications of these different methodological approaches for financial literacy, related institutional change, and public policy. Conventional economics predicts no substantive improvement from improvements to financial literacy. The errors and biases approach to behavioural economics suggests limited improvements to decision making from financial education as errors and biases are largely hardwired in the brain. Government and expert intervention affecting individual choice behaviour is recommended. The evidence suggests that the bounded rationality approach to behavioural economics, with its focus on smart decision makers and the importance institutional and environment constraints on decision making, is the most promising lense through which to analyse financial decision making. From this perspective, financial decision making can be improved by providing decision makers with better quality information presented in a non-complex fashion, an institutional environment conducive to good decisions, an incentive structure that internalize externalities involved in financial decision making, and financial education that will facilitate making the best use of the information at hand within a specific decision-making environment.
B21|Product Innovation when Consumers have Switching Costs|This unique Handbook explores both the economics of the firm and the theory of the firm, two areas which are traditionally treated separately in the literature. On the one hand, the former refers to the structure, organization and boundaries of the firm, while the latter is devoted to the analysis of behaviours and strategies in particular market contexts. The novel concept underpinning this authoritative volume is that these two areas closely interact, and that a framework must be articulated in order to illustrate how linkages can be created.
B21|How cardinal utility entered economic analysis during the Ordinal RevolutionLength: 31 pages|The paper shows that cardinal utility entered economic analysis during the Ordinal Revolution initiated by Pareto and not, as many popular histories of utility theory assume, before it. Cardinal utility was the outcome of a discussion begun by Pareto about the capacity of ranking transitions among different combinations of goods. The discussion simmered away during the 1920s and early 1930s, underwent a decisive rise in temperature between 1934 and 1938, and continued with some final sparks until 1944. The paper illustrates the methodological and analytical issues and the measurement-theoretic problems, as well as the personal and institutional aspects that characterized this debate. Many eminent economists of the period contributed to it, with Samuelson in particular playing a pivotal role in defining and popularizing cardinal utility. Based on archival research in Samuelson’s papers at Duke University, the paper also addresses an issue of priority associated with the mathematical characterization of cardinal utility.

B21|The Impact of Capital Market Players’ Exit, Voice and Loyalty on Economic Growth|In analyses of the global money and capital markets, economic discourse is mostly focussed on the movement and flow of capital, giving less emphasis to its role in influencing the formation of institutional frameworks as well as national and international rules, particularly in terms of the impact on economic growth. Based on the concept of exit, voice and loyalty developed by Albert O. Hirschman, this paper examines the effect of capital movement and investors’ voice on economic growth, making use of both macroeconomic tools and linear regression based on the data of European countries and Post-Soviet states. Our results indicate that the de facto exit of capital has a negative effect on economic growth, while the de jure exit of capital to the shadow economy and investors’ voice result in a higher growth rate.

Furthermore, the ability to experience innovations in business by external links that may help to avoid risk, improve the quality of natural products, which means qualifying business activities and promote companies capable of rationalizing and projecting high yields. This paper provides an approach from the transaction cost theory of Ronald Coase, in particular, provides preconditions to estimate the specific market of biotechnology.

B21|Game complete analysis of symmetric Cournot duopoly|In this paper we apply the Complete Analysis of Differentiable Games (introduced by D. Carfì in [3], [6], [8], [9], and already employed by himself and others in [4], [5], [7]) to the classic Cournot Duopoly (1838), classic oligopolistic market in which there are two enterprises producing the same commodity and selling it in the same market. In this classic model, in a competitive background, the two enterprises employ, as possible strategies, the quantities of the commodity produced. The main solutions proposed in literature for this kind of duopoly are the Nash equilibrium and the Collusive Optimum, without any subsequent critical exam about these two kinds of solutions. The absence of any critical quantitative analysis is due to the relevant lack of knowledge regarding the set of all possible outcomes of this strategic interaction. On the contrary, by considering the Cournot Duopoly as a differentiable game (a game with differentiable payoff functions) and studying it by the new topological methodologies introduced by D. Carfì, we obtain an exhaustive and complete vision of the entire payoff space of the Cournot game (this also in asymmetric cases with the help of computers) and this total view allows us to analyze critically the classic solutions and to find other ways of action to select Pareto strategies. In order to illustrate the application of this topological methodology to the considered infinite game, several compromise decisions are considered, and we show how the complete study gives a real extremely extended comprehension of the classic model.

The result is that the distribution problem has not been resolved in the neoclassical theory because the positive profits involves value judgments about the product distribution

B21|British economists on competition policy (1890-1920)|"Most late 19th-century US economists gave a rather cool welcome to the Sherman Act (1890) and, though less harshly, to the Clayton and FTC Acts (1914). A large literature has identified several explanations for this surprising attitude, calling into play the relation between big business and competition, a non-neoclassical notion of competition and a weak understanding of anti-competitive practices. Much less investigated is the reaction of British economists to the passing of antitrust statutes in the U.S. What we know is simply that none of them (including the top dog, Alfred Marshall) championed the adoption of a law-based competition policy during the three decades (1890-1920) of most intense antitrust debates in the U.S. The position of three prominent British economists will be examined in this paper: H.S. Foxwell, D.H. MacGregor, and, of course, Alfred Marshall – the latter in two moments at the extremes of our period, 1890 and 1919. It will turn out that they all shared with their American colleagues a theoretical and operational skepticism about the government and judiciary interference with the free working of markets. They also believed that British industrial structure and business habits were so different from those in the U.S. that the urge of interfering with markets in order to preserve competition was much weaker. Among the paper's insights is that Marshall’s key concept of “defending a competitor’s right to compete” foreran the modern characterization of the goal of competition policy as ""the protection of the competitive process"". Yet Marshall developed his concept without making recourse to the post-1930s neoclassical notion of competition as a static market structure which lies at the foundation of most contemporary antitrust policy: a useful lesson from the history of economic thought for those IO economists who still claim that the classical dynamic view of competition is unsuited as a foundation for an effective competition policy."
B21|An optimal strategy for maximizing the expected real-estate selling price: accept or reject an offer?|Motivated by a real-life situation, we put forward a model and then derive an optimal strategy that maximizes the expected real-estate selling price when one of the only two remaining buyers has already made an offer but the other one is yet to make. Since the seller is not sure whether the other buyer would make a lower or higher offer, and given no recall, the seller needs a strategy to decide whether to accept or reject the first-come offer. The herein derived optimal seller's strategy, which maximizes the expected selling price, is illustrated under several scenarios, such as independent and dependent offers by the two buyers, and for several parametric price distributions.
B21|A Nested Contest: Tullock Meets the All-pay Auction|I present a two-player nested contest which is a convex combination of two widely studied contests: the Tullock (lottery) contest and the all-pay auction. A Nash equilibrium exists for all parameters of the nested contest. If and only if the contest is sufficiently asymmetric, then there is an equilibrium in pure strategies. In this equilibrium, individual and aggregate efforts are lower relative to the efforts in a Tullock contest. This leads to the surprising result that if aggregate efforts in the all-pay auction are higher than the aggregate efforts in the Tullock contest, then aggregate efforts in the nested contest may not lie between aggregate efforts in the all-pay auction and aggregate efforts in the Tullock contest. When the contest is symmetric or asymmetric, I find a mixed-strategy equilibrium and describe some properties of the equilibrium distribution function; I also find the equilibrium payoffs and expected bids. When the weight on the all-pay auction component of this nested contest lies in an intermediate range, then there exist multiple non-payoff-equivalent equilibria such that there is an all-pay auction equilibrium as defined in Alcade and Dahm (2010) and another equilibrium which is not an all-pay auction equilibrium; these equilibria cannot be ranked using the Pareto criterion. If the goal of a contest-designer is to reduce aggregate effort (i.e., wasteful rent-seeking efforts), then this nested contest may be better than both the Tullock contest and the all-pay auction.
B21|Denial, Rationalization, and the Administered Price Thesis|This paper analyzes neoclassical reactions to Gardiner Means's administered price thesis during 1980-2000. It shows that his original idea has been continuously denied by mainstream economists. At the same time, it has been transformed through a multiplicity of rationalization processes into one or another bastardized form. However, their attempts to deny and/or rationalize the thesis are unsuccessful as their sanitized versions of Means’s theory turn out to be self-contradictory in the neoclassical framework.
B21|100 Years Since The Birth Of Milton Friedman|The paper is concerned with the economic theory of Milton Friedman. First part outlines the life of Milton Friedman. Second part examines his economic theory - “Essays in Positive Economics” (1953), “Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money“ (1956), „A Theory of the Consumption Function“ (1957), „A Program for Monetary Stability“ (1959), „A Monetary History of the United States 1897 to 1960“ (1963) and „Price Theory“ (1976). His Nobel Prize lecture and American Economic Association lecture in 1967 are discussed. The third part analyzes Friedman’s methodology. Milton Friedman was the most influential economist of the second half of the 20th century. He is best known for his theoretical and empirical research, especially consumption analysis, monetary history and theory, and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy.

Cette critique est examinée en trois temps. On discute tout d’abord l’identification et l’interprétation que propose Orléan des hypothèses walrassiennes : objectivité et convexité des préférences d’une part ; souveraineté du consommateur d’autre part. On évalue ensuite la portée des conséquences de l’hypothèse mimétique sur les propriétés de l’équilibre concurrentiel, en termes d’optimalité et de stabilité. On reformule enfin sa critique moins en termes d’hypothèses ou de résultats que de questionnements, relatifs d’une part à la frustration des agents marchands, d’autre part à la pacification du monde social qui en résulte.
B21|The Paradox of Revenge in Conflicts|The authors consider a two-period game of conflict between two factions, which have a desire for revenge. It is shown that, in contrast to conventional wisdom, the desire for revenge need not lead to escalation of the conflict. The subgame-perfect equilibrium is characterized by two effects: a value of revenge effect (i.e., the benefit of exacting revenge) and a self-deterrence effect (i.e., the fear of an opponentâ€™s desire to exact revenge). The authors construct examples where the equilibrium is such that the self-deterrence effect paradoxically outweighs the value effect and thereby decreases the factionsâ€™ aggregate effort below the level exerted in the no-revenge case. This paradox of revenge is more likely, the more elastically the benefit of revenge reacts to the destruction suffered in the past and the more asymmetric is the conflict. The authors discuss the implications of revenge-dependent preferences for welfare economics, evolutionary stability, and their strategic value as commitment devices.

B21|Re-reading Keynes after the crisis: probability and decision|The recent financial crisis has renewed the interest in Keynes's thought and his analysis of the role played by individual agents in financial markets. George Akerlof and Robert Shiller, in particular, have drawn on the growing interest in behavioural interpretations of financial markets to hold that Keynes’s insistence on “the spontaneous urge to action” of individuals is the most relevant message conveyed by the General Theory. This paper starts off from a brief summary of Akerlof and Shiller’s influential stance and aims to provide an historically motivated assessment of their claim. The paper mostly concentrates on Keynes’s Treatise on Probability and discusses how Keynes applied his philosophy of probability to decision-making. It is argued that a fresh reading of this part of Keynes’s work can contribute to an understanding of how individual agents behave under uncertainty, and that the violations of the Bayesian creed scrutinized in behavioural finance, and in some current proposals to amend mainstream decision theory, were already implicitly discussed by Keynes in his critique of frequency probability
B21|Retrospectives: X-Efficiency|"In a 1966 article in the American Economic Review , Harvey Leibenstein introduced the concept of ""X-efficiency"": the gap between ideal allocative efficiency and actually existing efficiency. Leibenstein insisted that absent strong competitive pressure, firms are unlikely to use their resources efficiently, and he suggested that X-efficiency is pervasive. Leibenstein, of course, was attacking a fundamental economic assumption: that firms minimize costs. The X-efficiency article created a firestorm of criticism. At the forefront of Leibenstein's powerful critics was George Stigler, who was very protective of classical price theory. In terms of rhetorical success, Stigler's combination of brilliance and bluster mostly carried the day. While Leibenstein's response to Stigler was well reasoned, it never resonated with many economists, and Leibenstein remains undeservedly underappreciated. Leibenstein's challenge is as relevant today as it ever was."
B21|The Law of Indifference, Equilibrium, and Equilibration in Jevons, Walras, Edgeworth, and Negishi| In developing their equilibrium theories over the decade 1871-1881, Jevons (1871), Walras (1874-7), and Edgeworth (1881) made use of some version of a Law, called Law of Indifference by Jevons and Edgeworth and often referred to as the Law of One Price in connection with Walrasian economics. In Jevons’s theory of exchange, the Law of Indifference is a quasi-tautology playing a fundamental role in both the derivation of the equilibrium conditions and the characterisation of Jevons’s equilibrium concept. In Walras’s pure-exchange model, the Law of One Price, assumed as a postulate and lacking any proper theoretical underpinnings, is no longer confined to equilibrium analysis, as in Jevons, but is so conceived as to embrace Walras’s equilibration analysis, namely, the celebrated tâtonnement construct, too. Finally, in Edgeworth’s theory of exchange, the Law of Indifference, once again restricted to equilibrium analysis only, is made to emerge as a limiting result, produced by the joint operation of Edgeworth’s replication and recontracting mechanisms and associated with the unbounded increase in the size of the economy. One century after Edgeworth’s achievements, Negishi (1982) resumed Jevons’s and Edgeworth’s interpretation of the Law of Indifference as an equilibrium property; yet, parting company with Edgeworth, he tried to prove that the arbitrage mechanism underlying the Law is at work and fully effective even in very small finite economies. The aim of this paper is twofold: first, to reconstruct the various uses of the Law of Indifference and its variants in the diverse theoretical traditions originated by Jevons, Walras, and Edgeworth; secondly, to critically discuss Negishi’s attempt to revive Jevons’s Law of Indifference as a fully micro-founded and extremely powerful equilibrium property of finite competitive economies where arbitraging activities are allowed for.
B21|Hicks et l'économie de la dépression|Durant les années 1930, Hicks cherche à comprendre la crise à laquelle l’économie mondiale est confrontée. Mais à la différence de la plupart des économistes de l’époque, il tente de se représenter théoriquement la situation dans un cadre d’équilibre général walrassien. Le présent article étudie la façon dont Hicks a développé cette approche dans les derniers chapitres de Valeur et capital (1939). Hicks en vient à affirmer que les fluctuations du système capitaliste mettent son existence en danger et forme le projet d’une théorie des cycles qui accorderait une place centrale aux anticipations de prix et intégrerait un scénario d’effondrement du système. Les difficultés que ce projet rencontre dès 1939 sont analysées afin d’expliquer son abandon dans A Contribution to the Theory of the Trade Cycle (1950).<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B21|Utilitarianism and Economic Behavior. Looking for Benthamite Traces|In spite of the use of a utilitarian language in Rational Choice Theory, economists do not acknowledge any link to this current of moral philosophy, and have made great efforts to rid economics from its legacy. In this document we aim at assessing these efforts retracing their history from Pareto to Samuelson in order to determine how close they came to their ideal of formulating a positive science rid of what they called any metaphysical traces.
B21|Desplazamiento forzoso, participación laboral femenina y poder de negociación en el hogar: ¿Empodera el conflicto a las mujeres?|El desplazamiento de población es un fenómeno frecuente en los países inmersos en conflictos internos. El desplazamiento forzoso, además de afectar directamente a la población desplazada, contribuye a deteriorar las condiciones laborales de la población vulnerable en las comunidades receptoras. Para la población desplazada, las pérdidas de ingresos son sustanciales y al migrar a las ciudades se vinculan a la fuerza laboral del sector informal. Evidencia cualitativa revela que las mujeres desplazadas pueden competir mejor en los mercados laborales urbanos pues su experiencia laboral es más relevante para ciertos trabajos urbanos no calificados. Este artículo usa los cambios exógenos en la participación laboral femenina para identificar sus efectos sobre el poder de negociación de la mujer en el interior del hogar. Los resultados muestran que las mujeres desplazadas por el conflicto trabajan más horas, devengan salarios similares y contribuyen en mayores proporciones al ingreso del hogar frente a las mujeres rurales. Sin embargo, su mayor contribución a los ingresos del hogar no se traduce en un mayor poder de negociación en el hogar. Más aún, la violencia doméstica aumenta para las mujeres desplazadas. La ira y la frustración de las mujeres desplazadas derivan, además, en un incremento de la violencia contra los niños. Dado que los niños de las familias desplazadas han sido víctimas directas del conflicto y de la violencia doméstica, la transmisión intergeneracional de la violencia puede perpetuar ciclos de violencia.
B21|Evidencia empírica de la teoría del consumo para Colombia 2000-2010|En este trabajo se evalúan las hipótesis de consumo de Keynes, Friedman, Modigliani y Hall,mostrando sus elementos teóricos, junto con la verificación econométrica de cada una para Colombia, con datos trimestrales, en el periodo 2000-2010. Se muestran las diferencias que se pueden obtener en el análisis de estas, con sus respectivos impactos en la política económica. En el texto se concluye que la hipótesis keynesiana es útil para un estudio de política económica a corto plazo; mientras que la de Friedman, con expectativas adaptativas, resultó, más consistente a largo plazo que la de Modigliani y la de Hall.
B21|La teoría racional del crimen. Aplicaciones de Gary Becker en Bogotá, D.C|"RESUMENEl documento analiza las políticas públicas de seguridad en la ciudad de Bogotá, formuladas sobre la premisa de que existe una correlación entre la criminalidad y las llamadas causas objetivas del conflicto. No obstante, la evidencia empírica que arroja la revisión bibliográfica demuestra que dicha relación no es significativa. Para demostrarlo se desarrolla un modelo decomportamiento criminal, que explica el fenómeno como una competencia en la que los delincuentes compiten entre sí formando una estructura que mejora la productividad de la cadena criminal. De esta manera se elimina el problema del riesgo moral. Esta última idea constituye la hipótesis central del texto que pretende rebatir las causas objetivas de la conducta criminalpara efectos de análisis de la seguridad ciudadana.

APPLICATIONS BY GARY BECKER IN BOGOTÁ, D.C.This document analyzes the public security policies in the city of Bogotá, formulated on the premise that there is a correlation between criminality and the so called objective causes of the confl ict"". In spite of the empiricalevidence of the bibliographic review, it shows that the correlation is not signifi cant. In order to demonstrate this, a behavioral criminal model was developed to explain the phenomenon as a competition in which delinquents compete among themselves forming a structure that improves the productivity of the criminal network. This way, the risk of a moral issue is eliminated. The latter idea is the central hypothesis of the article that pretends to refute the objective causes of criminal conduct in order to analyze citizen security. It is worth clarifying that the empirical evidence is preliminary because itwas impossible to access neither the National Police data base, nor the 2003 victimization survey which was declared a booking statistics by the Colombian Government. Lastly, this article pretends to open a debate about the way in which the criminal policy must be assessed.resUmoA TEORÍA RACIONAL DO CRIME.

B21|Buchanan on externalities: An exercise in applied subjectivism|Buchanan's work on the methodology of economics includes many references to externalities. Buchanan has emphasized that a subjective conception of economics, and a focus put on exchange rather than on choice, has implications on an analysis of externalities. In this paper, we analyze the reverse claim: Buchanan's views on externalities are a perfect illustration of his plea for subjectivism in economics, and the need to focus on economics-as-a-science-of exchange. We show that Buchanan's treatment of externalities was a “laboratory” for his claims and arguments about subjectivism.

B21|The role of tourism in the development of border regions in Hungary|Following the changes of regimes in Central Europe, research into border regions has been increasingly adverted. However, various suggestions of researchers came into light on the definition and role of borders. Prior to the changes of regimes, the development of cross-border tourism was counterworked by administrative tools resulting in settlements in border regions becoming peripheral. Negative effects emerged mostly at border sections demarcated between countries either not able to join (for some reason) or not willing to gain access to the European Union and certain member states (occurring at the Ukrainian, Serbian, Belarusian and, in some cases, the Croatian border). In the field of cross-border cooperation, within the tourism industry, a west-to-east and north-to-south gradient can be detected that, by the present logic, can be explained by the changes of economic circumstances and the succession of European Union accession.
B21|Valuing Recreational and Conservational Benefits of a Natural Tourist Site: Case of Cherrapunjee|Nature based tourism has been a very important source of income and employment in Meghalaya as the state is endowed with diverse scenic natural beauty that attracts a large number of domestic and foreign tourists every year. This paper attempts to examine the impact of various social, economic and locational factors on the visiting decision of the tourists to Cherrapunjee, the wettest place on the earth. The recreation benefit enjoyed by the visitors, from the natural beauty of the site is estimated by using both the revealed and stated willingness to pay i.e., Travel Cost method (TCM) and people's willingness to pay for the preservation and improvement of the area through Contingent Valuation technique (CVM). Distance travelled and travel cost incurred by the visitors is found to have significantly negative impacts on the frequency of visit while income, education has significantly positive impact on the same. The estimated recreation benefits obtained from revealed and expressed WTP for the preservation and improvement of the site is in favour of policy induced increase of recreation charges in the site.
B21|Elasticities of substitution and complementarity|This paper develops a classification scheme of the many different definitions of elasticities of substitution and complementarity in the production case based on duality, gross and net substitution, elasticity type, and four different basic concepts of substitution and complementarity is developed. The classic Berndt-Wood dataset is used to show how the various elasticities differ. This variation is considerable and shows that the correct elasticity should be used for the intended purpose – there is no one true elasticity of substitution. The paper also reintroduces and clarifies Pigou’s contributions to the debate on the elasticity of substitution after seventy years of obscurity in which they have not been cited.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
B21|The law of indifference, equilibrium, and equilibration in Jevons, Walras, Edgeworth, and Negishi|In developing their equilibrium theories over the decade 1871-1881, Jevons (1871), Walras (1874-7), and Edgeworth (1881) made use of some version of a Law, called Law of Indifference by Jevons and Edgeworth and often referred to as the Law of One Price in connection with Walrasian economics. In Jevons’s theory of exchange, the Law of Indifference is a quasi-tautology playing a fundamental role in both the derivation of the equilibrium conditions and the characterisation of Jevons’s equilibrium concept. In Walras’s pure-exchange model, the Law of One Price, assumed as a postulate and lacking any proper theoretical underpinnings, is no longer confined to equilibrium analysis, as in Jevons, but is so conceived as to embrace Walras’s equilibration analysis, namely, the celebrated tâtonnement construct, too. Finally, in Edgeworth’s theory of exchange, the Law of Indifference, once again restricted to equilibrium analysis only, is made to emerge as a limiting result, produced by the joint operation of Edgeworth’s replication and recontracting mechanisms and associated with the unbounded increase in the size of the economy. One century after Edgeworth’s achievements, Negishi (1982) resumed Jevons’s and Edgeworth’s interpretation of the Law of Indifference as an equilibrium property; yet, parting company with Edgeworth, he tried to prove that the arbitrage mechanism underlying the Law is at work and fully effective even in very small finite economies. The aim of this paper is twofold: first, to reconstruct the various uses of the Law of Indifference and its variants in the diverse theoretical traditions originated by Jevons, Walras, and Edgeworth; secondly, to critically discuss Negishi’s attempt to revive Jevons’s Law of Indifference as a fully micro-founded and extremely powerful equilibrium property of finite competitive economies where arbitraging activities are allowed for.
B21|Negishi on Edgeworth on Jevons’s law of indifference, Walras’s equilibrium, and the role of large numbers: a critical assessment|In developing their pure-exchange equilibrium models, Jevons (1871), Walras (1874-77), and Edgeworth (1881) make use of some version of a law, called law of indifference (or principle of uniformity) by Jevons and Edgeworth and often referred to as the law of one price in connection with Walrasian economics. Edgeworth, in particular, shares with Jevons the idea that the law of indifference must be regarded as an equilibrium property; unlike his predecessor, however, he denies the validity of the law in all economies with a finite number of traders: for him, price uniformity can only emerge and a Jevonsian or Walrasian or competitive equilibrium can only be established when the traders’ number grows unboundedly large. About one century later, Negishi (1982) resumes the time-honoured discussion about the law, striving to prove that, contrary to Edgeworth’s original conjecture, a competitive equilibrium can be attained even in small economies, provided that the true driving force underlying Jevons’s law of indifference, namely, its implicit arbitrage mechanism, be allowed to operate and carry its effects through. In this paper, after reconstructing Jevons’s, Walras’s, and Edgeworth’s respective positions, we critically discuss Negishi’s critique of Edgeworth’s stance on Jevons’s law of indifference, Walras’s equilibrium, and the role of large numbers, showing that his central claim is unsubstantiated.
B21|Political Reservations, Access to Water and Welfare Outcomes: Evidence from Indian Villages|In a developing economy with an ethnically diverse society, such as India's, household welfare and its distribution within the household unambiguously depend on how much time each member of the household spends on productive activity. In this paper we examine the welfare impact of reducing the time spent by members of households, particularly women, through political reservations in rural India. Using a unique data set we find that (i) Political reservations and the ability of women to participate in the process of governance contribute to household welfare by allowing women to participate in labor markets, essentially because provision of public goods and in particular water, increases the productivity of household labor time. (ii) The concomitant decline in household work and increase in labor market participation is a robust indicator of increased productivity of household labor time being translated into productive work. In particular women participate in self employment and on cultivation. The effect on household incomes caused by members engaged in self-employment activities and own-cultivation is higher compared to effects caused by participation in off-farm wage labor. (iii) Further, our results are robust to the inclusion of residential location, access to credit, and shocks.
B21|The Agents of Education Market|The hereby paper is grounded upon an approach that considers education from the point of view of market economy adapted to the demands and the specific character of the educational system. Under such circumstances, we have drawn out this study through which we have elaborated an analysis of the main market components of the educational system. At the same time, due to the particular traits of the education market, we have displayed the part, influence, and action detained by each of this market’s agents.
B21|Scarcity, self-interest and maximization from Islamic angle|This paper clarifies some misinterpretations of three foundational concepts in mainstream economics from Islamic viewpoint. These are scarcity of resources, pursuit of self-interest and maximizing behavior of economic agents. It argues that stocks of resources that God has provided are inexhaustible. But important is the availability of resources out of stocks to mankind. Availability is a function of human effort and the state of knowledge about resources over time and space. In that sense resources are scarce in relation to multiplicity of human wants for Islamic economics as well. Self-interest must be distinguished from selfishness. The motive operates on both ends of human existence: mundane and spiritual. Its pursuit does not preclude altruism from human life. Counter interests keep balance in society and promote civility. Islam recognizes the motive as valid. Maximization relates to quantifiable ex ante variables. Uncertainty of future outcomes of actions makes maximization a heuristic but useful analytical tool. The concept is value neutral. What is maximized, how and to what end alone give rise to moral issues. Modified in the light of Shari’ah requirements the three concepts can provide a firmer definition for Islamic economics centered on the notion of falah.

B21|Impact of adverse economic shocks on the Indian child labour market and the schooling of children of poor households|This paper analyses the impact of adverse economic shocks on human capital formation in the case of India. It uses the extended theoretical model of Basu and Van (1998). The study has been carried out for the period between 1999 and 2002 and covers 385 districts. The results show that during a crisis, there is a fall in the school enrollment rate and a rise in the child labour participation rate. The study also argues that in the absence of a well-functioning credit market, to mitigate the adverse economic shocks on the children of poor households, the government must provide an incremental cash/in-kind conditional transfers to poor households with children.
B21|A rational road to effectiveness attainment|Operational effectiveness goes beyond efficiency while it incorporates exogenous variables, non-controllable by the service units. Effectiveness is a fundamental driver for the success of an operational unit within a competitive environment. In this context, we seek to identify the active units that meet both the high or technical efficiency and the perceived high quality criteria. We also aim to develop a roadmap for effectiveness for every operational unit and we consider the feasibility of the results produced by the effectiveness assessment process in the short run. The target values uncovered by comparative optimization techniques (e.g. Data Envelopment Analysis) for efficiency and effectiveness measurement generally have limited managerial implications due to production constraints, available resources, and legal status. This paper introduces a modified Quality-driven – Efficiency-adjusted Data Envelopment Analysis (MQE-DEA) model to assess effectiveness and provide a step-by-step path to achieve high quality and high efficiency in every operational unit under evaluation. The MQE-DEA model has particular applicability to the effectiveness assessment of homogenous service units in which an inverse relationship underlies the two dimensions of effectiveness embraced in this study (e.g. bank branches, restaurant chain stores, governmental one-stop-shops).
B21|Coopetitive games and global green economy|The paper aims at providing a Game Theory model of coopetition which addresses the problem of the global Green Economy. The Green Economy is a theoretical model of sustainable development. This sustainable development model should lead to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, determine the reduction of global pollution and the establishment of a sustainable and lasting global Green Economy, using mainly renewable resources. The paper applies the notion of coopetition, originally devised at microeconomic level, at a country level. The country has to decide whether it wants to collaborate with the rest of the world in getting an efficient Green Economy, even if the country is competing in the global scenario. The model provides a win-win solution, that shows the convenience for each country to participate actively to a program of sustainability and efficient resource allocation within a coopetitive framework.
