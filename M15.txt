M15|Procesamiento neuronal de señales de seguridad y riesgo online: un estudio neurocientífico|El incremento exponencial de las transacciones en el entorno web está siendo acompañado de desconfianza y altos niveles de riesgo percibido por parte del consumidor. Las señales de confianza online (sellos de seguridad, sistemas de puntuación o declaraciones de garantía) se han constituido como los principales medios que crean confianza en el entorno web. No obstante, no existe consenso en torno al tipo de señal que produce mayor confianza o la faceta del riesgo que ejerce mayor impacto en el consumidor (financiero, de resultados o privacidad). Este es el primer estudio que utiliza un enfoque multimetodológico (medidas neurológicas y de auto-reporte) para solventar ambas problemáticas. Los resultados sugieren que los sellos de seguridad son las señales que provocan mayor recompensa subconsciente, mientras que el riesgo financiero es el que confiere subconscientemente la menor aversión y valores negativos.

M15|Effect of Transformation Leadership on Innovative Work Behavior ? A case study of Thai Service Provider|Competing in an innovation-driven economy, firms are striving for innovation success in order to stay in a competitive edge. Employee innovative work behavior (IWB) is considered as a source and strategic factor driving organization to become more innovative and, hence to better perform. A number of literatures confirm the effect of leadership on employee performance. Likewise, it is assumed in this study that employee innovative work behavior should also be effected from the leadership of their team leaders. A transformational leader transforms how employees work and innovate. This transformation motivates employees to strive for the collective goals of becoming innovative organization. This study explore the effect of transformational leadership on employee?s work behavior and was carried out on a purposively selected sample of 260 IT employees working in a service provider company in Thailand. While employee?s work behavior was measured using 11-items measure based on the framework developed by De Jong and Den Hartog (2010), transformational leadership was measured in four dimensions; (1) idealized influence, (2) inspirational motivation, (3) intellectual stimulation behavior, and (4) individualized consideration, according to the framework proposed by Bass and Avolio (1990). Factor analysis and multiple regression analysis were carried out. The result suggests that transformational leadership has positive effect on innovative work behavior and could explain employee work behavior up to 26.7%.
M15|Cloud computing and big data in the context of industry 4.0 : opportunities and challenges|The global industrial systems have changed in the last few years due to great technological advancement in many fields. The Industry 4.0 concept has emerged in 2011 in Germany and later has been adopted and investigated by both academic and practitioners in many other advanced countries. Two main new technologies associated by and will have a great impact on industry 4.0. In this review paper, we shielded the light on cloud computing and big data. We present the possibilities and challenges associated with these technologies. The review reveals that sharing, efficiency in production and information sharing are the main possibilities of cloud computing meanwhile the security and privacy are main concerns. From other hand big data brings many opportunities like cost reduction, support the efficiency of decision making, however challenges related to large-scale parallel system and technical challenges still need to be addressed.

M15|The Effect of Big Data on Recommendation Quality: The Example of Internet Search|Are there economies of scale to data in internet search? This paper is first to use real search engine query logs to empirically investigate how data drives the quality of internet search results. We find evidence that the quality of search results improve with more data on previous searches. Moreover, our results indicate that the type of data matters as well: personalized information is particularly valuable as it massively increases the speed of learning. We also provide some evidence that factors not directly related to data such as the general quality of the applied algorithms play an important role. The suggested methods to disentangle the effect of data from other factors driving the quality of search results can be applied to assess the returns to data in various recommendation systems in e-commerce, including product and information search. We also discuss the managerial, privacy, and competition policy implications of our findings.
M15|Digitalisierungskompetenzen in der Führungsebene im Mittelstand|Die vorliegende Studie befasst sich mit Führungskompetenzen für eine erfolgreiche Digitali-sierung. Auf der Basis von Interviews mit der Führungsebene von Unternehmen unterschied-licher Eigentümerstruktur, Branche, Größe und Digitalisierung konnten drei verschiedene Kompetenztypen identifiziert werden. Diese verdeutlichen, dass der Unternehmenskontext und personenbezogene Merkmale der Führungskraft über die Zusammensetzung des Kom-petenzportfolios entscheiden. So haben Führungspersonen in größeren managementgeführ-ten Unternehmen mit einem hohen Digitalisierungsgrad eine breite Kompetenzabdeckung. Unternehmer, die kleinen und mittelgroßen Unternehmen aus dem Verarbeitenden Gewerbe und dem Dienstleistungsbereich vorstehen, erachten fachübergreifende kooperative Kompe-tenzen als bedeutsam, während die Unternehmensführung aus dem Handwerk Selbst- und Fachkompetenzen als entscheidend erachtet. Die Wirtschaftspolitik sollte diese Aspekte für eine zielgruppenorientierte Unterstützung des Mittelstandes berücksichtigen.
M15|Identifying leadership skills required in the digital age|Is leadership changing in an increasingly digitalised work environment? This question arises in corporate practice, societal debates, and in business management research. The evolution of digital technologies changes working environments considerably and creates new challenges for executives. So far, however, only little research has been conducted on how these challenges and technology-driven changes are associated with altered requirements for the skill set needed by executives. In this paper we bridge that gap by applying a three-stage research design. First, we develop a novel conceptual framework in which we categorise leadership skills and associate them with tasks, management level, and leadership experience. Building on this, we conduct semi-structured interviews with executives and systematically investigate job advertisements at the management level. Our interview results show that communication skills, subject-specific knowledge, self-organisation skills, and self-reflection skills are considered particularly relevant in times of rapid technology-driven change. Furthermore, many interview participants identify empathy and an open-mindedness towards the new as crucial personal traits. Our job advertisement analysis further reveals that executives need to be able to speak English, have IT skills, and be flexible, motivated, and stress tolerant.
M15|Statistical and economic evaluation of time series models for forecasting arrivals at call centers|Abstract Call centers’ managers are interested in obtaining accurate point and distributional forecasts of call arrivals in order to achieve an optimal balance between service quality and operating costs. We present a strategy for selecting forecast models of call arrivals which is based on three pillars: (i) flexibility of the loss function; (ii) statistical evaluation of forecast accuracy; and (iii) economic evaluation of forecast performance using money metrics. We implement fourteen time series models and seven forecast combination schemes on three series of daily call arrivals. Although we focus mainly on point forecasts, we also analyze density forecast evaluation. We show that second-moment modeling is important for both point and density forecasting and that the simple seasonal random walk model is always outperformed by more general specifications. Our results suggest that call center managers should invest in the use of forecast models which describe both first and second moments of call arrivals.

M15|In the Eye of the Beholder? Empirically Decomposing Different Economic Implications of the Online Rating Variance|The growing body of literature on online ratings has reached a consensus of the positive impact of the average rating and the number of ratings on economic outcomes. Yet, little is known about the economic implication of the online rating variance, and existing studies have presented contradictory results. Therefore, this study examines the impact of the online rating variance on the prices and sales of digital cameras from Amazon.com. The key feature of our study is that we employ and validate a machine learning approach to decompose the online rating variance into a product failure-related and taste-related share. In line with our theoretical foundation, our empirical results highlight that the failure-related variance share has a negative impact on price and sales, while the impact of the taste-related share is positive. Our results highlight a new perspective on the online rating variance that has been largely neglected by prior studies. Sellers can benefit from our results by adjusting their pricing strategy and improving their sales forecasts. Review platforms can facilitate the identification of product failure-related ratings to support the purchasing decision process of customers.
M15|A Homeowner’s Guide to Airbnb: Theory and Empirical Evidence for Optimal Pricing Conditional on Online Ratings|Optimal price setting in peer-to-peer markets featuring online ratings requires incorporating interactions between prices and ratings. Additionally, recent literature reports that online ratings in peer-to-peer markets tend to be inflated overall, undermining the reliability of online ratings as a quality signal. This study proposes a two-period model for optimal price setting that takes (potentially inflated) ratings into account. Our theoretical findings suggest that sellers in the medium-quality segment have an incentive to lower first-period prices to monetize on increased second-period ratings. The possibility of monetizing on second-period ratings depends on the buyers’ assessment of the rating system’s reliability. Additionally, we find that total profits and prices increase with online ratings and additional quality signals. Empirically, conducting Difference-in-Difference regressions on a comprehensive panel data set from Airbnb, we can validate that price increases are associated with lower ratings, and we find empirical support for the prediction that additional quality signals increase prices. Our work comes with substantial implications for sellers in peer-to-peer markets looking for an optimal price setting strategy.
M15|The Traveling Reviewer Problem – Exploring the Relationship between Offline Locations and Online Rating Behavior|Amongst the growing body of literature on the drivers of online ratings, the influence of customers’ local offline environment on their ratings has largely been neglected. This study examines the relationship between ratings made outside of a customer’s home area, i.e., when traveling, and the magnitude of online ratings. In line with our theory, we find that customers who rate while traveling give, on average, higher ratings than locals. This relationship is moderated by the posting time of a review relative to consumption, as travelers also post more positive ratings during or shortly after consumption compared to locals. Our identification strategy leverages panel data to control for unobservable reviewer heterogeneity and a clustering approach to mitigate reviewer-restaurant selection biases. We also investigate several additional factors such as travel distance, identification strategy of a reviewer’s home city, and the size of the home city relative to the size of the travel destination. Our results come with substantial implications for a business’ average rating and for customer decision making.
M15|Towards Platform Defined Business – Complementarity at the Spotlight|As markets become increasingly more competitive firms systematically move away from hierarchical integrated supply chains toward fragmented networks of strategic partnerships with external partners. Business practice indicate a growing number of busi-nesses relying on the platform organizational structures. For such constructs superior pro-duct quality and customer appeal maintain necessary but it is the breadth of the ecosystem of related product and services that has become a prerequisite for success. It implies the focus on third parties, complementors, who develop and deliver diverse content to plat-forms as well as enhance platform’s generativity. Although complementary relations should be the main reference while considering the network dynamics from different angles, the attention in the extant research gravitates toward inter-platform competition with platform owners as the central object. Thus, with the objective to contribute to the emerging lite-rature on industry platforms, this conceptual article discusses main challenges concerned with orchestrating arm’s length relationships with complementors, by departing from plat-form-owner-centered approach and focusing on behavior of interdepended contributors.

M15|The influence of entrepreneurial orientation on the performance of academic research groups: the mediating role of knowledge sharing|Abstract The objective of this research is to explore how entrepreneurial orientation (EO) contributes to explaining the performance of academic research groups through knowledge sharing. A questionnaire was used to collect data from 87 research groups (284 researchers) at a Spanish University. The relationships established were tested using 3SLS simultaneous equation models. We provide evidence in the present paper that the entrepreneurial orientation of research groups has a negative direct influence on performance, measured by the number of ISI articles published, if no knowledge sharing takes place between the group members. These results stress the importance of knowledge sharing in research groups in order to ensure that entrepreneurial group strategies (risky, proactive and innovative) are positive within an academic context.
M15|Diagnosing the Italian Disease|Italy’s aggregate productivity abruptly stopped growing in the mid-1990s. This stop represents a puzzle, as it occurred at a time of stable macroeconomic conditions. In this paper, we investigate the possible causes of this “disease” by using sector and firm-level data. We find that Italy’s productivity disease was most likely caused by the inability of Italian firms to take full advantage of the ICT revolution. While many institutional features can account for this failure, a prominent one is the lack of meritocracy in the selection and rewarding of managers. Unfortunately, we also find that the prevalence of loyalty-based management in Italy is not simply the result of a failure to adjust, but an optimal response to the Italian institutional environment. Italy’s case suggests that familism and cronyism can be serious impediments to economic development even for a highly industrialized nation.
M15|Austria’s digital transition: The diffusion challenge|Austria’s transition to a digital economy and society is slower than in other high-income small open European economies. The rate and pace of utilisation of eight main ICT applications shows that Austrian firms follow peer country counterparts with a gap, which has widened in most areas in recent years. Two dynamics drive digital transitions and Austria has room for progress in both of them. First, the potential for digitalisation in all firms, and especially in the smaller ones (where gaps are largest) should be freed-up by upgrading the full range of ICT-generic, ICT-specific and ICT-complementary skills. Second, Austria needs to make its business environment more conducive to firm entry and exit. The rate of entry of new firms and their growth are crucial for the diffusion of new business models and ICT innovations but fall behind peer countries. The adoption of ICT innovations by households also follows a staggered path: young and highly educated Austrians adopt ICT applications in similar ways to their counterparts in peer countries, while middle and older age cohorts display noticeable gaps. This calls for policies to help lagging groups become more acquainted with innovations. A whole-of-government approach, including large-scale utilisation of e-government applications in enterprises and households, should help to embrace change and facilitate the flourishing of innovative businesses, work practices and lifestyles throughout Austria. This Working Paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of Austria (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-austria.htm)
M15|The Impact of Customer Orientation on Quantity and Quality of User-Generated Content: A Multi-Country Case Study of Mobile Applications|This study examines preceding factors of user innovation behavior using a case of smartphone applications to examine indirect and direct effects of consumer attitude on user innovation. Specifically, this study focuses on two aspects of the user innovation evaluation: quality and quantity. Quality of user innovation in particular has the potential to contribute to the profitability of firms that provide SNS or other community services. This study proposes a structural model to examine the relationship between these two user innovation aspects and preceding attitude factors, involvement, consumer knowledge, and customer orientation. The empirical analysis is based on a consumer survey to examine commonalities and differences in two countries: Japan and China. In each country, two services are chosen as representative cases of the user-generated content business model to measure user innovation behaviors based on the two aspects mentioned. By clarifying the preceding factors of user innovation behavior, this study has implications for new business models and future innovation research.

One of its elements is the reorganisation of traditional ways of business management. Therefore, agile approach is more and more often one of the key aspects of building comparative advantage of a company. In this paper agile approach is understood as the capability of responding promptly to market’s needs. Purpose of the article: The paper aims at presenting selected research findings concerning the description of agile approach usage in organisations. The main authors’ objective is to present the way the transformation of organization is done or may be done with reference to agile approach. Methodology/methods: The paper comprises three parts. The first includes the results of analysis of literature concerning agile approach, where the authors make an attempt to answer the question: what are scientific studies in that regard? The literature analysis in that regard was conducted during academic internship at Shippensburg University, USA in 2016 and was based on the resources of its library. The second presents the findings of research done between 2005 and 2016 where case studies analyses of almost 50 companies in Poland and not only were conducted. In the last part of the paper, on the basis of the findings in the second part, the authors present a referencing process, which could in some cases increase the agility of organizational activities. Findings: The empirical studies show the differences in using selected agile activities for organizations from IT and other sectors. On this basis the last part of paper includes the referencing process, which in some cases could increase the agility of organizational activities. The authors are aware of the fact that the before mentioned referencing process is subject to quantitative verification which in turn will identify determinant of its usage; however, this is to be conducted in the next phase of research. In this phase the research of comparative-explorative nature as well as qualitative is presented.

These factors are important for banks to project how demand is likely to develop over time. After modelling the IB adoption decision across a sample of countries, we conduct a questionnaire amongst bank customers who include users and non-users of IB and set up focus groups, each comprising participants from a specific age bracket. Whilst generational factors do not emerge as significant in the regression models, the questionnaires and focus groups suggest that generations differ in their attitudes towards IT-delivery systems and choice of preferred delivery channels. In this way banks have to constantly ensure that their online product mix is appropriate to cater for such distinct needs, especially in view of the increasing competition from non-bank entities in areas such as payments services.JEL classification numbers: J10, M15, M31, O33Keywords: Bank Delivery Channels, Generations, Internet Banking, Malta, Retail Banking
M15|The Relationship between Female Representation at Strategic Level and Firm's Competitiveness: Evidences from Cargo Logistic Firms of Pakistan and Canada|The comparative study investigates the impact of various attributes such as feminine leadership style, gender diversity, and autonomy linked with the female representation at strategic level on the performance and competitiveness of the Cargo Logistic Firms in the contrasting economies; Pakistan and Canada. Previous studies offered limited insight due to unidimensional while this study takes multivariate approach, considering; variable of interest examined in terms of economies and gender. Cross-sectional research design following semi-structured questionnaire circulated among targeted audience by combining of stratified (probability) and convenience, purposive, and snowball (non-probability) sampling technique at layers of management. The combined sample size is 631 employees. The results showed that females prefer more flexible leadership style in comparison to males. Organisations having high gender diversity and female representation at strategic level are more progressive and innovative. Interestingly, in developing economies, rapid career growth chances are higher for females. Females are more people oriented while male are more task-oriented. Males have high desire for autonomy at workplace.
M15|The Mediating Role of Job Satisfaction between Transformational Leadership and Organizational Commitment within the SMEs of Karachi|The mediating role of job satisfaction between transformational leadership style and the organizational commitment within the SMEs in Karachi is the aim of this study. The correlation between variables is explored through quantitative methods. Total 190 respondents participated from 49 SMEs in Karachi. The results showed that job satisfaction has significant mediating role between variables of interest. This study confirmed that there is a positive strong correlation between transformational leadership and organizational commitment. Employees having high job satisfaction showed higher organizational commitment. Females scored more in comparison to males in terms of overall organizational commitment. However, males have high affective and normative while females have high continuance commitment.
M15|Risk management from the information security perspective|Risk management has emerged ever since the appearance of human communities and it has developed at a slow rate. Over time, a significant improvement was made, from accepting hazards to the identification, evaluation and control of unwanted events, threat prevention and exploitation of opportunities through scientific risk management actions. The fundamental role of research in cyber security is to concentrate the efforts on those contexts and conditions which determine the way in which key players reach a common understanding of the way to conceive and eventually answer to certain challenges in cyber security. In order to build a clear perception of these effects, this work presents the main elements which define cyber space, to come to the aid of turning the management process into an efficient one, especially when talking about cyber space as a space for conflicts, both economic and political.
M15|Transformational leadership, organizational commitment and innovative success|Transformational leadership is important for enhancing organizational performance. An inspiring leader positively influences employee confidence, attitude and self-esteem Therefore, this study aims to measure the association between self-esteem, transformational leadership and innovative success in the presence of affective and normative commitment. The sample size of the study was 397 and the scope of the study was restricted to the telecommunications industry in Pakistan. A self-administered questionnaire was used for collecting the required data. Structural Equation Modeling was used to test the measurement and structural models. The results suggest that self-esteem positively effects transformational leadership. Furthermore, transformational leadership has a strong, and significant effect on employees’ normative and affective commitment. In addition, normative and affective commitment positively influence innovative success.
M15|Financial Technology Transformation - Evidence from China?s Value Web|With the vigorous development in internet finance, the provisions of electronic platform service for online and mobile payments have become very popular in China. The internet finance has spurred the transformation and promoted innovation of the China?s banking sector, in particular under the policies support and encouragement from the Chinese Authority. At the same time, such development also brings new challenges to the Regulators. This paper examines the current status, regulatory challenges and development of the value web in China.Currently, internet finance in China mainly covers peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, third party online/mobile payment and online/mobile wealth management products. The value web has increased the financial inclusion and lowered the cost of entry for the public, which in return enhance user experience. With the advancement in technology, computing is getting faster and cheaper. Virtualization is driving up efficiency and utilization. Storage devices are growing in terms of capacity while declining in price. Delivery mechanism such as cloud computing also helps to lower costs and drive efficiencies. The internet finance business model is moving to Big Data application, banks expedite to draw close to both internet services and social communication network providers during the transformation process.Information technology has brought a new competitive agent and financial intermediate. Traditionally, banks are the confluence of financial information and fund flows. However, with opening on the operations of internet companies, information gathering and integration become more efficient, extensive and faster than those from banks. While chasing economic of scales, banks in the past have concentrated their resources to those big companies (the head) which can maximize banks? profit contribution. The ?tail?, those small and medium size enterprises with lower transaction amount but high frequency, is being ignored. This provides an excellent opportunity for internet finance to fill the gap. Thus, banks are facing the challenge on financial dis-intermediation during this wave of transformation.On the other hand, crafting enlightened regulation for the internet space, in particular, in relating to financial application is never to be an easy task. It is understood that the current regulatory framework may not be able to keep abreast with the exponential growth in the value web. In view of the challenges, a comprehensive review of the Cyber Security Law in China was conducted in June 2016. Regulators recognize the importance of technological transformation of the value web and carefully adapt the approaches to regulate this new ecosystem in China.
M15|A Study of Success Factors of Principle and Practice in Information Technology Risk Management|The purpose of studying the success factors of principle and practice in Information Technology Risk Management (ITRM) is initiated from the proposition that appropriate ITRM principle and practice can mitigate IT risks and losses which is a result of security threats. The literature showed that various general principles and frameworks are widely published but the established principle cannot be put into the practice. Additionally, there is a research study regarding the difficulty to maintain independent in identifying, reviewing and reporting tasks of IT risk and internal audit functions. The methodology consisted of the review of general principles and frameworks? documents and the interview from case studies. The general principles and frameworks in this research collected from the question ?Which principles and frameworks are applied to ITRM in your organization??. The question was asked to people in IT risk and IT internal audit functions from banking organizations and other industries which advanced information technologies are critical to the organizations. The content from first five applied principles and frameworks from the survey are Basel, COBIT 5 framework, COSO Enterprise Risk Management, ISO 31000 and ISO/IEC 27005 were reviewed. In addition, the interviews were conducted to the people in both functions from banking organizations regarding the success factors of principle and practice in ITRM in their opinions without guiding from the interviewer. The findings from the review of documents are eleven success factors that are general principle and framework selection, principle establishment, process design, structure of risk team, team?s expertise, complex level of task, interdependent level, risk culture, communication in organization, training and risk management?s tools and techniques. Meanwhile, the in-depth interviews? results showed that nine success factors that are adoption of ITRM principle, appropriate Process from ITRM Principle, task, interaction, adaptability, outsourcing, management support, conflict management and culture transformation. In conclusion, the success factors from both resources were compared and discussed as triangulation.The practical contribution of the research is that the success factors can be used as a primary check for the appropriation of current principle and practice, the exploration an intrinsic problem in both principle and practice on ITRM or the development stage. For the theoretical contribution, the researcher recommends studying various success case studies applying the principle and practices from various industries and classified the patterns by organization types which the information technologies are significant to their operation.
M15|Factors Affecting the Intention to Use the Intelligent Personal Assistant|An intelligent personal assistant (IPA) is a software agent that assists people to perform basic tasks or services for an individual, usually providing information via natural language. In spite of the versatile capabilities of the IPA to answer a user's simple information-based queries such as the weather and driving directions, the limited actual usage rates for the IPA services are reported so far. In this research, to evaluate the factors affecting the intention to use the IPA we develop the empirical model based on the technology acceptance model (TAM), innovation diffusion theory, and IS success model. Then, we collect the questionnaires from the actual users of the IPAs. Finally, the structural equation model validates the causal relationship between the constructs of the model. The major findings and suggestion for further research will be discussed in the conference in details.
M15|Research evolution in science parks and incubators: foundations and new trends|Abstract In this paper we undertake a quantitative review of the existing literature on parks and incubators to identify their foundations from a longitudinal perspective. To do so, we searched records in the SSCI database from 1990 to 2015 and identified 318 citing documents, which we split into four periods of 5 years each, to identify the interactions and path dependence that exist between different foundations of research. We evaluate the evolution of the theoretical foundations of this research line taking into account changes in citations over time. We also identify areas of future research closely connected with the theoretical foundations already identified. For this purpose, we used two bibliometric techniques—co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling—that enable us to assess the thematic similarity between scientific publications based on overlaps in their referencing patterns.
M15|Assessing Electronic Service Delivery in Municipalities|In the Netherlands, electronic service delivery has become an important issue in many municipalities. Using the Internet for service delivery is seen as an important element of e-government. Based on 2014-2016 panel-data of ICT service delivery for all Dutch municipalities, we show that there is a large variety among the municipalities in the extent to which they offer their service delivery digitally. We explore the factors that may explain the differences among the municipalities. Some trends can be discerned, most notably the strong relationship of e-government adoption with demographic characteristics, such as population, population density and both older age and younger age groups. Remarkably, we did not find an influence of educa-tion and income. Finally, we did not observe a relation between municipal allocated costs and level of e-maturity, hereby leaving the question open if and how e-government can lead to cost reductions.

M15|Erweitertes Management Reporting mit SAP S/4HANA auf Basis des Universal Journals: Realtime-Ergebnisreporting mit umfassenden Auswertungsmöglichkeiten durch die Weiterentwicklung der Financials-Funktionalität|SAP S/4 HANA schafft mit dem Universal Journal eine Datenbanktabelle (ACDOCA) welche die bisherigen Datenbasen für Accounting (FI) und Controlling (CO) zusammenführt. Damit entsteht eine einheitliche und integrierte Datenbasis (Single Source of Truth), welche die bisher notwendigen Anpassungen und Abstimmungen zur Herbeiführung einheitlicher Auswertungen und Standardreports (Single Point of Truth) überflüssig macht. Die vollständige Erfassung aller Kontierungen und Zusatzinformationen (Attributierungen) zum Zeitpunkt der Transaktion ermöglicht weiterhin eine sofortige Auswertung ('Realtime-Reporting'). Soweit rein transaktionsbasierte Informationen betroffen sind, muss daher nicht auf den Perioden- oder Monatsabschluss gewartet werden. Die Verarbeitung dieser Daten im In-Memory-Computing bedeutet gleichzeitig, dass die Daten jederzeit für Auswertungen zur Verfügung stehen und nicht in Datentöpfen wie einem Business Warehouse o.ä. zwischengespeichert werden müssen. Verbunden mit der enormen Verarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit werden damit den Nutzern entscheidungs- und steuerungsrelevante Informationen in deutlich verbesserter Qualität und wesentlich zeitnäher zur Verfügung gestellt. Die dargestellten technischen Möglichkeiten haben für die Unternehmen weitreichende organisatorische Konsequenzen. Accounting- und Controllingaufgaben rücken näher zusammen. Die Prozesse werden verschlankt. Die operativen Führungskräfte in den wertschöpfenden Prozessen (Vertrieb, Produktion, Einkauf) werden direkt und zeitnah aus den Systemen mit den steuerungs- und entscheidungsrelevanten Informationen versorgt. Controlling und Accounting werden als reine Informationslieferanten zunehmend entbehrlich.
M15|Modeling the Revolving Revolution: The Debt Collection Channel|We investigate the role of information technology (IT) in the collection of delinquent consumer debt. We argue that the widespread adoption of IT by the debt collection industry in the 1990s contributed to the observed expansion of unsecured risky lending such as credit cards. Our model stresses the importance of delinquency and private information about borrower solvency. The prevalence of delinquency implies that the costs of debt collection must be borne by lenders to sustain incentives to repay debt. IT mitigates informational asymmetries, allowing lenders to concentrate collection efforts on delinquent borrowers who are more likely to repay.
M15|Achieving Business Excellence by Optimizing Corporate Forensic Readiness|In order to improve their business excellence, all organizations, despite their size (small, medium or large one) should manage their risk of fraud. Fraud, in today’s world, is often committed by using computers and can only be revealed by digital forensic investigator. Not even small or medium-sized companies are secure from fraud. In the light of recent financial scandals that literary demolished not just economies of specific countries but entire world economy, we propose in this paper an optimal model of corporative computer incident digital forensic investigation (CCIDFI) by using adopted mathematic model of the greed MCDM – multi-criteria decision-making method and the Expert Choice software tool for multi-criteria optimization of the CCIDFI readiness. Proposed model can, first of all, help managers of small and medium-sized companies to justify their decisions to employ digital forensic investigators and include them in their information security teams in order to choose the optimal CCIDFI model and improve forensic readiness in the computer incident management process that will result with minimization of potential losses of company in the future and improve its business quality.
M15|Forecast Evaluation in Call Centers: Combined Forecasts, Flexible Loss Functions and Economic Criteria|Accurate forecasts of incoming calls are crucial to optimal staffing decisions in call centers. This paper evaluates a wide range of models and forecast combination techniques by means of statistical and economic criteria. Relative to the previous literature, this paper is novel in several respects. In particular, the statistical evaluation of competing models is carried out by using a fl exible loss function as input to pairwise and joint forecast diagnostic checks. Informative rankings across alternative single models and different groups of models are obtained. Moreover, models are evaluated from the perspective of a manager, who needs reliable forecasts to dimension the call center. Money metrics of forecasting performance are computed, which are based on the economic value of information and the certainty equivalent.
M15|Online Banking Acceptance: The Influence of Perceived System Security on Perceived System Quality|Increasing popularity of online banking systems instead of traditional branch networking requires understanding customer behaviors as users of such systems. This research aims to investigate online banking acceptance among Bosnian university students by considering system, user, acceptance and performance related factors by considering a new relationship between perceived system security and perceived system quality. According to the results, the users perceive that (1) online banking system is not secure and poorly qualified but useful and easy to use; (2) the users themselves are slightly capable of using the system; (3) they have intention to use the system but don’t use the system; and (4) they are slightly satisfied with the system and increase their benefits. The results also provide that all hypotheses except the relationship between perceived ease of use and intention to use are supported. Perceived System Security, as a new dimension, is found to have positive effect on Perceived System Quality. It can be implied that if the system is qualified and the users are self-efficient about using the system, they perceive the system as easy to use and useful. It is suggested that banks better take necessary steps to persuade their customers about the system security and usefulness in completing their tasks.
M15|De la science-fiction à l’innovation technoscientifique?: le cas des casques de réalité virtuelle|The commercialization of virtual reality headsets is an important technical, economic, and imaginary stake. Since the 1980s, artists have imagined the immersion of Humanity in virtual worlds thanks to headsets and haptic suits. This article focuses on two science fiction novels that have inspired creators of virtual worlds: Ernest Cline, Ready Player One (2010) and Neal Stephenson, Snow Crash (1992). The links between this imaginary and engineers are established, with a special interest on the specific use of technical imaginary by the technoscientific system. Indeed, this imaginary plays an important role in the construction of consumers markets, partly through an utopian products placement common to a lot of science fiction movies and novels. The question of the role of imaginary in the process of innovation of virtual reality technologies is central to understand how this technoscientific field works and stimulates leaders of imaginary.

M15|The Link between Information Technology, Activity-based Costing Implementation and Organizational Performance|Activity-based costing (ABC) is as a strategic tool that ensures accurate product costs as compared to traditional costing system. The implementation of ABC implementation offers useful information for performance measurement, cost control and strategic decision-making. Meanwhile, certain factors such as information technology (IT) determine the success of ABC implementation and its impact on organizational performance. However, past studies in this realm have neither been so emphatic in explaining the role of IT usage in implementing ABC in organizations nor examined the perception of employees and organizations’ decision makers towards the adoption of ABC. In addition, the government of Iraq and the Central Bank of Iraq has also issued strong recommendations to Iraqi banks to consider initiating ABC due to its influence of reduction cost. Thus, this study is motivated to examine the direct and the indirect relationships between IT, ABC implementation and organizational performance of banks in Iraq. This study surveyed 150 chief accountants of banks in the North region of Iraq. The data collected was analyzed using SPSS Version 21. The study revealed that there is a significant relationship between IT, ABC implementation and organizational performance. Also, the findings of this study demonstrated that, ABC implementation partially mediates the relationship between IT, ABC implementation and organization performance. Future researchers are recommended to consider other contingency factors and examine their effect on ABC implementation and organizational performance.
M15|Factors Influencing E-district Adoption: An Empirical Assessment in Indian Context|The purpose of this confirmatory study is to explore the factors influencing the acceptance of e-district services by the citizens inAssam, a North-East state of India. Taking unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), technology acceptance model (TAM) and TAM 3 as the basis, a conceptual framework is developed. The study uses semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and a questionnaire based survey through 166 valid data points to validate the conceptual framework. Moreover, the internal consistency of the scale items is checked with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient while the convergent and discriminant validities are checked with multitrait-multimethod matrix. This study confirms the positive relationship of “Perceived Usefulness” and “Facilitating Conditions” with “Behavioral Intention (BI)” while the expected positive relationship of “Effort Expectancy” and “Social Influence” with “BI” are found to be insignificant. Also, the study cannot find a significant negative relationship between “ComputerAnxiety” and “BI.”

M15|Retailers’ Responsibility towards Consumers and Key Drivers of Their Development in Poland|Multinational retailers are now very powerful and their activities could influence whole economies. In this paper, we investigate why they engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices towards consumers, how it fosters sustainable development, and what the role of institutions are in the process of developing CSR strategies. Changes that have taken place in Poland since 1989, when the transition process into a market economy started, constituted an excellent research field due to the fact that the retail market was not saturated at the beginning, consumers were only slightly protected by the law, and there were no institutions promoting the implementation of social responsibility standards by companies. Research involving analysis of secondary data drawn from retailers’ websites, CSR reports, and published data relating to the CSR institutions allowed the following: (1) identification of three stages of development in consumers’ conception of CSR characterized by the immoral, amoral, and moral management; (2) showing that these activities have a business case; and (3) explaining the role of institutions and competition in this process. It is also shown how multinational retailers could contribute to the sustainable development of less mature markets in which they invest.
M15|Strategy Implementation Style and Public Service Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Equity|Strategic decision-making theories suggest that organizations that combine rational and incremental strategy implementation styles are likely to perform better than those that emphasize a single style. To assess whether these arguments apply to the public sector; we explore the strategy implementation style and perceived service effectiveness, efficiency and equity of Turkish municipal government departments. Using fuzzy cluster analysis, we identify four distinctive though inter-related styles of strategy implementation in our sample organizations: logical-incremental; mostly rational; mostly incremental; and no clear approach. A logical-incremental and mostly rational style of implementation are associated with better effectiveness, efficiency and equity; with the absence of an implementation style associated with worse performance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
M15|The Functions of a Servant Leader|Servant leadership has been researched internationally and various types of favourable individual, team, and organisational outcomes have been linked to the construct. Different servant leadership measures have been validated to date and a clear distinction has been made between the theory of servant leadership and other leadership theories. However, it seems that research on the implementation of servant leadership within an organisation is still in need. The main functions of a servant leader are not yet conceptualised in the literature to help researchers or practitioners to implement servant leadership successfully within organisations. After conducting a systematic literature review, the main functions of a servant leader were identified. These functions were clustered into strategic servant leadership and operational servant leadership and supported by servant leadership characteristics and competencies as defined by current literature. The results of this study might help practitioners to develop servant leaders more effectively and assist organisations to cultivate a servant leadership culture within companies. Limitations and future research needs are discussed.
M15|Can Servant Leaders Fuel the Leadership Fire? The Relationship between Servant Leadership and Followers’ Leadership Avoidance|This study tested the effect of servant leadership on followers’ inclinations to strive for and, in contrast, to avoid leadership responsibility. Results from a study in the health care context, including two waves of data from 222 employees, revealed that servant leadership had a small but positive effect on followers’ leadership avoidance. This effect was influenced by followers’ implicit conception of an ideal leader. Specifically, servant leadership was found to reduce leadership avoidance when the congruence with the followers’ ideal leader prototype was high. Furthermore, followers’ core self-evaluations and affective motivation to lead mediated the relationship between servant leadership and reduced leadership avoidance. Implications of these patterns for theory and practice and avenues for future research are discussed.
M15|The Impact of Heavy Perceived Nurse Workloads on Patient and Nurse Outcomes|This study investigated the relationships between seven workload factors and patient and nurse outcomes. (1) Background: Health systems researchers are beginning to address nurses’ workload demands at different unit, job and task levels; and the types of administrative interventions needed for specific workload demands. (2) Methods: This was a cross-sectional correlational study of 472 acute care nurses from British Columbia, Canada. The workload factors included nurse reports of unit-level RN staffing levels and patient acuity and patient dependency; job-level nurse perceptions of heavy workloads, nursing tasks left undone and compromised standards; and task-level interruptions to work flow. Patient outcomes were nurse-reported frequencies of medication errors, patient falls and urinary tract infections; and nurse outcomes were emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction. (3) Results: Job-level perceptions of heavy workloads and task-level interruptions had significant direct effects on patient and nurse outcomes. Tasks left undone mediated the relationships between heavy workloads and nurse and patient outcomes; and between interruptions and nurse and patient outcomes. Compromised professional nursing standards mediated the relationships between heavy workloads and nurse outcomes; and between interruptions and nurse outcomes. (4) Conclusion: Administrators should work collaboratively with nurses to identify work environment strategies that ameliorate workload demands at different levels.
M15|The Criticality of Connecting People to Financial Results ? an ROI Calculation Model for Romanian FSOs|Organisational culture and employee engagement have been the focus of recent broad-based research efforts. Adding this concern to the revealed importance of performance indicators on human capital, and that their use is getting momentum, in order to attach financial values to knowledge management assets, it becomes more and more critical to measure human capital value. Key for Romanian FSO’s managers becomes to consider that both human and financial values have a focus on adding value in every process and function in the organisation, and to perpetuate organisational profitability by the corporate culture, on the one hand, where culture is a powerful factor that helps a company to engage, on the other hand, talented people. There is a substantial concern on using ROI on Learning and Development programmes, but whilst this is still declared, Romanian FSOs do not yet have a consistent method to measure it. This study is showing the criticality of connecting people to financial results and data analysis suggests that ROI calculation has a positive impact on creating and fostering a powerful organisational culture and that employees’ awareness of ROI values within their organisation has a powerful effect on their sense of engagement. Our findings have a more practical implication for the analysed industry by shaping a formal ROI measurement mechanisms blueprint, an ROI calculation model for the Romanian FSOs, in the form of a mechanism that could be employed when considering the design of an ROI Methodology for Romanian FSOs.
M15|Students’ Awareness on Information Security between Own Perception and Reality – An Empirical Study|The accounting profession is evolving aiming at responding in an adequate manner to the society’s requirements dominated by the IT insertion in all the aspects of the life. The IT knowledge and skills needed by the accounting professionals are increased and the accounting faculties are determined to respond to the new professional requirements. This paper discusses the accounting students’ awareness in regard with information security. The research performed emphasized the significant gap between the students’ perception on their information security awareness and the reality. The study revealed that the students’ computing knowledge is more technical and less addressed to information security issues. The research conclusions emphasize the urgent need for improving the universities’ curriculum in regard with information security issues and students’ training using information security awareness programs. The Romanian literature is scarce in regard with this topic. From this perspective, the present paper signals the need to deepen the students’ training process aiming at better preparing the students for the professional life and make them be more employable.
M15|The New Key Drivers to Improve the Open Government Performances: Some Empirical Evidences from Italy|Aim and scope of the paper is to demonstrate how an effective and efficient management applied to the Public Sector can improve the administrative transparency, an evidence – this last – now increasingly seen in the practices carried out by Public Administrations on their own websites. In adherence to the international literature on the issues addressed by the research, the work seeks to provide an empirical and theoretical answer to the following research question: is it possible to identify the presence of a potential correlation between efficiency and transparency, by a quantitative analysis applied to different Italian Public Sectors? . The actual contribution of the study is focused in emphasizing that the administrative efficiency – in a long-term perspective – can be considered not only a tool for the containment of public expenditure, but also a valuable means for improving administrative transparency. The empirical findings suggest the presence of a persistent heterogeneity of situations in which the most virtuous administrations in open government are those who for many years have pursued policies oriented to the administrative efficiency.
M15|The Interaction Effect of Accounting Information Systems User Satisfaction and Activity-Based Costing Use on Hotel Financial Performance: Evidence from Greece|The interaction of Information Technology (IT) and contemporary management accounting systems is an emerging research area. This paper aims at exploring the interaction effect of Accounting Information Systems (AIS) user satisfaction and Activity-Based Costing (ABC) use on hotel financial performance. We empirically test the above relationship in Greek hotel industry, because its highly competitive and information-intensive nature is characterized by the necessity for useful and accurate cost accounting information. Using hierarchical regression analysis, results suggest that when ABC use interacts with AIS user satisfaction, hotel financial performance is improved. On the contrary, AIS user satisfaction and ABC use have no significant association with financial performance when they act independently. This study fills a gap in the literature by developing a new framework that combines IS user satisfaction theory (IS Success Model) and contemporary management accounting techniques. Moreover, it underlines the role of AIS user satisfaction as an enabler of ABC. Finally, our findings extend the hospitality accounting literature, since empirical research on ABC is limited in the hotel industry.
M15|Considerations on the selection and prioritization of information security solutions|This paper provides a set of guidelines that can be used for prescribing a methodology or a detailed process for selecting and prioritizing security projects or solutions. It is based on the idea that costs of security solutions should be justified by their contribution to ensuring adequate protection of information resources in the organization which implements them. The article reviews general issues of security risks and costs, arguing the need for explicit consideration of information resources security requirements in order to validate decisions concerning security projects implementation. In such an approach, security requirements of information resources are used as a reference system to quantify the benefits and limitations of security solutions defined as alternative or complementary responses to certain security risks as their implementation faces budget constraints.
M15|Information security – a new challenge for the young and future financial auditors|The purpose of this paper is to inquire if the young and future financial auditors are fully aware of the impact that information security has on audit missions, focusing also on the responsibilities of the participants in financial audit missions, regarding the assessment of the risks derived from information security. To determine the extent to which audit risk might be influenced by information security, a literature review was conducted, that has focused on this current concern, as expressed by different researchers, professional bodies, Big Four companies and the regulators. In order to assess the current level of awareness regarding the impact of information security on the audit risk, 25 young professionals have participated to a survey and with their answers have proven that they realize the impact of information securing on audit missions and the necessity of having sufficient knowledge regarding information technology in order to identify the risk from the information security area which might affect the financial statements and the activity of the organization. Moreover, young and future financial auditors are aware of the fact that the audit profession will suffer modifications due to the changes in the information technology field, which will affect the approaches in audit missions and in this regards the financial auditors must develop new working skills such as understanding information systems and information security and possessing skills in analysis and data modelling. Besides the survey used, five auditors who work in Big Four companies were interviewed, in order to highlight the way in which the profession is adapting to technological changes, especially in the case of assessing controls of information technology systems and information security. From the results of the interview it can be concluded that within the Big Four companies, there is a high level of awareness regarding the necessity of solid knowledge in the information technology field. The paper is the first to examine the perception of young and future financial auditors from Romania, regarding the impact that the information security has on audit missions.
M15|Trends and priorities in internal audit|The status of the internal audit as an important pillar for corporate governance is recognized unanimously; however, this status is gained through a continuous and joined effort of all internal auditors and by a clear and solid vision of the internal audit function’s development, designed by the chief of internal audit. This status recognizes the internal audit’s support for the achievement of company objectives and the improvement of risk management and it also requires continuous quantitative accumulations in the work of internal auditors. From this perspective, the author’s attention focused on the main risks and priorities that the internal audit is facing as they are reflected by international studies and surveys. The conclusions emphasized by the author’s research may be considered important milestones for the improvement of the internal audit function in Romania and for its solid connection to the realities and problems the companies are confronting with.
M15|Factors Influencing The Intention To Use E-Government Services In Algeria: An Empirical Study| The purpose of this paper is to investigate about behavioral intention of an Algerian citizen to use e-government services and also to see certain factors effecting to use these services. The research model includes; subjective norms and behavioral intention to use e-government services have been developed based on the technology acceptance model (TAM), which is supported by the theory of reasoned action (TRA) and theory of planned behavior (TPB). The overall framework has been applied to understand the intention to use e-government services in the context of Algeria. Furthermore, there are two independent variables family and media, which influence through mediation i.e. subjective norm on the dependent variable of intention to use e-government services. The study used 300 questionnaires, which was sent to Algerian students, 100 respondents have replied, which is about 33% response. However, the findings of this research analysis have shown that, family influence has a direct, positive and significant relationship towards intention to use e-government services, whereas media influence is significant towards intention to use e-government services with the mediation of subjective norm. Consequently, subjective norm mediates positively in the relationship between family influence and intention to use e-government. Thus, the contribution made by this study is to provide further insight and a better understanding of citizens of Algeria to use e-government services. The study represents a guideline for establishing an appropriate model for e-government adoption of citizens’ perspectives.
M15|Human Resources or Information Technology: What is More Important for Companies in the Digital Era?|Background: Companies can improve their business performance, increase revenues and reduce costs by enhancing their information technology (IT) capability. On the other side, there is an increasing importance of human resource management (HRM) practices related to IT utilization, which are important for the business performance of a company in the rapidly changing knowledge-based economy.
M15|Diagnostic Analysis Of Electronic Commerce In Romania|The paper examines the evolution of electronic commerce by product group (IT, electrical and electronics, the art products, on food and beverages, textiles and leather on the distribution of information, cosmetics) in online stores. We conducted an analysis of the electronic stores regions, the volume of transactions counties. Delimit more strengths and weaknesses of e-commerce in our country, namely: online stores have specialized departments serviced by specialists in informatics, has implemented the Electronic System of Public Procurement, the number of online stores is increasingly higher, but there is a lack of a national strategy for the development of electronic commerce, the low level of e-banking services, limiting sales online in Romania. Electronic commerce is used by all walks of life, many branches of commerce presents developments described in the paper based on the analysis of statistical data in a positive trend, sometimes with large increases specific to the emerging markets.
M15|Customer Loyalty Using Customer Relationship Management|"Customer Relationship Management has developped into a major element of the business strategy of many companies and is based on creation and development of personalized relationships with customers to increase their profitability. A Customer Relationship Management strategy enables a firm organizational behavior rapid adaptation to changes occurring in the market and thus the company will be able to satisfy the wishes and demands much better clients. Managers of companies performing rationale ""is difficult to conquer a customer than to keep an existing one,"" come to support this research on the costs of these alternatives; those determined by winning a new client are 3 to 15 times higher by branch and product than those implied by an existing customer loyalty. Customer orientation means that everything that makes a company must be based on its care of you fulfill all requirements, whether internal or external customer, whether public sector or a non-profit organization. This should mean that everything is made-setting priorities, making decisions, participating in meetings or discussions with management - to consider customers requests and demanding . This paper aims to address system - Customer Relationship Management customer service perspective as the reason why there are organizations, organization and its leadership must adopt a customer orientation and to show more attention to its demands."
M15|Operational Risk & Cybersecurity|The impact of the Internet has had strong growth in the last two decades. The entire economy depends on ICT. The open and free cybernetic space, promoted social and political inclusion allowing easily interaction and exchange of information between communities and citizens from different countries. The Information and communication technology has become the backbone of our economy determining economic growth. Complex systems in key sectors of the economy such as finance, healthcare, energy and transport use powerful computer systems. Meanwhile many business models are built on the continuous availability of the Internet and the proper functioning of the informatics systems. The online environment requires high reliability, protection incidents, malicious activity or abuse. Cyber ??criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to steal critical data or economic espionage activities in cyber space. All these factors explain why governments worldwide have begun to develop strategies and act properly in cyberspace as an important international issue. The paper has a special goal, to approach informatical security segments concerning operational risks generated by the informatic systems used by regulated entities authorized / approved and / or supervised by the FSA.
M15|Digitalisierung, Online-Handel und Smart Production: Chancen und Herausforderungen für die Logistikbranche|Die Logistikbranche hat sich zu einem Schlüsselfaktor für die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit von Volkswirtschaften entwickelt. Denn die Globalisierung der Märkte, die Intensivierung der Arbeitsteilung in der Industrie, die die Verringerung von Fertigungstiefen verstärkt, schlanke Produktionsverfahren und eine minimale Lagerhaltung forcieren die Nachfrage nach logistischen Leistungen. Um Lösungen für die immer komplexeren Nutzeranforderungen zu finden, treibt die Logistikbranche ihre eigene Digitalisierung voran.

Internetplattformen bieten die Möglichkeit, Prozessinformationen zu vernetzen, und eine webbasierte Vernetzung der Akteure schafft Transparenz und erhöht die Effizienz.
M15|Management Of Tourism Transport|Undoubtedly, the relevance of transport activities in relation to tourism activities is essential, because it is extremely important and necessary to offer feasible information about tourism services to help consumer to choose the mode of travel to destinations ideal holiday. The methods used in the development of this hypothesis were explanation, exemplification (brief presentation of each mode of transport) comparison etc. Analyzing the current situation of national, European and World Wide tourism transportation, the paper proposes practical applications able to explain that the conduct of economic activities as an integral part of the sector of trade and services within a national economy, would not be possible without the involvement of transport, whether by road, rail and air and naval. The results of the analysis are perfectly applicable offering guests the opportunity to reach the most remote corners of the world in a short time, high degree of comfort and affordable price.
M15|Recommender Systems In E-Commerce Applications|One of the major problem with online shopping is finingd the right product, because finding the right product presumes that we know its name, but in most cases it is not so. For this reason the users need help in the process of online searching/shopping. Recommender systems have became a popular technique and strategy for helping users to select desirable products or services. In the past few years the recommender systems have changed from novelties used by a few big e-commerce sites, to serious business tools that are re-shaping the world of e-commerce. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of the classification of recommendation systems based on technology used to create recommendations, and inputs they need from the customers. Furthermore we analyze a few algorithms used by recommender systems and we will also present some marketing recommender systems and their comparative analysis.
M15|Cognitive Systems. Redefining The Cooperation Between Man And System|Cognitive systems appeared as a response to the real challenges brought by the Big Data phenomenon. It was found that the solutions for solving difficult problems caused by this phenomenon could be brought by using artificial intelligence tools. In this context a convergence between Big Data and Artificial Intelligence happened, which determined the start of a new stage in system development, namely the era of cognitive systems. The potential of these systems is given by the characteristics that differentiate them from other systems. The cognitive systems offered solutions and were used with success in complex projects from the medical and financial sectors. The architecture of cognitive systems is complex. These systems are designed so that they use artificial intelligence tools when processing source content, producing analytical solutions which can be used in the decision process. In this paper base concepts, the characteristics and architecture of cognitive systems, the benefits brought by the development and use of them were presented.
M15|Concepts Of The Reorganization Of Service Processes|In this article the literature based review of the developing of (logistificated) business processes and their reorganizations are shown briefly. The research of the service processes is also actual in our time giving work to managers and researches alike. In the narrowing market the increasing competition and the dominance of customers is a warning to the companies to carry out continuous rationalization and reductions of costs in order to increase efficiency. In this essay we would like to show briefly how we started our research primarily concentrating on technical literatures. First of all we concentrate on the improvement assets of processes. We will show some major tendencies in the process of Business Process Amelioration (BPA) evolution. The production focused approach of services can mean significant process improvement therefore it is a good analysis method of the process improvement.
M15|Estrategia e innovación en las Mipymes colombianas ganadoras del premio Innova 2010-2013|Esta investigación, de tipo exploratorio y descriptivo, tiene como objetivo indagar acerca de la asociación entre algunas variables de estrategia y de innovación, en las Mipymes colombianas ganadoras del premio Innova del Ministerio de Comercio, Industria y Turismo, en el periodo 2010-2013.

M15|Relación entre los sistemas de contabilidad y control de gestión y los sesgos en la evaluación y toma de decisiones|Resumen Los directivos realizan evaluaciones y toman decisiones que pueden estar sesgadas y, como consecuencia, provocar efectos contrarios a los deseados en el rendimiento organizacional. La identificación de los sesgos y sus causas han sido ampliamente estudiadas en la literatura de contabilidad y control de gestión en las últimas décadas. El objetivo de este trabajo es sintetizar los resultados previos, lo cual permite disponer de una visión más clara y comprensiva del papel de los Sistemas de Contabilidad y Control de Gestión (SCCG) en relación a los sesgos en las decisiones y evaluaciones. Como resultado se obtiene un marco conceptual en el que los SCCG se postulan al mismo tiempo como generadores e inhibidores de sesgo, en función de sus propias características y de las características de los usuarios. Este resultado permite que profesionales (especialmente los controllers) y académicos conozcan mejor los procesos de utilización de la información generada por los SCCG y así actúen en consecuencia.
M15|Factores contextuales implicados en la elección del sistema de información interno|Resumen El objetivo del presente trabajo es identificar los factores contextuales que potencialmente influyen o están implicados en la elección y eficiencia del sistema de información interno. La investigación planteada obedece a un estudio explicativo. Se centra en un solo sector económico, debido a que permite acotar los efectos derivados de las condiciones de mercado, del ciclo económico y de la tecnología de producción. El sector elegido ha sido el hotelero. Se concluye que el rendimiento de una organización depende del acoplamiento entre la estrategia, la estructura y el sistema de información interno implantado en la organización.
M15|Impacto del revenue management en los sistemas de control de gestión|Resumen El Revenue Management (RM) tiene por objeto prever la demanda de productos o servicios de la manera más precisa posible, a fin de poder establecer y adaptar las decisiones de precio y disponibilidad de productos, en los diferentes canales de venta, y maximizar la rentabilidad. El RM trata de maximizar el ingreso que puede alcanzar una empresa con una capacidad fija de fabricación de un producto o de prestación de un servicio; así, el objetivo es tratar de destinar la capacidad a aquellos clientes que aportan más valor a la empresa, asignándoles la capacidad adecuada. En este marco de actuación se suele aludir, constantemente, a la necesidad de generar un resultado, o alcanzar una rentabilidad, sin embargo a estos efectos sólo se toman en consideración los costes variables, y en menor medida los costes fijos, lo que nos lleva a plantear la cuestión ¿qué impacto tiene el método de cálculo de costes en los procesos de gestión de ingresos? Esta es la cuestión que conforma el objetivo del presente artículo, al identificar cuáles son las interrelaciones que existen entre la contabilidad de gestión y el RM, dado que ambas perspectivas son complementarias en el logro de un objetivo común, como es buscar la mayor eficiencia y efectividad económica de las operaciones desarrolladas por cualquier empresa.
M15|Leadership, Ethics, Prudence and Justice: Prudence Alone Is not Enough for Decision-Makers|It is not unusual for management researchers to take the stand that value judgements and, thus, virtues, are an unrealistic approach to management, because what is considered to be realistic is achieving specific results, which may be easier to obtain in the short-run if managers follow some rules not based on morality but on ¿facts¿ (i.e., empirical relationships between quantitative results and the actions taken). We argue that, on the contrary, virtues are crucial for competent decision-making, mainly if we take a dynamic, long-run view of the organization. We then analyze virtues, knowledge, and the relationship between them, to show the interrelationships between prudence, practical wisdom and justice. We argue that the unity of virtues, while it is a desirable end, may have to be acquired through practice, and that, for that purpose, justice has to be the main priority. Justice will then help to develop prudence and, with the other virtues incorporated as well, provide a better future for the organization in all its aspects.
M15|Integrating justice and trust in MCS: How to generate goal congruence and long term fairness coherent with the firm's mission|Based on the model and the concepts presented in Cugueró-Escofet and Rosanas (2013), that links justice in the MCS design and use to several states of goal congruence, we also incorporate the role of trust in managers as a crucial aspect of the informal organization. We are going to show that trust in manager is a consequence of the informal justice of MCS with implications for fairness perceptions in the long run. We specifically expect to be able show three consequences. First, that trust is a consequence of informal justice of the informal MCS; second, that trust and justice together generate effects in terms of goal congruence and long term fairness. We think that with this model fills the gap of existing research that looks at trust as a consequence of justice but also as a generator of justice, because trust is shown to have both roles: trust is as a consequence of ex-ante informal justice and at the same time, trust helps to enhance the virtuous circle of ex-ante justice and goal congruence to generate ex-post justice perceptions.

M15|Is Self-Regulation Sufficient? Case of the German Transparency Code|The German pharmaceutical industry is stepping ahead with its implementation of a new transparency disclosure code for cooperation between pharmaceutical companies and health care professionals (HCPs) and health care organisations (HCOs). In Germany, this transparency code (“Transparenzkodex”) is applicable since January 2015, and data will be publicly available around mid-2016. No empirical work has been done that addresses the impact of the transparency code on cooperation between HCPs, HCOs and the pharmaceutical companies, including the possibilities of competitive analysis of the available data. In this paper, we interviewed experts from 11 pharmaceutical companies representing small, medium-sized as well as multinational corporations which represent 80% of the German pharmaceutical market. Besides interviews, the authors designed a game to evaluate possible financial investments in key opinion leaders. The market can be regarded as a zero sum game. By allowing public identification of such key HCPs and HCOs, the amount spent on them might increase and not decrease. In a way, the transparency code may foster more and not less spending; in our simulation game, the financial investment in marketing key HCPs and HCOs exceeded sustainable limits.

M15|Advertising between Archetype and Brand Personality|The aim of the paper is the alignment of C.G. Jung’s (1954) archetypes and Aaker’s (1997) brand personality framework in the context of advertising. C.G. Jung’s theories had a tremendous impact on psychology. David Aaker and his daughter Jennifer are seen by many as the branding gurus. Despite the fact that both frameworks refer to persons/personalities there is no publication linking the two frameworks. Our research tried to fill this gap by developing a joint framework combining Jung’s and Aaker’s attributes and apply it by analyzing two distinctively different TV commercials from Asian hotel chains. A total of 102 Executive MBA students had to watch both TV commercials and then conduct an Archetype (C.G. Jung) Indicator test and rate Brand Personality (Aaker) traits of the two commercials. Results show that there is common ground. This has implications for advertisers who may want to specify an archetype and related personality attributes for their promotional campaigns. Game changers in the hospitality sector may want to be seen as Outlaw whereas established hotel chains may position themselves as Lover with personality attributes such as welcoming, charming, and embraced.

M15|Understanding Collaboration in Integrated Forms of Project Delivery by Taking a Risk-Uncertainty Based Perspective|Background: Cross-discipline team collaboration between the project ownership team, design team and project delivery team is central to effective management of risk, uncertainty and ambiguity. A recently-developed framework that was developed to provide a visualisation tool to enable various project procurement and delivery forms has been adapted to answer the research question How can uncertainty best be managed in complex projects? Methods: The research involved reviewing transcribed recorded interviews with 50 subject matter experts that was originally analysed using axial coding with Nvivo 10 software to develop the framework that the paper refers to. It extends analysis to focus on risk and uncertainty previously reported upon in that study. Results and Conclusions: The adaptation presents a hypothetical partnering and alliancing project collaboration map taken from a risk and uncertainty management perspective and it also refines its focus on coping and sensemaking mechanisms to help manage risk-uncertainty in a practical and ‘how to do’ manner. This contributes to theory by extending the relationship based procurement (RBP) framework from taking a purely procurement theory focus to being applied in a risk-uncertainty project management theory domain. It also provides a practice contribution by explaining how the RBP mutation to a collaboration and risk-uncertainty management framework may be applied.
M15|Value of Uncertainty: The Lost Opportunities in Large Projects|The uncertainty management theory has become well established over the last 20–30 years. However, the authors suggest that it does not fully address why opportunities often remain unexploited. Empirical studies show a stronger focus on mitigating risks than exploiting opportunities. This paper therefore addresses why so few opportunities are explored in large projects. The theory claims that risks and opportunities should be equally managed in the same process. In two surveys, conducted in six (private and public) companies over a four-year period, project managers stated that uncertainty management is about managing risk and opportunities. However, two case studies from 12 projects from the same companies revealed that all of them had their main focus on risks, and most of the opportunities were left unexploited. We have developed a theoretical explanation model to shed light on this phenomena. The concept is a reflection based on findings from our empirical data up against current project management, uncertainty, risk and stakeholder literature. Our model shows that the threshold for pursuing a potential opportunity is high. If a potential opportunity should be considered, it must be extremely interesting, since it may require contract changes, and the project must abandon an earlier-accepted best solution.

M15|Successful Control of Major Project Budgets|This paper differs from scientific papers describing current research. In line with the theme of this special issue, it challenges conventional risk management practice against the background of former research results successfully finished decades ago. It is well-known that conventional practice frequently results in budget overruns of large projects. International reviews document that. Severe delays of schedules are also well-known. This paper describes successful research results from almost three decades ago, which successfully challenges this severe problem and has led to new practices. The research involved is an unusual mix: Scandinavian researchers from psychology, statistical theory and engineering economy. The resulting procedure has been widely used since around 1990 and challenges conventional procedures. The procedure is documented to be able to yield statistically correct prognoses, when the “rules of the game” have been correctly followed. After a short summary of the basic situation, this paper summarizes the research, followed by some resulting experiences, focusing on two recent studies each of 40 infrastructures and other major projects. In both sets, the actual final cost largely equaled the expected project cost. This result is a marked change from international past and present experience. Finally, the need for further research and progress is discussed.
M15|Strengthening the Energy Policy Making Process and Sustainability Outcomes in the OECD through Policy Design|This study investigates the nature of the energy policy making process and policy priorities within the OECD in order to identify opportunities for improvement in these processes and to improve sustainability outcomes. The Qualitative Content Analysis methodology is used, investigating governance and energy policy making alongside energy policy goals and priorities within eight OECD nations. A congruous energy policy making process (policy cycle) is discovered across the assessed nations, including the responsible bodies for each stage of the policy cycle and the current energy policy priorities. A key weakness was identified as a disconnect between the early stages of the policy cycle, issue identification and policy tool formulation, and the latter stages of implementation and evaluation. This weakness has meant that the social aspects of sustainability goals have been less developed than environmental and economic aspects and a heavy burden has been placed on the evaluation phase, risking a break down in the policy cycle. An additional “policy design” stage is proposed including a sustainability evaluation process prior to decision making and implementation, in order to remedy these identified shortcomings.
M15|The Effects of Traditional and Electronic Word-of-Mouth on Destination Image: A Case of Vacation Tourists Visiting Branson, Missouri|The effects of integrated word-of-mouth (WOM), both traditional and electronic, on tourism products are yet to be fully investigated. The current study aims to assess the effects of and differences between traditional WOM and electronic WOM, between personal WOM and commercial WOM, and between positive and negative WOM on a destination image. Results of the study indicate that traditional WOM had a greater influence on destination image compared to electronic WOM. Personal traditional WOM had a greater influence on destination image compared to electronic personal WOM and commercial WOM. However, negative WOM exerted less influence on the destination’s image compared to positive WOM while negative electronic WOM had a greater influence on destination image compared to negative traditional WOM.
M15|Farmer-Entrepreneurs, Agricultural Innovation, and Explosive Research and Development Cycles|Private sector research and development (R&D) in food processing has seen a growing share of agricultural R&D. This paper analyzes market and technological links between farmer-entrepreneurs and food processing firms. It is shown that processing sector R&D tends to display explosive cycles. To avoid explosive cycles, the processing sector sets the R&D growth path and its target. Dynamic adjustments are related to the shadow price of R&D and farm output price. In equilibrium, the effects of increases in technological innovations (e.g., at the farm level, in public agricultural research, from entrepreneurial talent, in processing sector R&D, and in the price of final goods) on agricultural price and output are positive. The patent race does not affect steady-state agricultural price and output, nor processing sector R&D; it only reduces the opportunity cost of R&D.
M15|Challenges in Cost Estimation under Uncertainty—A Case Study of the Decommissioning of Barsebäck Nuclear Power Plant|Cost estimation is an important part of project planning. Over the years different approaches have developed, taking uncertainty into account in the cost estimation processes in order to tackle the dynamic nature of projects. However, when implementing these approaches, some challenges have been revealed. The aim in a cost estimation process is to establish a realistic overview of the total project costs and its uncertainties. Even though tools and methods for taking uncertainty into account are implemented, projects with cost overruns are often seen. In this paper we look into some challenges with the practice in cost estimation processes and identify possible improvements to overcome them. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate better solutions to some of the major weaknesses identified in current cost estimation practice. We use a case study of decommissioning of Barsebäck Nuclear Power Plant to illustrate how to overcome these challenges. First of all, this is an interesting case with challenges related to the project and the cost estimation process, given the complexity in the situation and that very few have experiences related to decommission of nuclear power plants. Second, we applied an approach that is not yet commonly used to develop cost estimates for this kind of projects. The paper concludes that it is possible to improve the results of uncertainty analysis of cost estimates. A well prepared process, with a suitable group of experts that go through a well-structured process, focusing both on risks and opportunities and using a top-down approach can compensate for some of the challenges related to cost estimation under uncertainty.
M15|The Effect of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations on Academics’ Entrepreneurial Intention|This work investigates entrepreneurial intentions among academic scientists. Drawing from the literature on entrepreneurial behavior, it contributes to delineate the differences in motivations that are correlated with entrepreneurial intention to those that are considered to be linked to entrepreneurial behaviors. By disentangling the concept of motivations in its ultimately basic constructs of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, we investigate how these two different types of motivations are related to the formation of entrepreneurial intention at the level of academic scientists. Through a survey conducted at the University of Ferrara—one of the leading universities in Italy in terms of technology transfer and scientific production—findings reveal that while academic entrepreneurial intention seems to be mostly driven by intrinsic motivations, the effect of extrinsic motivations, which are regarded as a main antecedent of entrepreneurial behavior among scientists, are largely mediated by academic positions, work environment and different combinations of these two factors. This work therefore highlights the importance of social norms in the investigation of entrepreneurial intention in academia.
M15|Drafting an Effective Ethical Code of Conduct for Professional Societies: A Practical Guide|Academic, medical, and research communities are struggling to quickly and effectively address unethical conduct within their professional ranks. Without a policy in place, individuals and institutes are subject to convoluted procedures and unnecessary consequences. In addition to policies geared to prevent harassment and assault, it is important to protect the ethical basis for research and provide a set of guidelines for how professionals treat each other, students, and trainees. Since drafting a policy of this nature is complex, 10 guidelines are provided as a framework for how to draft, implement, and establish an ethical code of conduct. Further implications for nonprofit societies and professional societies in particular are discussed.
M15|Investigating the Reliability and Validity of the Leadership Practices Inventory ®|This review explains the origins of the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI) as an empirical instrument to measure The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership framework, a major transformational leadership model. The essential psychometric properties of the LPI are investigated using both the LPI normative database, with nearly 2.8 million respondents, as well as reviewing pertinent findings of several hundred studies conducted worldwide by scholars utilizing the LPI in their research. Issues of both reliability and validity are considered, with the conclusion that the LPI is quite robust and applicable across a variety of settings and populations.
M15|Linking HRM Practices and Institutional Setting to Collective Turnover: An Empirical Exploration|The present study addresses the relationship between human resources management (HRM) practices and employee turnover by taking into account the influence of socioeconomic environment. Data was collected at company level with an international sample of 830 companies from 12 countries (Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom, Brazil, Switzerland, China, France, Italy, Poland, Germany, South Africa, and Spain). A division into four bundles of human resources (HR) practices is introduced: remunerative, communication, developmental, and well-being practices. The influence of the socioeconomic environment was factored in by including the institutional setting in terms of the level of coordination as a country-level variable. The results showed that collective turnover is related to both a country’s institutional determinants and to company HR practices. Remunerative HR practices may have a negative influence in terms of enhancing turnover, particularly within countries high in coordination. HR well-being practices are the most beneficial practices in terms of reducing employee turnover. Our study adds to our knowledge on the relation between HR practices and turnover from an international perspective. It complements the empirical knowledge on the effectiveness of HRM practices in a cross-national setting and supports the notion that the institutional context should be given more attention when studying HR effectiveness.
M15|What Is Public Agency Strategic Analysis (PASA) and How Does It Differ from Public Policy Analysis and Firm Strategy Analysis?|Public agency strategic analysis (PASA) is different from public policy analysis because public agency executives face numerous constraints that those performing “unconstrained” policy analysis do not. It is also different from private sector strategic analysis. But because of similar constraints and realities, some generic and private sector strategic analysis techniques can be useful to those carrying out PASA, if appropriately modified. Analysis of the external agency environment (external forces) and internal value creation processes (“value chains”, “modular assembly” processes or “multi-sided intermediation platforms”) are the most important components of PASA. Also, agency executives must focus on feasible alternatives. In sum, PASA must be practical. But public executives need to take seriously public value, and specifically social efficiency, when engaging in PASA. Unless they do so, their strategic analyses will not have normative legitimacy because enhancing public value is not the same as in some versions of public value or in agency “profit maximization”. Although similarly constrained, normatively appropriate public agency strategic analysis is not “giving clients what they want” or “making the public sector business case”. PASA must be both practical and principled.
M15|University Knowledge Transfer Offices and Social Responsibility|Numerous studies and reviews about University Knowledge Transfer Offices (UKTO) have been written, but there are few that focus on Social Responsibility (SR). We present a systematic review of the research on both fields. We consider not only logics from agency theory and resource-based view, but also the dynamic approach from institutional theory, as they aim to generate sustainable economic and social value. The evolution of Knowledge Transfer Offices depends on their role as brokers of collaborations among different stakeholders, according to their mission and capacity to confront the innovation gap. We follow the line of SR viewed as a response to the specific demands of large stakeholders. Building upon recent conceptualizations of different theories, we develop an integrative model for understanding the institutional effects of the UKTO on university social responsibility.

M15|Determinants of Academic Startups’ Orientation toward International Business Expansion|This study explores the determinants of academic startups’ orientation toward international business expansion, focusing on their technological capabilities, availability of public support, the regional characteristics of their locations, and the research standards of their parent universities. Using unique survey data on 448 academic startups in Japan and by estimating an ordered logit model, we find that academic startups are strongly oriented toward expanding their businesses internationally if they have strong technological capabilities, receive public support, are established in regions with a high ratio of exporting small firms, or are affiliated with a parent university with an excellent research reputation.
M15|Business Model as Relational Aggregator: Exploring Business Relationships|Bringing up services based on Information and Communication Technologies shows to be a complex process for everyone involved in it. Dynamic ecosystem of businesses participating in creation of the value proposition of the services requires a specific way of reasoning and simplified guidance to implementation. We discuss how industrial relationships evolve in terms of value dimensions, through a lens of a business model. This discussion has been done through four streams of literature starting from Activities, Resources and Actors Model and value literature, and continues through value networks and ecosystem literature, so as to round up in discussion on different views on business models. Out of this discussion a conceptual framework has been presented. On the other side, we present basis for the division of the analysis of services based on ICT into two different views and actually offer a table of separation of concerns (into these two views).
M15|Engineering the Digital Transformation of Marketing|In full process of continuous identifying digital opportunities throughout the whole value chain, marketing must better understand the difference between change and transformation, integrating people, technology and best practices, considering the social interaction accelerated by social media, and the already set triggers of the digital transformation, achieving step by step better customer engagement and improving customer experience while integrating it across channels. Under the continuous pressure of improving their company’s digital marketing efforts by using the adequate digital marketing techniques, they must follow the trends, including the emergent ones, doing the right thing about them, integrating digital and traditional marketing, enhancing knowledge of their customers’ needs, wants and attitudes, achieving a complete customer view, and delivering real-time experiences accordingly.
M15|Digital marketing capabilities in today's evolving digital world|Romania’s digital infrastructure makes it an attractive place to start a tech business fertile according to Quartz, but its pool of talented product developers need sales and marketing skills, learning the important lessons of best practices. Digitization is transforming globally the way industry functions from supply chains to production to customer experience, companies being forced to continuously innovate. Digital marketing capabilities have become one of the most important marketing capabilities. The Romanian users’ mobile internet consumption knew a considerable increase in the last years, while mobile telephony penetration rate is impressive. Globally, as shown by Deloitte’s Global Mobile Consumer Trends, 1st Edition, 2016, mobile proves to be indispensable in today’s always-connected world, and businesses must consider the key trends shaping the future of mobile connectivity. In order to advance on the way towards adopting the big corporate practice of mobile perfection, it is important to make practical steps. Other valuable researches revealed key insights in managing digital marketing activities, and key trends such as digital transformation moving from digital silos to integrated teams, considering the increasing talk of a need for a post-digital marketing world, without neglecting the challenge of integrating digital and traditional marketing. As it is not an easy task to apply the many digital channels and technologies to a business, it is worth having a better understanding of the core skills needed by today’s digital marketer.
M15|Challenges for digital marketing capabilities within the context of the main ongoing marketing management trend|It is well-known what a beginning and end for a digital strategy means, and to what are customers responding most positively, and also that there are new disciplines and innovations supporting digital business, and that there is a bridge between human and technology enabling new business models. As digital is a dynamic marketing function, there is a real need to build digital marketing capabilities, including digital strategy, social media, and mobile marketing activities, considering the impact on performance of digital practices, and understanding convergence of market-oriented behaviors associated with the usages and purchases of goods or services. And as digital transformation is the main ongoing marketing management trend, it is important to see not only how the growth within this transformation is fueled, but also the link between challenges and key drivers of this transformation, and to understand how to better approach the personalized marketing.
M15|Training & Development Barometer for Effective Transformation of Organizational Commitment and Overall Performance in Banking Sectors of KPK, Pakistan: Qualitative study of Workforce of Bank of Khyber|This research paper investigates the impact of T&D program on the level of employees' organizational commitment and overall performances in the Banking sector of KPK by considering Bank of Khyber as a case study. Study aims to critically examine all three attributes of organizational commitment (affective, normative, and continuance commitment respectively) and its impact on the job satisfaction in banking sector of KPK, Pakistan. The notions of Guest et.al, (2003) and Wall & Wood (2005) are taken as a foundation to explore the linkage between organisational commitment and T&D program, however both these studies had not investigated all three attributes in equal manner. The focus of these previous studies were more on affective and continuance commitment and did not investigate the causes and consequences that make these attributes to create an impact on the overall performances. Thus this study is significant because it attempts to explain in exploratory manner the reasons behind impact created by training. Inductive approach in a cross-sectional design following interpretive research philosophy research is carried out. The bank of Khyber, KPK is case study selected with 15 regional and branch managers as participants for interviews and 277 employees participated in the survey questionnaire, selected through stratified, convenience, and random sampling technique. Results of present study indicates that to retain skilled workforce, organization has to work on their continuance commitment by offering them promotion and salary increment because these are two factors that enable firms to retain skilled workers. Training increases employees' affective and normative commitment more in general as compare to continuance commitment. This paper contributes to the field of management and administrative sciences by investigating the relationship between T&D program and employees' performance and organisational commitment by exploring workforce and management's perspective through financial institution. It adds to the managerial literature related to T&D in relation with organisational commitment and overall performance in developing country's context.

M15|Leadership Best Practices And Employee Performance: A Phenomenological Telecommunication Industry Study|This phenomenological study explored leadership best practices among senior managers at a major telecommunications organization in to determine the perceived effects that such routines had on actual employee performance. The study took place in State of Georgia in the United States from January 16 to February 18, 2014 and involved ten selected managers who held the role of customer service manager for a minimum of 2 years and were identified as a top performer based on the ranking and rating reports from the organizationâ€™s data. The major themes that emerged centered around four major areas: (1) employeeoriented perspective of best leadership practices, (2) performance perspective of best leadership practices, (3) process perspective of best leadership practices, (4) learning and growth perspective of best leadership practices. It was determined that leaders should create a working environment where there is increased employee engagement and participation; communicate goals, gain employee understanding, and apply communication styles that fit the need of each employee at all levels; identify and plan opportunities of growth for employees through training and development; recognize the importance of personally engaging with their employees; and, understand the importance of having regular meetings to update employees about new products and services.
M15|Anti-Counterfeiting Technologies In Albanian Food Industry|European Parliament has taken several actions related to the authenticity of food, including the establishment of laws and standards. Albania, as a country that aspires to join the European Union, has implemented the legal framework to meet these standards. However, there is a lack of traceability in systems that will help food companies and the government fulfill these requirements. This paper shows a prototype where food authenticity is an integral part of a traceability system. The objective is to provide a combination of Quick Response (QR) coding with anti-counterfeiting technology. This is accomplished using encryption algorithms over mobile platforms. The prototype implementation in this way implies easy data access of for business operators, government authorities as well as the ultimate customer.
M15|Empirical Study For The Validation Of A Mathematical Model To Measure Corporate Performance In Manufacturing, Estudio Empirico Para La Validacion De Un Modelo Matematico Que Mide El Desempeno Corporativo En Industrias Manufactureras|In recent years there have been various concepts of improvement initiatives that promise results through superior performance. They create value for the organization. For this reason there has been increased interest in studying the process of implementing improvement strategies in organizations; Improvement strategies lead companies to align their strategies with performance indicators. However, there is little in the literature about how to optimize correlational models, i.e. models involving multiple variables simultaneously. The main purpose of this paper is to identify corresponding weights for the construction of a mathematical model capable of measuring corporate performance in manufacturing firms. We also compare the results obtained by applying multivariate statistical techniques to validate the model. Results show validity of the mathematical model was obtained, which makes possible its application in manufacturing enterprises
M15|Competitiveness And Supply Chain In The Productive Sector Of Valle Del Cauca, Colombia,Competitividad Y Cadenas De Abastecimiento En El Sector Productivo Del Valle Del Cauca, Colombia|Modern commercial dynamics implies constantly evaluation of models not only for negotiation, but distribution of the stock production. It involves establishing a categorical importance to logistics processes of supply and physical distribution, either at the national or international level. This research aims to characterize and visualize main processes or nodes that articulate the supply chain productive sectors of Valle del Cauca. We correlate this with obtaining competitive advantages in these sectors. From this perspective we observe that logistics remains an operational process of instrumentation supply or distribution. It is an active part of commercial positioning strategies of companies as well as a key element to reduce costs in the technological structure of the productive sector
M15|The Leadership From The Succession Process In The Mexican Family Enterprise, El Liderazgo A Partir Del Proceso De La Sucesion En La Empresa Familiar Mexicana|The most dangerous period that faces a family business is when passing from a leadership style that worked during the time of the founder to a new style practiced by the successor among brothers and cousins. The objective of this work is to determine a successor can evaluate his/her aptitude for the new post and which strategies should be developed with the aim to exercise a leadership that guarantees continuity and growth of the family business. To achieve the proposed objectives, we carried out field research. The survey was administered to 18 business second-generation family CEO’s in the state of Coahuila’s Center Region. The results obtained show that the majority of the interviewed affirm that they can comply with the formal requirements, but need to strengthen their ability to face circumstantial proofs and to overcome political tests. We present some strategies that allow the successors to exercise a leadership suitable to the organizational and family circumstances that are confronted with by succession
M15|Implementation Of The Electronic Invoice In Trade And Services Sector In Mexico. Evidence Of Trade And Services Sector, Impacto De La Implementacion De La Factura Electronica En Las Mipymes Del Sector Comercio Y Servicios En Mexico|Small business are important in the economy of many countries for their contribution to job creation and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Therefore, it is imperative and desirable that small businesses improve, update or implement the use of Information Technology and Communication (TIC´s). In 2014, changes were introduced to the Tax Administration System (SAT) in Mexico which requires the use of electronic invoicing for all taxpayers. The new requirement imposes challenges to companies that have not incorporated the use of the TIC´s in their business practices. Thus, we conducted an exploratory and descriptive study of 100 small business in the trade and services sector in Mexico to evaluate their perception of the process of implementing electronic invoice in their company, the use of TIC' s in their business activities and to assess their level of TIC competencies
M15|The Smes And Their Digital Preparation: Guanajuato (Mexico) Study Case, Las Pymes Y La Preparacion Digital: El Caso De Guanajuato, Mexico|Guanajuato state is encountering the challenge of having among the best economic growth among the Mexican Republic States in the past three years. The state government predicts sustainable growth within the next years and that during this administration period 2012-2018, MSMEs will be consolidated. It is for this reason that MSMEs will require a set of tools such as the ICTs to accomplish their target growth and brand positioning. We establish wo goals for this paper. The first is to determine if the level of Digital Preparation DP at the SMEs is influenced by internal indicators POER and external indicators PEER. The second is to determine if SMEs from Guanajuato State are digitally prepared to encounter changes imposed by a globalized economy. All of this is done using a methodology of descriptive, correlational and linear regression type over a random and stratified sample of 677 economic units of the most representative cities in the state. The results indicate that both POER and PEER influence the Digital Preparation of companies. Unfortunately, SMEs are still on a initialization phase. This means that for the Stateâ€™s Government to fulfill their expectations, they must meet challenges. They face the challenge that SMEs achieve sufficient grade of consolidation on their DP so they can meet any changes imposed by the worldâ€™s globalized economy.

M15|Teleworking in the new milleneum|The success of telecommuting adoption depends on many factors, including the employee’s openness and readiness for such a work arrangement, the company’s openness and desire to take advantage of such a model, and an information and communication technology infrastructure that can enable its success. Telecommuting, which originated in the 1970s as a response to the oil crisis and concerns over employees’ potential inability to travel to and from the office, has involved employees completing work outside the traditional working office environment. Recent advancements in information and communication technologies enabled this form of employment relationship to become a viable alternative to traditional offices, leading to cost advantages to employees and employers, improving the environment, working motivation and thus leading to increased adoption (Turetken et al., 2011). Yet, despite the potential advantages of telecommuting, the adoption of this working model has been slower than initially predicted due to many mitigating factors (Pyöriä, 2011). These deterrents may include traditional corporate cultures that may not support a non-traditional employment relationship due to risks of relinquishing power, misunderstandings of cost value, personal preferences in terms of work/life balance and work schedule flexibility, regulatory concerns related to liability and intellectual property rights associated with working outside the traditional office (Calvasina, et al. 2012), and overall control over legal liabilities (Genova, 2010). This research, which builds upon earlier work, aims to look at the various factors related to teleworkers’ experience and the effect on teleworkers’ success in terms of satisfaction, performance, and productivity. The theoretical framework adopted for evaluating these relationships is Human Capital Theory, which suggests that direct experience improves employee productivity, thus leading to increased capital value. Evidence for this study is non-experimental and quantitative in nature using the same research instrument used previously for measuring success. A web-based distribution method has been used to gather responses from a wide variety of United States based employees across multiple industries, age groups, and an even mix of genders. Therefore, evidence presented in this paper comes from the collection and analysis of a total of 406 usable survey responses. The finding provides insight into the effect of teleworking experience on employee success. Two factors in particular, gender and technology in particular, were aggregated and may be of interest for future study. This research is the first in terms of evaluating teleworking-specific experience and evaluating the effect of teleworking success by using the framework of human capital.
M15|The conceptual framework of the factors influencing consumer satisfaction in social commerce|The twentieth century has seen enormous changes in the field of Information Communication Technology (ICT) and that change will continue into the future, as well. When Web 2.0 tools appeared, people had the opportunity to interact with each other on the internet and helped to create a new stream with different functions. This stream called Social commerce (SC) which is defined as an extension of Business to Customer (B2C) e-commerce where consumers can interact with each other to conduct online shopping activities and discuss their experiences and preferences on products and services. Virtually all of the previous research on SC focus on behavioral and purchase intentions. In addition, there are many theories that can provide a better understanding of the satisfaction in SC. For instance, the theory of social interaction (Liang & Turban 2011) and the theory of social process (Amblee & Bui 2011) can both help in understanding consumer behaviors. In addition, the motivation theory might help in understanding why people use SC as well as how intrinsic and extrinsic motivations carry on in SC (Liang & Turban 2011). Although these studies have reviled promising findings, questions remain concerning what factors affect consumers’ satisfaction, which are yet to be answered. Therefore, this study aims to develop a theoretical framework using Trust and Social Influence theories to investigate the influencing factors on customer satisfaction in social commerce. Investigating the theoretical framework of this study would provide theoretical evidence and help businesses and individuals to better understanding the factors that affect consumer satisfaction in SC.

M15|Analysis About The European Shipping And Payment Trends 1975 – 2015|In shipping, more than in other economic sectors, changing trends are very frequent, because of the specific dynamic of markets. The freight rates and second hand prices in the dry bulk market seem to be stationary. This result is in contrast to the findings of a number of papers. However, the results confirm that classical shipping market was stationary in freight rates, which is not the case, if the freight rates followed a random walk. By transforming, all observations, from US$, to Japanese yen, showed that freight rates and prices saw to become stationary and volatility, reduced.
M15|Website quality and performance indicators including ratio numbers – A study of German and Danish SME companies|We expect economic benefits from companies with good company websites. However, only little is known about the real effects of good websites on company success. Based on data about 1,000 small and medium-sized European production companies in Germany and Denmark a study is conducted in order to uncover correlations between economic indicators and the quality of company websites. The set of performance indicators for the companies are extracted from the ORBIS company database. The website quality data are obtained through a criteria-based evaluation method. A set of multivariate analyses of the data are performed using the Pearson method and the Spearman method. These analyses also include investigations for the constituent parts of indicators that are ratio numbers. At the country level, it turns out that in some areas the Danish companies outperform the German companies. Also the obtained results show that there exists a correlation between the website quality and the number of employees. A yet insignificant correlation between website quality and the ratio number ‘financial gearing’ is revealed, too. However, when decomposing ‘financial gearing’ into its constituent parts, bivariate correlation analyses with the constituent parts lead to highly significant correlations.
M15|A Conceptual Culture Model for Design Science Research|The aim of design science research (DSR) in information systems is the user-centred creation of IT-artifacts with regard to specific social environments. For culture research in the field, which is neces-sary for a proper localization of IT-artifacts, models and research approaches from social sciences usual-ly are adopted. Descriptive dimension-based culture models most commonly are applied for this pur-pose, which assume culture being a national phenomenon and tend to reduce it to basic values. Such models are useful for investigations in behavioural culture research because it aims to isolate, describe and explain culture-specific attitudes and characteristics within a selected society. In contrast, with the necessity to deduce concrete decisions for artifact-design, research results from DSR need to go beyond this aim. As hypothesis, this contribution generally questions the applicability of such generic culture dimensionsâ€™ models for DSR and focuses on their theoretical foundation, which goes back to Hofstedeâ€™s conceptual Onion Model of Culture. The herein applied literature-based analysis confirms the hypothesis. Consequently, an alternative conceptual culture model is being introduced and dis-cussed as theoretical foundation for culture research in DSR.
M15|The Formalization of a Generic Trading Company Model Using Software Agents as Active Elements|Business environment simulation often requires unique knowledge based on the modeler’s experience. However, even experience based simulation models need some extent of abstraction and formalization in order to achieve results that are expected. Business process simulation models usually incorporate several essential components such as the model of trading functions that reflect customer behavior, procurement functions for modeling company inputs and the optimization of production & logistics functions. When modeling management decisions, a management function model with a loopback to company economic outputs is also needed. As a solid foundation of such complex business simulations, an abstract multi-agent architecture of a trading company model is proposed. The abstract model is inhabited with active entities – software agents and a method of registering their actions in a simulation run log is proposed. This approach combines the basic notions of abstract agent archi tectures with process mining methodology. Finally, the correctness of our software-agent system is verified and a validation is provided showing that the proposed system fits the real data company outputs.
M15|XBRL â€“ The business Language in the Digital Age|In many areas of activity, the passage to the digital support for documents or, more broadly, for information consisted only in the simple replacement of the old documents from classic paper size in text files. Normally, this allowed a considerable economy of paper, allowed archiving and dissemination of these documents, and to some extent even facilitated the search for data. However a whole host of other benefits of the digitalization of information have remained unexploited. Thus, unlike a specific search where it would be indicated exactly the search criteria must be fully read all the documents available when among them are searched only those documents of interest at a time. This happens because the data contained in these files, although they are â€œdigitizedâ€ , are not sufficiently â€œmarkedâ€ to be able to be handled by the information processing tools, the manual intervention of the human user remaining, under these circumstances, unavoidable.

M15|Quality Work-Life as predictor to Organisational Commitment under contrasting Leadership Styles: I.T Responses from Pakistan's private software houses|This study investigate the dimensions of organisational commitment under transformational and transactional leadership style while considering the attributes of Quality Work-life prevailing in Pakistan's private software houses. Theoretical framework is developed by considering studies commenced in last three decades on similar topic. This study considers positivist paradigm with objective epistemology, realism ontology, and hyopthetico-deductive quantitative method to explore the relationship between research variables. The sample size for study is 408 participants from 10 mega cities of Pakistan through combining probability and non-probability sampling technique. Self-administered survey questionnaire was circulated through HR department of targeted firms. Results showed that transformational leadership has strong significant relationship with all dimensions of organisational commitment whereas transactional leadership has positive relationship with affective and continuance commitment. Employees prefer transformational leadership style and their level of commitment is driven by existing QWL programme. This paper contributes to expansion of body of knowledge regarding QWL and organisational commitment under considered leadership styles in developed economies. This paper is unique in terms of strategic approach such as deductive quantitative approach under scientific paradigm.
M15|The Balanced Scorecard and Beyond – Applying Theories of Performance Measurement, Employment and Rewards in Management Accounting Education|This study applies the prevailing scholarly theories of strategic management, employment decisions, cost accounting and share reward schemes to a panel of questions raised by Colin Drury (2012) in the case study of the fictitious company Integrated Technology Services (UK) Ltd., ITS (UK). The paper provides model answers which can be used when working with the case study at institutions of higher education. The merit of the work lies in three areas. First, it provides an overview of theories accepted by the academia that can be utilized for further research. Second, it contrasts pro and contra arguments. Thus it shows the limitations of the very theories when applied to scenarios inspired by practical problems. Third, it develops an innovative Balanced Scorecard for ITS (UK). The scorecard can be used as an example when working with Drury’s case study. But it is also suitable for real life situations of business entities faced with oppressive overheads and deteriorating net margins, building on highly skilled workforce and trying to preserve its differentiated profile.
M15|Innovación y emprendedurismo: Ordenando el rompecabezas de la Nueva Gestión Empresarial de la Innovación<BR>[Innovation and entrepreneurship: Sorting the puzzle of the New Business Management of Innovation]|This essay aims to clarify the puzzle of new principles and techniques in the field of business management of innovation. These new principles and techniques were born in a widely-connected world with an increasing presence of startups and innovative companies in order to meet pervasive market uncertainty and facilitate implementation of “new-to-market” innovations. The focus is placed on the implications for competitive strategy and business management of innovation. Instead of drawing on Schumpeterian concepts, we use the modern notion of “disruptive” innovations (those upsetting the rules of the game and old structures in a business or industry), as well as the principles and techniques recently developed to approach the uncertainties and costs of innovations: customer development and lean startup. We compare two paradigmatic styles of innovation: the startups’ stereotype (the American style) and that of “innovation transfer” (German-European style). Then, we discuss the main orientations of innovation policy with regard to the new industrial initiatives (Industry 4.0 in Germany and Europe and advanced manufacturing in USA) and their counterpoint of startups' innovating creativity across a connected world at the edge of an information revolution.

M15|Millennials and Over-the-Top-Services in the Context of Transformation of Telecommunication Business: Evidence from the Czech Republic|The relationship between telecommunication companies and over-the-top (OTT) services such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, iMessage has been receiving increasing attention over the past years. These services are especially popular among young consumers born between 1980 and 1996, also known as the Millennials. The goals of this article are to provide a comprehensive overview of the transformation of telecommunication business in the Czech Republic and to capture the habits and preferences of consumers in using OTT services on their mobile devices, as well as their satisfaction level with the current telco services that they possess. Using a survey among 289 young Czech consumers conducted at the beginning of 2016, we provide findings that can be used by telecommunication operators as well as OTT provides to adapt their business strategy to the habits and preferences of their current or potential customers.
M15|Formal Assessments, Teams and Influence of a Project Champion in the Selection of ICT Projects: A Czech Republic and UK Study|We present and critically examine the links between the role of formal appraisal procedures, appraisal teams, and project champions and their influence in the selection of information communication technology projects in the Czech Republic and the UK. Our research is empirical and uses comparative analysis and exploratory descriptive analysis to interpret the findings. We draw on the economic, management and consensus-performance literature, and optimism bias theory to support our research. Our findings show significant differences in the practices between the Czech Republic and the UK, which we believe are the result of cultural and economic diversities. There is a high level of involvement of a project champion in the selection of projects with concern being expressed over their excessive/biased influence in the decision-making process. An important fi nding from our research reveals that adopting clearly defined appraisal/selection procedures may reduce this biased influence. As project failure can result from the influence of a project champion at the project selection stage, it is important to fill this perceived gap in the literature. The research is the only empirical study of its kind conducted simultaneously in the Czech Republic and the UK.
M15|Vývoj mezd a příjmové nerovnosti u ICT odborníků v České republice<BR>[Wages Development and its Non-Equality by ICT Professionals in The Czech Republic]|This article analyses wages development in the Czech Republic since 2000 to 2014. Analysis is principal focused on ICT Professional’s (this group of employees in the economy is split into two sub groups ICT Specialists and ICT technicians) wages and its comparison to the wages in the whole Czech economy. Used data sources were collected by Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of the Czech Republic, in the “Information System of Average Earnings” which is harmonized with the “Structure of Earnings Survey“ provided by Europen Union. Analysis is provided by ICT sub groups and by gender. For more detail analysis, is also the percentile analysis of ICT job groups in comparison to the whole Czech economy presented. Contribution of ICT Professional’s average wage to the average wage of the Czech economy increased from 0.43% in 2000 to 1.32% in 2014. The long term trend in wages of ICT Professionals in permanently increasing. Wages for ICT Specialists are significant higher then wages of ICT Technicians. The non-equality in wages is analysed by method of Gini index. This method is demonstrated by the development of GINI index for ICT Professionals and its comparison to Gini index of the whole Czech economy. Comparison shows that non equality is lower by ICT Professionals then in the Czech economy and from two job groups in ICT is the lower non equality for ICT Technicians group then for ICT Specialists.
M15|Tomorrow’s Paradox: Refining Knowledge by Smarter Information and Communications Technologies while Humans Tend to Become a Limited Factor of Performance|The paper analyzes some challenges of the exponential development ofInformation and Communications Technologies (ICT)in the Information society (IS) toward Knowledge Based Society (KBS), focusing on the premises of strange evolutions of the inherent interactions between humans and ICT smart machines along the complex and dynamic processes of generating knowledge and refining knowledge, caused by the natural limits of humans. The analysis reveals the detailed mechanisms which could lead to abnormal or paradox situations when ICT smart machines could/should replace humans. The paradox could appear when using such new technologies to replace human in order to avoid the consequences of routine stress, fatigue but especially the lack of responsibility in specific applications. Also, the analysis approaches the main consequence of “data deluge” (overwhelming data“products”), as for an optimal efficiency for IS/KBS, all these “products” of ICT must be highly “processed” in order to provide useful knowledge and eventually refined knowledge, but, naturally, the analysis try to answer to the question to what extent smart machines could/should replace humans. The paper main conclusion is that the paper title (Tomorrow’s paradox ...) is intended to generate an alarm signal about the abnormal situation where humankind is almost arrived, as we have to create such “smart machines” which could help us to get knowledge and refined knowledge designated to fight against ourselves, i.e. to avoid the consequences of a large diversity of aberrant behaviour generated by the average person or exception individuals.
M15|Information And Communications Technologies Go Greener Beyond Iot- Behind Is All The Earth|The paper is approaching the systemic analysis of the context of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) exponential evolution, as driving power of the transformation of the Information society (IS) toward Knowledge Based Society (KBS), foccusing on a smart management of ICT/IS/KBS evolution, where the essential is to deeply analyze, update the solutions, refine knowledge and responsibly react to challenges/implications, in order to correct the negative consequences of such complex and mass processes at Earth scale. The analysis approached the actual point of ICT development, dominated by Cloud Computing, Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT), starting from the premises created by “COPs21” Paris Conference context including ICT latest figures on carbon footprint and IoT emergent expansion – which show that Internet traffic is increasing with 40% / year, which would lead, without corrections, as ICT could consume in 10 years 60 percent of the Earth’s energy production. The author opinion is that the actual “machine” trend, focussed on striving for performance, must be balanced by a greener approach aiming power efficiency and carbon footprint reduction, including a concrete approach based on relevant issues as: Identifying incertitude/risk complex and complicated mechanisms, generated by the exponential speed of ICT development in IS/KBS and generally on Earth ecosystem; Developing greener ICT capable to induce greener solutions in all fields of activity; Designing new integrated models, algorithms and technologies for information analysis to cope with all consequences of IoT, Cloud computing, Big Data. The paper main conclusions include the priority to fight the main difficulties generated by the extreme speed of changes induced by ICT exponential pace of development, which create such complex consequences but does not allow humankind the necessary time to real time react, with the immediate approach of this “impossible” mission as being twofold: rethink and adapt (slow) the ICT pace and on the other hand create the instruments to help us find the balance between the designed ICT pace and the capacity to cope with it!
M15|Information and Communications Technologies Go Greener Beyond IOT- Behind Is All the Earth, Part 2|The paper presents a systemic analysis of the context, implementation and consequences of „greener” Information and Communications Technologies (ICT). The presented context reveals the necessity to carefully „observe” the fast and complex processes of ICT development, in order to identify real-time solutions to compensate all their (unwanted) consequences in the future and shows that it is reasonably to suppose that building greener ICT while extending IoT as a network of networks at Earth scale has to go beyond ... energy savings. The analysis covered the desired consequences of greener ICT as coming from two main directions: directly from all processes of production and utilization of ICT (products and services); indirectly from the whole diversity of applications of ICT as imbedded in practically all areas of humankind activity fields. The analysis focused on identifying the most important directions where energy savings are significant for ICT carbon footprint, but more than this, on ways ICT could generate, for humankind life on Earth and generally for Information society (IS) toward Knowledge Based Society (KBS) evolution, benefic effects that could be also considered „green” or environment friendly for the humankind ecosistem, although they could not be quantified as energy savings. Based on United Nations definition, the author considered that sustainable processes in social and economic are also green forms of development, extending the environment to the ecosystem of humankind life on Earth. The analysis presented also the two main directions for the „greener” ICT/IoT implementation, mainly for energy savings, as improvements of technologies, architectures, components, devices, algorithms, methods and protocols. The other side is generated by a diversity of methods to provide a green behaviour of ICT/IoT use.The essential aspect is that the effect of those technologies will be multiplied by the number of expected IoT networks/devices, this way appearing the huge relevance and consequences of greener ICT in the IoT era. The paper also approached some evaluation/measuring aspects referring to the the greener ICT processes. A special attention, in the second section of the paper, is given to learning from green ICT, as going beyond energy savings, where the main consequence is given by the changes of business models, with sustainable progress for humankind, representing one of the most dramatic non-energy savings consequences of ICT (green) evolution in IS/KBS. The analysis concluded that Big Data, Cloud and Analytics could be the main vectors of this transformation, but here the point paper analyzed is even further forecasting: how to manage the design and use of those technologies in order to leverage the generation of above mentioned green consequences by ICT/IoT. Last but not least, the analysis pointed that humankind have to beware of ICT exponential development negative consequences as “ICT dependence”, physical/intellectual activity fading and excessive resources consumption.
M15|Developing Information and Communications Technologies with More Artificial Intelligence, Using Artificial Intelligence, When Internet of Things is “Intelligence Everywhere” Part 1|The paper is approaching the systemic analysis of the emergency of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems and generally of AI in the context of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) exponential evolution and proliferation, as main driving factor of the transformation of the Information society (IS) toward Knowledge Based Society (KBS). The paper analysis presents the AI premises to be a potential revolutionary step in ICT development, having, naturally, challenges of the same scale, because of the complex convergence of the state-of-the art AI technologies with Internet of Things (IoT) networks (IoT is “intelligence everywhere”!) and Big Data, applying with exponentially pace/performance at Earth scale. Security, ethical, moral or legal rules are identified as the prominent challenges of the exponential pace/performance and planetary expansion of AI/ICT, addressed to humankind in IS toward KBS on Earth. Among the challenges, security is first, because the benefits of the AI/ICT progress have got such a huge level and horizontal expansion in autonomous systems and processes, as our lives depend dramatically on their reliable and safe operation .Consequently, the solution is not to stop AI/ICT progress, but to use our actual intelligence and refined knowledge in order to‘’build robots we can trust’’ and generally ICT we can trust.From security point of view, developing ICT with more artificial intelligence, using artificial intelligence could create sensible risks against the essential requirements on ethical, moral or legal rules. In detail, the analysis confirms that in the (actual or next) stage of AI/ICT development we can lose the safe limit of control for AI, when imbedded ‘’intelligence’’ (as performance and technology level) is pushing us to think that we can trust in higher or total (100%) autonomy of the new AI systems only because the technology can support that (level of autonomy)! Paper proposition is that the essence of “fight” (against advanced AI vulnerabilities) strategy has to be the plenary use of the only (long term) advantage human could have over AI (machine): the imagination potential. Consequently, when developing advanced AI/ICT (especially advanced robots), we have to use the most advanced refined knowledge plus our imagination maximum potential, aiming with priority two main objectives. First we must be sure that human subjective criteria are cleared (know yourself) by refined knowledge based on security, ethical, moral or legal rules. Then, analyse all possible scenarios of “fight” (against advanced AI vulnerabilities). Technically we can win the “fight” (against advanced AI vulnerabilities) only if applying the advantage of using similar refined knowledge, but exceeding by human (unlimited) imagination the analysis advanced AI could perform based on learning processes it could have passed. The analysis concludes with the crucial importance of models and algorithms the specialists could use to apply the more and more performant available technology, because this amazing AI/ICT performance and proliferation at planetary scale are the main premises to create functional vulnerabilities (risks) unless backing solutions to timely compensate them are provided by appropriate models and algorithms.

M15|Herramientas colaborativas para la Gestión del Conocimiento en la Universidad 2.0 (Collaborative tools for Knowledge Management at the University 2.0)| Spanish abstract En el contexto empresarial se presentan a diario múltiples problemas que ya han sido resueltos por otras personas anteriormente. Además se buscan informaciones en el exterior cuando la empresa cuenta con expertos en la materia que pudieran contribuir con su conocimiento y aportar a su capital intelectual. Estas situaciones se evidencian de forma particular en las universidades ya que confluyen diversas ciencias y sectores. Para evitar esto se comienza a implementar la Filosofía 2.0, que evita que se pierda el conocimiento organizacional facilitando la colaboración para compartir información, contactos y recursos entre sus miembros. En el caso de las universidades se acuña el término Universidad 2.0 que está asociado en gran medida al uso de herramientas y conceptos colaborativos de la Web 2.0 en sus procesos formativos y empresariales. Estas herramientas se encuentran enfocadas principalmente en las personas y en brindarles la posibilidad de socializar lo que saben convirtiéndose en participantes activos en la construcción y divulgación de nuevo conocimiento. En el presente trabajo se abordan los términos Web 2.0, Empresa 2.0 y Universidad 2.0, así como la marcada relación entre ellos. Además se da a conocer la evolución de la universidad hacia el trabajo colaborativo a través de la Web. Se muestran también herramientas colaborativas que apoyan la Gestión del Conocimiento en la Universidad 2.0. Por último, se proponen un grupo de ideas para la implantación de la Gestión del Conocimiento a través de herramientas colaborativas de la Web en una universidad cubana. English abstract In business context recurrent problems appear. In addition, information outside the organization are searched when the company has experts in the field who could contribute their knowledge and intellectual capital. These situations are particularly evident in the universities which converge various sciences and sectors. To avoid this situation organizations begin to implement the philosophy 2.0, which prevents the organizational knowledge is lost facilitating collaboration to share information, contacts and resources among its members.In case of universities the coined term is University 2.0 that is associated largely with the use of collaborative tools and concepts of Web 2.0 in their training and business processes. These tools are focused primarily on people and give them the opportunity to socialize what they know becoming active participants in the construction and dissemination of new knowledge. In present paper concepts and relations between the terms Web 2.0, Enterprise 2.0 and University 2.0 are addressed.

M15|Algoritmos Heurísticos para la Solución del Problema Lineal con Restricciones de Equilibrio (Heuristic Algorithms for Solving Linear Problems with Equilibrium Constraints)| Spanish abstract Los problemas lineales con restricciones de equilibrio son un caso particular de los modelos de optimización con restricciones de equilibrio. Debido a la complejidad que presentan, la condición de equilibrio se sustituye por condiciones necesarias obteniéndose un problema con restricciones de complementariedad (MPCC). La estructura del conjunto de soluciones factibles del MPCC obtenido es compleja ya que es la unión de poliedros. Resolver todos los problemas correspondientes a minimizar la función objetivo sobre cada uno de estos poliedros es computacionalmente costoso. El presente trabajo utiliza un enfoque heurístico para dar solución al MPCC, adaptando los algoritmos de Búsqueda Local y Recocido Simulado. Este trabajo presenta un conjunto de funciones de prueba y los resultados computacionales más significativos obtenidos. English abstract Linear equilibrium constrained programming is a special class of optimization models with equilibrium constraints. Because of the complexity of the equilibrium condition it is replaced by necessary conditions, which leads to a complementarity constrained problem (MPCC). The set of feasible solutions in a MPCC is structured as a union of polyhedrons. Solving the MPCC problem would require the minimization of the objective function on each of these polyhedrons. The computation cost of this approach is unfeasible, thus, this work presents a new approach where heuristic algorithms such as Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing are used to search for good solutions on the polyhedrons space. A new benchmark for linear equilibrium constrained optimization is introduced. The computational results achieved by the proposed heuristics on the new benchmark are presented.

M15|importance of Internationalization and Valorization in technical universities supported by Information systems|This article explores the importance of internationalization and valorization in technical Universities as one of core priorities for achieving international excellence and strengthening university ? industry collaboration. The World is becoming more interconnected and Higher Education institutions can no more act on their own ? they are motivated and even forced to become international. But an important topic for management of each University, especially technical, is to strengthen the collaboration with business in global environment. Valorization or creation of new products and services through innovation process is an important task for all technical Universities that want to maintain strong bond with the industry and capitalize on this process. This article is based on research conducted between technical Universities in Baltic States, where different processes in university internationalization and valorizations have been distinguished as main driving forces of institutional development. The conducted research shows that this task can be achieved by increased international research, student mobility, large scale jointly managed projects and other international activities. After internationalization and valorization processes have been analyzed, establishing the most critical key elements for fostering both of these processes, authors present an evaluation of Riga Technical University?s case as an example on how internal Information Systems provide the possibility for management to both implement strategic settings of the University and accelerate valorization within the University. This can be achieved trough correct strategy development based on key elements of valorization and internationalization, effective strategy implementation, monitoring and creating of appropriate incentive mechanism where IT support pay an important role.
M15|Evaluation of Broadband Internet Service for Rural Areas in Korea|Although according to the 2015 OECD survey South Korea ranks number one in broadband internet service in the world, the rural areas in South Korea still lack the enough internet infrastructure to access the national backbone network effectively. Because of the economic feasibility the internet service providers are reluctant to install the broadband internet for the rural areas where less than 50 households live. Recently South Korea has invested lots of efforts to provide broadband access to the rural areas to overcome the digital divide. In this research, to evaluate the performance of broadband internet service for rural areas in South Korea we develop the empirical model based on the information systems success model. Then, we collect the questionnaires from the subscribers who have used the broadband internet service since 2013. Finally, the structural equation model validates the causal relationship between system and/or service quality and performance. The major findings and suggestion for further research will be discussed in the conference in details.
M15|The role of information/knowledge flow in the clients? purchasing decisions|In the current reality and the conditions under which companies conduct its activity, the role of information/knowledge is gaining in importance. The Internet?s popularization had a big influence on this increasing, as Internet allows not only for information providing but also its generation. Looking further, it has also contributed to the increasing meaning of knowledge, based on a large amount of information perceived by the receivers. In the case of information that was already presented in the traditional supply chain, as one of the subjects of flows - next to products and financial resources, but its role was confined mainly to the improvement of the entire supply chain. Now, information flows that takes place between the company and its client are very important, these flows play a large role in making purchase decisions taken by clients. Because of this decision, whether to buy the product or not, the further development of the company may depend on. Therefore, the main purpose of this article was to verify whether for the clients, information about the products are important and if they play an important role in making purchase decisions. The authors focused on how clients obtain and share information/knowledge about the products offered by the company, and also examined whether for the client the efficient flow of information is important, and whether in their opinion, the company try to improve their information flows directed to its clients.

M15|Enabling Business-Preference-Based Scheduling of Cloud Computing Resources|Although cloud computing technology gets increasingly sophisticated, a resource allocation method still has to be proposed that allows providers to take into consideration the preferences of their customers. The existing engineering-based and economics-based resource allocation methods do not take into account jointly the different objectives that engineers and marketing employees of a cloud provider company follow. This article addresses this issue by presenting the system architecture and, in particular, the business-preference-based scheduling algorithm that integrates the engineering aspects of resource allocation with the economics aspects of resource allocation. To show the workings of the new business-preference-based scheduling algorithm, which integrates a yield management method and a priority-based scheduling method, a simulation has been performed. The results obtained are compared with results from the First-Come-First-Serve scheduling algorithm. The comparison shows that the proposed scheduling algorithm achieves higher revenue than the engineering-based scheduling algorithm.
M15|Web Platform for Romanian SMEs Networking|After the 90s, private initiative in Romania has tried to get market shares in the emerging niches: IT services, ecommerce, retail, energy.

M15|The relationship between culture and information privacy policy|Abstract Operating in a global market provides challenges for managers concerned with information privacy. This work builds on a branch of research that has evolved to examine the relationship between culture and attitudes to information privacy. Our approach is unique in that our dependent variable is a count variable designed to measure the rate of uptake of privacy laws. It is a departure from studying cultural variables at the individual level. We also identify the cultural impact of legislation at the national level. Previous models generally use a relatively crude division of legislative codes. By contrast, this work examines the impact of culture on baskets of privacy elements drawn from the EU directive. These attributes are candidates for codification in law, but are taken up at varying rates. A key originality and challenge of the work is the use of the GLOBE variables for culture. Results suggest that group collectivism, power distance, assertiveness and uncertainty avoidance are the most powerful cultural predictors of the level of privacy legislation provision.
M15|How and why network governance evolves: evidence from a public safety network|Abstract Public sector organizations increasingly form interorganizational networks that rely on technology to achieve what they cannot achieve independently. The governance of these public sector networks is complex due to the nature of interorganizational relationships and technology. This paper aims to increase our understanding of network governance by exploring the evolution of governance over the 40+ year lifespan of a public sector network. The historical case study is based on the technology affordance and organizational actualization concepts applied to three critical incidents in the history of a public safety network. The incidents provide evidence that technology and governance do interact, that timing matters and that future research is needed to understand more fully how and why network governance evolves and the implications of governance evolution on network performance.
M15|Development of a maturity model for electronic invoice processes|Abstract The digitalization of invoice processes provides a good opportunity for companies to pare down expenses, optimize administrative tasks, and increase efficiency and competitiveness. But the digitalization is limited by a variety of software solutions, legal uncertainties, heterogeneous demands, lack of know-how, and information system infrastructure incompatibilities. A holistic map of electronic invoice processes is mandatory, especially to demonstrate different levels of process integration and optimization. A maturity model puts this into practice and provides companies with a tool to identify their current situation and to derive recommendations to optimize that situation. In this paper, a maturity model for electronic invoice processes will be developed using exploratory data from focus groups. A theoretical approach that is based on a procedure-model for developing maturity models is applied. Four categories (strategy, acceptance, processes & organization, and technology) are identified and enriched by sub-categories. Future research requires the development of detailed maturity metrics.
M15|Structural analysis of value creation in software service platforms|Abstract As software service platforms grow in number of users and variety of service offerings, it raises the question of how this phenomenon impacts the value obtained by users. This paper identifies system usability, service variety, and personal connectivity to be the major determinants that contribute to the value offered to users on mobile software service platforms. A structural equation model, which is based on utility theory, technology acceptance theory, and the theory of network externalities, has been constructed from seven observed constructs, reflecting the three determinants and the user value. The lower bound of user value is estimated through the user’s willingness-to-pay for services and the user’s willingness to spend time on using services. For the validation, a co-variance-based structural equation analysis has been conducted on online survey data of 210 users of mobile service platforms (e.g., Android, iOS). The results show that the number of services used and the number of active user connections were found to be the strongest constructs explaining user value. Perceived usefulness did not explain user value as much. In total, they can explain 49 % of the value that the user receives from the platform. The implication of this result is that users’ value from a software service platform cannot be explained by the technology acceptance model itself. Instead, an approach that, as used in this research, of integrating network externality theory, utility theory, and technology acceptance theory is necessary.
M15|Big data analytics in E-commerce: a systematic review and agenda for future research|Abstract There has been an increasing emphasis on big data analytics (BDA) in e-commerce in recent years. However, it remains poorly-explored as a concept, which obstructs its theoretical and practical development. This position paper explores BDA in e-commerce by drawing on a systematic review of the literature. The paper presents an interpretive framework that explores the definitional aspects, distinctive characteristics, types, business value and challenges of BDA in the e-commerce landscape. The paper also triggers broader discussions regarding future research challenges and opportunities in theory and practice. Overall, the findings of the study synthesize diverse BDA concepts (e.g., definition of big data, types, nature, business value and relevant theories) that provide deeper insights along the cross-cutting analytics applications in e-commerce.
M15|Generating and exploiting customer insights from social media data|Abstract Previous research has emphasized the virtues of customer insights as a key source of competitive advantage. The rise of customers’ social media use allows firms to collect customer data in an ever-increasing volume and variety. However, to date, little is known about the capabilities required of firms to turn social media data into valuable customer insights and exploit these insights to create added value for customers. Based on the dynamic capabilities perspective, in particular the concept of absorptive capacity (ACAP), the authors conducted multiple case studies of seven mid-sized and large B2C firms in Switzerland and Germany. The results provide an in-depth analysis of the underlying processes of ACAP as well as contingent factors – that is, physical, human and organizational resources that underpin the firms’ ACAP.
M15|Location-based advertising on mobile devices|Abstract Location-based advertising (LBA) allows the delivery of advertising messages to consumers in places that are known for their particular high and positive advertising effect. While LBA is recognized for static roadside billboards and the Web, LBA can now be found on mobile devices. This mobile advertising adds valuable opportunities for companies: it allows consumers to be addressed (i) individually, (ii) based on their current location, and (iii) dynamically in real-time; furthermore, (iv) content may be replaced quickly by remote access. Accordingly, within the mobile marketing domain, LBA on mobile devices turns over a new leaf. This young research field is interdisciplinary at its core and marketing and technical experts expect major impetus. To contribute to this growing field, we systematically analyze and evaluate existing literature in the field of LBA on mobile devices, and present the results of six analyses. By building bridges between the involved disciplines, we present existing research in a condensed, concise and evaluating form which will support researchers in orienting for future research in the field. Furthermore, we pinpoint selected “white spots” in research and draw attention to promising areas for future research and directions of future development trends.

A t test has been performed to assess the significance of the inter-cluster diversity. Five co-existing research streams shaping the research field under investigation have been identified and characterized.
M15|"De la cooperativa agroalimentaria a la “Learning Netchain"". Hacia un planteamiento teórico interorganizativo e interpersonal<BR>[From agrifood cooperatives to learning netchains: toward an interorganizational and interpersonal framework]"|Se propone un planteamiento teórico/conceptual para determinar si las relaciones interorganizativas e interpersonales de la netchain de las cooperativas agroalimentarias evolucionan hacia una learning netchain. Las propuestas del trabajo muestran que el mayor grado de asociacionismo y la mayor cooperación/colaboración vertical a lo largo de la cadena están positivamente relacionados con la posición horizontal de la empresa focal más cercana del consumidor final. Esto requiere una planificación y una resolución de problemas de manera conjunta, lo que está positivamente relacionado con el mayor flujo y diversidad de la información/conocimiento obtenido y diseminado a lo largo de la netchain. Al mismo tiempo se necesita desarrollar un contexto social en el que fluya la información/conocimiento y las nuevas ideas de manera informal y esto se logra con redes personales y, principalmente, profesionales y con redes internas y, principalmente, externas.

M15|How do collaboration and investments in knowledge management affect process innovation in services?|Purpose: Despite the keen interest in radical and incremental innovation, few studies have tested the varying impact of firm-level factors in service sectors. This paper analyses how collaboration with existing and prospective users, and investments in knowledge management (KM) practices can be adapted to maximise the outputs of radical and incremental process innovation in a Knowledge-Intensive Business Service (KIBS) industry. Methodology: Original survey data from 166 Information Technology Service (ITS) firms and interviews with 13 executives provide the empirical evidence. PLS-SEM is used to analyse the data. Findings: Collaboration with different types of users, and investments in KM practices affect radical versus incremental process innovation differently. Collaboration with existing users influences incremental process innovation directly, but not radical innovation; and prospective user collaboration matters for radical, but not incremental innovation. Furthermore, for radical innovation, investments in KM practices mediate the impact of prospective user collaboration on innovation. Implications: While collaboration with existing users for incremental process innovations does not appear to generate significant managerial challenges, to pursue radical innovations firms must engage in intensive collaboration with prospective users. Higher involvement with prospective users requires higher investment in KM practices to promote efficient intra- and inter-firm knowledge flows. Originality: This study is based on a large-scale survey, together with management interviews. Radical and incremental innovations require engagements with different kinds of users in the service industry, and knowledge management tools.
M15|Innovation and information technology capability as antecedents of firms' success|"The primary aim of this article is to identify antecedents of firm's success in specific circumstances of the New economy. Many researchers have tried to answer the question ""Why do some firms persistently outperform others?"". One of the most dominant view on this issue is a resource based view (RBV) or resource-based theory (RBT). According to this theory, sources of competitive advantage begin with the notion that differences in performance are fundamentally due to the distinctive resources and capabilities that are valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable. Information technology as a resource of the company has the increasing importance for the researches and managers. Research on the information technology (IT) value within organizations and firms' IT capabilities have expanded over the past decade. IT capability is defined as the existence of IT infrastructure, IT knowledge and IT operations within company. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the interaction impact of IT capability and firms' innovation on business performance. The study uses survey data from managers and structural equation modelling to assess the relationships between IT capability, firm's innovation and business performance. This study finds that both IT capability and innovation capability play important role in achieving greater business performance. The findings indicate that managers should focus on development of the IT function within company, taking into account importance of IT investment as well as IT knowledge, and promotion of innovativeness."

How strong is this connection? (Does SMEs get constantly feed-back from clients? Do they win or lose clients through SM? Does the customer satisfaction increase? Are there fewer complaints?)
M15|Project Management in Collaborative Research Projects: Challenges and opportunities|Project management (PM) is the skill of planning and organisational effort set about to accomplish a task or goal (Chai, Zhou, & Wang, 2007). PM is perceived as being one of the main ways in assuring the quality of a project and is critical in a collaborative environment, which is typically more difficult to control and manage (Wong, B., & Bhatti, 2009). Modern project management started between 1900 and 1950 ? during this time the advance was specifically on the shortening of the project schedule caused by technology advancement. After 1958 the rapid advancement of technology changed the way that PM was done until we are now in a period where the internet changed business practices in the mid 1990s and ?provided a fast, interactive, and customized new medium that allowed people to browse, purchase, and track products and services online instantly. Between 1995 and 2000, the project management community adopted internet technology to become more efficient in controlling and managing various aspects of projects.? (Kwak, 2005:7). Being connected created many opportunities and also opened new opportunities for collaboration over boundaries. Individuals are now able to do more for themselves, be able to do more with others and improves the capacity to do more in formal organizations. Miles & Trott (2008) summarize three lessons learned from several data collection activities, as being having a common purpose, sharing power and that if you do it right, it is worth it.Collaborative research projects over countries introduce new challenges to the project manager of the project. For this paper we give feedback on the first phase of a collaborative systems development project between 5 countries and the lessons learned from the collaborative effort from a project management perspective.

Stand-alone system until now is going to Cloud Computing trend, many data can be used to save or transfer information through cloud computing. The study uses these technologies to design a multifunction e-service system for ambulance. The e-service system updated the new way from handwriting to smart device, it can ensure information to save and transfer to the hospital database. In order to improve the current ambulance system process and replace handwriting format, this study invents the e-service system for ambulance. We use service design approach to redesign service process of ambulance, and then this study uses smart device to install e-service system for ambulance. This e-service system integrates many various media (such as sound, pictures or text ) and helps hospital employee to prepare some material before the patients arrive at hospital. This study will use Taiwan?s ambulance to illustrate its process and try to improve it with service design methodology.
M15|European Quartet of Missed Opportunities for Internet Governance|Who controls the Internet? Conventionally, it is assumed that the hegemony, if not monopoly, of the U.S. Government over the Internet governance is a fait accompli generated by the historic evolution, as well as the economic and political power which the USA asserted in an almost aggressive manner. This assumption is the result of a set of myths and misinformation and deserves to be corrected while presenting both American and European perspectives, in the context of the real managerial and technical setting. This black-and-white perception is to be rejected and replaced by a colorful mosaic showing that a set of misunderstandings and aborted opportunities shaped the pathway to the status quo. An active and strong impact over the Internet governance was several times close to European hands, and it is highly instructive to analyze these situations where Europeans did not manage to get involved in the top Internet management. Four decades, four sets of opportunities and four failures for many business management and other reasons are detailed. Considering the global situation, Europeans cannot afford repeating such mistakes. Taking into account the current stage of the relationship between the EU and USA, especially Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a consensus, or at least a respected tolerance, of the management of the Internet and governance over it is critical.

M15|A user perspective on contrasting factors of contactless mobile payments adoption|This study investigates the adoption of contactless mobile payments from a user point of view. Near Field Communication (NFC) mobile payments that consist of credit card contactless payments with smartphones are believed to be on a rapid growth path due to expected advantages for all major parties involved: consumers, credit card companies, banks, smartphone manufacturers, and mobile operators. Despite this overall optimistic picture there may, however, be some potential user doubts that would slow adoption. Thus, NFC payments might be associated with both fears linked to credit card use (e.g., account security) and to smartphone use (e.g., privacy). To assess the contrasting, positive and negative, factors of contactless mobile payments adoption from a user perspective, a cross-sectional investigation was run with two samples of Canadian consumers, 150 participants each. While one of the samples was presented information emphasizing the advantages of NFC mobile payments, the other sample was presented information pointing to possible issues associated with this new form of mobile payments. Following that, an online survey was conducted simultaneously with all participants in the two samples. Outcomes indicate that, irrespective of the information offered a priori, consumers perceive both opportunities (e.g., utility and fun) and challenges (e.g., unnecessary complications or privacy threats) associated with the service provided. Major players on the NFC mobile payments market should address these salient consumer factors in order to increase consumer adoption and, hence, the overall success of contactless mobile payments with smartphones.
M15|Potential of Mobile Applications aiding Logistic Processes|This paper aims to give an overview of the potential which mobile applications have in aiding special logistic processes like warehouse management, fleet control and tracking, document handling, etc. In the previous decades industrial solutions dominated the software market. These solutions were highly reliable but also very expensive and not flexible in respect of implementing modification needs. The sudden evolution of mobile technology made it possible to apply cheap or even free applications to aid logistic processes. This paper deals with the main advantages of using mobile apps in supporting certain processes which are usually the cost factor, flexibility and easy system migration possibilities.

M15|A Study on the Factors Impacting Managers? Green IT Perceptions|Recently, concerns with environmental issues enabled businesses to transform their practices to become more environmentally sensitive. It is widely accepted that carbon emissions have an increasing impact on the climate and environmental problems. It is further known that information technology (IT) makes a significant contribution to carbon emissions, albeit not being directly perceptible to the general public. That?s why, a new term called green IT emerged recently to create a positive and environmentally sensitive movement in IT field. Green IT is defined as the practices and technologies for designing, manufacturing, using, and disposing of computers, servers, and associated devices such as monitors, printers, storage devices, and networking and communication systems to minimize impact on the environment. Businesses have recently become aware of the issues related to green IT, as practicing green IT has a positive impact not only on the environment and global warming, but also on the profits through decreasing energy consumption costs. For this reason, it is necessary to study green IT practices and perceptions of businesses and managements as well as the factors influencing it. This study examines the impact of environmentally sensitive management and human resources on green IT practices. The current study used the data collected via a structured survey conducted in Kahramanmara? province of Turkey, by incorporating 121 businesses operating in textile, food, steel kitchen utensils, and other sectors. The data analysis with respect to the structural model and the psychometric properties of the research model was done by partial least squares (PLS) method by using SmartPLS software. The results of the data analysis reveal that the measurement model meets all the required criteria (reliability, discriminant validity, convergent validity). According to the results of the structural model, the perceptions of managers concerning the environmentally sensitive management and human resources are positively related to green IT practices. The findings of the current study reveal that businesses that consider environment in their strategic decisions and businesses that have human resources that are aware of the environment in their activities are more likely to have positive attitudes towards practicing green IT.
M15|An Empirical Investigation on Factors Influencing SNS Addiction|Along with the recent advances of mobile internet technology, use of social network service(SNS) is very common among adolescents or college students in their daily lives. Although there have been a lot of studies on Internet addiction or mobile phone addiction, however, there were little research on SNS addiction so far. Scholars investigated somewhat broader and obscure phenomenon of Internet addiction. In this regard, the current study tried to examine factors which influence SNS addiction behavior. Unlike Internet addiction, there are positive influencing factors such socialization, enjoyment as well as problematic ones like loneliness. Data were collected from college students in Korea to examine how those factors influence addiction behavior and hypotheses were tested using the partial least square method. All three factors, socialization, enjoyment, and loneliness, were found significantly influenced SNS addiction and socialization was positively associated with enjoyment.
M15|The technological, organizational and environmental framework of IS innovation adaption in small and medium enterprises. Evidence from research over the last 10 years|This paper relies on the technological innovation adoption literature and uses the technological-organizational-environmental (TOE) framework to analyze the factors influencing new information systems (IS) adoption in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Even though the TOE framework has not seen much development in the last years, research on the TOE framework can take a number of directions in the future, because novel contexts of adoption and new technologies are persistently being developed. This paper undertakes a review of the literature on IS adoption in SMEs during the last decade (2004 to 2015) and identifies the main variables influencing the adoption process. In doing so, we try to see if any changes in the patterns of IS adoption from SMEs are present and look for emerging research topics and gaps in the field of SME and IS innovation adoption in the last decade.
M15|Internet governance and its legitimacy - from rethoric to facts and even beyond|What is the Internet? What is Internet governance? Who has the competency and legitimacy for it? What are the perspectives regarding the future Internet governance? These questions deal not only with the business management of the Internet but also its compliance or contradiction with conventional approaches and perceptions. These burning questions deserve to be addressed systematically, scientifically and critically, from the standpoint of the USA, the EU and even individuals. The Meta-Analysis of the secondary data yielded from disparate literature and other sources, as well as of the primary data yielded by the author via direct questionnaires, is performed in an open-minded manner and reported comparatively, along with a number of glosses. The truth can and should be presented and explained, while myths should be corrected. The critical importance of IS/IT, and naturally of the Internet, generates a significant need for an enhanced awareness in this respect on all levels, national, regional and local, and both public and private. A successful and sustainable existence in the postmodern society depends upon the effective and efficient employment of IS/IT, and without understanding the governance of their platform par excellence, the Internet, business conduct is a chimera. The goal of this article is to address the above mentioned four questions from various perspectives through pre-set hypotheses, and to bring more light in this area, an area of a, so far, rather confused perception and much discussion. As well. to perhaps even help launch initiatives towards more involvement in GAC, ICANN and in the Internet governance as such. There is no need for myths, the truth about the Internet governance should come to light.

M15|Role of Platform Providers in Software Ecosystems|Through the advancement of information technology, a new type of innovation could emerge. This innovation type suggests a leading company to open up its software service platform to customers as well as competitors. Many innovation studies have been performed in the past, in order to understand the structure of this interaction among platform users from a network science perspective. By focusing on the internal mechanisms of software vendors only, these studies missed the role of platform providers in the innovation process though. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating the impact of platform providers on the structure of a software service network. The empirical data about the software services network has been gathered from Salesforce.com AppExchange. It is used to identify the clusters in the network and the network position of each software service. Using the Kruskal-Wallis test, we infer from those results that the network position of the platform providers software services is different from the network position of software services of third party vendors. In particular, our results show that the software services released by the platform provider locate at hub positions, while those released by third party vendors locate at positions interconnecting clusters. These results imply a role division between platform providers and third party vendors in this innovation type. The former leads the overall innovation on the platform, while the third party vendors interconnect software services of different categories.
M15|Value Creation in Software Service Platforms|In order to benefit from operating an IT service platform (e.g., SaaS platform), platform providers need to find a way to keep their existing users and application services active sources of value. However, the understanding of how to achieve that is limited due to the newness of this kind of business. This paper investigates whether all stakeholders of the platform ecosystem can generate sufficient value when participating in the platform. As stakeholders, we consider application service users, service developers, and service platform providers. We also analyze the interrelationship between these stakeholders. The analysis outcome is a value creation model that allows the calculation of the stakeholders’ values. The model also helps inferring the relative impact of different factors on the evolution of values of the software service platform stakeholders. Our simulation results confirm that all stakeholders of a service platform mainly benefit from a growing installed base of application users. However, in a mature market, a large service variety mainly benefits the service platform provider, while the other stakeholders obtain a reduced increase in their benefits. In particular, the utility growth of application users becomes constrained as the benefit from new connections with other users decreases and the number of new services used decreases. Similarly, the revenue of service developer decreases, making service development less profitable. Therefore, we can state that not only a large fraction of the value creation goes to the platform provider but also that the software service ecosystem can collapse, if no mutually beneficial pricing of services is implemented.
M15|Utility-Based Smartphone Energy Consumption Optimization for Cloud-Based and On-Device Application Uses|As the use of smartphones and its applications continue their rapid growth, prolonging the smartphone battery lifetime has become one of the main concerns for smartphone users if re-charging is not possible. In this paper, we show that, by taking into account the user preferences, the energy consumption of smartphones can be adjusted to maximize the user utility. The user preferences are reflected through the type of application uses, the perceived costs of energy allocation for the different types of applications, and the perceived value of energy remaining in the battery of the smartphone. In particular, we optimize the energy consumption of smartphones through the use of a utility-based energy consumption optimization model, which we developed. We demonstrate the workings of our model by applying it to a simple scenario, in which we vary the perceived value of energy remaining in the smartphone battery and the user’s perceived costs for energy consumed by the two types of application uses: cloud-based application uses and on-device application uses. Our results show that, by letting users express their preferences, users can allocate the remaining smartphone energy such that it maximizes their utilities.
M15|Challenges Emerging from Future Cloud Application Scenarios|The cloud computing paradigm encompasses several key differentiating elements and technologies, tackling a number of inefficiencies, limitations and problems that have been identified in the distributed and virtualized computing domain. Nonetheless, and as it is the case for all emerging technologies, their adoption led to the presentation of new challenges and new complexities. In this paper we present key application areas and capabilities of future scenarios, which are not tackled by current advancements and highlight specific requirements and goals for advancements in the cloud computing domain. We discuss these requirements and goals across different focus areas of cloud computing, ranging from cloud service and application integration, development environments and abstractions, to interoperability and relevant to it aspects such as legislation. The future application areas and their requirements are also mapped to the aforementioned areas in order to highlight their dependencies and potential for moving cloud technologies forward and contributing towards their wider adoption.
M15|Functional Programming Using the New C++ Standard|In our article we demonstrate that the new C++ standard is the one preferred by economists and big software companies to implement AI and decision making algorithms. Today software technology evolves very quickly, to an old paradigm, called functional programming. This paradigm uses lambda functions ready to be used where declared instead of function pointers. The long term target is to let compilers evaluate rather than execute a program/function. The new C++14 standard allows lambda calculus as we demonstrate in the applicative section of implementing conditionals, booleans and numbers.
M15|Added Values Of Social Crm: The Examination Of Customer Perspective|"Background: Social media allow companies to create more ""friendly"" and personal interaction with their customers on an individual basis affecting the relationship development. Generally, people have more confidence in their friends’ recommendations. On the other hand, companies prefer this type of direct and targeted communication considering its reasonably lower costs, greater ability to target specific categories of visitors, the speed of response, etc. Objectives This paper aims to investigate the characteristics and benefits of using Social Customer Relationship Management (or abbreviated SCRM) for developing relations that many customers nowadays perceive as the most valuable component of the business offer. Methods/Approach The most important characteristics of SCRM were examined using factor analysis and logistic regression in order to explore how respondents’ gender and variables with highest weight from each factor re -late to customers’ choice of social media-based interaction. Sampling technique was applied via an online questionnaire containing four sections of questions with a link posted to ensure a greater response rate for analysis. Results This study indicates that the most significant added values of SCRM compared to traditional CRM, of often called classic CRM, are: customers’ mutual collaboration and interactions, customers’ engagement and interactions with company, available and flexible interaction, and customers’ involvement. The final logistic model indicates that two variables were statistically significant for the probability of making decision on further interaction. Conclusions Paper provides some important practical contributions, offering managers a framework of important factors that need to be considered when planning and implementing their CRM strategies. Precisely, they can establish and adjust their social-media based inter -action in line with identified added values from customer perspective."
