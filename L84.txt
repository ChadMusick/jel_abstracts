L84|Do firms exchange knowledge through complementary or substitutive routes of diffusion?|Studies on firms’ relationships and network structures have attracted more and more attention from several scholars, but surprisingly little is known about the role played by heterogeneous knowledge ties among the same set of actors and to what extent they follow overlapping or different routes of exchanging knowledge. In this vein, an investigation of multiple knowledge networks in clusters is a fundamental approach to interpret the reasons for innovation and economic performance. With an original dataset comprised of data collected by surveys directly administered in local wineries in the Montefalco wine region of Italy, this paper aims to analyse the roles played by different local knowledge ties, within a sector that is critically driven by the exchange of knowledge among economic actors. Social Network Analysis and Exponential Random Graph Modelling were applied in order to investigate the driving forces of the knowledge flows. The empirical results show that different kinds of relationships positively impact the spread of knowledge, but they are different in magnitude, and they follow complementary routes of exchange rather than overlapping ones.
L84|Structural Change In City Systems Evolution: City Growth In Sweden 1810-2010|This paper analyses city system dynamics, based on a theoretical framework relating interaction potentials to agglomeration economies and density externalities. It employs new historical time series data on population size of cities in Sweden over two centuries (1810-2010) and introduces two schematic growth factors: (i) the intra-city potential and (ii) the extra-city potential located in in rings encircling each city. The first factor is measured by each city’s population size, while the second is a vector of distance discounted population size for each of a city’s urban rings. In this way we can explain a city’s growth as a function of its interaction potential inside the city, s well as inside the first, second hand third ring. A robust finding is that cities with large ring potentials follow different development paths than those with small ring potentials. We also find clear evidence of structural change between the two centuries (1810-1910 and 1910-2010. In the first period, city growth is positively impacted by the size of the intra-city potential, whereas the same potential dampens or reduces the growth in the second period. Moreover, the Ring I and Ring II potentials tend to switch from having negative growth stimulation in the first period to having positive stimulation in the second period. The regressions are checked for robustness by yielding consistent results when growth is measured as relative as well as absolute change.
L84|Spatial And Diversity Dynamics Of Producer Services: Growth Interdependences In Sweden 2007-2016|During the period 2007-2016 in Sweden we can observe how the share of business (producer) services gradually increases as an aggregate phenomenon. The service categories are partitioned into ordinary (OBS), knowledge-intensive (KIBS), and very knowledge-intensive business services (VKIBS). The growth is faster in local and regional economies that have large demand potentials. Other sectors grow faster when located in places where the business-service supply potential is larger. We outline a theoretical framework where service suppliers locate their capacity in response to the size of the service-demand potential, whereas other sectors of the economy, locate and expand in response to the service-supply potentials, for each of the three service categories OBS-services, KIBS-services and VKIBS-services. These model alternatives are assessed in a series of dynamic econometric exercises. A major assumption is that business-service firms operate in a context of monopolistic competition, which means that when the capacity to supply and deliver business services increases, then the number of service varieties also increases, and thus adds to the multiplicity of varieties in local economies (municipalities) that have a large demand potential. In the model framework the service suppliers are selling innovation-relevant information to customer firms in a region, and thereby also unintentionally spread information and knowledge among firms in the region. In this way, business-service suppliers become knowledge providers and important actors in the relevant regional innovation system.
L84|Performance management and audit & feedback to support learning and innovation – Theoretical review and implications for Swedish primary care|Health care professionals frequently describe performance management and monitoring of efficiency and quality measures for external accountability as an administrative burden with limited benefits. Professionals argue that they are subject to too tight control that signals distrust, limits professional autonomy and ultimately decreases their motivation to perform. At worst, poorly incentivized indicators influence the behavior of providers in directions that undermine patient benefits. Against this background, policy interest has recently turned towards new governance and managerial approaches in Swedish health care services, allowing for a higher degree of professional autonomy, participatory processes and use of non-financial incentives. This change will undoubtedly have implications for performance management. Inspired by current changes in Swedish primary care, this article explores the design of audit & feedback elements through a review of the empirical evidence and theories about motivation and incentives. Audit & feedback interventions have so far taken a “diffusion of innovation” perspective focusing on implementation of evidence and targets into practice. More complex changes in the delivery of services is likely to require experience-based DUI (Doing, Using, Interacting) modes of innovation, which in turn calls for a more formative and enabling approach to performance management and audit & feedback. A key question is how an appeal to social determinants of professional identity and reputation mechanisms can motivate professionals to change their behavior. Practical implications and research opportunities that follow from the theoretical propositions are discussed using Swedish primary care as an illustrative case.
L84|Fiduciary Duty and the Market for Financial Advice|Recent regulatory debate in the financial advice industry has focused on expanding fiduciary duties to broker-dealers. Proponents of this reform argue that it would improve the advice given to clients and limit losses from agency problems, while detractors counter that such regulation would increase compliance costs without directly improving consumer outcomes. This paper evaluates these claims empirically, using a transactions-level dataset for annuity sales from a major financial services provider and exploiting state-level variation in common law fiduciary duty. We find that imposing fiduciary duty on broker-dealers shifts the set of products they sell to consumers, away from variable annuities and towards fixed indexed annuities. Within variable annuities, fiduciary duty induces a shift towards lower-fee, higher-return annuities with a wider array of investment options. We develop a model that leverages the distributional changes in products sold to test the mechanism by which fiduciary duty operates. We find evidence that fiduciary duty does not solely increase the cost of doing business but that it has the intended effect of directly impacting financial advice.
L84|Enablers of the Neo-Liberal State? Exploring the Role of the International Accounting-Consulting Firms in Australia Since the Mid-1980s|This Discussion Paper is part of a wider contemporary history project examining the growth and role of the commercial consultancy and contractor market within the public sector in Australia since the neo-liberal turn in the mid-1980s. The paper considers evidence as to whether the role of the big international accounting firms within the public sector was â€˜neo-liberalâ€™ in nature, either as a result of ideological and policy advocacy or technical facilitation of pre-set neo-liberal directions. The extent to which these firms (currently PwC, KPMG, EY and Deloitte) are seen as integrated or fragmented organisations has some bearing on this question. Hence, the first quarter of the paper sketches the historical broadening-out of the firms from accounting to a wider range of services, the debate over whether they have functioned as global corporations or networked partnerships, the rationalisation of the leading firms over the past three decades and the relatively sparse commentary from political scientists about the significance of the firms and other commercial consultants for public policy and administration in Australia. The second quarter of the paper points to the role of the firms in regard to two markers of a neo-liberal policy direction: privatisation of government business enterprises and particular tax policies and practices. Drawing on qualitative sources, it argues that while the firms made some contribution to the agenda-setting process in both areas, in tacitly (privatisation) or explicitly (taxation) signalling their broad policy preferences, they played a more fundamental role in detailed policy formulation and implementation â€“ in easing the path of privatisation and corporate tax minimisation. The second half of the paper summarises original research by the author in regard to official public listings of consultancies and contracts at the national government level. This quantitative analysis yields important findings: that overall spending on the firms displayed a long-term, consistent and strong increase, both in absolute terms and relative to other consultancies and contractors; that this spending went far beyond accounting and auditing to many areas of management, though with financial analysis likely to underpin management inputs; and that a good deal of this work appeared to be oriented to program content and policy-relevant tasks. otwithstanding these findings, the paper emphasises that the extent to which this work confirmed to neo-liberal markers â€“ such as support for private modes of provision and greater competition â€“ cannot be readily confirmed, due to limitations in the official summary data. Such confirmation can only be achieved by qualitative case studies.The paper acknowledges that, as the firms have broadened their personnel and services over the three decades, much of the management and technology work of the firms in the public sector is unlikely to be intrinsically neo-liberal but potentially compatible with other philosophies of the public sector. Nonetheless, the growing presence of the firms within the public sector does erode notions of public sector capability and distinctive ethos. The paper concludes with a brief pointer to how the foregoing discussion, and further research, can be related to the academic literature on the differing roles played by commercial consultants in relation to clients, ranging from legitimation and facilitation of client preferences through to independent advice and learning.
L84|Transaksi Jual Beli Online (E-Commerce) dalam Perspektif Hukum Islam|The more developed science and technology, the more developed methods used in the buying and selling process. E-commerce is a commercial transaction carried out between the seller and the buyer or with another party in the same agreement relationship to send a number of goods, services, or transfer of rights. This research is classified as Library Research, where data is collected by quoting in library research, literature searches are carried out rather than preparing a research framework or proposal to obtain similar research, deepening theoretical studies or sharpening methodologies. Based on the discussion of the results of the study, it can be concluded that online e-commerce is similar to the greeting contract, which is payment in advance and the item is received in the future.
L84|Cultural Intelligence Of Healthcare Staff: A Vital Value Of Service Operators|The diversity of peoples and cultures in Thailand has increased immensely. This challenges healthcare professionals, especially nurses, to recognize the beliefs and actions of patients from different national origins, ages, religious affiliations, languages, genders, sexual orientations, socioeconomic and occupational statuses, and geographical locations, among others. Not only do nurses deliver healthcare service closely to patients, but they also have to possess knowledge, attitudes, and skills that make diverse patients feel comfortable and at ease with them. Moreover, nurses have to maintain good communication with their patients for better healthcare service quality, ultimately, satisfying patients. For this reason, the cultural intelligence (CQ) is a significant capability of nurses. CQ determines how nurses are able to interact in service healthcare encounter with patients from various backgrounds. The objective of this study is to investigate nurses? CQ. The target respondents are nurses in both private and public hospitals in Bangkok, Thailand, because they have much more opportunities to interact with multifarious patients. Nurses will be measured CQ according to Ang et al.?s model (2007) including four dimensions, namely, metacognitive, cognitive, motivational, and behavioral. Confirmatory factor analysis will be utilized for data analysis.The expected result is that nurses possess all four CQ dimensions with different weights. The implication of this study is to gain a better understanding of CQ of nurses in Thai context for healthcare improvement which leads to enhance patients? satisfaction.
L84|Produktportfolio-Management im Zeitalter der Digitalisierung|Dieses Papier beschäftigt sich mit dem Produktportfolio-Management (PPM) und seiner Rolle im Zeitalter der Digitalisierung. Während einige betonen, dass strategische, langfristige Planung und PPM in Zeiten kürzerer Produktlebenszyklen, digitaler Innovationen und disruptiver Geschäftsmodelle veraltet zu sein scheinen, betonen andere die zunehmende Bedeutung von PPM, die Notwendigkeit einer effektiven Ressourcenallokation und eines Risikoausgleichs bei der Integration von Smart Products und digitalen Produkt-Service-Systemen in bestehende Produktportfolios. In der Praxis ist die Aufgabe des Value Proposition Design und Portfoliomanagements oft auf verschiedene Geschäftseinheiten, Abteilungen und Rollen (z.B. Produktmanagement, New Product Business, Servicegeschäft, Digital Business) verteilt. Die Mehrheit der Unternehmen erkennt das Potenzial eines systematischen Produktportfoliomanagements noch nicht vollständig. Sowohl die Literatur als auch die Ergebnisse unserer empirischen Studie zeigen, dass ein systematischer Ansatz für das Produktportfolio-Management zu höheren Gewinnmargen und erfolgreicheren Innovationen führt. Um den Kundennutzen zu maximieren und die Effizienz zu steigern, ist ein integrierter Ansatz erforderlich. Basierend auf einem umfassenden Literaturüberblick stellt dieses Papier einen integrierten PPM-Rahmen vor. Es soll eine Grundlage für die Diskussion darüber geschaffen werden, wie PPM in Bezug auf physische Produkte, digitale Produkte, Dienstleistungen und Produkt-Dienstleistungssysteme im Zeitalter der Digitalisierung organisiert werden kann.
L84|Knowledge intensive business services and urban areas: an analysis of localization and productivity on Italian data|We analyse the geographic localization and the productivity of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) in Italy, using both census data and balance-sheet data at the firm level. We find that KIBS are generally agglomerated in urban areas where they attain significantly higher labour productivity levels. Urban productivity advantages are found to be strongly associated with the local availability of human capital and to standard proxies of Marshall-Arrow-Romer and Jacobs agglomeration economies. Forward demand linkages and some factors impacting on the thickness of the local labour market also appear to be relevant. On the whole, the set of explanatory factors considered could explain the entire urban productivity premium estimated for Italian KIBS firms.
L84|Participants' Reputation in the Syndicated Lending Market|How do lenders use their reputation when participating in syndicated loans? I address this question by focusing on syndicate composition with respect to participants’ reputation and its impact on loan spreads. I find that lender reputation enables it to compete in terms of choosing the types of loans to be involved in, so more reputable lenders participate in loans to safer, more transparent, and larger borrowers. In general, more reputable lenders participate in loans with more market finance features, rather than bank finance. However I find no evidence that lenders use their reputation and the corresponding market power for direct price competition. Any significant price effects of participants’ reputation seem to aid the certification process, rather than exploit their market power.
L84|El sector de seguridad y vigilancia privada: evolución reciente y principales retos laborales, regulatorios y de supervisión|La última década ha sido testigo de una importante expansión de los servicios de seguridad y vigilancia en América Latina, con una tasa media de crecimiento anual del 8%, casi el doble de la tasa global de expansión de la seguridad privada. De acuerdo con la Superintendencia de Vigilancia y Seguridad Privada, en Colombia en 2016 el sector contaba con cerca de 900 empresas, la mayoría de ellas pequeñas y empleaba a más de 256 mil personas. Sin embargo, dado que en el sector existe una alta informalidad, estas cifras podrían estar subestimadas. En todo caso, se trata de un sector relevante para la economía y dado su objetivo, también para la seguridad ciudadana. La adecuada regulación de la seguridad privada es crítica, pues por su naturaleza, se trata de un sector que implica altos riesgos tanto para los prestadores como para los usuarios del servicio. Como se describe en el presente trabajo, uno de los principales problemas de los que adolece el sector es que el marco normativo que rige actualmente tiene más de 20 años de vigencia, aun cuando las necesidades y alcances se han trasformado con el tiempo y nuevos elementos como la tecnología han entrado a jugar un papel relevante en la gama de servicios que se ofrecen. En consecuencia, la adecuación de la regulación requiere de especial atención. El propósito del presente estudio, elaborado para Fedeseguridad, es hacer un diagnóstico de la situación del sector en Colombia, principalmente en los servicios de vigilancia privada y transporte de valores, reconociendo los principales retos que enfrenta hacia el futuro en materia de regulación, mercado laboral y sistema de contratación.
L84|Occupational Licensing, Labor Mobility, and the Unfairness of Entry Standards|The combination of occupational licensing at the local market level often coexists with labor mobility across local markets. We empirically study a labor market in which a district-specific entry (licensing) examination is coupled with labor mobility across districts. Our analysis exploits a change in the grading procedure of the exam, from grading in the local district to grading in a randomly assigned different district. We document that licensing regulation leads to extreme heterogeneity across markets in admission outcomes (up to 50 percent differences in licensing exam pass rates), unfair (discriminatory) admission procedures (up to 49 percent unfair exam results), and inefficient mobility of workers. These findings, together with the estimated impact of the reform on exam outcomes and grading standards, provide the first evidence of regulatory competition based on strategic interaction among licensing boards.
L84|Flexible dependence modeling using convex combinations of different types of connectivity structures|There is a great deal of literature regarding use of non-geographically based connectivity matrices or combinations of geographic and non-geographic structures in spatial econometrics models. We explore alternative approaches for constructing convex combinations of different types of dependence between observations. Pace and LeSage (2002) as well as Hazır et al. (2016) use convex combinations of different connectivity matrices to form a single weight matrix that can be used in conventional spatial regression estimation and inference. An example for the case of two weight matrices, W1,W2 reflecting different types of dependence between a cross-section of regions, firms, individuals etc., located in space would be: Wc=γ1W1+(1−γ1)W2,0≤γ1≤1. The matrix Wc reflects a convex combination of the two weight matrices, with the scalar parameter γ1 indicating the relative importance assigned to each type of dependence. We explore issues that arise in producing estimates and inferences from these more general cross-sectional regression relationships in a Bayesian framework. We propose two procedures to estimate such models and assess their finite sample properties through Monte Carlo experiments. We illustrate our methodology in an application to CEO salaries for a sample of nursing homes located in Texas. Two types of weights are considered, one reflecting spatial proximity of nursing homes and the other peer group proximity, which arise from the salary benchmarking literature.
L84|A growth theory of professional services|IMost of the current economic literature on growth has focused on products and manufacturing. But professional services differ from manufactured products because their value stems from an interaction with the customer, while products value stems from technology. Therefore, growing a professional service is not about investing in technology but rather about increasing the amount of interactions that can be performed with the same level of quality. This article thus proposes a quality based theory of growth. The proposed theory is shown to explain professional services observed empirical growth patterns with respect to age and size. It also shows that in professional services, growth can either be competition-driven or opportunity-driven depending in the importance of the client interaction in the service delivery. Finally, it is able to capture most of the known growth heterogeneity sources in terms of market and services characteristics.
L84|Family-Centered Measures of Access to Early Care and Education|This study proposes new family-centered measures of access to early care and education (ECE) services with respect to quantity, cost, and quality and uses them to assess disparities in access across locations and socio-demographic groups in Minnesota. These measures are distance-based and use available geographic data to account for the fact that families can cross arbitrary administrative boundaries, such as census tract or ZIP code lines, and thus better reflect the real experiences of families than conventional area-based measures. Combining synthetic family locations simulated from Census demographic and geographic data and information on ECE provider locations, we calculate travel time between the locations of families with young children and ECE providers to measure families' access to providers of different types. The results yield a map of areas with low and high relative ECE access. The average family in Minnesota lives in a location where there are nearly two children for every nearby slot of licensed capacity, however, access to ECE supply varies considerably at the local level. The supply measure can also serve as a weight useful in computing family-centered measures of ECE quality and access costs, incorporating both prices and travel costs, to further characterize the local ECE market from the perspective of families. Improving measures of variation in families' access to ECE quantity, cost, and quality is valuable as policymakers consider expansions to public supports for early learning and ECE entrepreneurs decide where to invest.
L84|Quality Service Strategy in Improving Performance of Puskesmas Service Area of Mranggen District|"This study aims to analyze the quality of services available at the health center of Mranggen in order to formulate a strategy to improve the quality of health services of Puskesmas by analyzing the importance and level of performance in six dimensions of service quality (Tangibles, Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance, Empathy and Accessibility) to produce performance (performance) that can satisfy customers. The data analysis of this research was conducted by qualitative descriptive method, to answer the problem formulation about how to improve the quality of health service of Mranggen in accordance with the quality standard set by the Government, then used ""Importance-Performance Analysis"" with Cartesian diagram, the number of samples of this study 75 respondents taken from three Puskesmas available at Puskesmas Mranggen. The result of the research shows that the dimension of Responsiveness is the main priority to improve the quality of service because it has the highest importance of 81.3%, while the performance is still low with the level of conformity of 71%, while the next sequence based on the level of conformity is Assurance dimension, Accessibility, Tangibles, Reliability, and Empathy. Thus the whole health centre Mranggen considered good enough from the level of customer satisfaction."
L84|The Effect of Social Media on Employees’ Job Performance: The mediating Role of Organizational Structure|Social media is creating a drastic change at workplaces, and organizations are increasingly interested in adaption of it for their business processes. The aim of social media usage at workplace may differ but ultimate objective is to build social networks and sharing. This empirical research examined the effect of use of social media on employees’ job performance and the mediating effect of an organizational structure. Survey data gathered from 205 valid responses and analyzed by structural equation modelling technique. Results revealed that “use of social media” is positively correlated with “employees’ job performance”, while organizational structure has positive mediating effect.
L84|Buyer-Seller Relationship-An Analysis Of Customer Service Experience With Barber Shop|It?s broadly accepted that to understand customer is a problem. Hence every service providers attract different customer groups. This customer group?s level of fulfillment will also change. It?s normally observed that satisfied customer use to avail the repetitive services from the same seller or service provider. But other way around, there are also some customers, notwithstanding satisfaction from the existing service providers, they defect. It?s fact that 100 % customer retention is not possible practically though seller try to retain the customers. This has an implication on the service provider?s income, productivity and growth. The paper highlights the matters and policies which construct or destruct the buyer-seller relationship with especially reference to the Barber?s services. On the basis of several situations which barber come across customer, that has been explained with reference to the diverse situations to which barber get exposed to.
L84|An Evaluation of Talent Management with the Department of Arts and Culture in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa|One of the problems faced by today?s organisations is the need to stay current and adapt to the evolving environmental, market, economic and workforce conditions. ?It has become clear that the most important organisational asset, especially in knowledge intensive organisations depend on its employees?. Organisations now have to put more emphasis on recruiting and retaining top performing employees. This has given rise to talent management. The aim of the study was to evaluate talent management at KZN Department of Arts and Culture and the purpose of the study was to: identify if the Departments strategic HR policies are hindering or supporting their talent efforts and to determine what talent management practices should be put in place to in order to attract, develop and retain high performing employees and to get an understanding of how the Departments employees feel about the current state of events. A quantitative study was conducted where an electronic questionnaire was sent to the Arts and Culture employees. The population size of the study was 300 Arts and Culture employees who had e-mail and internet access. Of the 300 employees, a total of 170 responded to the questionnaire giving a 57% response rate. The main findings of the study were that the Department of Arts and Culture KZN did not have a talent management strategy nor talent management policies. The respondents scored the department low on issues such as promotion, sourcing candidates internally and financial assistance to study further. The Department will need to pay special attention to those items. On the upside, the majority of employees stated that they were the right fit for their positions either by their academic qualification or work experience. This is well and good but certain employees hold qualifications that allow them to be able to perform at higher levels than what they are on currently. There are no policies in place to address this, and currently nothing has been done to find talent within the Department. The Department can introduce programmes such as job rotation, mentoring system, cross training and regular career discussions as a start which can be implemented by the Senior Managers in each Directorate. Policies should be implemented which allow for horizontal movements and internal recruitment since the lack of is one of the main sources of dissatisfaction amongst the Departments employees.
L84|On the Economics of Audit Partner Tenure and Rotation: Evidence from PCAOB Data|This paper provides the first partner tenure and rotation analysis for a large cross-section of U.S. publicly listed firms over an extended period. We analyze the effects on audit quality as well as economic tradeoffs related to partner tenure and rotation with respect to audit hours and fees. On average, we find no evidence for audit quality declines over the tenure cycle and little support for fresh-look benefits after rotations. Nevertheless, partner rotations have significant economic consequences. We find increases in audit fees and decreases in audit hours over the tenure cycle, which differ by partner experience, client size, and competitiveness of the local audit market. More generally, our findings are consistent with efforts by the audit firms to minimize disruptions and audit failures around mandatory rotations. We also analyze special circumstances, such as audit firm switches and early partner rotations, and show that they are more disruptive than mandatory rotations, and also more likely to exhibit audit quality effects.
L84|Modeling the Revolving Revolution: The Debt Collection Channel|We investigate the role of information technology (IT) in the collection of delinquent consumer debt. We argue that the widespread adoption of IT by the debt collection industry in the 1990s contributed to the observed expansion of unsecured risky lending such as credit cards. Our model stresses the importance of delinquency and private information about borrower solvency. The prevalence of delinquency implies that the costs of debt collection must be borne by lenders to sustain incentives to repay debt. IT mitigates informational asymmetries, allowing lenders to concentrate collection efforts on delinquent borrowers who are more likely to repay.
L84|Timing of Proactive Organizational Consulting: Difference between Organizational Perception and Behaviour|The aim of this paper is to show organizational perceptions and behaviours regarding proactive search for consultancy services. Management consulting is operating primarily through the analysis of perceived and existing organizational problems, but on the other hand it could be considered as a creation of value for organizations through the application of knowledge, techniques and, assets to improve organizational performance which is in the unknown and hidden potential part of organizational Johari window. Perceptions of organization are shown through managers and consultants perceptions survey in southeast Europe region. From the other side as an empirical base of real managerial behaviours there is a database of companies which had been proactively asking for consultancy services in southeast Europe region. This research is based on Adizes Institute database, which is the reason we have introduced the Adizes Corporate Lifecycle model theory. We will show the difference of perceptions at what stage in lifecycle organizations should engage consultant help and reality, when companies actually do that. We will use data analysis results to discuss whether timing when organizations decide to proactively engage consultants is the right time for such engagement.
L84|Study on the Development of Quality Measurements Models for Steering Business Services in Relation to Customer Satisfaction|The growing competition in the market, higher customer demands and globalisation forces the business service providers to improve their services much faster. Nowadays, it is not enough to provide good quality it is more important to delight the customers and to deliver more than they expect. Likewise, renowned research companies predicted that customer satisfaction will become the competitive differentiator within the next years. Thus, the main reasons of the present study are at first, establishing a common understanding on the term “quality” and presenting the relationship between customer satisfaction and service quality. Secondly, the study summarizes the identified factors, which mostly influence the customer satisfaction, as well as the common methods used to measure service quality in relation to these factors. Thirdly, the authors introduce and explain the newly developed six step model for establishing an effective measurement method for service quality and the proposed three level service quality model with the related measurements and outcomes. Both models will assist business service providers to protect and improve their service quality and with that their customer satisfaction. The methodology used for this research is a systematic literature review focused on subjects of quality, customer satisfaction and best-practice metrics for service quality. In addition, surveys and studies from well-known research companies were evaluated. The outcome of the study is always focused on the business service area.
L84|Caracterización de los actores del clúster BPO - ITO - KPO en Cali (2014 - 2016)|Studies based on cluster mapping allow to understand the potential of certain industrial sectors and its relevance in the economy of a region, in such a way that businessmen, the academia and State, can have a reference for decision making that will promote the cluster’s dynamism and as a consequence, the socio-economic development of the region. This document is the result of the study of the socio-economic characterization of the actors, based on the technique of cluster mapping of the sectors BPO KPO and ITO and related to the city of Cali, Valle del Cauca, Colombia in 2014 and 2016. The motivation to carry it out was based on the support that the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali has been providing to the Major’s office of Cali, initially to the “Program of Cluster Promotion and Strengthening of the Secretary of Planning” (Programa de Fomento y Fortalecimiento de Clúster de la Secretaría de Planeación), as support to cluster-related initiatives; in this case, to PacificShore, businessmen that received a copy of this study in June 2016 to be analyzed. More recently (August 2017), the study for the recently constituted Secretary of Economic Development of Santiago de Cali has been updated, that has the purpose of encouraging the development of this type of industries in the city. The version here presented corresponds to the updated study.
L84|Moderating Effect of Access to Finance on the Relationship between Total Quality Management, Market Orientation and Small and Medium Enterprises Performance: A Proposed Framework|This study proposed a framework for the moderating effect of access to finance (AF) on the relationship between total quality management (TQM), market orientation (MO) and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) performance in Nigeria. However, relatively few studies have attempted to consider the relationship between TQM, MO and SMEs performance. The majority of the studies conducted on the relationship between the construct have presented different findings. In order to bridge the gap, a moderating effect of AF is introduce or proposed based on the suggestions of the literature. The study is significant to policy makers, government, regulators, and financial institutions on the need to provide AF to the real and potential entrepreneurs for SMEs development in Nigeria. In addition, the study will serve as additional literature to few studies on SMEs performance particularly in emerging economies like Nigeria that has not been explored.
L84|Dispersion and Volatility of TFPQ in Service Industries|This study, using microdata on narrowly-defined service industries, presents empirical findings on the cross-sectional dispersion and time-series volatility of total factor productivity (TFP). The novelty of this study lies in its use of high-frequency, establishment-level panel data to compare the physical measure of productivity (TFPQ) and revenue-based productivity (TFPR) in the service industries. According to the analysis, first, TFPQ and TFPR are highly correlated with each other in terms of cross-section as well as time-series dimensions. Second, the within-industry dispersion of TFPQ is not larger than that of TFPR, which differs from past studies on the manufacturing sector. Third, TFPQ dispersion is lower when aggregated industry-level TFPQ is higher, and vice versa. Fourth, service producers with highly volatile TFP are less productive.
L84|Competition Makes Inspectors More Lenient: Evidence from the Motor Vehicle Inspection Market|We examine the impact of competition on firms' leniency towards their customers in a heavily regulated market, which is consciously designed to mitigate incentives to deviate from the regulation. Using a panel data set representing 22.5 million periodic vehicle roadworthiness tests during the period 2010-2015, we show that inspection stations operating in more competitive markets are more lenient to their customers than stations operating in less competitive markets. We present both fixed effects and instrumental variable estimates of the effect of competition on firms' incentive to be lenient to their customers.
L84|Opening Hours Decision and Competition in the Motor Vehicle Inspection Market|This paper examines the effect of competition on a firm's choice of opening hours in the motor vehicle inspection market. Competition affects the incentive inspection firms face when choosing opening hours, which influences the probability that consumers find service time that best matches their preferred time. We use 2SLS analyses to resolve the potential endogeneity of market entry decisions. Using a detailed monthly firm-level panel data for all inspection firms in Sweden, we find that increased competition, measured using both the number of firms in a geographic market and average distance to nearby competitors, leads to expanded opening hours. The probability that inspection firms offer services on weekends also increases with local competition.
L84|サービス業生産性の動態分析 : Tfpの企業間格差とヴォラティリティ|本稿は、狭く定義されたサービス業種を対象に、生産性のクロスセクションでの分散と時系列での動態に関する実証的事実を提示する。高頻度のミクロ時系列データを使用し、サービス業の生産性を数量ベースの生産性指標（TFPQ）と金銭ベースの指標（TFPR）を比較しつつ分析した研究は、おそらく初めてのものである。分析結果によれば、第一に、TFPQとTFPRの変動は、事業所レベルで高い相関関係がある。第二に、生産性の事業所間格差は、一般にTFPQよりもTFPRの方が大きい。これは製造業を対象とした先行研究とは異なる結果である。第三に、産業平均のTFPが高いときは、一般にTFPの事業所格差が小さく、産業平均のTFPが低いときは格差が大きい傾向がある。第四に、TFPの時系列でのヴォラティリティが高い事業所ほど、平均的な生産性水準が低い。以上の結果は、相対的に生産性の低い事業所において、需要平準化の潜在的利益が大きいことを示唆している。

L84|Dispersion and Volatility of TFPQ in Service Industries|This study, using microdata on narrowly-defined service industries, presents empirical findings on the cross-sectional dispersion and time-series volatility of total factor productivity (TFP). The novelty of this study lies in its use of high-frequency, establishment-level panel data to compare the physical measure of productivity (TFPQ) and revenue-based productivity (TFPR) in the service industries. According to the analysis, first, TFPQ and TFPR are highly correlated with each other in terms of cross-section as well as time-series dimensions. Second, the within-industry dispersion of TFPQ is not necessarily larger than that of TFPR, which differs from past studies on the manufacturing sector. Third, TFPQ dispersion is lower when aggregated industry-level TFPQ is higher, and vice versa. Fourth, service producers with highly volatile TFP are less productive.
L84|Innovation and location in German knowledge intensive business service firms|"""Knowledge Intensive Business Services (KIBS) are widely perceived as being important drivers of technological progress and innovation. KIBS are generally understood as depending, driving and thriving on knowledge exchanges and therefore, geographical proximity to markets, customers and suppliers would be expected to be a critical factor in their performance. This paper investigates how the innovation performance and processes of KIBS firms are related to their distance from the nearest city and also to the size of the nearest city. For this purpose we make use of detailed firm level data and consider Germany as a research field. While most current evidence on this topic emerges from Canada, we complements and add to this existing literature on the geography of KIBS by examining these issues in the German spatial setting which largely conforms to a textbook type of spatial urban hierarchy. Our probit results indeed find that there are very strong distance decay and city size effects, and these also vary according to the innovation type."" (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en))"
L84|Digital Labor Markets and Global Talent Flows|Digital labor markets are rapidly expanding and connecting companies and contractors on a global basis. We review the environment in which these markets take root, the micro- and macro-level studies of their operations, their ongoing evolution and recent trends, and perspectives for undertaking research with micro-data from these labor platforms. We undertake new empirical analyses of Upwork data regarding 1) the alignment of micro- and macro-level approaches to disproportionate ethnic-connected exchanges on digital platforms, 2) gravity model analyses of global outsourcing contract flows and their determinants for digital labor markets, and 3) quantification of own- and cross-country elasticities for contract work by wage rate. Digital labor markets are an exciting frontier for global talent flows and growing rapidly in importance.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L84|Are Recessions Good for Staffing in Nursing Homes?|The quality and cost of care in nursing homes depend critically on the number and types of nurses. Recent research suggests that the nursing supply adjusts to macroeconomic conditions. However, prior work has failed to consider the effect of macroeconomic conditions on demand for nurses through the effect on revenues. We test how county-level unemployment rates affect direct-care staffing rates in nursing homes using California data. We exploit the wide variation in the unemployment rates across counties and over time in 2005â€“12. We also test whether there are heterogeneous effects of unemployment rates by facility size, staffing level, and profit status. We find that as unemployment rates increase, staffing by registered nurses (RNs) decreases but staffing by licensed practical nurses (LPNs) increases. The increase in LPNs is larger in large nursing homes, nursing homes with higher staffing levels, and in for-profit nursing homes. We also find that as unemployment rates increase, nursing home revenue decreases. While the effect of macroeconomic conditions on nursing supply may be important for cost and quality of care, the mechanism is not simple, direct, or homogeneous for all types of nurses and nursing homes.
L84|On the Economics of Audit Partner Tenure and Rotation: Evidence from PCAOB Data|This paper provides the first partner tenure and rotation analysis for a large cross-section of U.S. publicly listed firms over an extended period. We analyze the effects on audit quality as well as economic tradeoffs related to partner tenure and rotation with respect to audit hours and fees. On average, we find no evidence for audit quality declines over the tenure cycle and little support for fresh-look benefits after rotations. Nevertheless, partner rotations have significant economic consequences. We find increases in audit fees and decreases in audit hours over the tenure cycle, which differ by partner experience, client size, and competitiveness of the local audit market. More generally, our findings are consistent with efforts by the audit firms to minimize disruptions and audit failures around mandatory rotations. We also analyze special circumstances, such as audit firm switches and early partner rotations, and show that they are more disruptive than mandatory rotations, and also more likely to exhibit audit quality effects.
L84|Trade in services related to the environment|This paper discusses the nature and scope of international trade in environmentally related services, and analyses the implications that services trade restrictions have on the provisions of these services domestically and abroad. Numerous services appear crucial to the delivery and proper functioning of environmental goods and equipment be they a wastewater-treatment facility or a renewable power plant. By helping lower the costs of these services and improving access to world-class suppliers, trade policy can contribute alongside energy and environmental policy to the prevention and abatement of greenhouse-gas emissions and pollution in all its forms. Besides clarifying the role and scope of services related to the environment, the analysis undertaken in this paper suggests that the restrictions that countries impose on services trade may have a detrimental effect on the provision of environmental activities through the establishment by specialised firms of a commercial presence abroad, i.e. through mode 3 trade in services.
L84|Effectiveness and Challenges of Recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) in the Indian Hotel Sector|The present study tries of evaluate the effectiveness and challenges faced by adopting RPO practice in the India Hotel sector. The research objectives are driven from the purpose of the research which deals with distinct issues related to RPO and various perspectives of utilizing RPO. These objectives guided in identifying factors influencing the rationale for outsourcing the recruitment processes. The need for RPO has gained significance with the impact of organizational structure, stringent project deadlines, insufficient time for internal HR department for recruiting personnel, inefficiencies in integrating all stages of recruitment and expansion of geographies. The study is developed on building a theoretical framework which is prepared through analysing previous literature about outsourcing, and their utilization and efficiency in organizations. Mixed method approach has been followed to analyse with better validity and exploration of the context related to the effectiveness of RPO in the Indian hotel sector. The key findings indicated that the culture was positive influence on the usage of RPO in the organizations, in terms of adopting RPO during expansion of geographies and globalization. Also, the organizational structure was the major challenge in adopting these practices along with monitoring the outsourcing activities, lack of communication and inefficient HR practices.
L84|Triple Helix Model’s (THM) impact on enhancing creativity and skills within UAE public and private sectors|Organizations and businesses cannot depend completely on their own to generate new ideas for innovation and development in present knowledge based societies. Consequently, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced 2015 as the Year of Innovation and excellence awards have been established aiming to boost cooperation between various sectors in the country. Therefore, the concept of the Triple Helix (university–industry–government) was found as a model of innovation. The aim of this research is to establish the impact of a Triple Helix approach on enhancing creativity and skills within UAE public and private sectors. It explores the concept of the Triple Helix Model (THM) in the context of the UAE public and private sectors focusing on its existence, implementation, barriers and drivers. Methods of analysis include both qualitative and quantitative approach in which a conceptual framework was derived from the literature review, a survey was developed and distributed to a sample of employees from different organizations, and follow-up interviews were carried out with key stakeholders (in which their departments are implementing/ involved in the THM). The findings exposed the stakeholders’ perception about the importance of the concept and each actor’s role in the THM, the limited utilization of the concept among the organizations, and the challenges in terms of relational barriers and knowledge sharing. The research findings reveal that TH approach has a positive influence on enhancing creativity and skills within UAE sectors and several recommendations have been proposed such as leadership involvement and support, designing organizational innovation strategy, and the addition of society helix.
L84|Should the US Eliminate Entry Barriers to the Practice of Law? Perspectives Shaped by Industry Deregulation|States' requirements that lawyers obtain a license to practice law, as well as American Bar Association (ABA) regulations of legal practice, constitute barriers to entry to the legal profession. In this paper, we argue that eliminating entry barriers in legal services would generate benefits that are similar to those resulting from deregulating U.S. network industries (i.e., transportation, communications, and energy.) Specifically, prices would fall as competition from incumbent firms and new entrants intensifies; in the long run, competitive forces and operating freedom would incentivize firms to produce innovations that significantly benefit consumers and the broader economy.
L84|Knowledge-Intensive Business Services and Business Consulting Services in Romanian Changing Economic Environment|The impact of the knowledge based society, especially on knowledge intensive business services, proved to have a really significant influence on the development of services industry. Consultancy services are acknowledged as innovation-intensive and knowledge-intensive business services at the same time. On the base of qualitative and quantitative research, by combining the disparities analysis with logical ranking, critical assessments and explanatory associations, comparative analysis, and empirical research, this article aims to contribute to a better appreciation and understanding of the consultancy services sector in Romania, as part of the larger family of knowledge intensive business services. The regional differences of business and personalized consultancy services are considered for discussion and revealed in the specific of the national network that has a clearly defined center. The concentration of the consultancy companies and most employees in four regions reflects the theory according to which the supply of these services is unevenly distributed, following the potential clients from better developed areas of the country. In all four types of analyzed consultancy activities, the total profit is bigger than economic loss. The disparities between regions are also supported by the dynamic evolution of the consultancy sector in Romania.
L84|Regional Development Fueled by Entrepreneurial Ventures Providing KIBS – Case Study on Romania|The main goal of the current research paper is to analyze the evolution of the knowledge intensive business services sector from Romania, for the period 2008-2014, from a territorial point of view and to assess its impact in the general economic development. Using a time series of Gini coefficients and other quantitative instruments, the paper provides clear evidences that, during the 2008-2014 period, the domain has increased its concentration, Bucharest and the 10 most attractive counties being responsible for over 88% from the field’s activity at national level, in 2014. Another important fact is that Bucharest which is responsible for almost 66% of the field’s activity, in 2008, is diminishing constantly its importance during the analyzed period. Using panel regression, the presented research brings clear evidence that the main characteristics of the field (KIBS sector): number of companies, total turnover and number of employees can be used, as independent variables, in econometric models designed to estimate the size of the economy of the Romanian counties.
L84|Real Convergence, Steps from Adherence to Integration|The macroeconomic model Solow-Swan shows that the marginal rates of capital, technology and labor force, with positive values, have the capacity to stimulate the economic growth of the emergent economies, as in the case of Romania, for the 2005-2014 period, facilitating the determination of specific correlations between macroeconomic indicators to analyze the convergence towards the average European Union (EU). The economic theory, highlighted in particular by the Solow-Swan model, was applied in the current paper, to determine the potential of real convergence. Moreover, the statistics for the period 2005-2014 facilitated the analysis of the growth and recession factors specific to economies of Central and Eastern Europe and placed Romania amongst the EU countries with emergent economies and potential of economic growth. The European Commission’s reports regarding the macroeconomic imbalance procedure draw attention on the same indicators presented in the article to address proper recommendations and support corrective measures. Making a step from nominal to real convergence, the latter derives naturally from the need to recoup the gaps in comparison with developed economies amongst countries of the Euro Area.

L84|Franchise From Family Business?|The purpose of this study was to examine the franchise as a form of enterprise in perspective to existing family businesses and how can they operate this way. Why is this form better for them, what advantages it has? In this case an ice cream shop’s economic inidicators were examined ,one which is owned by a hungarian family in Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok county who runs several shops like this. That is why this study was made, to find out if it is possible to run it sucsessfully and what costs does the newcomers in the franchise business network have to pay and how much is the time on the return of investments.
L84|Distorting Economic Balance and its Consequences on the Regional Market of Consulting Services|At the present time on the background of the stagnation of the professional consulting services market, the potential capacity of this market is rather sufficient to be attractive for investments. On the basis of the survey according to the representative selection of consulting companies and representatives of small and medium-sized business of the South-East of the Republic of Tatarstan, the spread between the demand and the supply on the regional market of consulting services was revealed. The market of consulting services in Almetyevsk was analyzed. Based on the obtained results, offers on using the potential of the regional market of consulting services and decreasing the stable “spread” between the demand and the supply were presented.
L84|Knowledge-Intensive Business Services in Russia: 2014–2015 Crisis Aftermath|In recent years, knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) have become extremely important in the knowledge-based economy. KIBS concentrate a well-qualified workforce and create high levels of value-added services, serve as a driver for the innovation-based development of many countries. However, the growth rates of this sector in Russia considerably fell after the 2008 crisis; some KIBS-industries could not even reach pre-crisis volumes of production and the share of this sector in GDP significantly declined. The crisis trends in Russian economy at the end of 2014 and at the beginning of 2015 had a strong negative impact on KIBS. We show that the share of companies with decreasing revenues has dramatically grown in all industries. The demand side has also changed: the client base is now more unstable and customers more regularly fail to fulfill contract obligations. An industry analysis reveals significant divergences in the rates and trajectories for development of Russian KIBS industries. However, the sector heterogeneity might be also found in KIBS of other countries. The paper is based on both survey of 656 Russian KIBS producers and in-depth interviews with 24 leading KIBS experts.
L84|The Role of Lawyers in Social Changes in Developing Countries: Evidence from Russia|This paper reviews the activity of professional legal organizations as factors in the transfer from limited access order (LAO) to open access order (OAO) according to the theory of North, Wallis and Weingast. By analyzing the experience of lawyers’ collective action in developing countries, this paper proposes a decision tree explaining the process of the mobilization of the legal community to counter violations of the law by the ruling elite. It shows that this collective action plays a significant role in implementing the rule of law. However, the efficiency of such collective action in a particular country depends on the institutional capacity of its legal association and on the position of the professional elite leading it. The history of the development of Russian legal advocacy shows that exogenous shocks actually stimulate the collective action of lawyers, which in turn compels the government to respond
L84|Informational Frictions and Practice Variation: Evidence from Physicians in Training|Substantial practice variation across physicians for seemingly similar patients remains an unresolved puzzle. This paper studies physicians in training to explore the behavioral foundations of practice variation. A discontinuity in the formation of teams reveals a large contribution of relative experience in the size of practice variation. Among the same physician trainees, convergence towards a common practice differs by practice environment, with more convergence in specialist-driven services. Rich trainee characteristics and training histories, including the practice styles of prior supervising physicians, explain little if any variation. These findings suggest a major role for informational frictions in the origins of practice variation.
L84|Analyzing the Influence of Occupational Licensing Duration and Grandfathering on Labor Market Outcomes|The length of time from the implementation of an occupational licensing statute (i.e., licensing duration) may matter in influencing labor market outcomes. Adding to or raising the entry barriers are likely easier once an occupation is established and has gained influence in a political jurisdiction. States often enact grandfather clauses and ratchet up requirements that protect existing workers and increase entry costs to new entrants. We analyze the labor market influence of the duration of occupational licensing statutes for 13 major universally licensed occupations over a 75-year period. These occupations comprise the vast majority of workers in these regulated occupations in the United States. We provide among the first estimates of potential economic rents to grandfathering. We find that duration years of occupational licensure are positively associated with wages for continuing and grandfathered workers. The estimates show a positive relationship of duration with hours worked, but we find moderately negative results for participation in the labor market. The universally licensed occupations, however, exhibit heterogeneity in outcomes. Consequently, unlike some other labor market public policies, such as minimum wages or direct unemployment insurance benefits, occupational licensing would likely influence labor market outcomes when measured over a longer period of time.
L84|Retention Strategies to Increase Organizational Commitment and Reduce Employee Turnover in Hospitality Sector of Karachi, Pakistan|"This study aims to explore the relationship between retention strategies and employee turnover. In addition to that, the effectiveness of these strategies to enhance organizational commitment of employees working in the hospitality sector (fast-food chain) of Karachi, Pakistan. The study considered five decades of managerial literature to explain the relationship between variables. Semi-structured matrix based survey questionnaire and open-ended unstructured interview questions as research instruments to investigate the relationship. The research philosophy has been interpretive and deductive research is used. The sample size in this study is 426 participants in survey and 34 interviews with the management from the entire chain of fast-food restaurants in different regions of Karachi. The sampling technique is non-probability ""convenience sampling"". The findings revealed that high employee turnover is due to part time employment and high number of temporary employees or drop out from college and universities. Moreover, there is a relationship between employee turnover and organizational commitment. The higher job satisfactions leads to increase employees' commitment. It is recommended to the management of restaurant that friendly environment and training workshops are essential to retain good quality employees."
L84|Dimension of the Country of Origin Effect in the Perception of Medical Services in EU Countries? an International Comparison|The influence of the country?s images on consumer attitudes has been defined as the country of origin (COO) effect. So far, the research in that field in services has been relatively scarce, and the analysis of expert literature indicated that the question of the COO effect in medical services has been discussed only in one article.The aim of the paper is to provide the answers to the following questions: 1) do the COO dimensions apply to the assessment of medical services?; 2) what is the significance of the particular dimensions in these services?; 3) does the significance of the particular dimensions depend on consumers? origin?Four dimensions have been introduced: innovativeness, diversity, quality, prestige. Study has been carried out in three European countries (Germany, Lithuania and Poland) and the survey sample consists of 264 respondents. The data have been collected with the use of a questionnaire form developed by the authors. Their statistical processing has been provided with the use of a t test and the analysis of variance with repeated measurement.The analysis confirms very high significance of the COO dimensions in medical services, and the fact that the significance is of differentiated nature. The research indicates that Quality and Innovativeness are the most important dimensions as regards medical services. Diversity and Prestige are significantly less important. The differentiation pertaining to the significance of dimensions indirectly indicates that medical services are affected by the COO effect. The analysis indicates that the COO dimensions as well as consumers? origin affect the assessment of the importance pertaining to a particular dimension, however the pattern of dimension preference is similar in all three countries. The results of the research may be applied in economic practice: in marketing operations of service providers and in operations of institutions which deal with shaping the image of their country and its positioning in the international environment.
L84|Young Professionals? Intentions To Make Use Of Financial Planning Services: A South African Perspective|The global financial crisis coupled with an increase in life expectancy, declining working age population and economic pressures have heightened the need to be active in analysing financial resources. In South Africa, national and global economic pressures, rising health care costs and other societal factors have caused the vast majority of the population to remain underprepared financially. Young professionals are ideally positioned to combat these pressures, due to the benefits of having a longer time horizon to save and invest. However, research has shown that young professionals fail to take advantage of financial planning services early enough in life. Therefore the purpose of this study was to investigate the factors influencing the intentions of young professionals? to make use of financial planning services. From the literature, four factors were identified, namely Financial goals and objectives, Financial knowledge, Role of a financial planner and Personal circumstances. A measuring instrument, in the form of a self-administered questionnaire, was distributed to 350 respondents residing in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces of South Africa. The data collected yielded 284 usable questionnaires which were subjected to various statistical analyses. An exploratory factor analysis was undertaken and Cronbach?s alpha coefficients were calculated to assess the validity and reliability of the measuring instrument respectively. Descriptive statistics were calculated to summarise the sample data and the hypothesised relationships were assessed by means of multiple regression analysis. The results of this study show that Financial goals and objectives, Role of a financial planner and Financial knowledge were found to have a significant influence on the Intentions to make use of financial planning services. Based on the results the study, recommendations and suggestions for further research were provided.
L84|Human resource management practices and organizational performance. The mediator role of immaterial satisfaction in Italian Social Cooperatives|The paper deals with the mediating role of immaterial satisfaction between substantive human resources (HR) features and organizational performance. We address this relationship in the Italian social service sector using a survey dataset that includes 4134 workers and 320 not-for-profit social cooperatives. The obtained results show that human resource management (HRM) practices influence immaterial satisfaction and, satisfaction positively impacts on firm performance. However, the impact of the different HRM practices is not the same. In this sense, worker involvement and workload pressure have a positive impact on firm performance; but task autonomy or collaborative teamwork do not have impact on organizational performance.
L84|The Effect of Product Demand on Inequality: Evidence from the United States and the United Kingdom|"Using Consumer Expenditure Survey data this paper shows that more educated workers demand more high-skill-intensive services and, to a lesser extent, more very low-skill-intensive services (such as personal services). Additional evidence at the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level shows that this ""education elasticity of demand"" mechanism can explain part of the correlation between the share of college-educated workers in a city and the employment share of service industries. The parametrization of a simple model suggests that this induced demand shift can explain around 6.5 percent of the relative demand shift in the United States between 1984 and 2002. Similar results are provided for the United Kingdom. (JEL D12, J24, J31, L84)"
L84|The Best of Times, the Worst of Times: Understanding Pro-cyclical Mortality|It is well-known that mortality rates are pro-cyclical. In this paper, we attempt to understand why. We find little evidence that cyclical changes in individuals' own employment-related behavior drives the relationship; own-group employment rates are not systematically related to own-group mortality. Further, most additional deaths that occur when the economy is strong are among the elderly, particularly elderly women and those residing in nursing homes. We also demonstrate that staffing in nursing homes moves countercyclically. These findings suggest that cyclical fluctuations in the quality of health care may be a critical contributor to cyclical movements in mortality. (JEL E24, E32, I12, J16, L84)
L84|Litigation in Spain 2001-2010: Exploring the market for legar services|There is empirical evidence of a cross-country positive association between the number of lawyers per capita and the extent of litigation. For instance, Spain has more litigation and more lawyers per capita than most OECD countries. How should this association be interpreted? In this paper we analyse the variation in both variables across Spanish provinces during the period 2001-2010, by means of an instrumental variable approach, to shed some light on the sources of the statistical association between them. Finally, implications of the results are discussed.
L84|Competition in the Audit Market: Policy Implications|The audit market's unique combination of features—its role in capital market transparency, mandated demand, and concentrated supply—means it receives considerable attention from policy makers. We explore the effects of two market scenarios that have been the focus of policy discussions: mandatory audit firm rotation and further supply concentration due to the exit of a “Big 4” audit firm. To do so, we first estimate publicly traded firms' demand for auditing services, allowing the services provided by each of the Big 4 to be differentiated products. We then use those estimates to calculate how each scenario would affect client firms' consumer surplus. We estimate that, for U.S. publicly trade firms, mandatory audit firm rotation would induce consumer surplus losses of approximately $2.7 billion if rotation were required after 10 years and $4.7–5.0 billion if after only four years. We find similarly that exit by one of the Big 4 would reduce client firms' surplus by $1.4–1.8 billion. These estimates reflect only the value of firms' lost options to hire the exiting audit firm; they do not include likely fee increases resulting from less competition among audit firms. The latter could result in audit fee increases between $0.75–1.3 billion per year for mandatory rotation and $0.47–0.58 billion per year for the disappearance of a Big 4 audit firm. Such losses are substantial; by comparison, total audit fees for public firms were $11 billion in 2010.
L84|Educational Policies And Initiatives For Improved Performance|According to Gartner estimates, due to increased variety, speed and data volume, by 2015 there will be a global demand of 4.4 million professionals for real-time analysis of data from sources with different structures, but only one third of the demand will be met. The purpose of this research is to identify possible solutions for improved academic results in the IT domain, considering the time management policies, the content and the student motivations, as well as the business strategy tendencies. These proposals are targeted toward meeting the IT specialists demand. The research is composed of two parts: the first explores the Romanian IT labour market characteristics, while the second investigates the academic education policies that can help mitigate deficiencies and attain higher performance. The deficiencies are identified through a series of statistical research and analysis based on national level databases, adopting a quantitative approach. The policies proposed are supported by a flow model developed considering the students' activity, motivation, traits and results, measured and analysed quantitatively.
L84|The Effect of Regulatory Harmonization on Cross‐Border Labor Migration: Evidence from the Accounting Profession|The paper examines whether international regulatory harmonization increases cross‐border labor migration. To study this question, we analyze European Union initiatives that harmonized accounting and auditing standards. Regulatory harmonization should reduce economic mobility barriers, essentially making it easier for accounting professionals to move across countries. Our research design compares the cross‐border migration of accounting professionals relative to tightly matched other professionals before and after regulatory harmonization. We find that international labor migration in the accounting profession increases significantly relative to other professions. We provide evidence that this effect is due to harmonization, rather than increases in the demand for accounting services during the implementation of the rule changes. The findings illustrate that diversity in rules constitutes an economic barrier to cross‐border labor mobility and, more specifically, that accounting harmonization can have a meaningful effect on cross‐border migration.
L84|Caracterización del Sector de Servicios a las Empresas en Manizales| Este documento se construyó con base en el análisis de la información recolectada durante el proyecto de Censo Sectorial Manizales 2015 realizado desde el Área de Investigaciones Socioeconómicas de la Cámara de Comercio de Manizales por Caldas. En aquel proyecto se realizó la recolección de la información mediante visitas a la sede principal de las empresas pertenecientes al sector según la base de Registro Mercantil1. Para este fin se seleccionaron, previo análisis, el listado de empresas tomando como referencia la Clasificación Internacional Industrial Uniforme - CIIU revisión 4 adaptada para Colombia del DANE (2012). La justificación del presente estudio de Caracterización del sector de servicios a las empresas en Manizales responde a la clara importancia que ha adquirido este sector en los últimos años en las diversas economías a nivel mundial, la expansión que ha tenido dentro de la generación de valor agregado en la economía nacional y local, y la necesidad de información estratégica que sirva como fuente para conocer la estructura de las empresas del sector en la ciudad y sus respectivas debilidades, fortalezas y potencialidades.
L84|Do lawyers induce litigation? Evidence from Spain, 2001–2010|There are important theoretical reasons to support the idea that lawyers induce litigation. However, estimating empirically that relationship is problematic given a standard endogeneity problem: if lawyers generate litigation, additional litigation attracts more lawyers. According to recent studies, Spain has more litigation and more lawyers per capita than most OECD countries. In this paper we test for the relationship between the number of lawyers and litigation in Spain by making use of instrumental variables, in the period 2001–2010. Specifically, we construct two groups of instrumental variables related to the number of law schools founded in Spain by 1968 and to the distance between the current provincial capitals to the historical capital of their university district (where it was possible to study law) in 1845. The results show that the number of lawyers has a positive effect on litigation. However, from our econometric analysis we do not find an obvious problem of simultaneity for the period considered. Policy implications are derived.
L84|The frontiers of auditing research|Purpose - – The purpose of this paper is to examine issues at the frontiers of auditing research. After the global financial crisis and the earlier round of reforms, there are many opportunities for research, some driven by current proposals for reforms and some by fundamental research issues. Research can contribute to the development of policy in response to current issues. Research can also be valuable in exploring issues raised in past research. Design/methodology/approach - – Issues that are currently of concern to regulators and for which research would be of value are reviewed, together with fundamental issues arising from previous research. Findings - – The introduction of independent regulation, increasing levels of globalization and increased attention to research by regulatory bodies have drawn attention to some research issues, especially auditors providing non-audit services, rotation of audit firms, joint audits and ways to provide increased competition. In addition, there are a number of areas in which there seems to be an obvious need for auditing research, but surprisingly little research is being done. These topics include the impact of higher-quality auditing in developing economies, and assurance for other entities such as charities and small companies. As more attention is now being given to auditing research, there are opportunities in established areas of research as well. Originality/value - – Research is starting to make a contribution in policy making with relation to auditing, but there is still a need for much more research. The paper provides guidance on areas where further research will be valuable.
L84|How To Deal With Knowledge In Small Companies? Defining Emergent Km Approach|This paper examines the concept of emergent KM approach in small companies. The origins of consideration are grounded in the theory of strategic management literature and in particular in the distinction between deliberate versus emergent approach towards strategic planning. Using the methodology of case study, we carried out an explorative research to analyse the characteristics of KM approach in two small companies located in Italy and Poland. Both companies appeared to follow emergent KM approach and therefore, a detailed analysis of this phenomenon was feasible. A description of the main features of an emergent KM approach is then proposed. On the basis of research results, implications for both managers and researchers are discussed.
L84|Self-regulation of the legal profession and quality in the market for legal services: an economic analysis of lawyers’ reputation|Our article intends to show that self-regulation of the legal profession helps to regulate the quality of legal services in a market characterized by strong information asymmetries. Our model highlights the role of the collective reputation of the profession jointly with the individual reputation of lawyers to sustain high quality. It shows that a high-quality steady state exists in a market for legal services and that the likelihood of high quality increases when the market is self-regulated by the legal profession as compared with the situation where there is no self-regulation. Moreover, the profession has an incentive to maintain a good collective reputation as this increases the clients’ willingness to pay for legal services and, therefore, the rent that accrues to lawyers as a whole.

L84|The economics of research, consulting, and teaching quality: theory and evidence from a technical university| We investigate the effect of both research and consulting on teaching quality in higher education, at the individual level. We propose a theoretical model in which academics allocate effort between the three activities, over a two period time horizon, under the assumption of positive spillovers from research to both consulting opportunities and teaching, and of life-cycle effects on incentives. Propositions from the model are tested against data from a mid-sized Italian engineering faculty. We find that teaching quality is negatively related to consulting and positively related to research experience. However, both relationships are not linear, due to the importance of several mediating factors, such as seniority and the role of scientific publications as a signal for attracting consulting opportunities.
L84|Combining knowledge bases in transnational innovation - microfoundations and the geography of organization|The aim of the paper is to contribute both conceptually and empirically to a deeper understanding of the territorial shaping of knowledge combination and its development dynamics underpinning innovation. The importance of combining and integrating knowledge bases from different sources, geographical scales and heterogeneous actors is increasingly recognized in innovation studies. Yet, the question of what limits or enables knowledge combinations in innovation processes and what generates relatedness among unrelated knowledge bases in time and space is not fully answered. Conceptually the paper suggests a more specific focus on microfoundations and temporality by taking into account the economics of organization in more detail. This appears a particularly promising approach, as the causal relations and mechanisms across and between aggregated levels such as firms, sectors, regions, or nations are not well understood. Empirically the paper explores the micro-dynamics of knowledge combination and its territorial shaping from a transnational perspective. German-Chinese innovation projects in sustainable construction are investigated by using the methodology of innovation biography. This method allows following the time-space path of innovation. It enables capturing knowledge interactions and their unfolding in multi-scalar and cross-sectoral ways. The results underline a very dynamic geography of organization and barriers for knowledge integration at the micro-level rooted in organizational and institutional path dependencies. The investigation in the interplay between more permanent and temporary organizational forms and its geography holds a large potential for further research to provide new insights into the spatiality of combining knowledge bases in innovation processes.
L84|KIBS for public needs|Abstract Knowledge intensive business services (KIBS) are special in that they rely on knowledge exchange between service providers and consumers and thus intensive cooperation between the two parties is essential at all stages. This implies approaches to find the “right” provider may have to differ from those used in the sector of more homogeneous services and goods. Public procurement regulation aims to improve competitiveness, yet does this help achieving the best value for money in the procurement of KIBS? Legislative constraints on the types of admissible public procurement mechanisms may have an undesirable effect on the provider selection, meaning that services may not be purchased from the most efficient or the most suitable provider. As a benchmark, private consumers are unconstrained in their choice of KIBS providers. We exploit this difference to study the efficiency of KIBS purchases by the public sector, as compared to that in the private sector. Using the 2007 and 2011 waves of a unique survey of KIBS consumers in Russia, we find, inter alia, that the public sector reports lower satisfaction from KIBS and admits a lower level of co-production than the private sector. Our main recommendations refer to the optimal choice of public procurement methods.
L84|Profile Of The Micro Businesswoman In Puerto Rico, Perfil De La Empresaria De Micro Empresas En Puerto Rico|During the last three decades participation of women in the labor market and business has increased significantly. Yet the attention of specialists in this field focuses on the participation of employment and not on business promoters. The few studies on the subject emphasize the reasons women have to start a business are the need for independence in carrying out its work, the frustration with the inequality they face in their careers and the lack of a job with a flexibility schedule that allows them to meet their domestic activities. This research aims to identify the profile of women entrepreneurs in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The validated questionnaire of the doctoral thesis: Factors affecting new businesses created by women, defended at the School of Business Administration and Management in Barcelona, Spain (Valencia Silva, 2010) was used to collect and analyze data for this empirical research. The instrument was self-administered to 89 women entrepreneurs in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in the period of October 2013 to February 2014. Surveys were processed in the SPSS software. The main results are the following: the average age to undertake predominates in women of 31 to 55 years, 95% have university education, 65% have dependents, 56.2% develop business plans and 48% belong to professional associations. The predominant sector is the service followed by trade. They undertake motivated by the conjunction of need and opportunity.
L84|The occupations of regulators influence occupational regulation: evidence from the US private security industry|Licensing requirements for US private security firms and guards differ substantially from state to state. State regulatory institutions for this industry also vary considerably. Some states have specialized regulatory boards with industry personnel (guards, firm owners) and/or public police as board members, while others rely on non-specialized regulators such as Departments of Commerce, State, Professional Regulation, or Consumer Affairs. These cross-state variations in licensing requirements and regulatory institutions provide an opportunity to explore relationships between the two. Private security regulation is of particular interest in this context because previous empirical research implies that allocating more resources to private security reduces crime, and that relatively stringent licensing requirements limit entry, thereby increasing crime. A panel of 1991–2010 state data is employed to see if particular regulatory institutions are associated with particular licensing requirements. Empirical results suggest that requirements for entry into this market tend to be relatively strict when active private security personnel are in control of licensing, and that different patterns of regulation generally apply when police or non-specialized agencies control licensing. Therefore, both public-interest and private-interest explanations for the observed relationships between the structure of regulatory institutions and resulting licensing requirements are discussed.

L84|State funeral regulations: inside the black box|This study estimates the effects of state regulations affecting funeral markets. It accounts for multiple major categories of regulations and demand inducement as well as direct price effects. While concurring with prior studies that find ready-to-embalm regulations increase funeral costs and decrease the percentage of cremations, this study finds that several other state regulations are associated with significantly higher receipts per death. The regulation with the largest apparent effect on average funeral costs is the direct disposition license, which is associated with a $1250 reduction in receipts per death. Restrictive regulations affect the revenues of funeral homes and services to a much greater extent than they affect the revenues of cemeteries and crematories, and in some cases the regulations even increase funeral homes and services’ share of industry revenues. Thus, it appears that funeral homes receive most of the benefits of regulation. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015

L84|Independent Economic Think Tanks in Russia: Evolution and Developmental Prospects|The paper analyzes the current state and performance of Russia’s think tanks operating in the area of economic analysis. It identifies the main stages of development of this sector, which is new for the country, and the factors shaping its key characteristics. It is argued that overall economic think tanks in Russia have reached a stage of relative maturity, but at the same time the sector has been facing serious problems limiting its further development. The paper emphasizes that in the situation of economic crisis there should be a larger role for independent expertise in supporting development of new economic policies. However, the potential of Russian think tanks could be utilized effectively only if there is a change in the current composition of demand for expertise, to be driven by emergence of new stakeholders who are interested in quality policy research. To maintain professional standards and promote high quality of expertise, collective actions of think tanks themselves are equally important. The paper relies on the results of two surveys of Russian think tanks, undertaken in 2012—2013 and 2015, and also on the interviews with a group of their managers.
L84|Strengthening the Independence of the Attorneys’ Community in Russia: The Demand of the Population and Business, Human Capital, and Professional Associations|The article analyzes social and economic factors that provide Russian attorneys an opportunity to compensate the institutional weakness of their profession, to protect the independency and effectively defend the interests of the clients. As an indicator of dependent position of attorney we use the proportion of cases with plea bargaining. Using the date of representative nationwide survey of 3317 attorneys in Russia we conclude that the independence of attorney is associated with ‘resources for confrontation’: previous experience, client’s demand for legal services, communication with colleagues and membership in professional associations.
L84|The Effect Of Social Capital Level Of Accommodation Services Employees On Job Satisfaction|The aim of this research is to reveal the social capital level of employees in accommodation services, to measure job satisfaction by a Job Satisfaction Survey and to find out the relationship between social capital and job satisfaction. The sample of the research is 210 workers who work in 2, 3, 4 and 5 star hotels in Mardin and Batman and who are chosen with random sampling. For this aim in this research a scale prepared for researchers with 55 articles named “social capital levels in hotel managements” and again a scale to measure the job satisfaction of employees in accommodation services with 36 questions are used. The scale with 55 articles mentioned above is composed of five sections with titles of; organizational commitment, communication-social interaction, collaboration-social networks and participation, confidence, tolerance towards differences and sharing the norms. At the end of the research it has been found out that there is a positive relation between job satisfaction and social capital except for the aspects of tolerance towards differences and sharing the norms. It has been confirmed that tolerance towards differences and sharing the norms has a slightly negative relationship with job satisfaction. Those results show that to increase the job satisfaction of employees and accordingly to increase their efficiency and to ensure the continuance of the business they should take measures to increase social capital of employees.
L84|Raising the Potential of the Domestically Oriented Sector in Germany|Germany’s manufacturing sector, which plays an important role for exports, has been performing well over the past decade in terms of labour productivity growth and international competitiveness. However, the services sector has had much slower growth rates. Competition often appears to be hindered by protection of incumbents. Reforming and deregulating the domestically oriented sectors, including network industries, crafts and professional services would release hidden growth potential and prove beneficial to the economy as a whole. It could also help strengthen domestic demand and reduce dependence on exports. This Working Paper relates to the 2014 Economic Survey of Germany (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-germany.htm). Relever le potentiel des secteurs orientés sur le marché intérieur en Allemagne Au cours de la dernière décennie, le secteur manufacturier allemand, qui joue un rôle important dans les exportations, a enregistré de bons résultats, en termes de hausse de la productivité de la main-d’oeuvre comme de compétitivité internationale. Le secteur des services en revanche affiche des taux de croissance bien plus modestes. Il semble que la concurrence y ait souvent été entravée du fait de la protection des entreprises en place. Réformer et déréglementer les secteurs orientés sur le marché intérieur, notamment les industries de réseau, l’artisanat et les services professionnels, permettrait de libérer le potentiel de croissance caché et serait bénéfique pour l’économie dans son ensemble, et contribuerait en outre à renforcer la demande intérieure et à réduire la dépendance par rapport aux exportations. Ce document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE de l’Allemagne, 2014 (www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-economique-allemagne.htm).
L84|A Snapshot of China's Service Sector|The share of the tertiary sector in China’s value added has increased steadily, overtaking the share of the secondary sector in 2013. With increasing incomes, the share of services is expected to grow further as at higher incomes a larger share of income is spent on services. In addition to final demand, intermediate demand can be another driving force for service industries. As liberalisation leads to a greater role for the market in allocating resources, service industries are expected to become more competitive and therefore it may become cheaper to outsource services than to produce them in-house. Liberalisation will likely also lead to greater specialisation to remain competitive, thereby making specialised services available for outsourcing. This will likely spur the development of some high value-added logistics services such as warehousing or order handling. By the same token, professional services such as accounting or engineering are also likely to benefit from a greater reliance on the market and greater competition. In the envisaged transition from “made in China” to “created in China”, the service sector is expected to play a prominent role. To that end, the service sector is gradually being provided a more even playing field as privileges for manufacturing industries are being withdrawn and a more equal treatment of producers across sectors is being adopted. This paper provides a snapshot of the service sector, its size, the ownership of its firms, and productivity across types of firms depending on ownership, sector, age, size and geographical region. This Working Paper relates to the 2015 OECD Economic Survey of China www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-china.htm. Un état des lieux du secteur des services en Chine La part du secteur tertiaire dans la valeur ajoutée de la Chine n’a cessé de croître pour dépasser celle du secteur secondaire, en 2013. Compte tenu de l’augmentation des revenus, la part des services devrait continuer de progresser car plus le revenu est élevé, plus les dépenses consacrées aux services augmentent. Outre la demande finale, la consommation intermédiaire devrait constituer un autre facteur de consommation à la hausse de services. Les mesures de libéralisation laissant un plus grand rôle au marché dans l’allocation des ressources, le secteur des services devrait gagner en compétitivité et c’est pourquoi leur externalisation pourrait désormais coûter moins cher que leur production en interne. Pour préserver la compétitivité, la libéralisation entraînera également une plus grande spécialisation et des services spécialisés s’offriront ainsi à l’externalisation. Le développement de certains services logistiques à forte valeur ajoutée, comme la gestion d’entrepôts ou de commandes, devrait s’en trouver très certainement stimulé. De même, il est probable que les services de professions spécialisées comme la comptabilité et l’ingénierie bénéficieront eux aussi d’un plus large recours aux mécanismes du marché et d’une concurrence renforcée. Le secteur des services entend jouer un rôle de premier plan dans la future transition du « fabriqué en Chine » au « créé en Chine ». Dans cette optique, ce secteur voit s’instaurer peu à peu des règles de jeu plus égales, les industries manufacturières se voyant retirer certains de leurs privilèges et le principe d’égalité de traitement des producteurs entre les secteurs étant adopté. Ce document dresse un état de lieux du secteur des services et analyse sa taille, les structures de propriété de ses entreprises et la productivité de différents types d’entreprises en fonction de leur propriété, leur activité, leur ancienneté, leur taille et leur région. Ce document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de la Chine, OCDE, 2015 www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-economique-chine.htm.
L84|Tapering payments in hospitals: Experiences in OECD countries|This study covers “tapering scale” mechanism in hospital payments, i.e. mechanisms linking unit prices to the volume of services produced. This paper begins with an overview of hospital services and hospital payment methods in OECD countries, focusing more specifically on DRG-based payment. It then reviews studies published on economies of scales in hospitals, which is the economic rationale justifying tapering payments. Thereafter, four case studies from Germany, the US State of Maryland, the Czech Republic and Israel offer a detailed insight into the practicalities of introducing this method of controlling hospital volumes and the impacts it has had. Ce rapport porte sur les politiques de dégressivité tarifaire appliquées au paiement des hôpitaux, c’est-à-dire les mécanismes liant les prix unitaires des services hospitaliers au volume de soins produits. Ce document de travail dresse tout d’abord un panorama de l’offre hospitalière et des modes de paiement des hôpitaux au sein des pays de l’OCDE en étudiant plus spécifiquement le paiement à l’activité. Il présente ensuite une revue des études portant sur les économies d’échelle dans le secteur hospitalier, justification principale de la diminution des tarifs au-delà d’un seuil de production. Enfin, quatre études de cas en Allemagne, l’État du Maryland, la République tchèque et Israël sont présentées afin d’étudier finement les modalités d’instauration et l’impact de ce mécanisme de contrôle des volumes hospitaliers.
L84|Does Working from Home Work? Evidence from a Chinese Experiment|"A rising share of employees now regularly engage in working from home (WFH), but there are concerns this can lead to ""shirking from home"". We report the results of a WFH experiment at Ctrip, a 16,000-employee, NASDAQ-listed Chinese travel agency. Call center employees who volunteered to WFH were randomly assigned either to work from home or in the office for nine months. Home working led to a 13% performance increase, of which 9% was from working more minutes per shift (fewer breaks and sick days) and 4% from more calls per minute (attributed to a quieter and more convenient working environment). Home workers also reported improved work satisfaction, and their attrition rate halved, but their promotion rate conditional on performance fell. Due to the success of the experiment, Ctrip rolled out the option to WFH to the whole firm and allowed the experimental employees to reselect between the home and office. Interestingly, over half of them switched, which led to the gains from WFH almost doubling to 22%. This highlights the benefits of learning and selection effects when adopting modern management practices like WFH. JEL Codes: D24, L23, L84, M11, M54, O31."

L84|Organisierte Ungleichheit in der Leiharbeit? (Organised inequality in temporary work?)|In diesem Beitrag stellen wir die Frage ins Zentrum, wie Kollektivakteure arbeitsbezogene Ungleichheiten in einer sozialen Umwelt mit institutionalisierten Arbeitsbeziehungen sozial konstruieren. Empirisch untersuchen wir qualitativ-explorativ, wie sich die Kategorisierung von Leiharbeit durch Praktiken der Signifikation, Legitimation und Domination auf der Meso-Ebene der Regulation von Arbeit vollzieht. Ein Befund ist, dass die Signifikation der Leiharbeit als benachteiligte Form der Arbeitskraftnutzung weithin geteilt wird, die arbeitspolitischen Akteure jedoch erheblich in der Bewertung darueber abweichen, ob diese Benachteiligung gerechtfertigt ist. Aus dieser Diskrepanz resultieren unterschiedliche Strategien der Akteure: Waehrend die Arbeitgeberseite eine symbolische Aufwertung der Leiharbeit als legitime Beschaeftigungskategorie anstrebt, versuchen die Arbeitnehmervertreter eine Gleichbehandlung der Leiharbeiter in materieller Hinsicht zu erreichen. Im Ergebnis befoerdert dieser Konflikt um die Deutungshoheit paradoxerweise die Rekategorisierung der Leiharbeit als eine Beschaeftigungsform mit hoeherer Legitimitaet, und zwar trotz fortbestehender Ungleichbehandlung der Leiharbeiter. (In this article we examine how collective actors construct work-related inequalities in a social environment characterised by institutionalised labour-management-relations. Empirically, we select a qualitative-explorative approach for illuminating how the categorisation of temporary work is shaped through the practices of signification, legitimation and domination in regulating work at the meso-level. We find that collective actors share the signification of temporary work as a disadvantaged form of employment, whereas they diverge in their evaluation of the legitimacy of this disadvantage. Actors derive conflicting strategies from these divergent evaluations: the employer side aims at a symbolic upgrading of temporary agency work as a legitimate category of employment, whereas labour representatives try to establish equal treatment of agency workers on material grounds. The paradoxical result of this evaluation contest is that temporary agency work is re-categorised as a type of employment with higher legitimacy, despite continued unequal treatment of agency workers.)
L84|Between work and non-work: Institutional settings of boundary management in case of German self-employed lawyers|Drawing on the boundary theory (Nippert-Eng, 1996a) and the concept of institutional framework according to Piszczek and Berg (2014), we explore in this paper the link between institutional settings and boundary management practices in the case of self-employed German lawyers. Qualitative empirical results on the basis of 12 interviews reveal that the institutional context in case of self-employed lawyers combine “discretionary”, “bureaucratic” and “greedy” (Nippert-Eng, 1996a) elements which consist of legal requirements, expectations of clients and family-related demands. Ways of dealing with institutional requirements (complying, resisting, and negotiating) in terms of boundary management of self-employed lawyers are discussed.
L84|Human Resource Management in Professional Service Firms: Too good to be true? Transcending conflicting institutional logics|Why is it that HR specialists appear to have difficulty applying their knowledge, systems and techniques in a systematic way when it comes to professional services firms (PSFs) – particularly when the drivers for developing powerful HRM practices within such businesses seem more pressing than ever? This paper analyzes the ways HR specialists and PSF managers/partners differ in their understanding of organizations and their management. The analysis supports the argument that, while HR specialists and the discipline of HRM are governed by bureaucratic logic in their approach to management, PSF managers by contrast are driven by professional logic. This creates a number of subtle as well as explicit tensions and disconnects that will have to be tackled if the practices of HRM are to prevail in PSFs. This paper contributes to HRM literature as well as institutional theory, by applying an analysis of institutional logics to HRM practice in PSFs. The paper builds on interviews with five HR managers who have held positions in PSFs, as well as a longitudinal case study of PSF managers in one of the ‘Big Four’ accounting firms. The paper offers a number of tentative proposals around how HRM and PSFs might transcend the described gulf between the two approaches to management.
L84|Human Resource Management in Professional Service Firms: Learning from a framework for research and practice|Success in human resource management (HRM) depends on the question of whether applied practices of HRM meet specific contingency factors and are appropriately configured. Using this argument, the present article examines HRM in professional service firms (PSFs) in pursuit of three objectives. First, we introduce a conceptual framework that illustrates how the constitutive characteristics of PSFs, as contingency factors, influence HRM practices and research. Second, based on this framework, we summarize key findings of research on HRM in PSFs and open up potential avenues for further research. Third, we reflect on the argument that HRM in PSFs can contribute to an understanding of HRM practices in other organizational settings, leading to the question of the mutual transferability of HRM practices. Aside from these three primary objectives, we also introduce the contents of the special issue.
L84|The Long Way of Organizational Communication in Tourism: From Theory to Practice|"Organizational communication has become a topic on which increasingly more specialists express their views. Very few succed, however, to move from theory to practice, so that their attempt to be beneficial to it. Moreover, as a proverb (anonymously) very well reveals, ""... we communicate increasingly more, but we understand increasingly less"" ... In this context, based on available statistics (which surprised and confused us in equal measure) I aimed to analyze the extent to which beneficiaries of tourism units’ services are satisfied with the correspondence between their offer and the reality on the ground. Methodological, I turned in a first step to crowdsourcing. This is an alternative to get, as a result of outsourcing, required services and/or ideas by seeking contributions from large groups of people and/or communities turning to online resources and not to traditional employees or suppliers. This is the context in which I launched through a website accessible to all willing to participate in our research, a questionnaire aiming to evaluate the quality of organizational communication from tourism facilities. In a second step, I proceeded to the interpretation of the received responses checking, econometrically, through analysis of variance (ANOVA), the research hypotheses. Basically, I investigated the existing biunivocal relationship between the tourism facilities and the beneficiaries of their services, in order to identify and improve some external organizational communication trends, potentially generating performance effects as a direct result of improving customer relationship management. At the end of the work I formulated two proposals designed to reveal how and in what way can be reduced the distance (still huge) that separates managerial theory from the practice of customer relationship in the tourism, hospitality and leisure industry.

L84|Market potential and the employment growth of knowledge-intensive services: comparing different geographical resolutions|In order to empirically understand the geographical reach of different markets, it is vital to use an appropriate geographical resolution. Using too large observational units risks hiding the interesting relationships within the regional boundaries. In this study, we aim to investigate and compare similar analyses performed on different geographical levels, with a special focus on innovative industries. Accessibility to markets, services and infrastructure is thought to be major determinants of the potential for economic development and welfare of a region. Earlier empirical research establishing the relationship between agglomeration forces and regional growth typically includes a measure for accessibility or market potential as an explanatory factor. The geographical scale that conventional accessibility measures operate on is usually on the level of municipalities or similar, even when theory suggests that a more disaggregated scale is desirable. Most often the reason for this is limitations in available data. In many cases, the researcher is left with a geographical level based on administrative borders. Analyses on more disaggregated levels allow the researcher to better pinpoint the actual accessibility that each firm faces. In order to shed light on the importance of these issues, this paper utilizes an exploratory approach to investigate the relationship between the spatial distribution and growth of knowledge-intensive services (KIS) and the accessibility to economic activity (market potential). We use regional employment growth in KIS as a proxy for regional innovativeness. The relationship is estimated on two different geographical levels using Swedish data. The more conventional model is estimated with the 290 municipalities in Sweden as the units of analysis. In the Swedish context, this represents the geographically smallest administrative level. In the more novel model, we use the 298 so-called SAMS areas of Jönköping County in Sweden. Our results show that the detailed level is particularly important for the analysis of the growth of the more advanced sectors of the economy, in our setting, the high-tech knowledge-intensive services.

L84|Outsourcing of mutual funds' non-core competencies|Fund families strategically shape their member funds' behavior to target specific groups of investors with varying performance and service needs. In this paper I introduce a new measure to identify performance-oriented and service-oriented funds. Matching theories from the industrial organization literature, I suggest that funds whose families outsource the execution of services unrelated to portfolio management to external specialists are the same funds with an emphasis on their core business portfolio management. I find an outperformance of serviceoutsourced funds that is robust to a range of alternative explanations. Moreover, I show evidence that service-outsourced funds indeed possess superior investment skills.
L84|Giving ideas a chance: Systematic development of services in manufacturing industry|The purpose of this paper is to propose a service development process that is adapted to manufacturing companies and to discuss its implication for companies with a focus on product development and product sales. This paper looks at new service development (NSD) literature and argues for design principles to develop a NSD process in a manufacturing context. Further, a generic NSD framework for manufacturing companies and a five-stage service development process framework is presented in detail. Managers need to be aware of the interrelationship that exists between NSD and NPD. A number of managerial implications are proposed and discussed. This paper emphasizes the importance of NSD lifecycle management, something that has not previously been extensively studied or addressed. In 2 addition, to explicitly discuss NSD in a business model context in manufacturing is novel.

L84|The Effect of Third-Party Funding of Plaintiffs on Settlement|A significant policy concern about the emerging plaintiff legal funding industry is that loans will undermine settlement. When the plaintiff has private information about damages, we find that the optimal (plaintiff-funder) loan induces all plaintiff types to make the same demand, resulting in full settlement; implementation may entail a very high repayment amount. Plaintiffs' attorneys with contingent-fee compensation benefit from such financing, as it eliminates trial costs. When the defendant has private information about his likelihood of being found liable, we find that the likelihood of settlement is unaffected. In both settings the defendant's incentive for care-taking is unaffected.
L84|Investigating Potential Strategies for Increasing Tourism Competiveness at the Black Sea Shore|During 2009-2011 the tourism industry at the Black Sea shore experienced a significant downturn as a direct result of the global economic crisis and a shy growth in 2012-2013 period. In this context of difficult macroeconomic conditions and a hardly predictable number of tourists, the suppliers of tourism services need a constant revision of strategy in order to increase their competitiveness and adapt to external market conditions. The main objective of this study is to investigate the competitive strategies that hotels managers in Mamaia resort, Romania, could adopt considering customers` expectations and hospitality industry best practices. In order to achieve this, a best practice benchmarking analysis was performed considering several locations on the seaside in France, Italy, Spain and Turkey. Following this analysis, several strategies are drafted, such as: use of social media, creation of packaged deals, targeting the business segment and advertising by using the cultural and historical context of the location. Moreover, a short survey among social media users revealed some of the tourists` expectations regarding their holidays at the Romanian Black Sea shore, such as quality of accommodation facilities, personalized services and entertainment possibilities.
L84|Marketizing the up-to-date forecasting|Marketizing the up-to-date forecasting is a component of its general transformation process. It reflects the fluctuating relation between forecasting and market mechanism. In this study it is considered an interaction between making estimates and the market logic. The following aspects are monitored: 1) intensive introduction of the forecasting elaboration process into the market supply, making forecasting an object of business activity and offering forecasts as goods in the market exchange; 2) the changes in the forecast functions in the capital accumulation process within the financial sector.

L84|Management Coaching Versus Management Consulting: Which Comes First?|In the fast growing business services market today, one manager may wonder whether to use coaching services or consultancy services. Questions might arise: which are the differences between the two types of services, their common points and the relationship between the two? This paper aims to explore the above mentioned questions while pleading for both services. The fact is that they are powerful processes that can bring added value to the organization through use of knowledge. The bottom line is that they work best in different situations, and they should not be regarded as a “one or the other” but as synergy knowledge related tools.
L84|Funktionaler Strukturwandel in der Industrie: Bedeutung produktionsnaher Dienste nimmt zu|There are fewer and fewer people employed in the German manufacturing sector. Between 1999 and 2013, the number of people working in the industry fell from 7.7 million to 7.3 million. However, not all areas have been equally affected by the decline, rather, there has been a functional restructuring within the industry: while fewer people are being employed in production, employment in many production-related services in the industrial sector, such as research and development (R&D), technical services, and management and organization functions have actually grown. Export-oriented industrial companies, in particular, have expanded their research and development divisions, but firms focusing on the internal market have also significantly increased their R&D activities. That the share of employment in production is falling does not necessarily mean that this area is becoming less important. On the contrary, the production area’s demands for a qualified, skilled labor force is high, in export-oriented as well as in sectors focusing on the internal market. The trend toward tertiarization in industry is likely to continue in the future, not least due to the increasing digitalization of information: routine activities will continue to become less important, demanding activities—also in production—will become more important. Immer weniger Menschen in Deutschland arbeiten im Industriesektor. Zwischen 1999 und 2013 ist die Zahl der Erwerbstätigen von 7,7 Millionen auf 7,3 Millionen gesunken. Nicht alle Unternehmensbereiche sind jedoch gleichmäßig vom Rückgang betroffen, vielmehr kommt es zu einem funktionalen Strukturwandel innerhalb der Industrie: In der Fertigung geht die Beschäftigung zurück, in den sogenannten produktionsnahen Diensten – also Forschung und Entwicklung (FuE), technische Dienste sowie Leitungs- und Organisationsfunktionen – nimmt sie zu. Besonders stark bauten die exportorientierten Industriebranchen ihren Forschungs- und Entwicklungsbereich aus, aber auch in binnenmarktorientierten Branchen legte FuE deutlich zu. Dass der Beschäftigungsanteil der Fertigung sinkt, heißt aber nicht zwangsläufig, dass dieser Bereich immer unwichtiger wird. Im Gegenteil: Die Ansprüche an die Qualifikation und Fähigkeiten der Arbeitskräfte in der Fertigung sind hoch, in den exportorientierten Branchen ebenso wie in den binnenmarktorientierten. Der Trend zur Tertiarisierung in der Industrie dürfte sich künftig fortsetzen, nicht zuletzt wegen der zunehmenden Digitalisierung von Informationen: Routineaktivitäten werden weiter an Bedeutung verlieren, anspruchsvolle Tätigkeiten – auch in der Fertigung – an Bedeutung gewinnen.
L84|The Effects of Emotional Labor on Job Attitudes of Hotel Employees: Mediating and Moderating Roles of Social Support and Job Autonomy|With increasing competition among hotels, managing employees seems to be important issue in delivering services to customers effectively. This issue also affects the firms’ outcomes and incomes. Thus, hotels as a service providing firms must be able to man age the emotions of employees in order to increase the quality of services and to create value for customers. Controlling emotions of employees also contribute to gain competitive advantage across rivals. The objective of this paper is to reveal the effect s of emotional labor on job attitudes of hotel employees by considering the mediating and moderating roles of social support and job autonomy. To this end, a questionnaire was employed to employees of hotels operating in Antalya Province. Results of the analyses support that emotional labor has a negative effect on emotional exhaustion. Emotional labor also has a positive effect on job satisfaction. In addition there are mediating and moderating roles of job autonomy and social support between emotional exhaustion and emotional labor, and emotional labor and job satisfaction.
L84|Open service innovation and the firm's search for external knowledge|The concept of open innovation captures the increasing propensity of firms to work across their traditional boundaries of operation. This phenomenon has largely been studied from the viewpoint of manufacturing businesses while services have received much less attention despite the predominant role they play in advanced economies. This paper focuses on open innovation in services, both as a subsector of the economy and as a component of the activities of manufacturing firms. We study the open innovation practices of business services firms and then consider the implications for open innovation of the adoption of a service inclusive business model by manufacturing firms. Our analyses are based on a unique dataset with information on open innovation activities amongst UK firms. Overall, engagement in open innovation increases with firm size and R&D expenditure. Business services are more active open innovators than manufacturers; they are more engaged in informal relative to formal open innovation practices than manufacturers; and they attach more importance to scientific and technical knowledge than to market knowledge compared to manufacturing firms. Open innovation practices are also associated with the adoption of a service inclusive business model in manufacturing firms and service-integrated manufacturers engage in more informal knowledge-exchange activities. The paper contributes towards a reconceptualisation of open innovation in service businesses and a deeper evidence-based understanding of the service economy.
L84|How Small Kibs Companies Manage Their Intellectual Capital? Towards An Emergent Km Approach|The growing interest in Intellectual Capital management and Knowledge Management is now reaching small companies, especially those in the Knowledge-Intensive Business Services (KIBS) sector. This paper aims to explore this issue, starting from the assumption that a planned and systematic approach to KM, as is used in large companies, is rarely applicable in small organizations. It is more likely that small companies adopt an approach to KM that could be defined as “emergent”, i.e. KM is not planned rationally and in advance, but emerges and is developed along with time. In the paper, the concept of emergent KM approach will be defined and discussed, and three research questions will be examined: a. Is it possible to detect an emergent KM approach in the practice of small KIBS? b. If so, why small KIBS companies follow an emergent KM approach? c. What particular features this approach can have in those companies? The study is based on the results of a qualitative survey involving several owners and managers of small companies operating in the KIBS sector. The survey uses the case study method, and gives grounds for a preliminary analysis of emergent KM approach is small companies offering KIBS. The findings confirm that it is easy to find small companies adopting an emergent approach to KM: in the analysed cases there were no formal KM plans, despite the fact that they have all introduced various KM practices. This shows that there can be the need to define KM approaches that better fit smaller companies
L84|Knowledge Intensive business services: the Russian experience|Knowledge-Intensive Business Services (KIBS) are seen to be a core sector of the so-called ‘knowledge economy’, and already play an important role in developed economies. The KIBS providers are both innovate themselves and provide their clients with knowledge and learning opportunities. This paper examines the status of KIBS in Russia, and explores some key issues in their role in innovation using data from surveys of KIBS firms and their clients.
L84|Knowledge Intensive Business Services: The Russian Experience|Knowledge-Intensive Business Services (KIBS) are seen to be a core sector of the so-called ‘knowledge economy’, and already play an important role in developed economies. They a both innovate themselves and provide their clients with knowledge and learning opportunities. This paper examines the status of KIBS in Russia, and explores some key issues in their role in innovation using data from surveys of KIBS firms and their clients in Russia. We note that KIBS are often highly customized, and many new services prove difficult to replicate. KIBS are closely tailored to solving the problems of specific customers, and thus these services typically involve KIBS consumers in a co-production process. Both the formal supplier and the formal user of the service are engaged together in service production, allowing for mutual knowledge transfers and learning. Using KIBS is shown to affect customers’ propensity to innovate, confirming the importance of this sector for the innovation system. Survey data suggest that the impact on innovation is, as a rule, positive and strong. The propensity to innovate in turn stimulates further consumption of KIBS, which is therefore the start of a self-sustaining growth mechanism of innovation activity. Similar consequences are conceptually associated with knowledge transfer in the course of co-production: consumers get both specialized and general knowledge, improving their skills and increasing the innovative capacities. This enables customers to better understand their own needs and encourages them to consume more customized KIBS in the future, and producing KIBS companies get the opportunity to become effective elements of innovation systems. Authorities should consider the possibility of fostering innovative development by supporting the sector in question.
L84|Who Demands Collective Action In An Imperfect Institutional Environment? A Case-Study Of The Professional Community Of Attorneys In Russia|We analyse the professional community of attorneys in Russia in order to understand their potential for collective action in an imperfect institutional environment. In 2013 we conducted a survey of 372 attorneys in 9 regions of Russia. Two main hypotheses are tested: 1) lawyers with strong ethical values have higher demand for collective actions; 2) the negative experience of clients rights violation by law enforcement officers can motivate attorneys to support the foundation of a strong professional association. Also we suggest that attorneys’ professional community with bona fide members at the core could be an instrument for an estimation of the quality of law enforcement in Russia.
L84|Gender Employment Longevity: I.T Staff Response to Organizational Support in Pakistan|"This research attempts to explain reasons behind employment longevity on the basis of gender among the I.T staff. Previous empirical researches have confirmed the correlation between organisational commitment, job satisfaction, and organisational support programme. However, most researches were single dimension primarily due to their focus on establishing the relationship between above mentioned variables in different organisational settings whereas, this research mainly explore on the grounds of gender’s impact of organisational support programme on the affective, normative, and continuance commitment of I.T staff. Furthermore, the causes and consequences of organisational support programme on I.T personnel is elaborated though ""Hypothetico-Inductive-Deductive Model"". This cross sectional study is commenced at Incisivesoft (I.T firm), following post-positivism research philosophy. Mixed research method has been used to explore both qualitative as well quantitative aspects related to research problem, using ""Online Survey questionnaire"" and ""In-depth Interviews"" as main research instruments used to collect responses from the sample size of 103 participants. The results reveal that organisational support programme has more impact on the female professionals in the I.T firms as compare to male staff. In the comparative analysis of three dimensions of organizational commitment, normative commitment and continuance commitment is high in female employees whereas male employees have high affective commitment. Moreover, research found that cultural influence is key factor for female's strong obligation towards firm. On the other hand, majority of male employees have ""situational commitment"" which reflects that their performance is highly driven by the situation at hand. Furthermore, this paper found that female employees are more loyal towards organisation whereas male are high performers but have low level of loyalty towards the organisation due to intense competition in the I.T sector of Pakistan."
L84|Professional Career Planning - Practice and Results|There are a number of factors that can put an emphasis on individual career plan, functioning as elements of insight and understanding of development needs, and understanding of others. A successful career management must take into account a number of clearly defined objectives focused on a policy based on an evaluation plan of employees, identifying their needs, identifying and retaining the best employees or those with the most effective prospects, providing training and development for employees, etc. However, the highest percentage in identifying the best potential in an employee is up to the employee himself, who often expects the organization to take all steps necessary to achieve his needs, but without making any effort on his own. The individual must be aware of his skills, professional knowledge, strengths and weaknesses, the needs and values of present and future, but also the long-term professional goals. The study in an enterprise from the energy field in Romania with regard to career planning was an attempt to find a way to shape a career plan according to the organization. For this a questionnaire was applied structured in four dimensions: employment situation in which the employee is, preparedness for change and personality traits. Participants in the study believe that self-management of interpersonal relationships, professional achievement and commitment are very important features in the development of their career, even if more than 50% ask about their current situation in the company, regardless of hierarchical position occupied. Moreover, an important share of employees are able to manage change, if the circumstances are appropriate, in addition to personality traits suitable for making changes because over 60% of them are extroverted, realistic, pragmatic and dominant.
L84|An analysis of the knowledge base of Scientific Research & Development Business Services|It is argued that the literature on SR&D outsourcing focuses mostly on client firms, that is, the demand side, while little is known of the characteristics of the supplying sector. The present paper tackles this gap by elaborating an exploratory analysis of this business service sector with a view to analyse the main patterns of specialization and their evolution over time. Using data on job content and skill requirements in the United States we explore how different forms of knowledge co-exist and co-evolve within a changing sector.
L84|Diasporas and Outsourcing: Evidence from oDesk and India|We examine the role of the Indian diaspora in the outsourcing of work to India. Our data are taken from oDesk, the world's largest online platform for outsourced contracts. Despite oDesk minimizing many of the frictions that diaspora connections have traditionally overcome, diaspora connections still matter on oDesk, with ethnic Indians substantially more likely to choose a worker in India. This higher placement is the result of a greater likelihood of choosing India for the initial contract and substantial path dependence in location choices. We further examine wage and performance outcomes of outsourcing as a function of ethnic connections. Our examination of potential rationales for the greater ethnic-based placement of contracts assesses taste-based preferences and information differences. This paper was accepted by Lee Fleming, entrepreneurship and innovation.
L84|Services Trade Restrictiveness Index (STRI): Construction, Architecture and Engineering Services|This paper presents the services trade restrictiveness indices (STRIs) for construction, architecture and engineering services. The STRIs are composite indices taking values between zero and one, zero representing an open market and one a market completely closed to foreign services providers. The indices are calculated for 40 countries, the 34 OECD members and Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. This report presents the first vintage of indicators for construction, architecture and engineering services and captures de jure regulations in force in 2013. The results for construction services indicate that the overall level of restrictiveness is relatively low, ranging from 0.05 to 0.32, with an average of 0.16. The more elevated levels of restriction can be largely attributed to general measures affecting all sectors of the economy. The STRI also supports the view that architecture and engineering services are less restrictively regulated than other accredited professional services, notably legal and accounting services. The average value for the STRI among the countries in the sample is 0.22 for architecture services, connoting a relatively low degree of regulatory restrictiveness; the corresponding value is only marginally lower, 0.2, for engineering services. The majority of regulations affecting trade in these sectors concern the movement of people.
L84|Services Trade Restrictiveness Index (STRI): Legal and Accounting Services|This paper presents the services trade restrictiveness indices (STRIs) for the regulated professions of legal and accounting services. The STRIs are composite indices taking values between zero and one, zero representing an open market and one a market completely closed to foreign services providers. The indices are calculated for 40 countries, the 34 OECD members and Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. This report presents the first vintage of indicators for legal and accounting services and captures de jure regulations in force in 2013. The STRI supports the view that legal and accounting services are subject to a relatively high level of regulation. Restrictiveness for legal services ranges from 0.11 to 0.73, with an average of 0.31. Accounting and auditing services show an average of 0.3 and STRI values ranging from 0.13 to 1. The results provide useful policy insights, particularly in order to identify priorities for reform at the national and international levels. Notably, in the case of legal and accounting services, easing a few prominent restrictions could result in a significantly more liberal and competitive market environment.
L84|Co-agglomeration of knowledge-intensive business services and multinational enterprises|It has been argued that the relationship between knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) and multinational enterprises (MNEs) within the regional economy is advantageous for urban and regional dynamics. It is likely that KIBS aim to locate proximate to (internationally operating) MNEs because of agglomeration externalities. The impact of MNEs on the birth of KIBS has rarely been examined, and the research on the new formation of KIBS has mainly adopted a case study approach, thus limiting the opportunity for generalization. We have taken a more quantitative approach using a continuous space framework to test whether proximity is important for the co-location of KIBS and MNEs in the metropolitan area of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Our results, controlled for other location factors, indicate that KIBS are co-agglomerated with MNEs and that the presence of a MNE significantly influences the birth of KIBS nearby, but the effect on such start-ups is considerably smaller than the positive effect of the presence of already established KIBS. We discuss the implications for urban and regional development strategies and policy initiatives.

Technical progress in trade means quantitative and qualitative changes in the application of information technology: the automation of processes, using modern equipment, the introduction of automatic data processing. Electronic commerce is one of the most important aspects of the Internet, which runs in the context of internationalization of economic activities continue under contemporary technological revolution and especially the new information technologies and telecommunications. The present paper aims to highlight the key trends in retail trade in the context of introduction on large-scale of information technologies, the use of smart devices and social networks.
L84|The diagnosis of the quality of educational services within the University of Petroşani|In the present context of amplifying the concerns for ensuring the quality of education in Romania and the coagulation of components of a new culture in the quality of education providers, the paper examines the ways in which the University of Petroşani has developed the organizational framework and the tools necessary to ensure and improve quality, in accordance with the provisions of the national legislation and with the standards and performance indicators used by The Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in Higher Education in the external evaluation of quality. The diagnostic analysis undertaken in this study focuses on the investigation of elements which guarantee the quality of the education process, starting from the premise that quality assurance, together with the availability of human resources, adequate logistics and materials form a social network which must not be disregarded when carrying out duties and fulfilling the objectives of an institution of higher education. The diagnosis attempted in the paper is completed, naturally, with a SWOT analysis of the current status of quality assurance within the University and with a package of measures that should be taken to enhance the strong points and to mitigate the weaknesses highlighted in the analysis.
L84|The Quality of Outsourced Logistics Service: A Collectivist Culture Perspective|The purpose of the study is to explore on the elements of outsourced logistics service quality and how the users’ satisfaction was formed within the Malaysian culture context. This qualitative study was based on five semi-structured interviews which were carried out with the executive officers and department managers of four logistics providers firms and one manufacturer. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis method. Rather than the organization’s performance-related factors, the results revealed that, within the Malaysian national culture context, there are influence of the cultural element towards customer satisfaction. There are four (4) logistics service quality elements identified include timeliness, task accuracy and the condition of the product, and the quality of key contact personnel. There are eight (8) other elements leading to satisfaction which is not within the original logistics service quality theory. They include efficient, consistent service, responsiveness, ensuring customers’ reputation, sensitive to other people feelings, taking blame to ensure satisfaction, emotional closeness between personnel and the family as a base of identity. The emerging elements provides the key insights on the elements which lead to satisfaction in the context of Malaysian logistics service users. Rather than the organization’s performance-related factors, the results revealed that, within the Malaysian national culture context, there are influence of the cultural element towards customer satisfaction.
L84|Job definitions and service behaviour. An investigation among technical service employees|Service organizations try to control the service behavior of employees using formal guidelines, training and instructions. However, the specific actions that are performed during the service encounters are predominantly under the discretion of the individual frontline employee. Therefore, the employee’s idiosyncratic perception of the job, the subjective job definition, may significantly influence the behavior shown in the service encounter. Based on existing approaches on job definitions with regard to proactive, citizenship, prosocial and safety behavior this paper proposes a method to assess the subjective customer related job definition of service employees in the technical industries. The results of a survey in 49 small technical service organizations indicate good psychometric properties of the measure. A second study including a survey in 20 service organizations and a customer survey reveals that the customer related job definitions of service employees are associated with the service behavior as perceived by the customers. The findings underline the importance of subjective job definitions of service employees for the achievement of effective service behavior. Assessing and changing customer related job definitions may be a promising way to improve service quality.
L84|Ecologie industrielle et développement territorial durable : le rôle des services<BR>[Industrial ecology and sustainable territorial development: The role of services]|Potentiellement créatrice d’effets d’agglomération favorisant la génération et l’attractivité d’activités nouvelles, l’écologie industrielle peut être considérée comme un vecteur de développement territorial durable. Mais il est nécessaire de pallier aux difficultés (techniques, économiques, informationnelles…) liées à la mise en oeuvre des symbioses industrielles. Nous étudions le rôle que peuvent jouer les activités de services, publiques et privées, dans la réduction de ces difficultés. Par leurs fonctions relatives à l’organisation des relations marchandes, à l’acquisition ou au maintien des capacités par les agents ou encore à l’aide à la décision, les services peuvent réduire les coûts de transaction engendrés par la mise en oeuvre de symbioses industrielles et accompagner les décisions stratégiques des entreprises.
L84|Exchange Rate Volatility and Tourist Flows into Turkey|This paper examines the effects of Exchange Rate Volatility on tourist flows into Turkey for the period of 1994~2012. Our results show that (i) there is a negative relationship between exchange rate volatility and tourist inflows into Turkey; (ii) there is a negative impact of the relative price ratio on the tourist flows indicating that relatively expensive places deter tourist arrivals, given the keen international competition among alternative destinations; (iii) GDP per capita at tourist origin, measured in Purchasing Power Parities, exerts positive influence on tourist flows. Our findings thus, suggest some direct policy implications: first, policy makers of a tourist destination country aiming to target potential markets for their tourist products, should, in principle, avoid markets prone to exchange rate volatility due to political and social upheavals or financial instability. Moreover, countries relying heavily on their tourism industry, should avoid using exchange rate policies for other policy objectives like international price competiveness, as these policies may end up to an exchange rate volatility that could reduce its tourism inflows substantially in the longer run.
L84|Improvement Of Body Shop Managing As A Part Of Vehicle Importers Center|The dynamic rhythm of living in today’s contemporary surroundings can not be considered without the use of personal and commercial vehicles, for transport of passengers and cargo. This means that every manufacturer in this segment, in their departments for development, find a way to increase their participation in the market. Since the race with time, for promoting new models on the market, not always is in positive relation with the profit which the manufacturer plans to achieve, issues the manufacturer’s focus in the after-sale activities. The body shop with its service, as part of the after-sale activities, brings the client satisfaction to a higher level and of course contributes to realization of higher profit of the company. The setting of the equipment and the staff management, the analysis of the number of entries and realized working hours in the body shop of an importer centre are the central topic/main subject for the author in this paper work. Finding the key factors, as well as the possibility for implementation of the key factors, would reflect increased number of entries, increased number of realized working hours and possibility for improving of the existing system of managing.
L84|A �human growth� perspective on organizational resources, worker satisfaction and firm performance|The paper deals with the mediating role of immaterial satisfaction between substantive organizational substantive features, defined as resources by on-the-job autonomy, involvement, teamwork and workload pressure, and organizational performance, defined in terms of improvements in product quality and innovation. We address this relationship in the Italian social service sector using a survey dataset that includes 4,134 workers and 320 not-for-profit social cooperatives. We apply a structural equation model including both observed and latent variables. Direct, indirect and total effects in the structural model show that: (i) worker autonomy in introducing innovation positively influences performance; (ii) involvement bears positively on performance when its effect is mediated by immaterial satisfaction; (iii) the negative impact of task-autonomy on performance is almost counterbalanced by its positive impact on worker satisfaction. To control for common method bias we resort to post-hoc testing and introduce three distal sources of subjective data from directors, managers and paid workers.

L84|Auditor Independence in New Zealand: Further Evidence on the Role of Non-Audit Services|Non-audit services provided by auditors to their audit clients continue to be a controversial issue around the world. While research evidence has not usually shown that auditors lose their independence when providing non-audit services, the risk that they could do so is still a concern to regulators and financial report users. However, after changes to the environment of auditing, including new regulation, it may be that the situation has changed. This paper examines whether there is a relationship between non-audit services and the loss of independence for publicly listed New Zealand companies in 2011. The results using three tests – audit fees, audit opinion and auditor tenure – show that there is no impairment of independence with respect to audit fees and auditor tenure. However, there is some evidence of impaired auditor independence in relation to the audit opinion.

It analyses the market of consulting services, and defines the market range. The study focuses on the market genesis, and outlines and presents the three stages of its initial development. It gives short characteristics of the pre-market history of consulting services during the administrative system. It formulates the strategies of consulting firms for entering the market, as well as the factors for their success.
L84|The Italian technology balance of payments|The technology balance of payments concerns external transactions in disembodied technology. Since the introduction in Italy of a new data collection system based mainly on direct reporting by enterprises, credits and debits tend to be appreciably greater than they had been under the old system based on bank settlements; the overall deficit increases, especially in sales or other transfers of patents, royalties and other licences. The new data and the revision of the time series from 1992 are presented for the first time in this paper. Italyï¿½s trade in disembodied technology remains relatively low as a percentage of GDP by comparison with most of the advanced economies. Its deficit is concentrated with the advanced economies, while it has surpluses vis-ï¿½-vis non-EU countries in general and some developing countries in particular. More than half of exports can be ascribed to manufacturing enterprises, whose position is in balance; the deficit, instead, derives from the service sector, with the exception of professional services (notably architecture and engineering). Finally, trade in disembodied technology is concentrated in a limited number of multinational enterprises.
L84|Entry, exit, and the determinants of market structure|Market structure is determined by the entry and exit decisions of individual producers. These decisions are driven by expectations of future profits which, in turn, depend on the nature of competition within the market. In this paper we estimate a dynamic, structural model of entry and exit in an oligopolistic industry and use it to quantify the determinants of market structure and long-run firm values for two U.S. service industries, dentists and chiropractors. We find that entry costs faced by potential entrants, fixed costs faced by incumbent producers, and the toughness of short-run price competition are all important determinants of long run firm values and market structure. As the number of firms in the market increases, the value of continuing in the market and the value of entering the market both decline, the probability of exit rises, and the probability of entry declines. The magnitude of these effects differ substantially across markets due to differences in exogenous cost and demand factors and across the dentist and chiropractor industries. Simulations using the estimated model for the dentist industry show that pressure from both potential entrants and incumbent firms discipline long-run profits. We calculate that a seven percent reduction in the mean sunk entry cost would reduce a monopolist's long-run profits by the same amount as if the firm operated in a duopoly.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L84|Outsourcing and the rise in services|This paper investigates the impact of outsourcing on sectoral reallocation in the U.S. over the period 1947-2007, and on the rise in services in particular. Roughly 40% of the growth of the service sector comes from professional and business services. This is an unusual industry as more than 90% of its output is an intermediate input to other firms, and it is where most of the service outsourcing activity is concentrated. These facts are essential to understanding the structure of the economy: professional and business services have experienced an almost fourfold increase in their forward linkage, the largest change in input-output linkages over the past 60 years. Using a simple gross output accounting framework, I calculate the contribution of the change in the composition of intermediates and their sourcing mode to the reallocation of employment across sectors. I find that the evolution of the input-output structure accounts for up to 33% of the increase in service employment, and professional and business services outsourcing alone contributes almost half of that amount.
L84|The Smart Homes – A Promising Business Domain Which Worth Attention Of Romanian Telecom Companies|In the paper the authors present an overview of the main worldwide development directions in the Smart Home solutions, review the Smart Home services, and give recommendations to potential Romanian and foreign investors in the establishment of such services in Romania. The homes and how people live and behave in them have evolved dramatically in the last fifteen years. Today, the authors are able to present a few major trends that revive the Smart Homes: social trends, digital addiction and the fact that global players see the home like the kernel of the digital atmosphere that surrounds us. The purpose was to identify an opportunity today, as these trends have a satisfying maturity degree.Studying various projects, authors were able to estimate that Smart Homes revenues will increase with 8-10 % per year until 2020 in Romania. These estimates include both direct revenues like home automation products/services and indirect revenues like maintenance of the new devices/services.

L84|Location patterns of service industries in France: A distance-based approach|We study the location patterns of business-oriented service and manufacturing industries in France. We develop a new test of localization considering space as continuous. Our test relies on a measure of divergence in the space of density distributions that allows us to assess whether or not the density distribution of bilateral distances between all pairs of plants within an industry significantly departs from randomness. We improve the test proposed by Duranton and Overman (2005), which proves to be biased with respect to the number of plants in the industry under scrutiny. Our test does not suffer from such a bias. This property is crucial for the French case where industrial concentrations of service and manufacturing industries drastically differ. With this distance-based method, we highlight some distinctive locational features of service industries that have not been mentioned in the literature so far. We show that: 1/service industries diverge more often from randomness than manufacturing industries, 2/a majority of diverging service industries are localized at very short distances (less than 4km) whereas a majority of manufacturing industries are localized at longer distances or even dispersed, 3/within a majority of service industries, the largest plants appear localized at shorter distances than other plants, 4/within most service industries, incoming plants reduce localization whereas exiting plants reinforce it over the period 1996–2005.
L84|R&D service firms: The hidden engine of the high-tech economy?|R&D service firms are highly innovative knowledge-intensive businesses. They constitute an important component of the knowledge economy, but one that is often in the shadow of the role normally attributed to universities and other public research organisations in the growth of high tech clusters and, more broadly, innovation systems. In this paper we present evidence from an in-depth analysis of the strategy, practice and impact of a sample of R&D service providers long active in the Cambridge area, the leading science and technology cluster in the UK. Based on an extensive programme of interviews with companies’ CEOs and managers, we analyse: the main features of the R&D contract and the way in which this allows firms to de-risk the uncertain process of early technology development and to meet customer's needs; the services’ typical organisational features and development stages; the variety of observed growth paths. We provide evidence of the significant direct and indirect contribution to innovation of these service firms and conclude by discussing the implications of this original model of technology development in relation to the early-stage financing and university-led growth debates.
L84|The impact of ICT and business services on the Italian economy|This paper studies the role played by ICT in affecting the efficiency of business services (BS) industry, using a structural disequilibrium model of the Italian economy. The Italian BS sector presents a peculiar dynamics (compared to other EU countries) in that, after initially improving its efficiency by adopting ICT, from the early 90s it stagnated. Our estimates suggest that this anomaly can be traced back to a structural deficiency in absorbing new technologies. Our contribution adds to the explanations of the slowdown of the Italian productivity.
L84|Outsourcing and the Rise in Services|This paper investigates the impact of outsourcing on sectoral reallocation in the U.S. over the period 1948-2002. Roughly 40% of the growth of the service sector comes from professional and business services. This is an unusual industry as more than 90% of its output is an intermediate input to other firms, and it is where most of the service outsourcing activity is concentrated. These facts are essential to understanding the structure of the economy: professional and business services have experienced an almost fourfold increase in their forward linkage, the largest change in input-output linkages over the past 60 years. Using a simple gross output accounting model, I calculate the contribution of the change in the composition of intermediates and their sourcing mode to the reallocation of employment across sectors. I find that the evolution of the input-output structure, which is mostly due to professional and business services outsourcing, accounts for 36% of the increase in services employment and 25% of the fall in manufacturing.
L84|Knowledge-Intensive Business Services (Kibs) And Their Role In The Knowledge-Based Economy|The development of knowledge-intensive business services in recent decades can be interpreted as one of the indicators of a transformation from an industrial economy into a knowledge-based one. Not only do quantitative measures, whether in the form of sales or employment figures (e.g. Chadwick, Glasson and Lawton Smith, 2008), undoubtedly show the expansion of these services; but also their characteristics make it clear that they significantly affect the formation and spread of knowledge throughout the economy. This article presents an analysis of the KIBS sector based on a literature review. In the first section, it presents the issues connected with defining and categorizing KIBS. In the second one, it shows the significance of this type of service, highlighting its influence on the innovativeness of the companies which it serves. The third section consists of a detailed review of the literature devoted to research on KIBS.
L84|The regulation of quality in the market for legal services: Taking the heterogeneity of legal services seriously|Reviewing the public and private interest approaches to the regulation in the market for legal services, this article points out their mutual inconsistency and their empirical and theoretical limits. It then argues that heterogeneous legal services should be considered when (de)regulating the market. Drawing upon the distinction between credence, experience, and search goods, we distinguish various legal services according to the degree of asymmetric information on quality characterizing the relationship between lawyers and clients. We argue that the heterogeneity of legal services impacts on the desirable level of regulation, implying that not all the markets for legal services should be regulated or, conversely, deregulated. Furthermore, when regulation is needed, the degree of asymmetric information between the regulatory authority and lawyers partly determines the choice between external and self-regulation.
L84|Knowledge Intensive Business Services As Generators Of Innovations|Knowledge Intensive Business Services (KIBS) are widely argued to be important actors in innovation systems. They are active both innovating themselves, and by providing their clients with important knowledge and learning opportunities. This study uses survey data to investigate the mechanisms of knowledge transfer and innovativeness improvement through the provision of KIBS. The empirical core of the paper is a set of Russian surveys of KIBS and their clients: KIBS are a fairly new phenomenon in Russia, so this provides an opportunity to contrast KIBS supplier-client relationships featuring more and less experienced customers. Many of the KIBS firms’ services are highly tailored to customer specificities, and we consider how far this is minor customisation and how far novel products (and thus potentially product innovations) are involved. These services typically involve KIBS consumers into a coproduction process, where both the formal supplier and the formal user of the service are engaged together in service production. Knowledge transfers through learning-by-doing in such cases affect customers' propensity to innovate and improve their absorptive capacity. The paper concludes that the generation of innovations through KIBS may well be a self-sustaining process. In this process, service providers are incentivised to engage in service innovations by more innovative customers’ demand for highly individualised services. In turn, the process stimulates the innovativeness of customers, as they engage in learning-by-doing through coproduction
L84|Do KIBS make manufacturing more innovative? An empirical investigation for four European countries|The paper aims at estimating the innovation impact of the vertical integration of knowledge intensive business services (KIBS) into manufacturing. Referring to the vertically integrated sectors of an economy allows innovative knowledge, which is transferred directly and indirectly from KIBS to manufacturing in an embodied way, to be measured. Its impact on manufacturing innovation is then estimated. By merging OECD data on sectoral R&D and input-output tables with sectoral patent applications from the Pastat dataset, a panel of 18 manufacturing sectors is built up for the four largest European countries – France, Germany, Italy and the UK – spanning from the mid-90s to the mid-00s. The more innovative sectors are actually those making more intensive and extensive use of R&D embodied into KIBS production flows. In policy terms, strengthening the bridge between KIBS and manufacturing appears to be as crucial as supporting KIBS activities and service innovations.Length: 29 pages
L84|The Value of Hiring through Referrals|"Employee referrals are a very common means by which firms hire new workers. Past work suggests that workers hired via referrals often perform better than non-referred workers, but we have little understanding as to why. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is primarily because referrals allow firms to select workers better-suited for particular jobs. To test our model, we use novel and detailed productivity and survey data from nine large firms in three industries: call-centers, trucking, and high-tech (software). Referred workers are 10-30% less likely to quit and have substantially higher performance on rare ""high-impact metrics"" (e.g. creating patents and avoiding truck accidents), despite having similar characteristics and similar performance on non-rare metrics. To identify the source of these behavioral differences, we develop four new statistical tests, all of which indicate that firms benefit from referrals predominantly by selecting workers with a better fit for the job, as opposed to referrals selecting workers with higher overall quality; to referrals enabling monitoring or coaching; or to it being more enjoyable to work with friends. We document that workers refer others like themselves, not only in characteristics but in behavior (e.g. unsafe workers refer other unsafe workers), suggesting that firms may gain by incentivizing referrals most from their highest quality workers. Referred workers achieve substantially higher profits per worker and the difference is driven by referrals from high productivity workers."
L84|Compensation Matters: Incentives for Multitasking in a Law Firm|"Due to the limited availability of firm-level compensation data, there is little empirical evidence on the impact of compensation plans on personal productivity. We study an international law firm that moves from high-powered individual incentives towards incentives for ""leadership"" activities that contribute to the firm's long run profitability. The effect of this change on the task allocation of the firm's team leaders is large and robust; team leaders increase their non-billable hours and shift billable hours to team members. Although the motivation for the change in the compensation plan was the multitasking problem, this change also impacted the way tasks were allocated within each team, resulting in greater teamwork."
L84|Internship Programs ï¿½ Opportunity for Start Career|Work experience is essential and appreciated by the organizations that hire new employees. One way the young people, completing their education, to acquire work experience is participation in the internship program. Organizations to develop and implement training programs, through which to raise suitable young people for work in organization, is practice in developed countries. Increasingly this practice is used in Bulgaria ï¿½ especially in larger organizations. Training programs give young people to gain valuable work experience that will help them in finding a permanent job after completion of their education. The paper research the benefits for trainees and the necessary conditions for a successful training program. In paper are used data from researches of Bulgarian consulting and non-government organizations.
L84|The Importance of Commercial Services in the Trade Activity|Although commercial services always accompanied the trade activities, the impact and power of these business were really felt about 3 decades ago. This paper aims to present the concept of commercial services from different points of view and to analyze various commercial business operations that implied the need to group trade services in several categories for easier administration, but also for solving economic and social problems such as vertical or horizontal competition. Due to the complexity and characteristics of commercial services, organization of commercial activities should provide flexibility depending on the time of the request, the moment of performance and the consumer behavior.Therefore,yhe knowledge of the characteristics of business services and their consequences for consumers and traders can influence the efforts to achieve results and to assume commercial risks.A briefly presentation of the commercial services development and their effects in the activity of a successful furniture trader is provided in order to demonstrate the importance of this type of services.

Questionnaires were mailed to 2,500 Crop Life magazine readers across the United States with a total of 262 questionnaires returned and 244 being usable. Keeping consistent with the objective of past precision survey, this survey asked respondents about their use and offerings of precision technology products and services, the economic implications of these products and services to their business, challenges they face with precision technologies, and their perception of on-farm adoption of precision technologies.
L84|Exploring Barriers to Innovation in Tourism Industry – The Case of Southern Region of Poland|This paper provides evidence for different factors hampering the innovative activity of micro, small and medium-sized tourist enterprises (MSMTEs). Innovation barriers are identified and explored within the framework of innovative chain of the regional tourism along its three main dimensions: organisational, environmental and innovation-process specifics. Empirical evidence is obtained through surveys conducted in 2012 in the southern region of Poland. The questionnaires were administered to representative samples of local tourist business stakeholders (MSMTEs, local governments, economic self-governments, tourists, local communities). The main conclusion is that the organisational, environmental and innovation-process related barriers to innovation in tourist sector appear to be closely and mutually interrelated. Furthermore, most of identified barriers emerge or tend to aggravate at the interfaces between local tourist business stakeholders.
L84|Resilience and recovery: The Philippine ITâ€“BPO industry during the global crisis|The Philippine business process outsourcing industry is poised to be a significant sector contributing to the countryâ€™s economic growth. Owing to the rapid development of information and communication technology in the past decade, the industry constantly boasts double-digit growth rates in revenue and manpower. However, as demand for outsourcing decelerated during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the industry faced its first major challenge. This research explores the Philippine information technologyâ€“business process outsourcing industryâ€™s performance during the crisis by assessing the post-crisis results of the industryâ€™s targets and strategies. The study identifies and analyzes the factors that contribute to the sectorâ€™s resilience and robust growth during the recession and concludes that offshored services can maintain short- to mid-term growth, but in the long term face major challenges with respect to innovation and talent sustainability. More importantly, the research emphasizes the central role of the Philippine government in the decision-making and policy-reform process that is essential in developing the Philippines into a business process outsourcing center of excellence.

(Consulting as a subject of study – a review of a recent literature.)|In this text I review the recent literature covering the main areas of research in the realm of consulting services. The reviewed studies were divided into four categories: a) studies about consulting industry treated as a whole, b) studies about processes and relations inside consulting organizations, c) studies focusing on relations between consulting organizations and their environments and d) studies pertaining to ethical dimension of consulting. The causes of growing popularity of consulting services in the modern world were described, as were characterized the consequences of consulting for isomorphism in public and private organizations.
L84|The evolving knowledge base of professional service sectors|The objective of the paper is to analyse the degree of heterogeneity across Professional Service sectors. While previous research concentrates on the criteria of industrial classification of these sectors, we propose an empirical analysis of employment structures and the associated skill bases. By shifting the focus from sectoral ‘boundaries’ to sectoral ‘structures’ we are able to appreciate under a novel perspective the emergence and evolution of specialization patterns.

L84|International Specialization In Services: Insights From A New Theoretical Taxonomy|The persistent assumption of nontradability of service activities led to a general lack of understanding of the role of services in country specialization and performance, in particular in the developed economies. Yet, the share of services in international trade is ever growing, proving their de facto tradability, and questioning about their potential for relocation, or rather relocatability. Relocatability of a service will in turn depend on its degree of territorial anchoring. This paper proposes a new taxonomy of the service activities according to their degree of territorial anchoring, based on the location determinants. Then, for a sample of developed countries, the international specialization is measured for each service activity. It ensues, by crossing results obtained, an inventory of the volatility of services in which countries of the sample are specialized, that can be used as a useful tool for the design of fiscal, social, employment or trade policies.
L84|What Do We Know About Contracting Out in the United States? Evidence from Household and Establishment Surveys|A variety of evidence points to significant growth in domestic contracting out over the last two decades, yet the phenomenon is not well documented. In this paper, we pull together data from various sources to shed light on the extent of and trends in domestic outsourcing, the occupations in which it has grown, and the industries engaging in outsourcing for the employment services sector, which has been a particularly important area of domestic outsourcing. In addition, we examine evidence of contracting out of selected occupations to other sectors. We point to many gaps in our knowledge on trends in domestic outsourcing and its implications for employment patterns and to inconsistencies across data sets in the information that is available. We recommend steps to improve data in this area.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
L84|Knowledge-Intensive Business Services: A Brief Overview|In the last decade of the 20th century knowledge has gained importance in the economy. This lead to the emergence of knowledge-based activities: knowledge-intensive organizations, and particularly knowledge-intensive services. These organizations function as external knowledge sources for other organizations. Their performance depends largely on professional knowledge. Since their performance has an impact on the success of their clients, it is important to look at those factors which influence the knowledge transfer between service provider and client organization. Based on theory and empirical research, the paper addresses the specific aspects of knowledge transfer from knowledge-intensive business service organizations to client organizations.

L84|Assessing the Efficiency of an Insurance Provider—A Measurement Error Approach|The purpose of this paper is to compare the cost efficiency of private and public property insurance providers in Switzerland. The most commonly used measure for this kind of exercise is the claims-premium ratio. We argue that this measure may give strongly biased results. We develop a simple model to test whether the elasticity of premiums with respect to claims is less than unity. We address the fact that premium income is relatively stable across time, while claims are not, using estimation techniques that correct for measurement error. We develop tools to cope with heteroskedasticity in such measurement errors and apply the model to a data set on 19 firms in housing insurance markets in Switzerland. We show that the public insurance providers are about 20% more cost efficient than their private counterparts. Copyright The Geneva Association 2005
