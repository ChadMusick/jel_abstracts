L83|The determinants of foreign tourism demand: separating elasticities for the extensive and the intensive margin|This paper estimates the elasticities of Italy’s foreign tourism demand to relative prices, nominal and real exchange rates using a dataset for tourism flows to Italy (and its macro-regions) over the period 1997-2015. By separating total tourism expenditure into the number of arrivals and per-capita expenditure, the effect of each explanatory variable can be divided into an extensive and an intensive margin. This disaggregation helps to clarify the reasons behind the mixed evidence found in the literature and offers a richer interpretation of elasticities. We find that the elasticities of tourism expenditure to relative prices and to nominal and real exchange rates are negative and range from -0.5 to -0.7, in line with previous results found in the literature. The effect on expenditure is channelled mainly via the extensive margin (i.e. the number of arrivals). Southern Italy shows higher price elasticities than the rest of the country, signalling a higher exposure to the competitive pressures from other Mediterranean destinations.
L83|Llegadas de turistas internacionales a Colombia durante 2001-2017: evolución, características y determinantes|En este documento se estudian las llegadas de turistas internacionales a Colombia. Se identifica el origen geográfico de los viajeros y se dividen en dos subgrupos: los colombianos residentes en el exterior y los extranjeros. Se encuentra que los arribos de turistas internacionales: i) se concentran en 20 países emisores, ii) se componen, mayoritariamente, de colombianos no residentes, iii) se aceleraron en los últimos 5 años debido al incremento notable de las llegadas de extranjeros, y iv) explican la dinámica de los ingresos externos por viajes. Se estiman ecuaciones de gravedad con modelos de datos panel para el periodo 2001- 2017, hallando que las llegadas dependen positivamente del tamaño de la economía de los países emisores de turistas, del volumen de comercio, de la población colombiana residente en el exterior y de la infraestructura en los establecimientos de alojamiento, y negativamente de la distancia hasta Colombia y de la percepción de inseguridad interna. Además, se encuentra que los determinantes de las llegadas son diferentes entre los colombianos no residentes y los extranjeros. **** ABSTRACT: We study international tourist arrivals to Colombia. We identify the travelers’ geographical origin and divide them into two subgroups: Colombians living abroad and foreigners. We find that the inflows of international tourists: i) are concentrated in 20 emitting countries, ii) are composed mostly of Colombians living abroad, iii) accelerated in the last 5 years due to the remarkable increase in foreigners’ arrivals, and iv) explain the evolution of international travel receipts. We estimate gravity equations using panel data models for the period 2001-2017, finding that arrivals depend positively on the size of the economy of emitting countries, the volume of trade, the Colombian population living abroad and the infrastructure in hotels and accommodation establishments, and negatively on the distance to Colombia and on the perception of internal security. In addition, we find that the determinants of arrivals are different for Colombians living abroad and foreigners.
L83|Quantifying the intangible impact of the Olympics using subjective well-being data|Hosting the Olympic Games costs billions of taxpayer dollars. Following a quasi- experimental setting, this paper assesses the intangible impact of the London 2012 Olympics, using a novel panel of 26,000 residents in London, Paris, and Berlin during the summers of 2011, 2012, and 2013. We show that hosting the Olympics increases subjective well-being of the host city's residents during the event, particularly around the times of the opening and closing ceremonies. However, we do not _nd much evi- dence for legacy e_ects. Estimating residents' implicit willingness-to-pay for the event, we do not _nd that it was worth it for London alone, but a modest wellbeing impact on the rest of the country would make hosting worth the costs.
L83|Strategic Investment Decisions in Multi-stage Contests with Heterogeneous Players|We study strategic investment decisions in multi-stage contests with heterogeneous players. Our theoretical model of a round-robin rank-order tournament predicts that players conserve resources in a current contest to spend more in the subsequent contest if the degree of heterogeneity in the current (subsequent) contest is sufficiently large (small). We confirm these predictions using data from German professional soccer, where players are subject to a one-match ban if they accumulate five yellow cards. We find that players with four yellow cards facing the risk of being suspended for the next match are (i) less likely to be fielded when the heterogeneity in the current match increases and (ii) more likely to receive a fifth yellow card in the current match when the heterogeneity in the next match increases or when the heterogeneity in the next match but one (for which they return from their ban) decreases.
L83|Girls' and Boys' Performance in Competitions: What We Can Learn from a Korean Quiz Show|We compare the performance of high-ability adolescent girls and boys who participated in a a long-running Korean television quiz show. We find there is a gender gap in performance – in favour of boys – across episodes of the quiz show. To investigate underlying mechanisms that might explain this, we explore how male and female performance varies under different rules of the game. We find that there are no gender gaps when stress is kept to a minimum – that is, in games without fastest-finger buzzer, knock-outs or penalties. However, in games with these features, there are significant gender gaps. In addition, we examine performance in Round 2 of the shows, where we find larger gender gaps. These are consistent with girls being increasingly hindered by psychological stress and risk aversion as competition is higher. Finally, we use panel data to estimate performance in the games in which players stay in for 25 questions. Here we find that girls are less likely to respond faster especially when their winning probability is higher. Further, the gender gap is more salient at the end of the game. The results are also consistent with gendered behavioural responses to psychological pressure.
L83|Gender Differences in Tournament Performance Over Time: Can Women Catch-Up with Men?|We investigate the evolution over time of gender differences in single-sex and mixed-sex tournaments, using field data from the Japanese Speedboat Racing Association (JSRA). The JSRA randomly assigned individuals into single-sex and mixed-sex races, enabling us to model learning in different environments. Our dataset comprises over one million person-race observations of men and women making their speedboat racing debut between 1997 and 2012. We find that the average debut-woman's performance (measured by lane-changing and place-in-race) improves faster than debut-men's in single-sex races, but more slowly than debut-men's in mixed-sex races. For the average male racer, the opposite is true.
L83|Making the most of tourism in Indonesia to promote sustainable regional development|Tourism has boomed in Indonesia in recent years and is already one of the main sources of foreign-currency earnings. Indonesia has rich and diverse natural assets, whose tourism potential remains underutilised. The government has an ambitious target of attracting 20 million tourists by 2019, up from nearly 14 million in 2017. The main destination will continue to be Bali. Using Bali as the preferred development model, the government wants to develop other destinations, particularly through infrastructure programmes to improve connectivity, which is a longstanding challenge for tourism as well as for regional development more generally. Enhancing the tourism-related skills of local populations will provide them with expanded job opportunities. This calls for reforms to vocational education and training. Moreover, recent efforts by the authorities to improve the business environment need to continue, including through helping firms embrace digitalisation. Tourism may be growing too fast in some destinations without adequately taking into account sustainability issues, both for the environment and local communities. Better planning and co-ordination at all levels of government and across relevant policy areas can facilitate more sustainable tourism development.This Working Paper relates to the 2018 OECD Economic Survey of Indonesia (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-indonesia.htm).
L83| Multiplicadores del turismo en el Perú, 2011| Este trabajo estima los multiplicadores Tipo I y II de producción, valor agregado, inversión, y empleo del sector turismo tomando en consideración la Cuenta Satélite del Turismo (CST) de los años 2007 y 2011. El turismo en el Perú de acuerdo a la CST del 2011 comprende doce ‘productos’ turísticos correspondientes a la actividad de la producción turística, 6 ‘productos’ conexos correspondientes a la actividad de la producción conexa al turismo, y 4 ‘productos’ no conexos correspondientes a la actividad de producción no conexa al turismo. La industria representa el 3,7% del PBI real y emplea al 3,4% de la población económicamente activa ocupada (PEAO) del Perú. En promedio para el periodo 2007-2015, el crecimiento del turismo ha sido ligeramente mayor que el crecimiento de la economía peruana, con una tasa promedio anual del producto bruto interno turístico per cápita de alrededor del 5%. Los multiplicadores miden las ‘expansiones potenciales’ en producción, empleo, y valor agregado, y exportaciones ante cambios positivos de la demanda final y sólo se podrán efectivizar si la oferta de los factores (internos a la firma y externos a las industrias) que inciden en la producción también respondan a dichos cambios. Los multiplicadores Tipo I miden los impactos directos e indirectos de cambios de la demanda final de todos los productos y/o actividades, asumiendo constante los efectos sobre el resto de sectores de la economía. Los efectos indirectos provienen de las interrelaciones productivas del turismo con el resto de sectores de la demanda final de la economía. Los de Tipo II miden los impactos directos, indirectos, e inducidos de cambios de la demanda final de todos los productos y/o actividades, asumiendo constante los efectos sobre el resto de sectores de la economía. Los efectos inducidos provienen de los aumentos de los ingresos destinados al consumo resultante del incremento de la producción en todos los sectores debido a los efectos indirectos. Las estimaciones muestran que los multiplicadores del sector turismo son relativamente más altos que los respectivos de la industria peruana sólo por sus efectos inducidos derivados de la demanda final.

L83| El sector gastronómico en el Perú: encadenamientos y su potencial en crecimiento económico| El presente trabajo analiza el potencial en crecimiento económico del sector gastronómico a través de las características productivas, encadenamientos y multiplicadores básicos de dicho sector y mercado con informaciones de diferentes fuentes desde el año 2004 hasta el 2016. El trabajo muestra, por un lado, que las magnitudes en valores reales de producción y empleo del sector están sobre-estimados debido a la inclusión de servicios o ´productos’ que díficilmente (y particularmente a nivel internacional), los ‘gourmets’ puedan considerarlos como ‘gastronómicos’. De otro lado, el trabajo muestra que el mercado gastronómico es segmentado por departamento (o región) y tamaño de empresa implicando diferentes elasticidades ingreso y precios de la demanda de los ‘productos, platos, recetas’ gastronómicos. Adicionalmente, los índices de complejidad de los productos de exportación y los multiplicadores de producción, valor agregado y empleo revelan el bajo nivel de complejidad de los ‘productos gastronómicos de exportación’ que implican capacidades productivas débiles y bajo dinamismo sobre el desarrollo y crecimiento de la economía. Los resultados del trabajo plantean una reconsideración de la tesis, propuesta por muchos, de que ‘la gastronomía es un sector motor de crecimiento y desarrollo económico de la economía peruana’. La probable contribución de la gastronomía está primariamente asociada a la inserción del sector a un política de promoción del sector turismo. JEL Classification-JEL: L83
L83|Spain's tourism models in the first third of the twentieth century|The remarkable emergence of the service sector to dominate the modern economy is the most outstanding consequence of the Industrial Revolution in the first third of the twentieth century. With it appeared a new social class which made an active contribution to the sector’s growth by opting for a new kind of tourist provision which was very different from traditional models, above all holidays in Spain. In the first third of the twentieth century, tourism in Spain was characterised by a variety of coexisting business models. On the one hand, business travellers went to the major cities. On the other hand, there was holiday travel, which can be broken down into three categories: the first type is traditional leisure-based tourism of an aristocratic cast, which dominated in the north, in the region of the Bay of Biscay, while the second type involves foreigners visiting the mythic south of Andalusia: Granada, Malaga, Seville and Cordoba. The third and final type, which appeared on the island of Majorca shortly after World War I, is the most modern, based on international colonial maritime traffic and cruise liners.
L83|Spatial dependence in museum services: An analysis of the Italian case|In this paper we investigate whether the services offered by museums are affected by the choices of neighbors, and we discuss whether the evidence can document that competition processes are at work. Specifically, we take into account the Italian case, where governmental and private museums co-exist. Resorting to Spatial Autoregressive Models, we show that a significant influence of neighbors’ choice concerning service supply does emerge. However, we cast several doubts that this piece of evidence can be solely due to sound competition among museums.
L83|Staking plans in sports betting under unknown true probabilities of the event|Kelly staking method has been shown to maximize long-term growth of bankroll. However, it demands for the estimation of the true probabilities for each event. As a result many sport tipsters have abandoned this staking method and opted for a flat staking plan ('unit loss') or, less frequently, an 'unit win' plan. We analyze under which assumptions these methods correspond to the Kelly staking method and propose a different staking plan: 'unit impact,' under the hypothesis that this plan fits better with the Kelly staking method. We test our predictions using a betting database from Pyckio, one of the most popular tipster platforms in the world. Results show empirical support for our hypothesis.
L83|From overtourism to sustainability: A research agenda for qualitative tourism development in the Adriatic|This paper discusses the nexus between economically-driven tourism development and broader societal aspects of social, cultural and ecological sustainability. The paper argues that similar to the discussion on the limits to growth in industrial development that started in the 1970s, the currently debated phenomenon of overtourism calls for a parallel discussion in tourism development. Similar to the argument that industrial development needs to be driven by qualitative, not quantitative growth, tourism development has to reorient itself away from the goal of ever-increasing tourist arrivals towards broader objectives of socially, culturally and ecologically sustainable qualitative growth. This argument leads to two policy implications. First, policymakers should consider which forms of tourism to encourage and which ones to discourage. Second, tourism policy should set incentives and disincentives accordingly. Institutional approaches from human geography can serve to analyze the prospects of these incentives and disincentives, and insights from behavioral economics such as the nudging approach can serve to shape policies accordingly. The paper takes the cases of two cities on the Adriatic sea, Venice and Dubrovnik, as examples.
L83|A Real Options Approach to Multi-Year Contracts in Professional Sports|This study utilized a number of useful innovations to estimate marginal revenue product’s for Major League Baseball free agents.Two robust results emerged from our empirical results. Free agents that are paid a salary below the MLB average tend to be underpaid, while those paid a salary above the MLB average tend to be overpaid. In addition, free agents on single-year contracts tend to be underpaid, while those on multi-year contracts tend to be overpaid. These results are not consistent with the standard monopsony talent market assumption, unless one resorts to arguing that the talent market is segmented. We develop a simple model of real options to demonstrate how a player can be overpaid or underpaid depending upon the length of the contract, the available opportunities for the player to move during the contract period and the player’s expected performance. We believe that a real options approach to player contracting is an important addition to the market-based approaches relied upon in the past.
L83|The Competitive pricing in marina business: Exploring relative price position and price fluctuation|Competitive pricing is considered to be a very important part of revenue management, a management instrument that enables selling right products and services to the customers at the prices that will produce highest revenues. Marina business is supposed to be a business whose products or services are perishable (similar to hotels, airlines, campsites, hostels etc.) and tracking prices of competitors is very important part of managing its business. The purpose of this paper is to address the problem of relative price position and relative price fluctuation performance in marina business and seeks to complement existing research in the domain of strategic price positioning. The research results reveal that marinas who set their prices higher than their competition achieve lower level of berth occupancy and at the same time succeed higher RevPAB. Marinas with lower prices than their competitors achieve higher level of berth occupancy and lower RevPAB.
L83|Festivals and destination marketing: An application from Izmir City|Festivals are among the growing global city and destination attraction factors and they are very trendy. Studies indicate that there is a direct relationship between the successful organizations of festivals and the number of visitors and tourism income of a city destination. Thus, festival marketing efforts usually have a direct impact on city marketing efforts. Due to this fact, the study tries to figure out the festival marketing potential of Izmir city that seems to lag behind the general tourism development pattern of Turkey contrary to the great potential it has. The study comprises of two main sections, first one being a literature review on festival marketing, followed by the second section on a qualitative research on Izmir’s festivals and their marketing potential. It tries to determine the positive impacts of Izmir’s festivals on destination marketing and by grouping and categorizing them under similar characteristics figuring out the most promising ones. The research consists of four open-ended interview questions on festivals held in Izmir city. As practical implications, Destination Management Organizations, Destination Marketing Organizations, destination and city marketers, festival managers and destination tourism developers may benefit from the findings of this study.
L83|Traveler segmentation through Social Media for intercultural marketing purposes: The case of Halkidiki|This paper aims to present a methodology for the segmentation of travelers by studying social media profiles and extracting information on their preferences and demographic traits. Through the study of the sample’s social media profiles (Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter), information about travelers’ demographics and preferences are combined for the segmentation of the tourists visiting a Greek region. From the analysis of the data, 10 preference-based segments occur, while the cultural-based division corresponds to the main national groups visiting the region.
L83|A Safe Minimum Standard, an Elasticity of Substitution, and the Cleanup of the Ganges in Varanasi|Despite repeated calls for a thorough cleanup of water pollution in the Ganges river, there are only two papers in the social sciences by Batabyal and Beladi (2017, 2019) that have shed theoretical light on this cleanup problem and its connection to the sustainability of tourism in Varanasi. Hence, we extend the above mentioned analyses and focus on two specific questions. First, we introduce the notion of a safe minimum standard (SMS) into the study and show how to analyze a probabilistic model of the Ganges cleanup problem when the SMS is accounted for. Second, for a representative citizen of Varanasi, we study how the magnitude of the elasticity of substitution between a composite consumption good and water quality in the Ganges---modeled by the SMS---affects the tradeoff between consumption and water quality maintenance.
L83|Increasing clicks through advanced targeting: Applying the third-party seal model to airline advertising|From five-star hotels and Michelin Star restaurants, few industries signal their quality and unique selling points through the use of third-party seals like tourism. However, despite using seals and certifications in advertising being widespread, little academic research has been conducted into their effectiveness. Through the running of campaigns on Facebook’s Ad Manager for Indian airline Jet Airways, this study applies the Third-Party Seal Model to optimise campaign audiences to target the right prospects with the most effective message. Findings and a practical framework for optimal campaign delivery for the airline industry are presented.
L83|Closed House of Wonders museum: Implications to the tourism of Zanzibar Stone Town, UNESCO World Heritage Site|This paper examines the impact of the closed House of Wonders Museum in the tourism industry of Stone Town, Zanzibar. The paper aims to propose the best practices taken into account due to the impact raised by the closure of the Museum. There has been no clear information on the overall situation which faces the site since 2012 when the Museum closed. Data collected through mixed methods, including the sample size of 105 tourists who visited the House of Wonders Museum, 8 Government Official, 6 Tour Guides and 8 Tour Operators. The findings show that the closed museum has affected the level of tourists’ satisfaction, tour operators, community and tour guides economically. The paper recommends quick rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Museum to save the integrity and authenticity of this World Heritage Site.
L83|Confidence and loyalty for agrotourism brands: The Lesvos paradigm|It has been established that strong brands are important in the agrotourism industry. Agrotourism brands provide the link between visitors and the agrotourism firms and tourists may or may not develop a degree of loyalty to relevant brands. The present study suggests that confidence in an agrotourism brand has high influence in development of brand loyalty. Based on hypotheses developed, confidence in an agrotourism brand is influenced by brand characteristics, agrotourism company characteristics and visitor characteristics. The present survey took place in Greece and examined the attitudes of visitors in agrotourism firms at the island of Lesvos. Survey results demonstrate that agrotourism firm brand characteristics appear more important in their impact on a visitor’s confidence in a brand. It was also established that confidence in a brand is positively influencing loyalty. Recommendations are developed for agrotourism marketers in relation to building and maintaining visitor confidence in a brand.
L83|The changing role of convention bureaus: An analysis of business models currently adopted by privately owned CBS|This study aims to describe how Italian Convention Bureau (CB) organisations faced the uncertainty about their future existence and role caused by government funding cuts and increased pressure from stakeholders to demonstrate market effectiveness and organisational efficiency. Firstly, it uses the business model concept to describe actors, activities and value creation processes of today’s CBs that largely rely on private funds. Secondly, it investigates the degree of concern of CB’s Board on measuring and monitoring the value created for the stakeholders that provide financial resources. Selected case studies relative to Italian CBs are analysed through in-depth interviews and document analysis. Findings point out that the profit model of the investigated CBs strongly relies on fees from partners and members or revenues from the sale of services to local operators. This implies that CBs make efforts to monitor the value created for these specific groups of stakeholders while less attention is given to the measurement of customers’ (i.e. event planners) satisfaction and impact of CB’s activities on the quality of life of local communities.
L83|Evaluating Factors of Small and Medium Hospitality Enterprises Business Failure: a conceptual approach|The aim of this paper is to present a comparison between macro and micro economic factors as they are suggested by the current literature in corporate failure field. Present study answers two research questions, firstly which the causes of corporate bankruptcies in tourism are, and secondly which metrics could help more on effectively predict a corporate failure. Based on a conceptual approach authors analyze and collect different macro and micro economic factors. Results indicates how strongly the various factors affect the quantity and intensity of bankruptcy applications and suggestions are given on how different models could be developed to predict the risk of bankruptcy in a macro or micro aspect. This is one of the first studies that investigates the effectiveness of different types of Corporate Failure metrics, which has, until now, suffered a dearth of conceptual studies in the field, especially in the context of national economies due to the economic recession.
L83|Travellers’ choice of information sources and information channels for domestic trips|The topics of disintermediation and re-intermediation, both offline and online, have captured the attention of researchers and practitioners alike. Relying on an information search perspective, this study aims to identify which factors (i.e. different socio-demographic characteristics and travel-related variables) best predict whether a traveller will seek information from a travel agency or from a service provider (i.e. information source choice) and if this will be done face to face or through the Internet (i.e. choice of communication channel). Contribution to the body of knowledge and managerial implications are discussed and suggestions for future research are given.
L83|Assessing the impact of tourism on hospitals’ performance in a coastal destination|Tourism represents one the most relevant industries in promoting the development of a destination, but tourism and its seasonality can produce negative outcomes. The additional demand caused by tourism can strongly affect public service providers which cannot adapt their supply to seasonal variations as a result of organisational, financial and institutional limitations. This work focuses on hospital services in an Italian coastal destination and it aims to explain the impact tourism and its related seasonality have on the performance of hospitals in a coastal destination. The activity of three hospitals located in Gallura, a region in the north-east of Sardinia, Italy, has been analysed. The analysis has been carried out using data on hospitals admission from 2014 and 2015.The study highlights the critical impact tourism can have on the activity of healthcare providers in a coastal destination, identifying the reduction of hospital performance and a potential cause of bed crises.
L83|Risk assessment for micro companies belonging to selected branches of the non-financial private services sector in Mexico through the Beta coefficient|The social and economic development of any country or region is closely linked to the performance of its economic units, specifically the micro-enterprises of the private non-financial services sector that provide the largest number of jobs in Mexico. The discipline of the valuation of companies allows to determine the value and the risks associated to any type of economic entity through the use of diverse financial tools; Specifically, the Capital Assets Valuation Model CAPM stands out. However, this model has several limitations that prevent the risk betas estimated in a general way from being useful for all types of companies. The present investigation was responsible for building an own index of microenterprises in Mexico to determine the respective beta risk coefficient for five branches belonging to the sector of temporary accommodation services and food and beverage preparation, which stands out for its number of establishments at the national level. The results generated allowed obtaining the five beta coefficients for each one of the selected branches, in such a way that said factors can be applied in a valid and effective way for the determination of the value and risks of companies belonging to these economic branches, constituting an alternative of valuation to obtain more and better financial resources.
L83|E-learning as a marketing tool for Tour Operators. The ‘Go Academy’ case study|Professional training has become increasingly more important as the tourism industry grows and evolves. It plays a particularly vital role in supporting business competitiveness in the traditional distribution system. This has encouraged a growing focus on e-learning and on the interesting advantages that it opens up in training activities. However, it has been given limited attention as a useful tool for marketing purposes. This paper aims to analyze the use of e-learning in the marketing perspective, with specific reference to the relationship between tour operators and travel agents, using the case study of the e-learning platform, Go Academy.
L83|Drivers of eco-innovation in the Spanish hospitality industry|The main goal of this research is to determine whether the accommodation capacity and the financial performance can be considered as the main driving forces of eco-innovation in the context of Spanish hotel industry. Eco-innovation is a challenge for tourism industry, given the connection and interrelationship between environmental quality and business performance. The eco-innovation plans represent a new field of research in its infancy. This paper addresses the conceptual evolution of eco-innovation to subsequently develop an analytical framework that tentatively explores this concept and its implementation in Spanish hotel companies through two basic internal characteristics of these organizations: their business performance and their respective size, measured in terms of accommodation capacity. The case study method was applied -through documentary evidence and structured interviews- to the 10 companies leading -in terms of turnover- the national hotel offering and have a remarkable international presence. All these interviews were conducted between November 6th, 2017 and February 28th, 2018.
L83|Conceptualizing triathlon sport event travelers’ behavior|This paper analyzes the relationships between self-congruity, functional congruity, satisfaction, sport event involvement and behavioral intentions of triathlon sport travellers. The moderating effect of different training experiences is assessed in allowing these relations. 885 data were collected among triathletes participating to international triathlon competitions. A theoretical model has been developed and tested using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The majority of hypotheses are empirically confirmed. Regarding the moderation hypothesis, a multi-group SEM has been estimated (considering high-intensity and low-intensity sport training as moderators). Some differences between the two groups are highlighted, remarking the need to develop differential marketing strategies in active sport tourism.
L83|Exploring community stakeholders’ perceptions of mass tourism: the case of Bruges|In the last years, there have been protests by residents against tourism in several destinations around the world. Tourists have also increasingly complained about destinations being overcrowded. At the same time, visitors are looking for more authentic experiences. Our research has been conducted in Bruges, one of the major tourist destinations in Belgium to analyse stakeholder’s perceptions of mass tourism and how destinations can ensure a more sustainable development. One of the major findings from this research is the importance of locals’ support to promote a sustainable tourism. Residents and local entrepreneurship could have a more positive attitude towards tourism if the positive impact outweighs the disadvantages of tourism. Practical and managerial implications are suggested.
L83|Who Loves to Gamble? Socio-Economic Factors Determining Gambling Behaviour in Germany|The interest among academics and policy makers in the economics of Gambling has risen substantially. Changes in gambling regulation, the relevance of gambling generated (tax) revenues and the usefulness to other fields of economics, increased the interest in understanding gambling demand. The focus of this paper is to provide one of the first comprehensive analyses of gambling demand in Germany, by studying the socio-demographic and socio-economic factors which influence gambling expenditures using one of the largest data sets available, the official income and consumption survey (Einkommens- und Verbrauchsstichprobe). Applying models suitable for censored data, we identify the factors influencing gambling demand. Some findings are in line with the previous literature on gambling demand, others are quite surprising. They show that female household heads spend less on gambling than their male counterparts. The number of dependants in the household influences gambling behaviour negatively, while married couples have higher expenditures than single person households. We find that while gambling expenditures increase with the age of the household head, they do so at a diminishing rate. Income is also a strong determinant of gambling expenditure. Gambling expenditures rise with the household's income. We find no evidence that expenditures increase regressively. Furthermore, the education and occupation of the Household head influences gambling behaviour. A higher education has a negative effect on the propensity to gamble. We also find that households with privately employed household heads tend to spend more on gambling than those with unemployed or self-employed household heads. On the other hand, a household head who is a civil servant or retired has a positive effect. In contrast to previous literature, we find a negative effect of urbanity on household gambling expenditure. We discuss these and other results in the context of the theory of risk taking preferences and also with a focus on gambling regulation and taxation.
L83|Economic development through halal tourism|Tourism is a potential sector in the world. The increasing number of tourist destinations and investments has encouraged this sector to become a major factor in foreign exchange earnings, employment, and business and infrastructure development. At present, halal tourism (halal tourism) is becoming a world trend. This is in line with the increase in the number of Muslim tourists from year to year. This article will review the concept of halal tourism, potential, and halal tourism as an alternative to economic development.
L83|Halal recreation potential in Indonesia in improving tourists and the global economy|This study confirms that halal recreation is one form of the tourism industry that has contributed to the growth in the number of tourists and the national economy, even contributing to the improvement of the world economy, with evidence that Indonesia has topped the Mastercard-Crescent Muslim Global Travel Index (GMTI) 2019 together with Malaysia. With a phenomenological approach, this study concluded that halal recreation in Indonesia has an important role in increasing the number of tourists and the global economy.
L83|The Crumbling of Francoist Spain’s Isolationism Thanks to Foreign Currency Brought by European Tourists in the Early Years of the Golden Age|The ‘Golden Age’ refers to an era of rapid economic growth which led to dramatic changes within European society. The steady rise in income coupled with recently introduced paid holidays encouraged the new middle classes to emulate the lifestyle of the glamorous and privileged trendsetters of the Belle Époque and the 1920s. The outward trappings of this included the purchase of a car and annual holidays in the Mediterranean, amounting in the 1950s to a sort of yearly pilgrimage. In the Balearic Islands and the Costa Brava an ample tourist sector flourished against a political background that was essentially in opposition to it – the autarchic stage of the Franco regime. Tourism, in the end, became one of the determining factors which provoked radical changes to this regime, leading eventually to complete abandonment of its militant isolationism.
L83|Twelve eyes see more than eight. Referee bias and the introduction of additional assistant referees in soccer|We are the first to investigate whether the introduction of additional assistant referees in the UEFA Europa League (in season 2009-2010) and the UEFA Champions League (in season 2010-2011) was associated with lower referee bias. To this end, we analyse a unique database with pre- and within-game characteristics of all games in seven recent seasons in these leagues by means of bivariate probit regression models. We find evidence for substantial referee bias before the introduction of additional referees, while no such evidence is found after the introduction. Furthermore, additional assistants go hand in hand with more yellow cards for both home and away teams. We show that these findings are robust to multiple operationalisations of referee bias and that they are not just picking up a general time evolution towards less referee bias or the effect of parallel reforms.
L83|Home advantage in European international soccer: Which dimension of distance matters?|We investigate whether the home advantage in soccer differs by various dimensions of distance between the (regions of the) home and away teams: geographical distance, climatic differences, cultural distance, and disparities in economic prosperity. To this end, we analyse 2,012 recent matches played in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. We find that when the home team plays at a higher altitude, they benefit substantially more from their home advantage. Every 100 meters of altitude difference is associated with an increase in expected probability to win the match, as the home team, by 1.1 percentage points.
L83|Girls' and Boys' Performance in Competitions: What We Can Learn from a Korean Quiz Show|We compare the performance of high-ability adolescent girls and boys who participated in a a long-running Korean television quiz show. We find there is a gender gap in performance -- in favour of boys -- across episodes of the quiz show. To investigate underlying mechanisms that might explain this, we explore how male and female performance varies under different rules of the game. We find that there are no gender gaps when stress is kept to a minimum -- that is, in games without fastest-finger buzzer, knock-outs or penalties. However, in games with these features, there are significant gender gaps. In addition, we examine performance in Round 2 of the shows, where we find larger gender gaps. These are consistent with girls being increasingly hindered by psychological stress and risk aversion as competition is higher. Finally, we use panel data to estimate performance in the games in which all players stay in for 25 questions. Here we find that girls are less likely to respond faster especially when their winning probability is higher. Further, the gender gap is more salient at the end of the game. The results are also consistent with gendered behavioural responses to psychological pressure.
L83|Lean management in the Hotel sector ? Opportunities and Threats|The lean concept has been identified with large companies, serial production, and the automotive industry. The approach is growing in popularity and the SME sector is increasingly using it. It is also gaining ground in the service sector. An ever-accelerating world does not always provide opportunities for understanding the principles of lean prior its introduction; consequently, the expected results rarely materialize. During my research in the service industry SME, the in-depth interviews, questionnaire queries, and on-site crawls (gemba walks) I have completed confirmed the existence of an illusory lean that originates from a misinterpretation of the principles. Lean is used as a tool and not as a philosophy. For this reason, it does not bring the expected results. Through hotel industry examples in my research, I present the development possibilities of the process and the potential dangers of misinterpreting lean use.
L83|Fire takes no vacation: impact of fires on tourism|Many Mediterranean-type climates around the world will face increased risks of wildfires as a consequence of climate change. In this study we consider the case of Portugal and estimate the impact of the increasing risk of forest fires on tourism. Using data for 278 municipalities for the 2000-2016 period we find a considerable negative impact of burned areas on the number of tourist arrivals, both domestic and inbound. We go beyond the traditional impact analysis and provide predictions for 2030 and 2050. The estimated costs to the Portuguese economy due to the impact of burned areas in 2030 range between 17.03 and 24.18 million Euros for domestic tourist arrivals and between 18.26 and 38.08 million Euros for inbound ones. In 2050, those costs will increase at least fourfold. These findings underscore the importance of taking the forest fire risks into account when planning local investments.

L83|Predicting disaggregated tourist arrivals in Sierra Leone using ARIMA model|This study have uniquely mad use of Box-Jenkins ARIMA models to address the core of the threes objectives set out in view of the focus to add meaningful value to knowledge exploration. The outcome of the research have testify the achievements of this through successful nine months out-of-sample forecasts produced from the program codes, with indicating best model choices from the empirical estimation. In addition, the results also provide description of risks produced from the uncertainty Fan Chart, which clearly outlined possible downside and upside risks to tourist visitations in the country. In the conclusion, it was suggested that downside risks to the low level tourist arrival can be managed through collaboration between authorities concerned with the management of tourist arrivals in the country.
L83|Twelve Eyes See More Than Eight. Referee Bias and the Introduction of Additional Assistant Referees in Soccer|We are the first to investigate whether the introduction of additional assistant referees in the UEFA Europa League (in season 2009-2010) and the UEFA Champions League (in season 2010-2011) was associated with lower referee bias. To this end, we analyse a unique database with pre- and within-game characteristics of all games in seven recent seasons in these leagues by means of bivariate probit regression models. We find evidence for substantial referee bias before the introduction of additional referees, while no such evidence is found after the introduction. Furthermore, additional assistants go hand in hand with more yellow cards for both home and away teams. We show that these findings are robust to multiple operationalisations of referee bias and that they are not just picking up a general time evolution towards less referee bias or the effect of parallel reforms.
L83|Home Advantage in European International Soccer: Which Dimension of Distance Matters?|We investigate whether the home advantage in soccer differs by various dimensions of distance between the (regions of the) home and away teams: geographical distance, climatic differences, cultural distance, and disparities in economic prosperity. To this end, we analyse 2,012 recent matches played in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. We find that when the home team plays at a higher altitude, they benefit substantially more from their home advantage. Every 100 meters of altitude difference is associated with an increase in expected probability to win the match, as the home team, by 1.1 percentage points.
L83|Measuring competitive balance in Formula One Racing|The Formula One Championship (F1) is one of the biggest sports businesses in the world. But, however, it seems to astonish that only very few scholarly articles analyze the F1 business. The aim of this study is to contribute to closing two gaps in the existing literature: it contributes (1) to the (sports) economic analysis of the F1 business and (2) to the literature on competitive balance in non-team sports. Like competitive balance in team sport leagues, also for F1 racing three dimensions can be distinguished: (a) race-specific competitive balance, (b) within-season competitive balance, and (c) between-season competitive balance. In addition to classical tools and data, some new and F1 specific indicators, like average lead changes or leading distance, are employed. Also, pitfalls induced especially by the used data source or calculation method are highlighted.
L83|How does online streaming affect antitrust remedies to centralized marketing? The case of European football broadcasting rights|The collective sale of football broadcasting rights constitutes a cartel, which, in the European Union, is only allowed if it complies with a number of conditions and obligations, inter alia, partial unbundling and the no-single-buyer rule. These regulations were defined with traditional TV-markets in mind. However, the landscape of audiovisual broadcasting is quickly changing with online streaming services gaining popularity and relevance. This also alters the effects of the conditions and obligations for the centralized marketing arrangements. Partial unbundling may lead to increasing instead of decreasing prices for consumers. Moreover, the combination of partial unbundling and the no-single-buyer rule forces consumers into multiple subscriptions to several streaming services, which increases transaction costs. Consequently, competition authorities need to rethink the conditions and obligations they impose on centralized marketing arrangements in football. We recommend restricting the exclusivity of (live-)broadcasting rights and mandate third-party access to program guide information to redesign the remedies.
L83| The role of boards' misperceptions in the relation between managerial turnover and performance: Evidence from European football|" In this paper, we account for boards’ misperceptions when replacing a top manager by differentiating between managerial turnovers following actual poor performance and managerial turnovers following seemingly poor performance due to bad luck in order to investigate their subsequent effects on performance. We focus on managerial changes within football organizations and analyze dismissals from the top European leagues. To account for the mean reversion of performance, we create a control group of non-dismissals using the nearest neighbor approach. To account for boards’ misperceptions, we differentiate between dismissals and non-dismissals that occur either due to poor playing performance on the pitch or due to a sequence of bad luck, which is measured using ""expected goals"". We find that dismissals after poor playing performance on the pitch increase subsequent performance, while dis-missals after a series of bad luck do not. Our results have important implications regarding the design of future turnover studies and the costs of boards’ ineffective turnover decisions."
L83| Does sentiment harm market efficiency? An empirical analysis using a betting exchange setting| This paper investigates whether the sentimental preferences of investors influence market efficiency. We use a betting exchange market environment to analyze the influence of sentimental bettors on market efficiency in 2,333 soccer matches played between 2006-2014 during the last three hours of the pre-play period. Contrary to bookmaker markets, there is no intermediary in a betting exchange and, thus, the market prices solely reflect the beliefs of person to person betting. We use three different proxy variables to measure the bettor sentiment and find that price changes are more likely to be inefficient for betting events that are more prone to sentiment. Based on that finding, we propose a trading strategy that generates positive returns before considering the transaction costs and commission fees. Although the returns turn negative after considering the transaction costs and commission fees, the proposed trading strategy still outperforms a random betting strategy.
L83| The advantage of scoring just before the halftime break – pure myth? Quasi-experimental evidence from European football| We examine whether the moment just before the halftime break is a particularly good time to score a goal. Using detailed data from the top five European football leagues between the 2013/14 and 2017/18 seasons, we exploit the quasi-random occurrence of goals scored just before and just after the halftime break. In the former situation, the game is exogenously inter-rupted by a break immediately after the goal, whereas in the latter situation, the game continues without interruption. We show that in the case of a goal being scored just before halftime, the scoring team benefits more from the halftime break than the conceding team.
L83| Investigating the conditions for psychological momentum in the field: Evidence from men’s professional tennis| We examine how interruptions and personal and contextual factors affect the manifestation of psychological momentum (PM). Using men’s singles tennis point-by-point data from the two Grand Slam tournaments, Wimbledon and Roland Garros, between 2009 and 2014 (N=29,934), we employ realized break points as the potential triggers of PM and rest periods between two sequential games as the exogenous task interruptions. Controlling for player ability and the state of the match, we find that players are more likely to win the next game after realizing a break point only if there is no rest period between games. Thus, our results suggest that interruptions terminate the momentum effect. Further-more, we find that the effect of PM increases for players with a lesser relative ability and at a later stage within a match, showing the importance of personal and contextual factors for PM.
L83|How outcome uncertainty, loss aversion and team quality affect stadium attendance in Dutch professional football|We investigate stadium attendance in the highest level of Dutch professional football for the seasons 2000/01 – 2015/16 focusing on outcome uncertainty, loss aversion and team quality. We find that for individual football matches, attendance is related to reference-dependent preferences with loss aversion dominating the preference for uncertain outcomes. Furthermore, team quality is an important determinant of stadium attendance. Towards the end of the season, outcome uncertainty regarding the final ranking becomes important. For this seasonal uncertainty, we find a positive and stable, but rather small impact of the introduction of a unique and large end-of-season play-off scheme for the qualification for European football.
L83|Emotional expressions by sports teams: an analysis of world cup soccer player portraits|Emotion display serves as incentives or deterrents for others’ in many social interactions. We study the portrayal of anger and happiness, two emotions associated with dominance, and its relationship to team performance in a high stake environment. We analyze 4,318 pictures of players from 304 participating teams in twelve editions (1970-2014) of the FIFA Soccer World Cup, and use automated face-reading (FaceReader 6) to evaluate the display of anger and happiness. We observe that the display of both anger and happiness is positively correlated with team performance in the World Cup. Teams whose players display more anger, an emotion associated with competitiveness, concede fewer goals. Teams whose players display more happiness, an emotion associated with confidence, score more goals. We show that this result is driven by less than half the players in a team.

L83|Tourism demand, low cost carriers and European institutions: The case of Brussels|The flow of tourism to a region is highly dependent on its accessibility and the cost of travel represents the main economic factor explaining tourism demand. The arrival of low cost carriers (LCC), with cheaper air fares, greatly leveraged the tourist flow around the world. However, as argued by some authors, if the destination is unique the importance of accessibility could be less relevant. Using quarterly data from 2000 to 2015, the paper assesses the effect of LCC on tourism demand focusing on Brussels. The peculiarity of Brussels comes from the high concentration of European and International institutions located in the city, which makes it a very interesting and singular case of research. Results reveal that LCC per se have a smaller positive effect on tourism demand for business purpose than the specific characteristic of Brussels. Indeed, the presence of European institutions complements the higher availability of low air fares, especially for business travellers.
L83|eSports: Profile of Participants, Complementarity with Sports and its Perception as Sport. Evidence From Sports Video Games|Research question: This study investigates three issues associated to the growing industry of eSports: the picture of participants in eSports and the correlates of the intensity of this participation; the complementary/substitutability relationship between eSports and traditional sports; and the perception of eSports as sport by the population. Research methods: Discrete choice, two-part and regression models are estimated using a sample of 11,018 individuals from the Survey on Sports Habits in Spain 2015. Results and Findings: The association of the correlates follows different patterns depending on whether considering participation or the intensity of this participation in eSports and also in terms of gender. Using different approaches, a significant degree of complementarity between participation and interest in eSports and traditional sports is estimated. For young people interested in eSports seems to an element influencing the overall interest in sports. Implications: Taking into account the different association of the correlates with the participation and the intensity of participation in eSports, this information could be used by firms in order to define marketing and brand investment strategies. The estimated complementarity between eSports and traditional sports should influence how the actual stakeholders in traditional sports define future strategies to favour the growth of both industries. The fact that eSports is increasingly perceived as a sport should have an influence, among others, in the collection of data on sports habits, in the way these activities are regulated and in the organization of multi-sport events, like the Olympic Games.
L83|Tourism Observatories 3.0: A Transnational Experiment in the MED|Following the precedent set by the Virtual Tourism Observatory run by the European Commission-DG GROW a few years ago, several initiatives have taken place to design and manage tourism observatories at both the transnational and local level. However, these initiatives do not yet seem able to provide adequate operational responses to the challenges that the Commission launched with the original VTO. While the opportunities offered by the Web 3.0 still do not seem to have been sufficiently taken advantage of, such initiatives also have not yet developed suitable methodologies to operationally include the tourism industry in the studies and monitoring performed by the OTs. This work presents an OT prototype including a participatory DSS (PDSS) designed specifically to overcome the aforementioned limits. The prototype was tested in 2017 on the entire eligible area of the 2014-2020 MED Programme covering 52 regions. The potentialities of this PDSS are shown through two case studies, one Italian and the other Portuguese.
L83|Recreational Value of the Baltic Sea: a Spatially Explicit Site Choice Model Accounting for Environmental Conditions|The Baltic Sea plays a significant role for recreational use in the nine littoral countries with more than 70% of the population visiting the coast, representing some 80 million recreation visits annually. Understanding the values associated with coastal recreation and the potential welfare changes of improving the state of the Baltic Sea is important for managing the marine environment. We estimate a spatially explicit travel cost model of coastal site recreation to the Baltic Sea to assess the welfare of accessing individual sites, identify recreational hotspots and simulate the welfare changes resulting from improving environmental and infrastructure conditions. The total benefits associated with the Baltic Sea based recreation amount to 11.4 billion EUR per year with significant variation across sites. Improving water quality and infrastructure boost the recreational value by nearly 9 billion EUR, almost doubling the recreational benefits compared to current conditions.
L83|The Impact of Foreign Participation in Outdoor Tourism Activities on Job Creation|We test whether foreign tourists in outdoor activities have contributed to job creation in Northern Portugal in 2006-2014. This is the very first study in Portugal that focus on the impact of foreign participation in outdoor activities on job creation, being innovative in this regard. Based on data from 4 sources, we employ OLS to regress the employment changes on the number of new firms, turnover, the share of foreigners in outdoor tourism activities, and on labour productivity. Results indicate a negative but not statistically significant impact. This result may imply that the higher foreign participation in outdoor tourism activities the lesser the number of employees in those firms. However, since results are non-significant they suggest the need of further empirical investigation.
L83|Forecasting Tourist Arrivals with Google Trends and Mixed Frequency Data|In this paper, we examine the usefulness of Google Trends data in predicting monthly tourist arrivals and overnight stays in Prague during the period between January 2010 and December 2016. We offer two contributions. First, we analyze whether Google Trends provides significant forecasting improvements over models without search data. Second, we assess whether a high-frequency variable (weekly Google Trends) is more useful for accurate forecasting than a low-frequency variable (monthly tourist arrivals) using Mixed-data sampling (MIDAS). Our results stress the potential of Google Trends to offer more accurate prediction in the context of tourism: we find that Google Trends information, both two months and one week ahead of arrivals, is useful for predicting the actual number of tourist arrivals. The MIDAS forecasting model that employs weekly Google Trends data outperforms models using monthly Google Trends data and models without Google Trends data.
L83|The good tourist, the bad refugee and the ugly German: Xenophobic activities and tourism|Germany shows a more welcoming attitude towards refugees than most other European countries. At the same time, the influx of refugees has led to massive protests, demonstrations and attacks against refugees. We look at the economic effects of these demonstrations and attacks on one important industry, namely tourism. Combining a novel, district-level data set on tourism with data on xenophobic activities, we find that xenophobic demonstrations have negative effects on tourist arrivals. This effect is found for domestic and foreign tourists.
L83|Effects of the three-point rule in German amateur football|Possible effects of the introduction of the three-point rule in 1995 are tested by using data from amateur football leagues in Germany, concretely in Westphalia. There are as expected signifi-cantly less draws and more goals since the rule change. For even amateurs follow incentives.
L83|Chance or Ability? The Efficiency of the Football Betting Market Revisited|The extent of market efficiency induced by rational behaviour of market participants is central for economic research. Many economists have already examined sports-betting markets as a laboratory to better understand trading behaviour and efficiency of stock prices while avoiding to jointly test the hypothesis of a correct capital market model. The following paper will investigate whether the European football betting market fulfils the efficiency paradigm introduced by Fama (1970) with a unique dataset allowing for an investigation of the German betting market in view of its regulatory changes recently. The analysis contributes to the literature by conducting a variety of empirical strategy including rational expectation frameworks and an ordered choice model to stress the ex post market performance from a weak and semi-strong form perspective. In view of existing market distortions as taxes, switching costs of changing betting providers and limitation in competition, the results of the analysis are indicative of a rational market equilibrium surprisingly close to the efficiency benchmark.
L83| Dealing with randomness in match outcomes: how to rethink performance evaluation and decision-making in European club football| In European club football, decision-makers often rely on recent match outcomes when evaluating team performance, even though short-term results are heavily influenced by randomness. This can lead to systematic misjudgments and flawed decisions when the random component is sufficiently large. We show that expected goals based on quantified scoring chances provide an evaluation metric that predicts future performance more accurately than do recent match results. Building upon this metric, we develop a chart that compares teams’ official league ranking to their ranking based on expected goals, which can alert decision makers to sensitive situations where a team’s true quality on the pitch is likely to deviate from the performance indicated by match outcomes due to random forces. Thus, incorporating this additional information into decision-making should enable clubs to avoid making poor decisions in certain situations and to improve the overall decision quality in the long run.
L83| The Role of Physical Attractiveness in Tennis TV-Viewership| What is beautiful is good, the ancient Greek lyric poet Sappho wrote over 2,500 years ago. Studies in social sciences, anthropology, psychology, and economics have shown various effects of physical attractiveness. Physically attractive people are hired more often, receive faster promotion, and generally earn more per hour; thus, there is a beauty premium. However, within the context of sports, little is known about consumer preferences concerning athletes’ physical attractiveness. In this study, we analyze 622 live tennis matches from 66 Grand Slam tournaments between 2000 and 2016, examining the relationship between attractiveness, measured by tennis players’ facial symmetry, and TV-viewership. We show that facial symmetry plays a positive role for female matches while there is no significant effect for male matches. The effect persists in several subsample regressions and robustness checks. Our results have important implications for managers in the field of sports. TV-broadcasters will likely acknowledge additional revenue potential from advertising due to increased viewership and change their programming accordingly. We contribute to the sports management and economics literature in that we introduce a new method to measure facial symmetry and show that physical attractiveness plays a positive role in tennis TV-viewership.
L83|European Club Football after “Five Treatments” with Financial Fair Play—Time for an Assessment|UEFA’s Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play Regulations (FFP) have impacted European club football. After five distinct applications of the break-even requirement, which represents the cornerstone of these regulations, it is time for an assessment. How has the situation in European top-division football changed since the FFP regulation? The most recent financial data show that European club football is characterized by significant financial recovery and further polarization. How has the FFP regulation presumably affected this development? This article discusses plausible reasons why FFP has contributed to financial recovery but has not aggravated polarization. Understanding the drivers of polarization is essential before taking further regulatory steps.
L83|On-field Performance Assessment in Football: Applying the Connected Network Data Envelopment Analysis Model|In this paper, we apply for the first time the connected network Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model to assess the on-field performance of football clubs during a league season. Specifically, we separately measure football clubs’ technical efficiency in offense, defense, and points’ earning by using their: (i) attacking and defending moves as the inputs of offense and defense, respectively; (ii) goals scored and goals conceded as the intermediate measures that simultaneously serve as both: (a) the single outputs of offense and defense, respectively; and (b) the inputs of the points’ earning process; (iii) points earned as the single output of the points’ earning process. To illustrate the usefulness of our theoretical framework, we make use of aggregate match statistics from the 2013-2014 Greek premier football league.
L83|Termination Risk and Agency Problems: Evidence from the NBA|When agents with a significant risk of termination in the short term have discretion over project selection, they may have incentives to underinvest in projects whose results would be realized only in the long term, and owners may take this agency problem into account when deciding whether to grant those agents discretion in decision-making. Because NBA rookies who participate in games gain NBA experience that likely improves their long-term performance, decisions of NBA teams about whether to let rookies play provide a useful context for investigating this potential agency problem. We develop a model that identifies when owners will choose to leave coaches with discretion over rookie participation decisions and shows that, in the presence of such discretion, coaches facing a higher termination risk can be expected to use rookies less often. Testing our model using NBA data, we find evidence that is consistent with the predictions of our model.
L83|The impact of occupancy in collective accommodation establishments on the selected macroeconomic variables in the Czech Republic in the period 2001 - 2015| The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of occupancy in collective accommodation establishments in the Czech Republic at an average rate of unemployment (%) to GDP (%) and the average pace of real wage growth (%) between 2001-2015. The methods are regression and correlation analysis. The output is then evaluate the impact of occupancy on the selected parameters. The most significant impact has occupancy in collective accommodation establishments at the average rate of unemployment. When we are comparing the GDP growth parameters and occupancy collective accommodation establishments is no evidence of a linear relationship. For evaluation of development depending average growth rate of real wages in total attendance collective accommodation establishments is indirect evidence of a weak linear dependence.
L83|Racers f attractive looks, popularity, and performance: How do speedboat racers react to fans f expectations?|Using a large sample of individual-level records in Japan speedboat racing where men and women racers participate, we investigated how racers f performance meets fans f pre-race expectations. To control for endogeneity bias, we measured the order of racers f attractiveness randomly determined in each race and then used this order as instrument for measuring racers f popularity. The fixed effects IV estimations revealed the following. (1) Racers who are more attractive than their competitors tend to be more popular even after controlling for the condition of the race, racer ability, and other characteristics. (2) More popular men show better performance in the race even if the reward does not vary according to popularity; such tendency is not observed for women. This study contributes a novel setting for determining the expectation enhancing effects of physical attractiveness.
L83|Perception Versus Reality - Competitive Balance In Major League Soccer From 1996 – 2016|For different sports leagues, studies show the positive effect of competitive balance on fan interest and consequently revenues. Particularly for Northern American leagues, competitive balance is a core concept in the construction of such, also to ensure financial stability of teams. Nevertheless, most studies in the literature concentrate on measuring competitive balance in European football leagues. To enhance the existing literature, our paper analyzes competitive balance in Major League Soccer (MLS), a comparatively young and therefore still developing league. To encompass ex-post results, as well as the ex-ante perception of fans if a league or match is uncertain in its outcome, we distinguish between ´actual´ and ´perceived´ competitive balance. Based on compiled data for MLS from 1996 until 2016 we measure the ´actual´ level of competitive balance in MLS with several commonly used competitive balance measures. Considering the corresponding decimal odds predictions and team wage bill information from 2006 until 2016, the ´perceived´ competitive balance is measured using a seemingly unrelated regression and further explanatory statistics. While the results of the ´actual´ competitive balance measurements indicate a league that becomes more balanced over time, the perception points towards an imbalanced league with clear favorites and reduced uncertainty of outcome.
L83|The Superstar Code - Deciphering Key Characteristics And Their Value|The purpose of the presented research is to advance the superstar literature on the aspect of superstar’s characteristics and value. Typically, superstar research is faced with one problem: They apply the same criteria to determine who their superstars are as to describe them later because they lack “an objective measure of star quality” (Krueger, 2005, p.18). To avoid this complication, the author chose to study Major League Soccer’s (MLS) designated players as this setting present a unique, as discrete, assignment of star status. MLS has formally introduced stars in 2007 under the designated player (DP) rule which delivers over 100 star-observations in the last ten years to investigate MLS strategy of star employment. The insights from this data set demonstrate which characteristics are relevant, whether MLS stars can be categorized as Rosen or Adler stars, and what the MLS pays for and in this sense values most. A cluster analysis discovers a sub group of ten stars that stand out from the others, in this sense superstars. A two-stage regression model confirms the value stemming from popularity, leadership qualities, previous playing level, age and national team experience but refutes other typical performance indicators like games played and goals scored or position. Overall, evidence for Rosen and Adler’s theory is found, and an over the time change from hiring old and popular stars to younger but still leadership-prone stars.
L83|“A regional perspective on the accuracy of machine learning forecasts of tourism demand based on data characteristics”|In this work we assess the role of data characteristics in the accuracy of machine learning (ML) tourism forecasts from a spatial perspective. First, we apply a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on non-parametric regression to isolate the different components of the time series of international tourism demand to all Spanish regions. This approach allows us to compute a set of measures to describe the features of the data. Second, we analyse the performance of several ML models in a recursive multiple-step-ahead forecasting experiment. In a third step, we rank all seventeen regions according to their characteristics and the obtained forecasting performance, and use the rankings as the input for a multivariate analysis to evaluate the interactions between time series features and the accuracy of the predictions. By means of dimensionality reduction techniques we summarise all the information into two components and project all Spanish regions into perceptual maps. We find that entropy and dispersion show a negative relation with accuracy, while the effect of other data characteristics on forecast accuracy is heavily dependent on the forecast horizon.
L83|Catch-Up: A Rule That Makes Service Sports More Competitive|Service sports include two-player contests such as volleyball, badminton, and squash. We analyze four rules, including the Standard Rule (SR), in which a player continues to serve until he or she loses. The Catch-Up Rule (CR) gives the serve to the player who has lost the previous point—as opposed to the player who won the previous point, as under SR. We also consider two Trailing Rules that make the server the player who trails in total score. Surprisingly, compared with SR, only CR gives the players the same probability of winning a game while increasing its expected length, thereby making it more competitive and exciting to watch. Unlike one of the Trailing Rules, CR is strategy-proof. By contrast, the rules of tennis fix who serves and when; its tiebreaker, however, keeps play competitive by being fair—not favoring either the player who serves first or who serves second.
L83|The tourism and economic growth enigma: Examining an ambiguous relationship through multiple prisms|The current literature on the tourism-economic growth causal relationship is rather contested. Thus, the aim of this paper is to revisit this ambiguous relationship from a more holistic view, providing a comprehensive study of destinations across the globe which takes into account the key dynamics that influence tourism and economic performance. More specifically, we focus on 113 countries over the period 1995â€“2011, grouped into clusters based on six criteria, which reflect their economic, political and tourism dimensions. A Panel Vector Autoregressive model is employed to reveal the tourismâ€“economy interdependencies across these clusters. Overall, the economicâ€“driven tourism growth hypothesis seems to prevail in most cases, although some shortâ€“lived bidirectional causalities are also identified. Thus, depending on the economic, political and tourism status of a destination, different policy implications apply.

L83|Do Better Informed Investors Always Do Better? A Buyback Puzzle|We explore the value of private investment information using data from a singular source: auctions of yearling racehorses. Horse breeders possess superior information about their own horses and have strong financial incentives to buy the best of these back at auction. However, those they repurchase subsequently perform significantly worse on average, earning 30% less at the racetrack than horses purchased by outsiders. Moreover, this underperformance is concentrated in male horses, despite these being purchased exclusively for racing purposes. These puzzling findings cannot be explained by differences in horse risk or breeder abilities, or by nonfinancial objectives, or by behavioral or selection biases. (JEL G02, G11, G14, L83, D44)

L83|Talent Development and Labour Market Integration: The Case of EU Football|We analyse how the Bosman ruling changed the incentives for football clubs in the European Union (EU) to develop talents. We show that the stiffer bidding competition over star players after the Bosman ruling has spurred talent development primarily in EU countries without established top clubs. This, in turn, has had a positive impact on their junior and senior national teams’ performance. However, the stiffer bidding competition has also led to a lower competitive balance in the Champions League, as non-established clubs prefer to sell their star players instead of challenging the top clubs. We provide empirical evidence consistent with these findings.
L83|Supporting the Dance Sector. Does Efficiency Clash with Success When Programming?|Dance has received scant attention in economic literature perhaps because it is an activity that appears under a number of legal forms and diverse formats and due to the fact that â€“in many instances- it is affected by a high degree of instability time-wise, thus making it difficult to have the necessary data available required for economic analysis. Nevertheless, this sectorâ€™s dependence on public funding provides grounds for it to be the subject of performance related studies. This work aims to offer an evaluation process for a public project designed to spread dance in Spain. The project involves a number of stakeholders: public authorities, performance venues and dance companies. Each participant plays a role in the project: public authorities provide the funding while the theatres and dance companies offer the artistic idea that is taken to the audience. By applying Data Envelopment Analysis techniques (DEA), the present work seeks to evaluate the efficiency of the stakeholders involved in the project, as well as the efficiency of the programme itself by relating resources and objectives. We find that efficiency in resource performance often runs counter to other cultural aims such as increasing audiences or extending repertoire diversity.
L83|Sales impact of servicescape’s emotional and rational stimuli: a survey study|Environmental psychologists suggest that people feelings and emotions determine what they do and how they do it. According to the stimulus organism respons model (SOR), the environment creates a behavioral/emotional response in individuals that, in turn, induces approach or avoidance behaviors. We conducted survey in six stores, settled in six different Italian cities, of a Swedish-founded Dutch-based multinational group, that designs and sells ready-to-assemble furniture, kitchen appliances and home accessories. Firstly, we apply the SOR model to evaluate loyalty program participation impact on consumers receipts. Subsequently, we provide empirical evidence about the effects of an emotional-sensorial stimulus (i.e. the presence of the restaurant inside the store). Through both a non-parametric and parametric testing, we found that environmental stimuli have a positive effect in terms of sales.
L83|Investigating the Efficiencies of World Cup Teams via DEA Approach|It is crucial to analyze football teams since football has increasingly become a significant industry within the economy. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been applied to many branches and especially to football. This paper investigates the technical efficiency levels of national teams participating in World Cup 2014 to shed light on the sport performance. Input oriented CCR/BCC model and super efficiency analyses have been used to investigate the football efficiencies. In this study, passes completed, attempts on target and possession are used as input while the only output is goal scored. The results have illustrated that World Cup winner Germany is found as efficient on both CCR and BCC model. On the other hand, only four teams are technically efficient within 32 teams while nine teams have demonstrated pure efficiency. Colombia is the most efficient team for both CCR and BCC super efficiency model. In this regard, we may conclude that efficiency would be a viable instrument in analyzing the football teams.
L83|Local Economic Tourism Development: Lessons From Southern Africa|As one of the largest industries in the world, the tourism industry has a positive economic impact on countries. This is especially true for developing countries where tourism is an essential driver for economic growth and development. In this regard Africa and specifically Southern Africa has plenty to offer tourists. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) is a regional economic community comprising fifteen member states, namely Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe (SADC, 2017). The tourism industry in the SADC region has been growing rapidly and the region has prioritized tourism as a means of promoting economic development and regional integration (SADC, 2017). For the fulfillment of these goals, a protocol on the development of tourism was created. The protocol aims to use tourism as a means for sustainable development drawing on the region?s natural and cultural resources (SADC, 2017). Southern Africa has large rural areas and many communities in need of local economic development (LED). LED is thus an on-going concern. Route tourism is often seen as a means to attract tourists to rural areas and to ensure that product owners, community members and governments are involved in a coordinated way (World Bank, 2017). The paper intends to reflect on the local economic development activities of two areas in Southern Africa where local economic development tourism has been contemplated. This includes the Maloti Drakensberg Tourism Route in South Africa and the Four Deserts Tourism Route in southern Namibia. The aim of the paper is to contribute theoretically and empirically to the development of approaches that enable growth for rural areas and to identify how LED has been implemented or not in the two study areas. Although the paper reflects a southern African perspective it will provide valuable insights applicable to other local economic tourism initiatives.
L83|Investigation of Customer Loyalty in Tourism|Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate customer loyalty in the tourism sector by taking into consideration quality of service and customer satisfaction.Method: A questionnaire was applied to measure customer loyalty, quality of service and customer satisfaction. 369 customers answered the questionnaire voluntarily. Approximately 42% of customers who filled out the questionnaire were male. The data were analyzed using the structural equations modeling. Results: The customer satisfaction and quality of service have been used to explain customer loyalty. A structural equation model containing these latent variables have been constructed and estimated. The signs of the standardized coefficients have been found to be in accordance with the expectations. Quality of service has directly positively affected customer loyalty (?=0.51; p
L83|Travel Constraints of Taking a Volunteer Vacation Abroad|This study examines travel constraints and risks faced by Thai people in taking a volunteer vacation oversea. The primary objective of this study was to gain rich, in-depth, and holistic understanding of how Thai people perceive and interpret travel constraints and risks in taking a volunteer trip oversea. An interpretive paradigm utilising qualitative research approach was employed in this study. The data were gathered from 28 respondents who had experience in volunteering in Thailand, but had no experience in taking a volunteer vacation oversea. The number of the informants was determined by data saturation point, which is when new theme stopped emerging from the data during the data collection and analysis process. These informants were selected via purposive sampling and snowball sampling. A combination of semi-structured interviews and participant observation was used to collect the data. The data were then analysed by thematic analysis technique. The research findings showed that all informants in this study had perceived of travel constraints and risks which influenced their decision to take a volunteer trip oversea. In terms of travel constraints, three categories of travel barriers were identified: intrapersonal barriers; interpersonal barriers; and structural barriers. As for the travel risks, seven categories of risks were found including: risks concerning transportation; risks concerning laws and orders; health risks; risks concerning accommodations; risks concerning climate; risks concerning tourist attractions; and risks concerning medical support system.
L83|The Relationship Between Footballer and Head Coach Transfer News and Stock Prices of Sport Clubs|Sportive performances of sports clubs are closely pursued by investors and the effect of match results on stock prices are widely investigated in the literature. On the other hand, whatever the results of the matches might be, the football players and head coaches affect the game by their physical performances, abilities, intelligence and strategic thinking characteristics. Football players and head coaches are the most important assets of the clubs that they work for. Nevertheless, the impact of transfer news of football players and head coaches on the clubs' stock prices have rarely been studied. We aimed to analyze the effects of transfer news of Trabzonspor (TSPOR: Istanbul), one of the four sports clubs traded in Borsa Istanbul, on stock prices within the scope of this study. The transfers exceeding a capital of 1 million Euros during the period of 2013-2017 were investigated by event study analysis. By analyzing 47 events related to football players and 15 events to head coaches, it was found that the contract news of head coaches had more prominent effects on returns than that of footballers'.
L83|The Effects Of Major Sports Events On Economic Growth And Foreign Direct Investment Inflows: The Results Of Empirical Estimation|In the modern literature there is no consensus on the effects arising in countries as a result of hosting major sports events, namely the Olympic Games, FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship. This paper focuses on two aspects of the major sports events effects in the hosting country: on economic growth and foreign direct investment inflows. The estimated database includes indicators for all countries that hosted major sport events during 1970?2015. This paper confirms the hypotheses of positive effects both on economic growth and foreign direct investment in the hosting countries. Positive significant effects are found not only during the period of preparation to the event, but (what is more important) during the 4 to 12 year period after the event.
L83|Regionale und lokale Wirtschaftsförderung: Meran und Brixen im Kontext der Regionalökonomie Südtirols<BR>[Regional and Local Economic Development: Merano and Bressanone within the Context of South Tyrol’s Regional Economy]|The present study takes stock of the regional economy of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano-Alto Adige/Bozen-Südtirol (South Tyrol) and the local economies of the cities of Merano/Meran and Bressanone/Brixen. In particular, the stocktaking exercise covers the sectoral structure of the economy, the role of retail and culture, and the state of tourism development in the two cities. Further, the study assesses agents and initiatives of local and regional economic development in both cities and on the provincial level. The stocktaking exercise takes into consideration the role of European structural policy and notably the province’s smart specialisation strategy. Based on the regional and local economic analysis, stylized conclusions are drawn and preliminary recommendations are given on how to develop the regional and local economies analyzed over the course of the coming years.
L83|Superstars in Team Sports: An Economic Model|In professional sports, superstars can earn extremely high incomes compared with those of other players. The existence of superstars in team sports is interesting because, unlike in individual sports, it is the teams that compete, not the individual players. This paper examines the mechanism of how an individual player can be a superstar even in the context of team sports. The key to the mechanism is that the probability of winning differs tremendously depending on whether or not a team has top-ranked players (i.e., those with relatively high abilities). This factor, combined with the effect of ranking preference, means that the salaries of players increase exponentially from the bottom- to the top-ranked player. As a result, a top-ranked player can be a superstar even in team sports.
L83|Probabilistic Approaches to Cleaning the Ganges in Varanasi to Attract Tourists|We study two probabilistic approaches to cleaning the Ganges river when the underlying goal is to use the cleanup to sustain tourism in Varanasi, India. The first approach models the idea that because resources are scarce and cleanup is costly, not all pollutants in the Ganges can be removed. Therefore, a cleaning agency first establishes a benefit-cost ratio rule and then it uses this rule to remove from the Ganges only those pollutants whose removal satisfies the ratio rule. In contrast, the second approach focuses on removing all pollutants from the Ganges but the emphasis now is on the frequency of cleanup given that pollutants accumulate temporally and hence water quality deteriorates over time. Finally, we compare and contrast these two approaches and discuss the connections between the two approaches and the sustainability of tourism in Varanasi.
L83|Chance or Ability? The Efficiency of the Football Betting Market Revisited|The extent of market efficiency induced by rational behaviour of market participants is central for economic research. Many economists have already examined sports-betting markets as a laboratory to better understand trading behaviour and efficiency of stock prices while avoiding to jointly test the hypothesis of a correct capital market model. The following paper will investigate whether the European football betting market fulfils the efficiency paradigm introduced by Fama (1970) with a unique dataset allowing for an investigation of the German betting market in view of its regulatory changes recently. The analysis contributes to the literature by conducting a variety of empirical strategy including rational expectation frameworks and an ordered choice model to stress the ex post market performance from a weak and semi-strong form perspective. In view of existing market distortions as taxes, switching costs of changing betting providers and limitation in competition, the results of the analysis are indicative of a rational market equilibrium surprisingly close to the efficiency benchmark.1
L83|Air passengers during the economic crisis: The Spanish case|This paper examines whether there is a relationship between the recent economic and financial crisis and air passengers in Spain. Static and dynamic models are estimated using data for the period 2004-2016. Initially, no relationship can be discerned between the variables; however, the estimates also show a possible dynamic relationship between the economic crisis and the number of passengers using Spanish airports, depending on the proportion of low-cost airlines at each airport.
L83|Tourism Planning and Tourismphobia: An Analysis of the Strategic Tourism Plan of Barcelona 2010-2015|The exponential growth of tourism has brought new challenges to destinations; how to plan themselves to avoid overtourism and this new form of intolerance, the so-called tourismphobia. In order to address the negative impacts of tourism and enhance the positive ones Barcelona has developed and implemented a strategic tourism plan. This paper seeks to understand how Barcelona addressed the tourismphobia problematic through planning: how it was done and which results were achieved in the end. This research reveals a clear gap between the planner’s intention and the plan’s implementation.
L83|Interaction from tourism development in Port-au-Prince, Haiti|Intensive or inadequate management of tourism and related development may affect the nature, integrity and the dominant features of an area. Local communities hosting tourism often are the weaker link which interacts with guests and service providers within the tourism value chain. Therefore, tourism development should embrace the paradigm of sustainability by improving the living conditions of host communities, ensuring efficient use of the resources available, and valorizing and preserving local heritage and traditions from any damages or loss. This paper examines the extent to which tourism development may affect social, economic, and environmental conditions of communities of the Sud Department of Haiti particularly Les Cayes. To meet the objective of this paper, we surveyed of 453 residents and examined their views on the influence of tourism development in the region. By using conducting this survey, we gathered insights on what is considered significant for the respondents, and also an assessed the influence of number of residents, place of residence, and coastal vs. Inland on residents' perceptions.
L83|Goldmine or Bottomless Pitt? Exploiting Cornwall’s Mining Heritage|This research paper discusses the rise of the heritage and tourist industry in Cornwall. It aims to historically contextualize this process by analyzing it in relation to the neo-liberal political landscape of the 1980s. The paper highlights several consequences of industrial heritage tourism in the region, including the growing gap between rich and poor that resulted from the arrival of newcomers from the richer Eastern counties and the perceived downplaying of Cornish heritage. It will explain how these developments paved the way for regionalist activists who strived for more Cornish autonomy in the field of heritage preservation and exploitation.
L83|Modelling wedding marketing strategies: An fsQCA Analysis|Aim of the study is to develop a model delineating customer perceptions on wedding marketing strategies in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Main objective of this paper is to analyse a category of special events: the wedding market sector in Kaohsiung, Taiwan by examining how they attract consumers regarding their marketing strategies using the method of fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). Based on a survey to married, in relationship and singles local citizens of Taiwan the relationships between impressions, importance, push factors with decision making was explored. To test the hypotheses of the proposed model a primary research study was conducted employing a mall intercept technique via distribution of a self-administered questionnaire within a cross sectional on-site field research context. A fsQCA modelling approach technique was employed in order to measure, estimate and confirm the different casual paths constructs, as well as to test the significance of the paths between different segments of the wedding industry. Our findings reveal that the presence of importance, push factors and decision making determines the level of consumer perception performance. However, impressions do not show significant impact on consumer perceptions.
L83|Integrierte Wirtschaftsförderung in Kufstein<BR>[Integrated Local Economic Development in Kufstein]|The present study takes stock of the local economy of Kufstein, Austria within the context of the regional economy of the Austrian state of Tyrol. Based on the findings of the analysis, the study proposes ideas for local economic development in Kufstein. The study characterizes the local economy of Kufstein sectorally and stakes stock of relevant agents and programs of local and regional economic development. The ideas elaborated on the basis of the analysis suggest a strategy of local economic development for Kufstein that integrates aspects of innovation and entrepreneurship support, tourism development, city marketing, and retail trade promotion and that is synchronized with the general orientation of the regional economic development policy pursued by the state of Tyrol.
L83|Effects of Service Quality and Customer Satisfaction on Repurchase Intention in Restaurants on University of Cape Coast Campus|This study sought to examine the effects of service quality and customer satisfaction on the repurchase intentions of customers of restaurants on University of Cape Coast Campus. The survey method was employed involving a convenient sample of 200 customers of 10 restaurants on the University of Cape Coast Campus. A modified DINESERV scale was used to measure customers’ perceived service quality. The results of the study indicate that four factors accounted for 50% of the variance in perceived service quality, namely; responsiveness-assurance, empathy-equity, reliability and tangibles. Service quality was found to have a significant effect on customer satisfaction. Also, both service quality and customer satisfaction had significant effects on repurchase intention. However, customer satisfaction could not moderate the effect of service quality on repurchase intention. This paper adds to the debate on the dimensions of service quality and provides evidence on the effects of service quality and customer satisfaction on repurchase intention in a campus food service context.
L83|Understanding cruise passengers’ motivations: The case of Greece|This paper aims to examine cruise passengers’ profile and their motivations for taking a cruise in Greece. The study provides insights into the motivations of 456 tourists traveling to Greece to experience a cruise. This article uses existing literature relevant to tourists’ motivations. The population of the current study consisted of passengers who disembarked in the port of Piraeus after an 8-day cruise in the Aegean Sea. The sample concentrated only on passengers who experienced a cruise in the Aegean Sea and consists of both international and local cruise passengers. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 was used to perform statistical procedures. The findings suggest that motivation dimensions of cruise passengers are structured in three major factors, “culture and tradition”, escape and relaxation” and “enjoyment and shopping”. Also, there is no statistically significant correlation between satisfaction and likelihood of returning, in contrast with the word-of-mouth.
L83|Visitors’ satisfaction in Dubai and pre-trip destination image|Understanding the factors that influence tourists’ satisfaction and the pre-trip destination image of potential visitors is particularly important for policy makers and tourism marketers. The objective of this study is twofold; first to assess the satisfaction level of tourists who have visited Dubai and further explore the factors that shape it and associate with it. Second, to assess the intention to visit Dubai according to the pre-trip destination image of potential tourists. This empirical study relies on a unique sample of 210 participants from all over the world in the year 2017. Several demographic characteristics as well as variables related to the trip process and the city attributes are collected and explored in order to document any relationship between the two groups. The major findings of the ordered logit analysis demonstrate that the city attributes are the most significant contributors to tourists’ satisfaction and to non visitors’ intention to visit Dubai. Trip factors and demographic characteristics also play a significant role only for the group of visitors. The overall satisfaction is what creates loyalty and drives tourists to repeat their visit.
L83|Sustainable Tourism Development and Climate Change: A Supply-Side Perspective|This paper presents and discusses findings of research carried out on a sample of 141 tourism stakeholders with two tourism destinations located in Sardinia, Italy. Specifically, it investigates: (1) the priorities that respondents consider essential to attain sustainability and competitiveness for their business and the destination as a whole, (2) the main barriers to tourism sustainability and (3) their attitude towards climate change and its influence on tourism. Our contribution to the literature, along with managerial implications, is discussed and suggestions for future research are given.
L83|Associating Facebook Measurable Activities with Personality Traits: A Fuzzy Sets Approach|In this study we identify potential associations between people’s personality (utilizing the popular Big Five personality model) and measurable Facebook activities such as number of likes received, number of posts, number of comments on posts. Extant literature suggests that personality can be manifested through different features of the Facebook profiles but under an implicit assumption that those users may belong in a single psychographic group. However, it has been shown that people may share characteristics, common acts and behaviors of more than one psychographic group. In this study we aim to address limitations of previous studies, by adopting a fuzzy set approach which is capable to handle users’ membership in multiple psychographic groups. Furthermore, fsQCA offers equifinality, which means that research can end up to the same outcome, beginning from different initial combinations of data. The work presented here provides empirical evidence concerning the association between Facebook activities and users' personalities in a novel way indicating the significance of this relationship and providing alternative combinations that lead to the same output. Furthermore, it paves the ground towards predicting social platforms' measurements, other than Facebook, relying on users' personalities, using the same technique but on different fields of study and social media platforms.
L83|Revisiting Employee - Guest Interactions in Hotels: An Analysis of Critical Incidents|The study was conducted to find out the positive and/or negative effects that hotel employees may have upon hotel guests’ experiences during their stay. Using the critical incident technique (CIT), data were obtained from 105 guests (a total of 174 incidents) staying in two different 5-star hotels that have similar characteristics in terms of type, price, ownership and concept in Bodrum, Turkey. The incidents were primarily categorized as positive and negative and afterward the incidents from two categories were compared to each other in terms of three main process of hotel accommodation as check-in, accommodation and check-out. Despite the fact that most hotels currently place emphasis on employee-guest interactions –under the concept of service quality or customer satisfaction-, the findings revealed that there were still a number of negative incidents that caused customer dissatisfaction and managerial implications were needed in hotels to minimize negative incidents and maximize the positive ones.
L83|Study on The Impact of Socio-Economic Crisis on Greek Wellness Tourists’ Spending Behavior|As most of the sectors of the world economy, tourism has also been affected by the global economic crisis and the resulting social redeployment. This global socio-economic situation, since 2010, has exerted additional pressure on the mental health and physical condition of people who are increasingly looking for new ways of relaxation and rejuvenation. The present study aims to investigate the impact of the current socio-economic crisis on the behavior and attitude of Greek wellness tourists. Quantitative research was conducted using a structured questionnaire on a sample size of 452 wellness tourists in totally 10 spas at Crete, Kos, Lefkada and Thessaloniki. The survey compared the spending behavior of respondents before 2010 and today. The findings of the survey show that although the behavior of Greeks as consumers is being negatively affected by the economic downturn, there is positive intention to continue using and spending on wellness services. In addition, results indicate the existence of positive attitude towards wellness tourism as a means of health promotion and enhancement. Proposals for further research are suggested.
L83|Does Guilt Affect Performance? Evidence from Penalty Kicks in Soccer|Does guilt affect performance? Exploiting a novel measure of the justification of penalty calls, we find that unjustified penalty calls negatively affect penalty conversion rates, and that this effect increases with social norms of trust. Exploiting the variance arising from players who do not play in their countries of origin by including the norms of both the league and the kickers’ countries of origin, we separate the constraints on egoism into two categories: internal sanctions, such as guilt, and external sanctions, such as shame. We find that both guilt and shame affect the performance of penalty kickers.
L83|Forecasting Tourist Arrivals: Google Trends Meets Mixed Frequency Data|In this paper, we examine the usefulness of Google Trends data in predicting monthly tourist arrivals and overnight stays in Prague during the period between January 2010 and December 2016. We offer two contributions. First, we analyze whether Google Trends provides significant forecasting improvements over models without search data. Second, we assess whether a high-frequency variable (weekly Google Trends) is more useful for accurate forecasting than a low-frequency variable (monthly tourist arrivals) using Mixed-data sampling (MIDAS). Our results stress the potential of Google Trends to offer more accurate prediction in the context of tourism: we find that Google Trends information, both two months and one week ahead of arrivals, is useful for predicting the actual number of tourist arrivals. The MIDAS forecasting model that employs weekly Google Trends data outperforms models using monthly Google Trends data and models without Google Trends data.
L83|Sharia hotels in Indonesia: Concept and potential analysis|This article describes the concept and analysis of potential sharia hotels in Indonesia. Using a phenomenological approach, this study concludes that sharia hotels have become part of the halal tourism industry and the need for Muslim communities in Indonesia in the future.
L83|The Segmentation of Visitor Tanah Lot Tourism Attraction|Tanah Lot Tourism Attraction (TLTA) is located on the South Coast of Bali Island precisely in the area of Beraban Village, Kediri District, Tabanan Regency, Bali. This research is quantitative descriptive method which sample is chosen based on purposive sampling technique, foreign and also domestic tourists who visit at time total 337 respondents. The statistical analyzed indicated that the domestic visitor segment is higher than the foreign visitor segment, this also indicate that domestic visitor is a potential target market for the products produced by local entrepreneurs in TLTA. Survey based on demography variable shows that the number of female visitor are more compared to male, dominantly by age group from 21 to 30 years old and most of them are students, and respondents educational level visit to TLTA are dominantly bachelor graduates. The geography variable shows that tourists visit to TLTA dominantly by domestics, followed by South Korea, Australia, and other countries.The psychograph variable, shows that dominant tourist visit because sunset and the nature of beauty view offered by Tanah Lot and mostly are repeater guests, received information from many sources. Their visit duration mostly between one to two hours, mostly they visit by rented car in the afternoon for sunset and the total amount of money spent between fifty thousand to one hundred thousand Rupiah, also the total amount of money spent during their visit is dominantly between five hundred to one million Rupiah per day. Chi-Square Tests indicated that there is correlation between group age, tourist occupation, and education level toward the motivation of visit to TLTA.
L83|New Tendencies in Tourism: The Sharing Economy|Abstract: The sharing economy is a phenomenon that has emerged in the recent years as a response to the technology development, the changing of the peoples' consumption habits, and environmental changes in terms of sustainability. This new economy model has had a rapid rise and has all the chances of becoming the economy that prevails on the market in the coming years. The new economic model has a market orientation and generates new business, new jobs, and growth in economy and income sources. The collaborative economy has also made its mark on the tourism. If the tourist services have been only traditionally provided a few years ago, there has recently been a new tendency in this area, namely to share goods/services. It is important to remember that this type of economy creates values such as trust, transparency, authenticity, and mutual help. This article attempts to highlight how the collaborative economy has put its footprint on the tourism, what are the challenges, benefits and impediments to such an economy.
L83|Price-Setting Behavior in a Tourism Sharing Economy Accommodation Market: A Hedonic Price Analysis of AirBnB Hosts in the Caribbean|This study investigated the price-setting behaviour of hosts in the tourism sharing economy in the Caribbean. Generally speaking, we find that site, reputation, convenience, personal and amenities attributes, along with country-level indicators significantly affect prices in the Caribbean. More specifically, most attributes have a positive effect on price-setting. Larger accommodations charge higher prices. Hosts with superior reputations charge higher prices. However, listings with a larger number of ratings are associated with lower prices. This may be an artefact of tourists’ preferences for cheaper sharing accommodations, resulting in a relatively higher volume of reviews for properties at the lower end of the price spectrum. Provision of Convenience options have an overall positive effect on prices, although there is evidence that some options can result in lower prices for tourists. The sole Personal attribute investigated is associated with higher price-setting behaviour. Virtually all amenities examined result in greater prices being charged for the space. Results indicate that geography has significant effects on price-setting behaviour. Listings in countries with greater economic and infrastructural development, greater biodiversity, but weaker exchange rates have higher prices. On the other hand, prices are lower in countries where there is more competition for customers.
L83|Airbnb, Technological Change and Disruption in Barbadian Tourism: A Theoretical Framework|This paper focuses on how Airbnb, an internet platform which has created the possibility for mass participation in the tourism market, is resulting in class conflict between new entrants and the ‘traditional’ tourism industry. Specifically, it studies how traditional tourism interests in Barbados have responded to Airbnb by seeking to restrict participation in the industry and presents this as a microcosm of broader class transitions and conflicts associated with new technologies. The paper utilises a Marxist theoretical perspective buttressed by Joseph Schumpeter’s theory of ‘creative destruction’ – places emphasis on the process of destroying productive systems to understand how specific industries expand and survive – and Clayton Christensen’s notion of ‘disruptive innovation’ – a process by which a disruptive product transforms a market – for studying how transformations in technology are impacting the tourism industry in Barbados. Its aim is to provide an account of how the process of disruption is unfolding in Barbados by highlighting the reactions of the main hotel lobby group to Airbnb, while also applying the ideas of Marx, Schumpeter and Christensen as useful theoretical lenses through which to examine the unfolding of the process of disruption of settled class and historical control of a dominant economic sector by new technologies.
L83|Officials and Home Advantage|Home advantage is the observed regularity that teams in sporting events win more often than their relative quality would suggest when playing at home. We review the literature and illustrate a number of the potential explanations using a novel and huge dataset of cricket matches. Explanations for the home advantage can be summarised into four headings: crowd, familiarity, travel and rules. Evidence increasingly points towards the role that officials play, yet other explanations cannot necessarily be ruled out.
L83|Determinants Of Tourism In French Overseas Departments And Collectivities|This article focuses on the determinants of tourism in French overseas departments and collectivities. An initial estimate of a panel model of an-nual data for Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, Reunion Island, French Polynesia, and New Caledonia (NC), over the period 1990–2012, shows that a 1% appreciation of the euro against the dollar reduces the number of tourists by 0.47%. The results also confirm the negative impact of distance/transport costs and the chikungunya crisis. Conversely, stronger growth in France or the United States and a higher level of wealth in the collectives promote tourism. A more detailed panel analysis, with monthly data for NC over the period 1995-2014, reveals that a 1% appreciation of the euro reduces tourism flows by 0.12%, and higher inflation in NC also penalizes tourism. However, distance and the economic situation of the country of origin do not significantly influence tourism flows to NC.
L83|Platform Competition: Betfair and the U.K. Market for Sports Betting|We examine two episodes of strategic interaction in the U.K. betting industry: (i) Betfair (an entrant multi-sided platform, or MSP) vs. Flutter (also an MSP), and (ii) Betfair vs. traditional bookmakers. We find that although Betfair was an underfunded second mover in the betting exchange space, it was able to attract punters at a much faster rate than the better-funded first mover, Flutter. Moreover, while Betfair and traditional bookmakers competed aggressively for market share, they also developed a highly complementary relationship that favored all parties. We discuss implications for research in the economics and management of MSPs. Specifically, we argue that the literature would benefit from work that endogenizes platform design and that considers the possible competitive and cooperative interactions between the business models of traditional incumbents and those of potential innovative MSP entrants.
L83|Yellow Cards and Suspension by Choice: Determinants and Asymmetries|This study demonstrates that psycho-economic determinants are significant in the awarding of yellow cards in a soccer match. This is the first multivariate analysis of the number of yellow cards given to a team in a match, and the study concludes that the characteristics of the referee, a home match effect, a derby match effect, and whether a team wins are crucial. The absolute point difference in relation to the current opponent can play a role as well. This is also the first work to analyze the probability of a team’s player collecting his fifth yellow card. We find that the probability is not determined by the characteristics of the referee but by whether a team wins, by whether a team plays at its home pitch and by the quality of the teams participating in the subsequent matches. Soccer players tend to collect their fifth yellow card and their suspension by choice when playing against a better opponent in the next match. For teams in the lower range, the opponent after next plays a role as well.
L83|The Economic Impact of Olympic Games: Effects of Host Country Announcements on Stock Market Returns|Roughly seven years before an Olympic games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) accepts bids from countries to host an Olympics. Subsequently, the IOC determines and announces to the world who has won and lost the right to host. Contrary to prior evidence, we find the announcements do not affect the bidding countriesï¿½ stock markets. We complement prior studies by using additional years of announcements, by investigating whether there are effects prior to the announcement, and by testing for an effect both parametrically and non-parametrically.
L83|How does big-box retail entry affect incumbents in the hospitality industry: Evidence from a natural experiment|This paper empirically measures the effects of big-box retail entry on the productivity of incumbent firms within the hospitality sector in the entry regions and investigates whether the effects differ depending on the size of the local market before entry. We use the entry of IKEA in four Swedish municipalities as a natural experiment to study how it affects productivity in incumbent firms within the hospitality sector. Our results show that entry by IKEA has a negative impact on the productivity of incumbents in Haparanda, Kalmar, and Karlstad, but no statistically significant effects in the metropolitan region of Gothenburg. As the majority of firms in the hospitality sector are restaurants, we expect that our results are due to increased competition within this part of the hospitality sector since all new IKEA stores come with a large, popular, and reasonably-priced restaurant.
L83|Measuring Customer Discrimination: Evidence from the Professional Cricket League in India|Research in the field of customer discrimination has received relatively little attention even if the theory of discrimination suggests that customer discrimination may exist in the long run whereas employer and employee discrimination may not. This paper examines customer discrimination considering a unique dataset from the most popular sports industry in India, i.e., cricket. Relying on Playing XI vote in the Indian Premier League (IPL), we analyze whether supporters have a different personal preference towards players based on their location of origin and religion. In contrast to the often-heated rhetoric surrounding discrimination, the often-unfounded assertions surrounding diversity, and the previous literature, we overall do not find any discrimination in voting. Our overall findings suggest that supporters treat players equally irrespective of nationality, place of origin or religious background while selecting their favorite players. However, our results also suggest that examining discrimination by controlling for proxy productivity characteristics may produce bias results as certain included or excluded characteristics may be systematically different. Our findings further suggest that political conflict may lead to customer discrimination. And finally, in line with Heckman's (1998) argument, our results suggest that customer discrimination may exist on the margin.
L83|Player Dismissal and Full Time Results in the UEFA Champions League and Europa League|This study is the first to estimate the effects of the sending-off of a player on the full time results in international club soccer. To this end, we analyse data of more than 2,000 recent games in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. We find that when home teams receive a red card, it harms their goal scoring and victory probabilities. By contrast, a red card for away teams can have a positive, negative, or neutral effect for them, depending on the timing of the player dismissal.
L83|Career Lotto: Labor Supply in Winner-Take-All Markets|Are people prone to selecting occupations with highly skewed income distributions despite minuscule chances of success? Assembling a comprehensive pool of potential teenage entrants into professional tennis (a typical winner-take-all market), we construct objective measures of relative ability and earnings projections. We find that prospective tennis professionals are attracted to right-skewed earnings distributions, independent of mean and variance. If skewness in prize money fell to zero, males would be 23% and females 5% less likely to continue pursuing a professional career, on average. Thus, winner-take-all labor markets appear to systematically encourage those with modest talents to pursue long-shot careers.
L83|Performance under Pressure on the Court: Evidence from Professional Volleyball|This study analyzes how psychological pressure affects performance. It refers to the discussion on differences between choking, i.e., an acute performance decline under pressure and underperformance under pressure. When performance outcomes are not defined binary even slight performance decrements can have huge consequences for future career. To study the consequences of psychological pressure on performance, we employ data on the serving performance of 213 professional volleyball athletes in 226 matches. We do not find any evidence for the existence of severe performance decrements under pressure (i.e. choking). However, athletes serve less effectively under pressure, i.e., they serve less direct points and less good serves. In consequence, we find that these subtler performance changes of serving players negatively affect overall team performance. Thus, we show that even if choking in the sense of an acute failure does not occur, performance decrements harming team production exist. This might be explained by single team members trying to avoid being held responsible for failure. Strengthening group cohesion to reduce psychological pressure on single group members might be a fruitful strategy to cope with similar problems in other working environments.
L83|Dispersion and Volatility of TFPQ in Service Industries|This study, using microdata on narrowly-defined service industries, presents empirical findings on the cross-sectional dispersion and time-series volatility of total factor productivity (TFP). The novelty of this study lies in its use of high-frequency, establishment-level panel data to compare the physical measure of productivity (TFPQ) and revenue-based productivity (TFPR) in the service industries. According to the analysis, first, TFPQ and TFPR are highly correlated with each other in terms of cross-section as well as time-series dimensions. Second, the within-industry dispersion of TFPQ is not larger than that of TFPR, which differs from past studies on the manufacturing sector. Third, TFPQ dispersion is lower when aggregated industry-level TFPQ is higher, and vice versa. Fourth, service producers with highly volatile TFP are less productive.
L83|Impact of Foreign Tourists on Productivity in the Accommodation Industry : A panel data analysis|Recently, the number of foreign tourists visiting Japan has been rapidly increasing, and the overseas travel balance has drastically changed. By using micro panel data, this study empirically analyzes the effects of this increase on productivity in the accommodation industry. The novelty of this study is represented by the use of a physical productivity measure to document an unexplored channel through which service trade contributes to increasing the productivity in the domestic service industry. The estimation results show that an increase in the number of foreign guests significantly improves the measured total factor productivity (TFP) of the accommodation facilities, although the effect of foreign presence is quite heterogeneous across facilities.
L83|Spatial Commitment Devices and Addictive Goods: Evidence from the Removal of Slot Machines from Bars|Commitment device theory suggests that temptations to consume addictive goods could be reduced by the regulatory removal of geographically close environmental cues. We provide new evidence on this hypothesis using a quasi-natural experiment, in which gambling regulators removed slot machines from some, but not all, neighborhood bars. We find that the removal of slot machines reduced personal bankruptcies of close neighbors (within 100 meters) but not neighbors slightly farther away. This is consistent with the removal of neighborhood slots serving as an effective spatial commitment device, which reduced close neighbors’ temptation to gamble, thus allowing them to avoid bankruptcy.
L83|Predicting the NFL Performance of Highly-Drafted Quarterbacks|We estimate econometric models to predict the future performance of National Football League (NFL) quarterbacks selected in the first three rounds of the NFL draft. Using previously agreed-upon measurement criteria, we find that our approach outperforms other specifications currently in use. Since our methods are replicable, stakeholders can use them to improve the draft’s efficiency and help it accomplish its mission to promote competitive balance. In addition, we find that functional mobility best predicts NFL success, and playing in a pro-style offense does not predict NFL success.
L83|Development Strategies to Improve the Ecotourism of Indigenous Villages|"""Objective – The aim on which this study conducted is to identify the interaction of indigenous factors and external factors at a Tourism Village Nongkosawit and then to create right strategy to develop the tourist village. Methodology/Technique – This descriptive quantitative research approach focuses on actual problems or phenomena of Nongkosawit which are described based on under-investigation facts and are then rationally and accurately interpreted. Data based on field surveys and questionnaires were evaluated with SWOT analysis (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat). Findings – The obtained SWOT results shows that, total score of 3.26 in IFE matrix and 3.00 in the EFE matrix indicate that the appropriate strategy to development a Nongkosawit tourism village is turnaround strategy which means internal problems in this village must be minimized to seize the market opportunities. Then rehabilitating infrastructural facilities, including hotels, restaurants and local tourist guides, and taking advantage of diversity of the ecosystem. Novelty – The study suggests that village tourism should make improvements on the internal side by performing management reconstruction and perform sharpening market segments. Stakeholders and communities must work together to support the development of rural tourism to raise the regional economy."""
L83|International trade in services and inequalities: Empirical evaluation and role of tourism services|This study investigates the impact of the international openness in tourism services trade on wage inequality between highly skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled workers in the tourism industry. The sample covers 10 developed countries and expands over 15 years. A cointegrated panel data model and an error correction model were used to distinguish between the short- and long-run effects. The results are compared to those of openness of business services and manufactured goods. The findings point out that tourism increases wage inequality at the expense of the least skilled workers in the long run and the short run.
L83|Do managerial skills matter? An analysis of the impact of managerial features on performance for the Italian football|This paper studies the impact of a set of managerial features on performance in the top division of the Italian football league during seasons 2000/01-2009/10. Our set of coach characteristics includes indicators of skill, experience, innate features as well as empathy with the team. We find that some managerial features matter even when we control by club power and past results. Indeed, performance is positively correlated with the fact that the manager has experience abroad or has been a previous player of the team but negatively correlated with lack of previous managerial experience. Other features affect only some particular aspects of performance. In particular, Italian managers play a more defensive game in home matches while old managers are more defensive in away games. Also, changing a coach within the season has a negative impact on the defensive skill of the team in away matches.
L83|Explaining the Number of Social Media Fans for North American and European Professional Sports Clubs with Determinants of Their Financial Value|The aim of this article is to investigate the explanatory variables of the number of Facebook fans and Twitter followers for professional sports clubs based on the financial value literature. Such explanatory variables are related to local market conditions and on-field and off-field performance. Based upon a sample of North American major league clubs and the most valuable European soccer clubs as evaluated by Forbes over the 2011-2013 period (423 observations), our results indicate a range of variables with a significant positive impact on the number of social media fans: population, no competing team in the market, current sports performance, historical sports performance, facility age, attendance, operating income, expenses/league mean, and being an English football club. An improved understanding of the effectiveness of clubs' social media presence is important for contemporary sport managers in terms of enhancing supporter communication, involvement, and accountability, as well as maximizing clubs' revenue generation possibilities. Our findings could help sport managers to realize their clubs' social media potential in pursuit of these objectives, specifically to understand which variables are under-exploited and why some clubs over-perform, which will allow managers to prioritize decisions to increase their number of social media fans and financial value.
L83|The future development of world records|We conduct an innovative analysis of sporting world records by a) using economic instead of sporting determinants and b) by using multivariate stochastic frontier functions. Using data from 48 different disciplines between 1970 and 2014, we show that world records are close to full efficiency and therefore actual athletic frontiers. Forecasts including economic determinants imply that the dynamics of world records largely depend on the dynamics of the frontiers and their driving forces, i.e., socio-economic developments.
L83|Beyond Moneyball|This study examines the changes in player compensation in Major League Baseball during the last three decades. Specifically, we examine the extent to which recently documented changes in playersâ€™ compensation structure based on certain types of productivity fits in with the longer term trends in compensation and identify the value of specific output activities in different time periods. We examine free-agent contracts in 3-year periods across three decades and find significant changes to how playersâ€™ past performances are rewarded in free agency beyond the change in those to on-base percentage seen in the mid-2000s. We find evidence that the compensation strategies of baseball teams increased the rewards to â€œpowerâ€ statistics beyond home runs in the 1990s from a model that focused on successfully reaching base with a batted ball without a significant regard for the number of bases reached. Similarly, we confirm and expand upon the increased financial return to bases on balls in the late 2000s as found in previous research.
L83|Megaâ€ Events And Tourism: The Case Of Brazil|Megaâ€ sporting events such as the FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup are expensive affairs. Host countries often justify the spending required to stage these events by predicting that megaâ€ events will draw large numbers of tourists. This paper analyzes monthly foreign tourist arrivals into Brazil between 2003 and 2015 and finds that the 2014 FIFA World Cup increased foreign tourism by roughly 1 million visitors. This number far exceeded expectations, but we show that roughly a quarter of this increase in foreign tourism was caused by the fortuitous advancement of Argentina's national team, and potential hosts should not count on the event to consistently produce outâ€ sized tourism figures. We conclude that onâ€ field results can greatly influence FIFA World Cup tourism. (JEL L83, F14)
L83|Hidden Subsidies and the Public Ownership of Sports Facilities: The Case of Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara|Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California is an example of a private financing / public ownership arrangement. While the stadiumï¿½s construction resulted in no direct tax increases, this ownership arrangement allows the San Francisco 49ers to avoid many types of taxes on the income generated from Leviï¿½s Stadium. We estimate the total tax savings to the 49ers at between $106 and $213 million over the first 20 years of Leviï¿½s Stadium compared with a privately financed and owned option. We argue that tax savings inherent in private financing / public ownership arrangements represent indirect and hidden subsidies.
L83|Corruption in the Bidding, Construction, and Organization of Mega-Events: An Analysis of the Olympics and World Cup|In the processes required to host a sports mega-event, corruption has been prevalent on numerous occasions, leading to unnecessary costs becoming the ultimate responsibility of a host governmentï¿½s taxpayers. Little progress has been made in the prevention of such behavior. In this chapter, we examine the history of corruption in sports mega-events, namely the Olympics and World Cup, to identify parts of the bidding and preparation processes that are vulnerable to illicit behavior. We propose potential solutions to be implemented at various levels in order to prevent further corruption.
L83|Effects of Brand-Fit Music on Consumer Behavior: A Field Experiment|Businesses might use music to align consumers with brand values, thereby influencing consumers' choices and perceptions. However, previous studies have focused on the effects of various characteristics of the music choice (e.g., tempo and style) and not on the effect of the congruence between music and brand values. Our cooperation with Soundtrack Your Brand, the exclusive provider of Spotify Business, makes it possible for us to test the effect of congruence between music and brand values on consumers in a field experiment using 16 chain restaurants within the Stockholm metropolitan area. Our results show that a playlist that only includes brand-fit songs increases revenues by 9.1 percent in comparison to selecting music that does not fit the brand. We also find that brand-fit music has a positive impact on consumers' emotions and that music seems to have an unconscious effect on consumers.
L83|Profitable Robot Strategies in Pari-Mutuel Betting|We have collected odds and results from 7 474 horse races in Norway and Sweden for a period of approximately 1.5 years. Based on the odds from the win game, we construct a profitable betting strategy for the corresponding triple game. Given a 30% track take, the existence of a profitable strategy is surprising. A robot is typically needed to identify and exploit underrated bets. We argue that the existence of heterogeneous beliefs between players in the market might form a basis for profitable betting strategies. We did expect that bigger pools (more liquidity) would remove this anomaly. That is not the case. More players, and thereby bigger pools, increases the profitability of the system.
L83|サービス業生産性の動態分析 : Tfpの企業間格差とヴォラティリティ|本稿は、狭く定義されたサービス業種を対象に、生産性のクロスセクションでの分散と時系列での動態に関する実証的事実を提示する。高頻度のミクロ時系列データを使用し、サービス業の生産性を数量ベースの生産性指標（TFPQ）と金銭ベースの指標（TFPR）を比較しつつ分析した研究は、おそらく初めてのものである。分析結果によれば、第一に、TFPQとTFPRの変動は、事業所レベルで高い相関関係がある。第二に、生産性の事業所間格差は、一般にTFPQよりもTFPRの方が大きい。これは製造業を対象とした先行研究とは異なる結果である。第三に、産業平均のTFPが高いときは、一般にTFPの事業所格差が小さく、産業平均のTFPが低いときは格差が大きい傾向がある。第四に、TFPの時系列でのヴォラティリティが高い事業所ほど、平均的な生産性水準が低い。以上の結果は、相対的に生産性の低い事業所において、需要平準化の潜在的利益が大きいことを示唆している。

L83|Dispersion and Volatility of TFPQ in Service Industries|This study, using microdata on narrowly-defined service industries, presents empirical findings on the cross-sectional dispersion and time-series volatility of total factor productivity (TFP). The novelty of this study lies in its use of high-frequency, establishment-level panel data to compare the physical measure of productivity (TFPQ) and revenue-based productivity (TFPR) in the service industries.

Second, the within-industry dispersion of TFPQ is not necessarily larger than that of TFPR, which differs from past studies on the manufacturing sector. Third, TFPQ dispersion is lower when aggregated industry-level TFPQ is higher, and vice versa. Fourth, service producers with highly volatile TFP are less productive.
L83|Adventure Tourist Potential In Guerrero Negro B.C.S. Mexico, Medicion Del Potencial Turistico De Aventura En Guerrero Negro B.C.S. Mexico|This paper examines tourism in the northern area of Baja California Sur Mexico. In spite of having one of the most relevant alternative tourism activities, it lacks diversification of tourist offerings. We apply a methodology to determine adventure tourism activities that can be developed in Guerrero Negro. The methodology is specific to the adventure tourism in the micro region of Guerrero Negro. Readers should use caution in applying the results here to other regions. To apply a methodological proposal similar to that presented, future researchers should take into account the natural and cultural values that are presented in the sites
L83|Does Proximity to Conflict Affect Tourism: Evidence from NATO Bombing|Although conflict, war, violence, and terrorism naturally affect tourism, research that identifies possible channels through which these effects propagate is scarce. We explore if the adverse effects are channeled through proximity to conflict areas. We use the conflict in Kosovo in 1999 and the country Croatia as a quasi-natural experiment and take advantage of the specific north-west to south-east orientation of Croatian Adriatic counties to identify the effect of NATO bombing in Kosovo on tourism outcomes as well as the potential proximity channel. Using data on the population of Croatian firms in the 1993-1999 period and the difference-in-differences identification strategy we find that tourism companies' revenues decreased significantly due to NATO bombing, especially in accommodation services and in companies with 50 or more employees. By analyzing heterogeneous effects with respect to the distance of the firm from Kosovo-using a linear and a more flexible model-we argue that within-country proximity to conflict is not a significant channel through which the negative effect propagates.
L83|Incentives to lose revisited: The NHL and its tournament incentives|This paper analyzes data from a tournament, namely the National Hockey League regular scheduled season of games, which provides incentives to increase effort in order to reach the playoffs and incentives to decrease effort once a team has been eliminated from playoff considerations because of the entry draft. Our results show that teams indeed react to these dual incentives - they win more games when there is still a chance to reach the playoffs and lose more after being eliminated from playoff considerations. One can argue that losing more games after having no more chance to reach the playoffs could be the result of lower motivation or disappointment. This is the first study to show that this is not the only explanation for a higher amount of lost games. Instead, we find that there is a concrete strategy behind losing.
L83|The acceptance of a protected area and the benefits of sustainable tourism: In search of the weak link in their relationship|Sustainable tourism is seen as a major development opportunity for regions with pristine nature and biodiversity hotspots, particularly in developing countries. The economic advantages of sustainable tourism are supposed to convince local persons that use restrictions and regulations set within a protected area (PA) are necessary and beneficial. Nevertheless, local persons are hardly found to positively assess PAs and their environmental protection efforts. This study combines earlier findings on the existence of PAs, their potential for tourism, their restrictions for economic development and the local populationï¿½s acceptance of environmental protection into a comprehensive model. Based on a representative survey of 686 people in the Hoang Lien National Park in Vietnam, we analyse the links in the suggested transmission mechanism. The results identify one major bottleneck for the acceptance of a PA: The people indeed acknowledge the economic advantages of a sustainable tourism sector, but do not see themselves as actual beneficiaries. Even if they are already involved in tourism, they feel the main benefits are generated for outside agents, while local persons have to deal with the restrictions imposed. This result has far-reaching implications for successful tourism policy and implementation of protected areas.
L83|Choking under pressure of top performers: Evidence from biathlon competitions|"Psychological pressure affects performance. This is especially true for individuals completing precision tasks in decisive situations, such as assessment tests, job talks, or sports competitions. In this paper, I shed light on detrimental effects of pressure on performance, a phenomenon known as ""choking under pressure"". I analyze a unique setting in which the effect of pressure on performance is naturally observable: Biathlon World Cup competitions. As the last shot in the final bout of shootings is regularly decisive for the victory, pressure is highest on the leader of the competition not to miss this last shot. Using event data from 11 seasons of Biathlon World Cup, I find strong evidence for ""choking under pressure"", implying that especially leaders are more likely to fail decisive shots. Furthermore, taking more time for the last shootings bout leads to a decrease in performance. Finally, I show suggestive evidence for a momentum effect - after missing a shot during the last shooting bout, the probability of missing the last shot decreases."
L83|Convergence vs. the middle income trap: The case of global soccer|"Unconditional convergence across countries worldwide is typically rejected in terms of GDP per capita. But when focusing on a specific internationally competitive industry, such as manufacturing, rather than the overall economy, unconditional convergence has been found to hold. As the epitome of competition and globalization, this paper uses the performance of national soccer teams as a further test case. We rely on data of more than 25,000 games between 1950 and 2014 and find clear evidence of unconditional $\beta$- and $\sigma$-convergence in national team performance, as measured either by win percentages or goal difference. We argue that transfer of technologies, skills and best practices fosters this catch-up process. But there are limits: we show that good teams from Africa and Asia are failing to close the gap with top European or South American teams for reasons that are analogous to the ""middle income trap"". Lessons for other sectors include the virtues of internationally transferable human capital as well as the mixed blessings of regional integration for worldwide convergence."
L83|Performance and Risk Taking under Threat of Elimination|We revisit the incentive effects of elimination tournaments with a fresh approach to identification, the results of which strongly support that performance improves under the threat of elimination and does so, but only in part, due to increases in risk taking. Where we can separately identify changes in risk-independent performance and risk taking, our estimates suggest that 23 percent of the improvement in performance induced by potential elimination is due to productive increases in risk taking. These effects are concentrated among those closest to the margin of elimination and among lower-ability competitors.
L83|Relations entre les recettes du tourisme et le taux de change : Cas du Maroc|Le Maroc a fait le choix de laisser flotter sa monnaie progressivement jusqu’à son flottement total. Cela impactera son économie dans sa globalité plus particulièrement le secteur du tourisme. En effet, ce secteur représente 7 % du produit intérieur brut (PIB). L’importance de ce secteur réside aussi dans les recettes en devise qu’il procure allégeant le déficit de la balance du paiement. Le Maroc détient 22,11% des recettes touristiques du continent africain. Le tourisme joue un rôle social important en tant que créateur des emplois directs et indirects pour les différents opérateurs. En plus, il constitue ces dernières années un baromètre de la stabilité économique et politique d’un pays. Nous proposons d’étudier la relation entre les recettes du tourisme et le taux de change. Pour cela, Nous recourons à un modèle macroéconomique reliant le taux de change et les recettes touristiques. Afin d’atteindre cet objectif, nous avons pris les pays leaders dans ce secteur d’activité appartenant à des régimes et à des zones monétaires différentes.
L83|Racial Discrimination in the Sharing Economy: Evidence from a Field Experiment|In an experiment on Airbnb, we find that applications from guests with distinctively African American names are 16 percent less likely to be accepted relative to identical guests with distinctively white names. Discrimination occurs among landlords of all sizes, including small landlords sharing the property and larger landlords with multiple properties. It is most pronounced among hosts who have never had an African American guest, suggesting only a subset of hosts discriminate. While rental markets have achieved significant reductions in discrimination in recent decades, our results suggest that Airbnb's current design choices facilitate discrimination and raise the possibility of erasing some of these civil rights gains.
L83|Total Quality Management Implementation and Guest Satisfaction in Hospitality|Total quality management (TQM) has become a modern system of constant improvement of the quality of all company activities. The purpose of this study is to measure the expectations and satisfaction of the guests concerning the attribute quality of the hotel product. Furthermore obtained results were compared in such a way as to analyse particularly the reviews of hotels which have implemented TQM and have the ISO 9001 certificates with reviews from hotels which have not implemented TQM and do not have the ISO 9001 certificates. The conducted analysis included 55 hotels in Serbia belonging to the 4- and 5-star categories, i.e. 1308 guests who have stayed in them. The results show that between the observed groups of guests there are fewer differences in expectations than in perception, and that generally speaking guests who have stayed in the hotels that have implemented TQM are more satisfied. The biggest difference concerning the guest satisfaction with the quality of service in the observed hotels is noticeable in relation to the employees and the value-for-money.
L83|An Examination of Customer Loyalty and Customer Participation in the Service Recovery Process in the Pakistani Hotel Industry: A Pitch|This pitch research letter (PRL) applies the pitch template developed by Faff (2015) to an academic project on customer loyalty and customer participation in the service recovery process in the hotel industry of Pakistan. The pitch template helped the pitchers to identify the core elements that form the framework of the research project. This PRL provides a brief background about the pitchers and pitch, followed by a brief commentary on the pitch and personal reflections of the pitcher on the pitch exercise itself.
L83|The impact of a new airport on international tourism: the case of Ragusa (Sicily)|Airports play a crucial role in connecting places and boosting local economic development; notwithstanding this, empirical evidence on the subject is relatively limited. This paper estimates the impact of a new airport in Ragusa, in southeastern Sicily, on international tourism flows in the area, using a synthetic control approach. Connecting by air a relatively peripheral and isolated area of Sicily with a high tourism potential has made it possible to increase by about one fifth the number of nights spent by foreign tourists (for over 5,100 additional nights), generating €434 thousand more in tourist expenditure per month.
L83|Cultural Tourism|The present work features a detailed analysis of the multitude of elements encompassing cultural tourism. In this paper, we will define the concept and describe the numerous particularities and forms of this type of activity. We will highlight its complex and dynamic nature and underline the important interconnectivity characteristic. Furthermore, we will submit a target market analysis, emphasizing the typical profile of the cultural tourism consumer. To illustrate the conceptual elements, we will present a case study, analyzing the George Enescu classical music festival in Romania and highlighting the economic and cultural benefits brought by this cultural tourism event.
L83|Artificial Pitches and Unfair Home Advantage in Professional Football|In the Netherlands, in the top tier of professional football some teams play their home matches on an artificial pitch while other teams play their home matches on natural grass. This paper investigates whether or not home teams who play on an artificial pitch have an additional home advantage to the regular home advantage. The main finding is, that this is indeed the case. This implies that artificial pitches generate an unfair home advantage in a competitive sport.
L83|The Rise of the Sharing Economy in Tourism: Exploring Airbnb Attributes for the Veneto Region|In just a couple of years, the sharing economy grew out to become a significant segment of the holiday accommodation market. Online peer-to-peer marketplaces allow people to offer rooms or entire houses to tourists, with Airbnb being the biggest and most famous example. This paper aims to give an insight into explaining which factors and attributes influence the success of Airbnb accommodations in the Veneto Region, using occupancy as a proxy. We analysed characteristics of 19624 Airbnb accommodations. The logistic regression model identifies a number of influential attributes which can be divided between locational characteristics, being located in attractive tourism destinations, and accommodation characteristics, for example the price, rating, number of previous bookings and the status of the host. The quantitative analysis allows to create an attractiveness scale, which is analysed for geographic patterns.
L83|Competitiveness of Heritage Sites: a comparison between Scuola Grande della Misericordia in Venice and Oude Kerk in Amsterdam|The presence of outstanding cultural assets is not always a synonym of tourism and local development. This means that the competitiveness of a destination or a site is also related to other factors, which have been studied and gathered within respective theoretical frameworks by different researchers, focusing the urban destination (Van den Berg, Van der Borg, Van der Meer, 1995), the site level (Jansen-Verbeke, 2012), and the relationship between heritage conservation and tourist use (McKercher, Du Cros, 2002). In the present paper, these three different models have been applied to two cases: Scuola Grande della Misericordia in Venice and Oude Kerk in Amsterdam. Two flexible spaces, recently restored, they are both important on the community level for their past function and modern adaptive re-use. Results demonstrate the usefulness of the models in offering an operative tool to evaluate the site on its own, but also their limits in a network destination governance perspective: thus they open to models integrations and future research in this domain.
L83|The Effect of Superstar Players on Game Attendance: Evidence from the NBA|"Economic models predict that ""superstar"" players generate externalities that increase attendance and other revenue sources beyond their individual contributions to team success. We investigate the effect of superstar players on individual game attendance at National Basketball Association games from 1981/82 through 2013/14. Regression models control for censoring due to sellouts, quality of teams, unobservable team/season heterogeneity, and expected game outcomes. The results show higher home and away attendance associated with superstar players. Michael Jordan generated the largest superstar attendance externality, generating an additional 5,021/5,631 fans at home/away games."
L83|An Overview of Sports Betting Regulation in the United States|The United States employs an ad hoc, unconventional method of regulating sports betting, banning it almost everywhere while granting a monopoly to firms in a single state, Nevada. This approach encourages illegal sports betting markets, ignores negative externalities, and generates welfare losses among the large population of responsible recreational gamblers. I review the current state of sports betting regulation in the U.S. and assess its economic viability in advance of the Supreme Court of the United States decision on the landmark Christie v. National Collegiate Athletic Association case.
L83|On the Efficiency of Racetrack Betting Market: A New Test for the Favorite-Longshot Bias|A number of empirical researches on the efficiency of racetrack betting market have shown the ¡®favorite-longshot bias,¡¯ which means longshots are overbet while favorites are underbet. Asian markets such as Hong Kong and Japan, however, have produced some contradictory empirical evidence to the bias. One critical element in the efficiency test procedure is how to assess the unobservable objective winning probability of a horse in a race. This paper proposes a new test framework with a more general evaluation of the objective probability of winning than the traditional method. Unlike the traditional method, our model allows the heterogeneity of the horses and the races. We apply the new empirical method to test whether the favorite-longshot bias is present in racetrack betting market of Korea. We found that the favorite-longshot bias exists in the racetrack market of Korea and the result distinguishes Korean racetrack market from other Asian markets.
L83|"What makes you ""super-rich""? New evidence from an analysis of football players' earnings"|"This article investigates the influence of performance, popularity and power on ""superearnings"" using a unique panel dataset of Italian football players built on various sources of data. Using OLS, Panel and Unconditional Quantile regression techniques, we find that detailed measures of these factors are all significantly associated with higher wages. Popularity dominates all the other factors at the right tail of earnings distribution and the agent's power contributes mostly to allocate players in richer teams. These new findings challenge the interpretations of super-earnings based only on very talented workers who ""win and take all""."
L83|Sind Wettbewerbe im Profisport Rattenrennen?|Eine Reihe von Autoren - vor allem im deutschsprachigen - Raum begründet die Notwendigkeit regulatorischer Eingriffe in Profisportmärkte damit, dass der Wettbewerb auf diesen Märkten systematisch versage. Als wesentliche Ursache für Wettbewerbsprobleme innerhalb dieser Ligen oder Meisterschaften gilt dem-nach das Auftreten eines ruinösen Wettbewerbs in Form von Rattenrennen à la Akerlof. Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht die Frage, ob Rattenrennenmodelle eine geeignete Erklärung des ökonomischen Wettbewerbs in einer Sportliga darstellen und legt regulatorische Implikationen dar.
L83|Smart Fitness: Ökonomische Effekte einer Digitalisierung der Selbstvermessung|Smart Fitness bezeichnet die digitale Erfassung individualisierter Fitness- und Lifestyledaten mit Hilfe von Wearables, Smartwatches, Apps und anderen Instrumenten. Die so generierten Daten sind für eine Reihe von Akteure wie Sportartikelhersteller, Pharmaunternehmen, Arbeitgeber sowie insbesondere auch Krankenversicherungen ökonomisch interessant. Wegen der hohen Aktualität sowohl des gesellschaftlichen Trends zur Selbstvermessung und -optimierung als auch der Verwendung personalisierter Daten im Zuge der Digitalisierung handelt es sich um ein dynamisch wachsendes und sich entwickelndes Gebiet, welches aber bisher kaum aus einer ökonomischen Perspektive untersucht wurde. In dem vorliegenden Beitrag wenden wir die ökonomische Theorie personalisierter Daten auf das Phänomen Smart Fitness an und leiten mögliche Effekte her, insbesondere auch für die Konsumentenwohlfahrt. Außerdem präsentieren wir eine nicht-repräsentative empirische Studie, welche einen ersten Einblick ermöglicht und dabei helfen kann, die empirisch relevanten Theorierichtungen zu identifizieren. Dabei stellen wir Bereiche heraus, in denen eher positive Wohlfahrtswirkungen zu erwarten sind, aber betonen auch solche, wo Wohlfahrtsgefahren lauern und daher Regulierungsrechtfertigungen bestehen. Letzteres gilt insbesondere, wenn personalisierte Fitness- und Lebensstildaten für die Individualisierung von Krankenversicherungstarifen oder Karriereentscheidungen durch Arbeitgeber verwendet werden.
L83|Four cases in sports competition policy: Baseball, judo, football, and motor racing|Practices and conducts in professional and even amateur sports can be subject to competition laws as soon as commercial activities are involved. From an economic perspective, this implies that both directly commercial activities like the sale of broadcasting/media rights and indirectly commercial activities like defining and enforcing the rules of the games can be hit by competition policy interventions. Setting and enforcing the rules of the game is an activity with commercial effects because it influences attractiveness and marketability of the sports in question. After discussing fundamental issues, this contributions reviews selected landmark cases in sports competition policy from an economic perspective. This includes the U.S. baseball antitrust exemption, access rules to Judo tournaments, sale systems of media rights in European football as well as a unique combination of long-run exclusivity contracts, skewed allocation of common revenues, and special influences on rule-setting by some competitors in Formula One motor racing. Eventually, the areas of state aid to football clubs and mergers in Danish football are sketched.
L83|Market-internal financial regulation in sports as an anticompetitive institution|"Financial regulation in sports is usually discussed in the context of representing an instrument against ""financial doping"". Notwithstanding the merits of this discussion, this paper takes the opposite perspective and analyses how market-internal financial regulation itself may anticompetitively influence sporting results. Virtually every regulative financial intervention distorts sporting competition to some extent and creates beneficiaries and losers. Sometimes, the actual winners and losers of financial regulation stand in line with the (legitimate) goals of the regulation like limiting financial imbalances or preventing distortive midseason insolvencies of teams. However, financial regulation may also display unintended side-effects like protecting hitherto successful teams from new challengers, cementing the competitive order, creating foreclosure and entry barriers, or serving vested interests of powerful parties. All of these effects may also be hidden agendas by those who are implementing and enforcing market-internal financial regulation or influencing it. This paper analyses various types of budget caps (including salary caps) with respect to potentially anticompetitive effects. UEFA's so-called Financial Fair Play Regulations are highlighted as an example. Furthermore, the paper discusses allocation schemes of common revenues (like from the collective sale of broadcasting rights) as another area of financial regulation with potentially anticompetitive effects. Eventually, the effects of standards for accounting, financial management, and auditing are discussed."
L83|Doping in teams: A simple decision theoretic model<BR>[Doping in Teams: Ein einfaches entscheidungstheoretisches Modell]|A simple decision theoretic model shows the doping incentives for a member of a professional sports team. Depending on the detection probability and the punishment, a sportsman dopes not at all, at a medium or at the maximal level. The whole team has a higher incentive than an individual team member that at least some of its members dope. That there are not many proven cases of doping in team sports could be because doping is less effective or because the incentives to cover it are higher than in individual sports.
L83|Does Wikipedia matter? The effect of Wikipedia on tourist choices|We document a causal influence of online user-generated information on realworld economic outcomes. In particular, we conduct a randomized field experiment to test whether additional information on Wikipedia about cities affects tourists' choices of overnight visits. Our treatment of adding information to Wikipedia increases overnight visits by 9% during the tourist season. The impact comes mostly from improving the shorter and incomplete pages in Wikipedia.
L83| Are women or men better team managers? Evidence from professional team sports| We empirically compare the performance of female and male team managers. We find that female team managers never perform worse than male team managers and that females work under significantly worse conditions than males. Additionally, we find that specialized experience has no influence. Special- 1 ized experience means having worked previously as an employee in the same industry. Our dataset consists of female and male managers in women soccer leagues acroos countries, viz., France, Germany, and Norway. Managers in team sports usually have exactly the same tasks (selection, coordination, and motivation of team members) as team managers in other industries. The limited number of women in top management positions in some of these industries and the lack of available data do not often allow comparisons. Our study, which includes a fair number of female team managers and a clear measurement of performance, can help understanding stereotypical behaviors. Therefore, our results have important implications for industries, companies, and clubs who oppose employing female team managers.
L83| Momentum in tennis: Controlling the match| Although many studies examine if players in sports and especially in tennis bene t from a psychological or physiological boost (momentum) none examine whether the set score as a dependent variable or tournament rounds as independent variables are important determinants when assessing momentum. We empirically investigate whether professional female and male tennis players benefit from momentum. In contrast to previous work, we nd players we find players bene t from momentum as long as they control a match. Once players lose control over a match, they have a signi cantly lower chance to win the next set than their opponent. This loss of control results in what we call anti-momentum.
L83| The Impact of Government Subsidies in Professional Team Sports Leagues| This article develops a game-theoretical model to analyze the effect of subsidies on player salaries, competitive balance, club profits, and welfare. Within this model, fan demand depends on win percentage, competitive balance, and aggregate talent. The results show that if a large market club receives a subsidy and fans have a relatively strong preference for aggregate talent, compared to competitive balance and own team winning percentage, club rofits and welfare increase for both clubs. If the small-market club is subsidized, a small subsidy increases competitive balance and player salaries of both clubs.
L83|The Role of African Americans in the Executive Labor Market: The Case of Head Coaching in College Basketball|In this paper, we examine how the number of African American and White American coaches in college basketball evolved since 1947. Particularly, we focus on 1973 when the league split up. The separation created asymmetric regulatory requirements. This led to a significant difference in the number of African American coaches. The evidence suggests that less regulated institutions employ fewer African American coaches. The results are time consistent, not clustered geographically, and unrelated to specific institutions. Our results have policy implications for college sports as well as other industries which have similar working conditions.
L83|Comparing forecasts for tourism dynamics in Medellín, Colombia|Tourism is a topic of interest to many economies around the world, but it has received limited attention in Colombia. Knowing the periods of larger tourist inflows is important for predicting coverage in services for tourists. In this paper, we compare the estimation between classical and Bayesian regression in order to choose the best alternative to predict the number of tourist arrivals to Medellin. We also identify the most significant variables affecting the influx of tourists and the models providing better fit to the associated dynamics. According to our results, the Bayesian approach shows better estimates than the classic one. In addition, the variable month is significant to explain the demands for both Colombians and foreigners. The periods with the highest incidence of visits to the city are December-January and June-July, a pattern that repeats itself every year, which is crucial for planning hotel resources
L83|Insiders vs outsiders in the hotel sector: is it worth entering an official classification system?|We investigate whether entering an official hotel classification system is as lucrative as suggested in the tourism management literature. Indeed, in countries in which the official hotel classification system is voluntary, a substantial fraction of hotels choose not to enter the system, and are outsiders. Considering that being classified (being insider) as a predictor of the rate structure may raise an endogeneity issue, we apply the recursive semi-ordered probit model to control for endogeneity and appropriately assess the effect of being classified on price rates. Using a sample of 357 hotels of Corsica, we show that, in contrast to previous research, classification does not provide any rate premium. We also fully derive conditional probabilities and partial effects on differences in conditional probabilities within the recursive semi-ordered probit model.
L83|How Segregated Is Urban Consumption?|We provide measures of ethnic and racial segregation in urban consumption. Using Yelp reviews, we estimate how spatial and social frictions influence restaurant visits within New York City. Transit time plays a first-order role in consumption choices, so consumption segregation partly reflects residential segregation. Social frictions also affect restaurant choices: individuals are less likely to visit venues in neighborhoods demographically different from their own. While spatial and social frictions jointly produce significant levels of consumption segregation, we find that restaurant consumption is only about half as segregated as residences. Consumption segregation owes more to social than spatial frictions.
L83|Destination attributes and tourist’s satisfaction in a cultural destination|Cultural tourism is one of the leading growing segments of the tourism industry. Many tourists who visit heritage sites seek a value-added and authentic experience, when compared with the traditional products or mass destinations. Considering the importance of tourist`s satisfaction in what regards the revisit intentions and word-ofmouth referrals, which in turn influence the economic development of the tourist destination, this study attempts to investigate the relationship between cultural/heritage destination attributes and tourist`s satisfaction. The study area for this paper is the city of Guimarães, in the northwest of Portugal. This city is a place of strong symbolic and cultural significance and was deemed a world heritage site (UNESCO) in the year 2001. In 2012, Guimarães was one of the cities that hosted the European Capital of Culture (ECOC). All this enhanced its tourism potential and increased the amounts of visitors. The methodology consists of quantitative research based on a self-administered survey applied to tourists who visited Guimarães in the first half of 2015. Based upon the empirical results of this study, several recommendations can be made to increase 2 tourists’ satisfaction vis-à-vis to Guimarães, regarding tourists’ needs, attributes valorization and cultural/heritage sustainability.
L83|Innovation and Competitiveness in the Context of the Bulgarian Tourism Industry|Despite the global challenges, international tourism has still achieved dynamic growth and undegone continued expansion. Travel for recreational, leisure or business purposes is an important source of economic growth in many countries. This holds particularly true for Bulgaria as it is a small, less developed and structurally weak country which faces the tremendous challenges of the rapidly changing and highly competitive global market. Without effective and coordinated government policies and actions tourism would not succeed to exploit fully its potential for inclusive and sustainable growth. The financial leakages expressed primarily in loss in revenue from tourism due to the low competitiveness of the sector, can significantly narrow the positive economic benefits of tourism and make the country vulnerable to negative economic, social, cultural and environmental impacts. Competitiveness, as it is evidenced in the literature reviewed in the article, depends on the development of the differentiated capabilities needed to sustain growth which could be created through innovation. According to this article, the industry could be enhanced through the different types of innovation. This applies to the whole country, to the various subnational regions, and to the individual tourism enterprises. Indeed, it is worth emphasizing that enhancing the competitiveness of economies, whose companies are exposed to international competition, depends on innovation. In that context the article aims to identify the types of innovation in tourism and the main areas where they could be applied while searching for possibilities to increase the competitiveness of the Bulgarian tourism industry and to ensure its sustainable growth.
L83|Simulation Evidence on Herfindahl-Hirschman Indices as Measures of Competitive Balance|Measurement of the degree of competitive balance, how evenly teams are matched, is central to the economic analysis of professional sports leagues. A common problem with competitive balance measures, however, is their sensitivity to the number of teams and the number of matches played by each team, i.e., season length. This paper uses simulation methods to examine the effects of changes in season length on the distributions of several widely used variants of the Herfindahl- Hirschman index applied to wins in a season. Of the measures considered, a normalized measure, accounting for lower and upper bounds, and an adjusted measure perform best, although neither completely removes biases associated with different season lengths.
L83|Halal Tourism Industry in Indonesia: Potential and Prospects|This study confirms that halal tourism is a tourism industry which has contributed to economic growth in Indonesia, although the world economy slows down. In Indonesia, halal tourism has long been grown in the form of a pilgrimage undertaken by people with religious motivation. Along with the development of the global Islamic economy, then this type of tourism is undergoing a metamorphosis that requires a change in modern ranging from attractions, hotels, up to marketing. The paper combines descriptive of halal tourism industry and practices of Islamic law in Indonesia. This approach found that halal tourism industry can not be separated from the religious practices of the majority of Muslims in Indonesia, but also economically contribute to the local community, and tourist sites that display the beauty and hospitality for tourists Muslims and non-Muslims. This study concludes that halal tourism has become part of the national tourism industry to position Indonesia as a center for halal tourism in the world in the future.

L83|Regional development in the context of economic reform: The case of Limassol|Regional development occurs in the larger context of national economies. Thus, the elaboration of regional economic development strategies cannot be separated from higher-level economic policy which frames and conditions opportunities and risks for regional development. As a Southern European country undergoing a process of profound structural economic reform, Cyprus provides a case for a policy context aiming towards the emergence of a new model of economic growth. Within this context, the Limassol region as one of the country’s major economic centers with a number of comparatively strong industries can serve as an example of how to promote regional development in the framework of national reform priorities such as moving the national economy closer towards a knowledge- and innovation-driven model. The present study analyses current reform priorities on the national and supra-national level, takes stock of the regional economic structure of Limassol district, and presents some preliminary ideas that could be further explored if and when a comprehensive regional economic development strategy for Limassol were to be elaborated.
L83|Characteristics of transit tourism in Hungary with a focus on expenditure|This study introduces the behaviour of participants in transit tourism in Hungary with a focus on their expenditure. With the help of multivariable mathematical-statistical methods, the motivational background and the spending characteristics of foreigners visiting Hungary between 2009 and 2013 are explored; in addition, the factors influencing expenditure, according to nationality, are investigated. According to our investigations, people in transit, whose spending is continuously increasing, make up a significant share of the expenditure of foreigners arriving in Hungary. Typical types of spending during transit are fuel purchases and dining at restaurants. Among transit visitors to Hungary, Romanian, Serbian (including Monte-negro and Kosovo), and Bulgarian nationals have the highest share. While the number and expenditure of transit visitors slightly increased during the examined period, the per capita spending decreased. The results of the study show that this is due to the changes in the composition of the countries involved. Changes in transit tourism expenditures are largely determined by nationality. The most important conclusion of our research is that the most significant characteristics of transit depend on general European trends (labour market conditions, tourism supply, etc.) and conditions (visa requirements, transport infrastructure, accommo-dation along transit routes, among others) provided for transit visitors by Hungary.
L83|Effectiveness and Challenges of Recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) in the Indian Hotel Sector|The present study tries of evaluate the effectiveness and challenges faced by adopting RPO practice in the India Hotel sector. The research objectives are driven from the purpose of the research which deals with distinct issues related to RPO and various perspectives of utilizing RPO. These objectives guided in identifying factors influencing the rationale for outsourcing the recruitment processes. The need for RPO has gained significance with the impact of organizational structure, stringent project deadlines, insufficient time for internal HR department for recruiting personnel, inefficiencies in integrating all stages of recruitment and expansion of geographies. The study is developed on building a theoretical framework which is prepared through analysing previous literature about outsourcing, and their utilization and efficiency in organizations. Mixed method approach has been followed to analyse with better validity and exploration of the context related to the effectiveness of RPO in the Indian hotel sector. The key findings indicated that the culture was positive influence on the usage of RPO in the organizations, in terms of adopting RPO during expansion of geographies and globalization. Also, the organizational structure was the major challenge in adopting these practices along with monitoring the outsourcing activities, lack of communication and inefficient HR practices.
L83|Revenue Sharing in Professional Sports Leagues as a Hedge for Exchange Rate Risk|Professional sports leagues that feature teams in different countries with different currencies are exposed to exchange rate uncertainty and risk. This is particularly evident for three professional sports leagues that feature teams in the United States and Canada. We construct a simple model of a profit-maximizing team that earns its revenue in one currency and meets its payroll obligations in a second currency and participates in a league-imposed revenue sharing plan. Team profit can increase or decrease due to movements in the exchange rate based on a simple condition. Revenue sharing reduces the exposure to exchange rate uncertainty and risk. Hedging is possible for a single team by adjusting its payroll, but not likely. Some elementary calculations suggest this previously unrecognized benefit of revenue sharing is substantial for baseball’s Toronto Blue Jays.
L83|Risk Diversification from Revenue Sharing in a Professional Sports League: Measuring Welfare Gains|Revenue sharing is a common league policy in professional sports leagues. Several motivations for revenue sharing have been explored in the literature, including supporting small market teams, affecting league parity, suppressing player salaries and improving team profitability. We investigate a different motivation. Risk-averse team owners may be able to increase league welfare by using revenue sharing to reduce the variance and affect the skewness of the league distribution of team local revenues. We first determine the extent to which revenue sharing affects these moments in theory, then we attempt to quantify the effects on league welfare for Major League Baseball. Our results suggest that revenue sharing had significant welfare gains, obtained at little cost, that enhance the positive effects noted by other studies.

L83|Using REIT Data to Assess the Economic Worth of Mega-Events: The Case of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics|This paper proposes an alternative approach to evaluate the effects of hosting mega-events, such as the Olympics, Football World Cup, and World Expo. Based on capitalization hypothesis, previous literature studies examined whether the announcement of mega-events affects prices of firms’ stock or real estate property. In contrast, I utilize data on Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), whose price is a hybrid of stock and property. The standard event study methodology with high-frequent data allows the estimation of abnormal returns due to the mega-event of interest, and clarifies the relationship between level of returns and characteristics of REIT’s property. I present an empirical example—the 2020 Tokyo Olympics—and the results are as follows: 1) investors judged that the comprehensive effects would be positive; 2) the effect becomes smaller as the distance from Host City (Tokyo-to) increases; 3) even in areas far from Tokyo-to, real estate used for hotels and commercial facilities are relatively susceptible to the Olympics.
L83|Economic Impact of Cruise Ship Passengers Visiting Bar Harbor (Maine) in 2016|This study examines the economic impact of cruise ship passengers visiting Bar Harbor in 2016. The economic impact figures account for passenger expenditures on a variety of goods and services (e.g., meals and drinks, souvenirs, books and paper goods, shore excursions) and the multiplier effects associated with the economic activity of businesses (and their workers) where the visitors spend money. The passenger economic impact analysis is based on 2,231 mail surveys that were completed and returned by visitors associated with 31 ship visits over 24 days between May and October. Guests were surveyed from a mix of small (e.g., American Glory, with a capacity of 49 passengers) and large ships (e.g., Regal Princess, with a capacity of 3,560 passengers), as well as passengers across a variety of cruise lines (e.g., Celebrity, Crystal Cruises, Holland America, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Oceania, Silversea Cruises). The survey respondents spent an average of $108—and $74 of this amount does not include expenditures on cruise-line sponsored tours. The largest expenditure items, other than cruise-line sponsored tours, are meals and drinks, clothing items, and general souvenirs. The cruise ship passengers had an estimated annual economic impact—including multiplier effects—of $20.2 million in local spending, 379 jobs (full- and part-time, and seasonal) and $5.4 million in labor income.
L83|Impact of Organizational Culture on the Pakistani Hotels Workforce's Job Satisfaction: Qualitative Report|The influence of organizational culture on the level of job satisfaction depends on the ability to cope up with the stress and working environment. This investigation tackle the purpose of Denison’s prototypical for searching the organizational culture and Spector JGS assessment to inspect workforce job gratification in the course of 5 points Likert Scale. The investigation studied 220 hotel employees from middle range 3 star hotels in Pakistan. For interpretation, researchers chiefly used MS Excel for classifying, coding, and fractionizing raw facts into processed meaningful themes. Current investigation demonstrates that employee’s job satisfaction chiefly dependent on organizational culture. The study undertakes in the direction of achieving organizational goals by initiating fortify strategies towards building the strength to obtain the objective. Moreover if organizations built a strong environment of learning as a part of their culture than it boosts the commitment level of employees. Further, it also helps employees to unfolding their career achievements. On the other hand, it is observed that females are occupied with higher level of job satisfaction while males have lower. Although, high level of job satisfaction exists but its more evident by this research that premiums, bonuses, and other types of incentives aid employees to lead from low level of job satisfaction to reach on their higher apex level of job satisfaction.
L83|Upgrading a tourism cluster: The case of Eilat|Tourism clusters have attracted a good deal of attention in literature, probably due to the fact that (mass) tourism exhibits a strong tendency to agglomerate. A major challenge for many tourism clusters is how to upgrade their competitiveness in the wake of market change. While the 1950s and 1960s saw the rise of standardized mass tourism particularly in Mediterranean countries, driven by the Keynesian welfare state and Fordist paradigm as well as rising wealth in European markets, since the late 1970s a more differentiated and individualized pattern of tourism demand has emerged. Since then, tourists’ preferences have become much more diverse and led to a roll-back of the previously dominant form of standardized, deterritorialized mass (package) tourism. This diversity is somewhat reminiscent of the notion of flexible specialization known from the literature on industrial change. In the wake of these changes, tourism clusters that came into being during the age of Fordist mass tourism have to devise strategies to differentiate their offer and to adapt their product to new market demands. Eilat in Israel is one of those tourism clusters that exhibit salient features of Fordist mass tourism struggling to find their place in a more differentiated international tourism market. This study takes a look at the structure of the Eilat tourism cluster and suggests a trajectory towards differentiation and upgrading to enhance Eilat’s long-term competitiveness as an international tourist destination.
L83|Cross-border regional development in Gibraltar|Political borders are a reality regional development has to cope with, even if they do not necessarily correspond to the functional boundaries of regional economies. EU membership has afforded regions located close to national borders a high degree of permeability, supported by EU cohesion policy through Interreg projects. But how can these cross-border regions manage to develop under political tides towards re-erecting hard borders? The present study examines the regional economy of British Gibraltar in relation to its Spanish neighbor region, and proposes ideas on how to develop Gibraltar’s economy in a post-“Brexit” reality. Despite continuing uncertainties about the nature and scope of future EU-UK relations, this study presents possibilities for future cross-border regional cooperation, and for developing Gibraltar’s local economy within a region that may be crossed by a hard border but even so remains functionally strongly integrated.
L83|Inclusive local development: A strategy for Heraklion, Greece|Identifying opportunities to facilitate economic growth is a major challenge in local and regional development. Particularly for local or regional economies confronted with deep structural economic problems, unlocking growth differentials by targeting untapped potentials for employment and entrepreneurship can provide an opportunity to renew themselves. Therefore, it is logical that the “missing entrepreneurs” from among economically underrepresented or disadvantaged groups such as women, senior citizens, people with special needs, or youth as well as immigrants have recently gained attention by scholars and policymakers in local and regional development. Still, there is not yet a clear and comprehensive understanding on how to consider the needs of economically underrepresented or disadvantaged groups, both as entrepreneurs or as employees, in local and regional development strategy design. While women and youth entrepreneurship have been subject to an academic and policy debate for some time, the discourse on how to include other economically underrepresented or disadvantaged groups in local or regional economies is far less advanced. The present study reviews the state of literature on inclusive local development and, based on a preliminary analysis of the local economy, proposes a strategy for inclusive local development in Heraklion, Greece. As a locality suffering under the structural economic crisis that has afflicted Greece for almost a decade, a strategy for how to include economically underrepresented or disadvantaged groups in the local economy is both a social necessity and a way to unlock untapped potentials for economic growth.
L83|Estrategias de fijación y ofuscación de precios en los hoteles de sol y playa<BR>[Pricing and obfuscation strategies for sun and beach hotels]|In this paper, we show that the pricing of sun and beach vacations in its most common form – three star hotels situated on the Baleares islands – follows the same guidelines as many currently consumed goods and services. Mature foreign markets in which there are no clear leaders tend to show price dispersion due to promotions and discounts introduced arbitrarily by some bidders, as well as the reactions of competitors. There is a basic price in these markets, which for hotels is determined by the type of establishment, location, size, and facilities, and the level of saturation and degree of specialization of the destination in which it is integrated. Add to this basic price intangible factors: service quality and brand power – of the hotel and destination – and finally, promotions.
L83|Cleaning the Ganges in Varanasi to Attract Tourists|Despite the salience of Mr. Narendra Modi's campaign from both environmental and touristic standpoints, the extant literature contains no theoretical studies of the clean-up of the Ganges and its connection to tourism.

With a trend-analysis approach, this article is based on data collected through interviews, exploration of events, news, and information from print media and electronic media, as well as documents from tourism organizers in Cirebon. This paper concludes that Cirebon positioned itself as one of the destinations for the development of halal tourism that became the centre of the tourism industry in the future.
L83|Forecasting Tourist Arrivals in Prague: Google Econometrics|It is expected that what people are searching for today is predictive of what they have done recently or will do in the near future. This study analyzes the reliability of Google search data in predicting tourist arrivals and overnight stays in Prague. Three differ- ently weighted weekly Mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) models, ARIMA(1,1,1) with Monthly Google Trends information and model without informative Google Trends variable have been evaluated. The main objective was to assess whether Google Trends information is useful for forecasting tourist arrivals and overnight stays in Prague, as well as whether higher fre- quency data (weekly data) outperform same frequency data methods. The results of the study indicate an undeniable potential that Google Trends offers more accurate forecast- ing, particularly for tourism. The forecasting of the indicators using weekly MIDAS-Beta for tourist arrivals and weekly MIDAS-Almon models for overnight stays outperformed monthly Google Trends using ARIMA and models without Google Trends. The results confirm that predications based on Google searches are advantageous for policy makers and business operating in the tourism sector.
L83|Tournaments with subsequent group stages are incentive incompatible|We discuss the strategy-proofness of multistage tournaments. In a tournament with subsequent group stages, players are divided into groups in the preliminary and main rounds, where they play pairwise matches against each other. The higher ranked players qualify to the next stage such that matches are not repeated in the main round if two qualified players have already faced in the preliminary round. Players prefer to carry over better results to the main round, provided that they qualify. It is shown that these tournament systems, widely used in handball, are incentive incompatible. We also present some historical examples where a team was ex ante not interested in winning by a high margin.
L83|On the provision of guided tours in multiple foreign languages to tourists|We provide the first theoretical analysis of the working of an agency that provides guided tours in multiple foreign languages to tourists. We begin by delineating a simple model of the functioning of such an agency. Our model accounts for the fact that this agency is operating in an environment of uncertainty because the demand for guided tours in foreign languages is probabilistic. Next, we compute the probability that in the next day, the agency under study will receive a total of nâˆˆN requests for guided tours. Finally, we ascertain the probability density function of the amount of time it takes to complete a requested guided tour in an arbitrary foreign language.
L83|Managing Change and Strategic Thinking: Evidences from Hospitality and Tourism Sector of the UK|This qualitative paper examines the strategic thinking and managing change in complex business environment in the hospitality and tourism sector of the UK through the cases of Hilton London Canary Wharf and Hilton London Tower Bridge. For the purpose of analysis, researchers explored the research phenomenon under different models including TALC model and IBTEE Model. Using convenience sampling, researchers interviewed face-to-face 12 Line Managers and 30 employees through open-ended semi-structured interview questions regarding change management process and obstacles interlinked with it. Findings revealed that although Hilton hotels have adapted changes to some extent but there is still more room for further improvement. The management of the selected hotels highly relies on the training purpose for the effective change adaption whereas coaching and research is lagging behind. The biggest constraint during effective change adaption is the diverse background of the workforce as most are from the multicultural backgrounds. Moreover, the communication, ritual, and cultural barriers are causing issues in the change process. Lastly, the recommendations are given for consolidating effective change management at workplace.
L83|Sustainable rural development through tourism activities in Dobrugdea's rural area|The sustainable rural development of the Dobrudgean rural area requires reaching a balance between the need to preserve the rural economic, ecological and cultural space and the tendency to modernize the rural economic activity and life. The pleading for the promotion of tourism activities in the Dobrudgean rural area starts from the need for rural economical diversification. In general, no rural development program can be conceived in the absence of an essential role played by agriculture. The rural economy is more developed and more dynamic if it has a more diverse structure, and if the share of non-agricultural economy is higher. In this context, the paper presents the tourism potential of the rural localities from Dobrudgea and the development of a viable network of private small and medium-sized enterprises in the tourism sector. The volume of information in this paper resulted from the investigation of relationships that exist between the environmental and social factors at local level, making it possible to define the necessary mechanisms for the sustainable development of tourism activities.
