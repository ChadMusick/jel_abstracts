M38|Monthly Payment Targeting and the Demand for Maturity|In this paper, we provide evidence of the importance of monthly payments in the market for consumer installment debt. Auto debt in particular has grown rapidly since the Great Recession and has eclipsed credit cards in total debt outstanding. Auto-loan maturities have also increased such that most auto-loan originations now have a term of over 72 months. We document three phenomena we jointly refer to as monthly payment targeting. First, using data from 500,000 used auto loans and discontinuities in contract terms offered by hundreds of lenders, we show that demand is more sensitive to maturity than interest rate, consistent with consumers managing payment size when making debt decisions. Second, many consumers appear to employ segregated mental accounts, spending exogenous payment savings on larger loans. Third, consumers bunch at round-number monthly payment amounts, consistent with the use of budgeting heuristics. These patterns hold in subsamples of constrained and unconstrained borrowers, challenging liquidity constraints as a complete explanation. Our estimates suggest that borrower focus on payment size, combined with credit-supply shocks to maturity, could significantly affect aggregate outstanding debt.
M38|Testing the Effectiveness of Consumer Financial Disclosure: Experimental Evidence from Savings Accounts|Disclosure—the practice of providing information to support decision making—has been widely mandated in public policy but is routinely ignored by consumers and subject to obfuscation by firms. Yet most evidence on the effectiveness of consumer financial disclosure stems from lab experiments where subjects do not have competing demands on their attention or from analysis of borrowing decisions where optimality is hard to characterize. In this paper, we provide field evidence from randomized-controlled trials with 124,000 savings account holders at five UK depositories. Treated consumers received varying degrees of salient information about alternative products, including one with their current provider that strictly dominated their current savings product. Motivated by work on search frictions, switching costs, and inattention, our experimental variation is designed to allow us to examine the importance of each in inhibiting effective disclosure. Despite the switching process taking 15 minutes on average and the moderate size of average potential gains (£123 in the first year), attention to disclosure is low, significantly limiting its potential effectiveness, motivating explicit disclosure-design rules, and demonstrating the nature of deposit stickiness.
M38|The Impacts of Managerial Autonomy on Firm Outcomes|The allocation of decision rights within organizations influences resource allocation, expansion decisions, and ultimately outcomes. Using a newly constructed dataset, I estimate the effects of an earned autonomy program for State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in India. The program gave managers (the board of directors) of profitable SOEs more autonomy over strategic decisions such as capital expansion and the formation of joint ventures. I find that autonomy allows SOEs to increase their capital stock and form more strategic partnerships which leads to greater sales and profits. I also find that the likelihood that a manager subsequently joins a board of a private firm is greater for managers of those SOEs which were granted autonomy, indicating that career concerns is a consistent explanation for these managerial decisions. Taken together, these results indicate that large gains in SOE performance are possible without privatization (by policies like earned autonomy) and may occur partly through managers' career concerns.
M38|Online privacy and market structure: Theory and evidence|This paper investigates how privacy regulation affects the structure of online markets. We provide a simple theoretical model capturing the basic trade-off between the degree of privacy intrusion and the informativeness of advertising. We derive empirically testable hypotheses regarding a possibly asymmetric effect of privacy regulation on large and small firms using a diff-diff-diff model with heterogeneous treatment timing. Our theoretical model predicts that privacy regulation may affect predominantly large firms, even if - as our data confirms - these large firms tend to offer more privacy. Our empirical results show that, if any, only large firms were negatively affected, suggesting that privacy regulation might boost competition by leveling out the playing field for small firms.
M38|Enhancing central bank communications with behavioural insights|In this joint Bank of England and Behavioural Insights Team study, we test the effectiveness of different approaches to central bank communications. Using an online experiment with a representative sample of the UK population, we measure how changes to the Bank of England’s summaries of the Inflation Report impact comprehension and trust in its policy messages. We find that the recently introduced Visual Summary of the Inflation Report improves comprehension of its main messages in a statistically significant way compared to the traditional executive summary. We also find that public comprehension and trust can be further improved by making the Visual Summary more relatable to people’s lives. Our findings thus shed light on how central banks can improve communication with the public at a time when trust in public institutions has fallen, while the responsibilities delegated to central banks have increased.
M38|Regulation with Experimentation: Ex Ante Approval, Ex Post Withdrawal, and Liability|Dynamic adoption policies of activities with uncertain returns are characterized by three key decisions: in the ex ante experimentation phase, the decisions when to abandon experimentation and when to introduce to market; in the ex post learning phase, the decision when to withdraw following the accumulation of bad news. In a tractable continuous-time model, we study the optimal mix of the three instruments regulators employ to align the private incentives of firms: ex ante approval regulation, ex post withdrawal regulation, and liability. Our results can rationalize the array of regulatory environments observed across applications ranging from product safety to patent protection. We also consider costly lying and show that the social planner can be better off when the firm privately observes research results.
M38|Conceptualizing ASEAN Tourism Brand: Towards A Coopetition Framework|Objective - This paper proposes an integrative framework in an attempt to conceptualize the branding of ASEAN tourism in a sustainable and unified approach based on the results collected from a sample of travellers visiting ASEAN destinations and tourism insights from NTOs or DMOs. Methodology/Technique - A mixed method is used to combine the quantitative and qualitative phases. A survey of travellers visiting ASEAN destinations (n=480) is conducted with a mix of Asian travellers and Western travellers, as well as 10 in-depth interviews with NTOs or DMOs to obtain tourism insights. Findings - The findings suggest that authenticity of the destination image is an integral part of ASEAN tourism. National Tourism Organizations (NTOs), Destination Marketing Organization (DMO) and other stakeholders of ASEAN tourism should adopt a coopetition framework and co-create a consistent and coherent positioning of the destination, while maintaining a competitive positioning of the nation, to achieve a sustainable brand of ASEAN tourism. Novelty - The paper highlights the needs for ASEAN NTOs and DMOs to enable coopetition for all tourism stakeholders for the promotion of the ASEAN brand. The proposed framework is seen as transformative in its ability to bring about collaborative and sustainable efforts to ultimately achieve an authentic ASEAN brand.
M38|The Strategic Role of Management of Human Resources to Prevent Corruption|Objective - Corruption is the greatest threat for growth and stability in an organization. The eradication of corruption has been achieved through instruments, law enforcement and inspectorate measures, but corruption levels in Indonesia are still not as low as other ASEAN countries such as Singapore and Malaysia. It is therefore necessary to expand the measures taken to eradicate corruption not only in terms of legal measures, but also within human resource management strategies. Methodology/Technique - This research uses a quantitative explorative technique using SPSS, a dependent variables of Prevent Corruption (Y), and independent variables of Organizational Culture (X1), Competence (X2), Leadership (X3) and Internal Control (X4). The study sample is the Directorate General of a Ministry in Indonesia with a population of 525 people, and a sample of 149 people. Findings - The study found that: (1) The regression equation model is Y = 0.014 + 0.972 X1 + 0,030 X2 - 0,053 X3 + 0,049 X4, RSq = 0,969, F = 1095,574; (2) culture is the most dominant factor in preventing corruption; (3) Competence, Leadership and Internal Control have no significant effect on the prevention of corruption; (4) Novelty - In the absence of improvements to existing policies, the rate of corruption in Indonesia is around 0.014 on a scale of 1-5.
M38|Rethinking nudge: not one but three concepts|Nudge is a concept of policy intervention that originates in Thaler and Sunstein's (2008) popular eponymous book. Following their own hints, we distinguish three properties of nudge interventions: they redirect individual choices by only slightly altering choice conditions (here nudge 1), they use rationality failures instrumentally (here nudge 2), and they alleviate the unfavourable effects of these failures (here nudge 3). We explore each property in semantic detail and show that no entailment relation holds between them. This calls into question the theoretical unity of nudge, as intended by Thaler and Sunstein and most followers. We eventually recommend pursuing each property separately, both in policy research and at the foundational level. We particularly emphasize the need of reconsidering the respective roles of decision theory and behavioural economics to delineate nudge 2 correctly. The paper differs from most of the literature in focusing on the definitional rather than the normative problems of nudge.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
M38|The influence of emotional intelligence on the performance of health department officers of Deli Serdang regency|Employee performance is the responsibility of employees to their work and the results achieved by the employees in performing the job given to them either in quantity or quality within a certain time. The goals of employee performance are to adjust employee expectation with organizational goals. Incompatibility between efforts to achieve employee performance goals with organizational goals will result in poor performance. Employee performance is influenced by internal and external factors. One of the internal factors that affect employee performance is emotional intelligence. This research analyzed the influence of emotional intelligence which consists of self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills on the performance of the Officer of Health Department of Deli Serdang Regency, North Sumatera, Indonesia. The type of this research was causal research with cross-sectional study design. The subjects of this research were Civil Servants working in the Health Department of Deli Serdang Regency who occupied operative positions or staff of 100 people. The sampling used data were collected through interviews, questionnaires distribution and literature study. The data were analyzed using a multiple linear regression model, hypothesis and testing was done by using T-test and F-test. This research was conducted at the Health Department of Deli Serdang Regency, North Sumatera Province, Indonesia. The result showed that emotional intelligence which had a significant influence on the performance of Health Service Officers of Deli Serdang Regency was motivation and social skill. The results of the T-test showed that the emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills simultaneously had a positive influence on the performance of the Health Department officers of Deli Serdang Regency. The results of the -test concluded that emotional intelligence: motivation and social skills had a positive and significant influence on the performance of the Health Department officers of Deli Serdang Regency. Emotional intelligence consisting of self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills had a positive and significant influence on the performance improvement of the Health Department officers of Deli Serdang Regency. The higher the emotional intelligence of the Health Department officers of Deli Serdang Regency, the better the employee performance, the lower the emotional intelligence, the lower the performance of the employees.
M38|Consumer Preferences for Natural Beef| The FDA received petitions to more clearly define the content of the natural label or even prohibit its use. Against this background, we conducted an online choice experiment to determine consumer preferences for boneless USDA Choice ribeye steaks. We also determined if providing consumers with information regarding the legal definition of natural had an impact on consumer preferences. Results indicate that natural labeling has a positive impact on consumer utility when consumers were not aware of the definition of natural; this impact was not found when consumers were informed of the definition of natural.
M38|Research and the Approval Process: The Organization of Persuasion|An informer sequentially collects and disseminates information through costly research to persuade an evaluator to approve an activity. Payoffs and control rights are split between informer and evaluator depending on the organizational rules governing the approval process. The welfare benchmark corresponds to Wald's classic solution for a statistician with payoff equal to the sum of informer and evaluator. Organizations with different commitment power of informer and evaluator are compared from a positive and normative perspective. Granting authority to the informer is socially optimal when information acquisition is sufficiently costly. The analysis is applied to the regulatory process for drug approval.
M38|The Relationship Organizational Culture and Organizational Commitment on Public Service Quality; Perspective Local Government in Bandung, Indonesia|Literature studies prove the importance the role of organizational culture (OC) and organizational commitment that contribute to organizational performance, but it is a few links to the quality of public services. This study was conducted to contribute in cultural studies’ organizations and organizational commitment to public service. The research object of government organizations in the city of Bandung, Indonesia with a sample of 187 employees with proporsionate cluster random sampling technique. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling partial least squares. The results showed that OC and organizational commitment significantly influence the quality of public services. This suggests that policy makers in Bandung local goverment, Indonesia should be able to improve OC and organizational commitment to public service that is accepted by society can run optimally
M38|Factors Influencing E-district Adoption: An Empirical Assessment in Indian Context|The purpose of this confirmatory study is to explore the factors influencing the acceptance of e-district services by the citizens inAssam, a North-East state of India. Taking unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), technology acceptance model (TAM) and TAM 3 as the basis, a conceptual framework is developed. The study uses semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and a questionnaire based survey through 166 valid data points to validate the conceptual framework. Moreover, the internal consistency of the scale items is checked with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient while the convergent and discriminant validities are checked with multitrait-multimethod matrix. This study confirms the positive relationship of “Perceived Usefulness” and “Facilitating Conditions” with “Behavioral Intention (BI)” while the expected positive relationship of “Effort Expectancy” and “Social Influence” with “BI” are found to be insignificant. Also, the study cannot find a significant negative relationship between “ComputerAnxiety” and “BI.”
M38|For Patriotism and Profit: Advertising in Service of the Swedish Government 1935-1985|Beginning just before the outbreak of World War II, the advertising industry in (neutral) Sweden began cooperating with the government. This cooperation was highly beneficial for the industry during the war as blockades and rationing caused the civilian advertising market to almost disappear. After the war, the cooperation continued, albeit in relation to primarily military matters. Later, however, the government began procuring advertising and media services on largely commercial grounds. Using documents (including previously classified records) from government agencies, trade organizations and individual advertising companies, this study presents the history of the special relationship between private advertising companies and the Swedish government. In the half century after the first examples of government advertising during World War II, distinct phases can be identified. The first phase began with the end of World War II, when government advertising was considered inappropriate during peacetime and cooperation occurred almost exclusively within the National Information Service (an organization similar to the US War Advertising Council), which prepared wartime advertising for World War III. The second phase began in the late 1960s, when the Swedish government began running large public advertising campaigns. The first campaign was connected with the introduction of right-hand traffic in 1967, and later campaigns were aimed at, for example, energy savings and public health. Finally, the third phase began in the late 1970s, when advertising developed into an integral part of public sector activities and government agencies and municipalities became major buyers of media and advertising services. In addition to the history of the relationship between the industry and the government, this paper provides an analysis of the incentives for cooperation and the influence of the public advertising market on the industry structure.
M38|The Ephemeral Concept of Parasitic Commercial Practices in the EU|Research background: It has been one decade since the transposition deadline regarding the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. The EU´s growth strategy, Europe 2020, and all EU member states are committed to smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth, to the single internal market and to R&D leading to innovations. These positive priorities, however, often conflict with one another. The EU crossed the Rubicon and decided to harmonize the protection against parasitic commercial practices hurting intellectual property and consumers. Is this appropriate, effective and efficient? Purpose of the article: The primary purpose of this article is to assess the appropriateness, effectiveness and efficiency of the EU harmonization of the ephemeral concept of parasitic commercial practices. The secondary purpose is to assess approach(es) of the EU and EU member states to this overlap of the competition and intellectual property regimes. The third purpose is to assess the feasibility of the integrative harmonization in this arena. Methodology/methods: The multi-disciplinary nature of this article, and its three purposes, leads to the employment of Meta-Analysis, of the critical comparison of laws and the impact of their application, to the holistic perception of historical and national contexts, and to case studies. The primary sources (field search) and secondary sources (literature) are explored and the yield knowledge and data are confronted with the explored cases. The dominating qualitative research and data are complemented by the quantitative research and data. Findings & Value added: The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive harmonizes the protection of various issues, including the ephemeral concept of parasitic commercial practices. The set trio of purposes leads to a conclusion that this overlap of competition and intellectual property protection is highly sensitive and nationally particular. EU integration in this sphere is needed, but the undertaken harmonization is not fully effective and efficient, and perhaps even not appropriate.
M38|Türkiye Vatandaşlarının Kırgız ve Kırgızistan İmajına Yönelik Algıları|Academic studies on country’s image have conducted since 1930. Creation of country image includes several key features as economic, politic, ecologic, technologic conditions, history and cultural background as well as human resources of that country. We can say that the country image as a subject attracts attention of academic studies. Although there are many studies on the image of Turkey in Kyrgyzstan, there is no published research on the image of Kyrgyzstan in Turkey. The main purpose of this study is to determine Turkish citizens’ perception toward Kyrgyz and Kyrgyzstan. For this purpose, it had carried out survey among 358 participants. The findings suggested that Turkish citizen’s perceptions toward Kyrgyz and Kyrgyzstan generally positive. However, there is a significant difference between participants who has already visited Kyrgyzstan and has not visited yet. In other words, after visiting Kyrgyzstan Turkish citizens’ view is being changing in a negative direction.

M38|Resisting Persuasion|Agents that are subject to persuasion attempts often employ strategies that allow them to effectively resist. In the context of Bayesian Persuasion (Kamenica and Gentzkow, 2011), we argue that if appropriate action-contingent payoff adjustments are available to the subject of persuasion, then payoff improvements are achieved. Remarkably, payoff-improving resistance strategies need not involve adding benefits to any action. We characterize the optimal resistance strategy when only costly payoff adjustments are allowed and we show that it induces a perfectly informative signal and a substantial increase in the agent’s welfare.

M38|Kontrowersje zwiazane z reklamowaniem lekow. Analiza porównawcza Polski i Stanów Zjednoczonych /Controversial Advertising of Medicines. A Comparison between Poland and the United States|For many years, the subject of aggressive marketing campaigns conducted by pharmaceutical companies has been raised in Poland. Drug ads are everywhere, on television, the radio, magazines and on the Internet. Therefore, it is extremely important is to ensure both their legal and ethical dimension. In my article I will present the differences between direct-to-consumer advertising of medicines in Poland and in the US. The dissimilarities result mainly from differences in legislation. In Poland the law is much stricter than in the US. For example, in the United States companies are allowed to advertise prescription drugs directly to patients. In the whole of the European Union, and thus in Poland, it is strictly prohibited. The article will present other regulations existing in Poland and in the United States and it will compare them. It will show examples of violations of the law and ethics in the advertising of medicine in both countries. It will briefly outline the negative consequences of unacceptable pharmaceutical marketing.
M38|"""Now that you mention it"": A Survey Experiment on Information, Salience and Online Privacy"|Personal data lie at the forefront of different business models and constitute the main source of revenue of several online companies. In many cases, consumers have incomplete information about the digital transactions of their data. This paper investigates whether highlighting positive or negative aspects of online privacy, thereby mitigating the informational problem, can affect consumers’ privacy actions and attitudes. Results of two online survey experiments indicate that participants adopt a more conservative stance on disclosing identifiable information, such as name and email, even when they are informed about positive attitudes of companies towards their privacy. On the other hand, they do not change their attitudes and social actions towards privacy. These findings suggest that privacy concerns are dormant and may manifest when consumers are asked to think about privacy; and that privacy behavior is not necessarily sensitive to exposure to objective threats or benefits of disclosing personal information.
M38|It’s the Society, Stupid! Communicating Emergent Climate Technologies in the Internet Age|Emergent or unproven technologies occupy a central role in post-Paris debates about climate change goals and their feasibility. New technologies have often faced major political and social challenges and the way they are communicated is changing as technical experts and scientists play a greater role in communicating directly online. We review the scope and key characteristics of communications on carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technologies presenting data from a comprehensive survey of websites compiled to assess the state of global CCS communications. Our key empirical finding is that existing communications are techno-centric in their framing, overlooking economic, political and institutional aspects of CCS as a societal arrangement. We also find an overrepresentation of traditionally less trusted actors from business and government (resulting in a pro-CCS bias), rather than by independent academic researchers or NGOs. We offer some recommendations for how CCS and similarly emergent climate technologies might be better communicated in the age of the Internet, not just in terms of their technical features but also in terms of their societal impacts and the role they might play in a wider social and political context.

M38|Consumer governance in electricity markets|This paper examines switching decisions by households in the MainPower distribution area of New Zealand. The paper measures the extent to which customers switch retailers following the release of information about directors' bonuses, marketing surrounding firm ownership, and work by the New Zealand Electricity Authority to promote transparency of the switching process. We document strong customer inertia, which, for some consumers, has reduced following the Electricity Authority's interventions. Customer movements following information releases and marketing campaigns are modest, suggesting that prices and inertia may be the most important drivers of customer migration.
M38|Information disclosure and consumer awareness|Whether consumers are aware of potentially adverse product effects is key to private and social incentives to disclose information about undesirable product characteristics. In a monopoly model with a mix of aware and unaware consumers, a larger share of unaware consumers makes information disclosure less likely to occur. Since the firm is not interested in releasing information to unaware consumers, a more precise targeting technology that allows the firm to better keep unaware consumers in the dark leads to more disclosure. A regulator may want to intervene in this market and impose mandatory disclosure rules.
M38|Willingness-to-pay for alternative fuel vehicle characteristics: A stated choice study for Germany|In the light of European energy efficiency and clean air regulations, as well as an ambitious electric mobility goal of the German government, we examine consumer preferences for alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) based on a Germany-wide discrete choice experiment among 711 potential car buyers. We estimate consumers’ willingness-to-pay and compensating variation (CV) for improvements in vehicle attributes, also taking taste differences in the population into account by applying a latent class model with 6 distinct consumer segments. Our results indicate that about 1/3 of the consumers are oriented towards at least one AFV option, with almost half of them being AFV-affine, showing a high probability of choosing AFVs despite their current shortcomings. Our results suggest that German car buyers’ willingness-to-pay for improvements of the various vehicle attributes varies considerably across consumer groups and that the vehicle features have to meet some minimum requirements for considering AFVs. The CV values show that decision-makers in the administration and industry should focus on the most promising consumer group of ‘AFV aficionados’ and their needs. It also shows that some vehicle attribute improvements could increase the demand for AFVs cost-effectively, and that consumers would accept surcharges for some vehicle attributes at a level which could enable their private provision and economic operation (e.g. fast-charging infrastructure). Improvement of other attributes will need governmental subsidies to compensate for insufficient consumer valuation (e.g. battery capacity).

M38|Innovation, competition and public procurement in the pre-commercial phase|Should the supply or the demand side bear the risk connected to innovation? The two polar cases identified in the literature are the supply push and the demand pull. The former is the typical one, with the supplier bearing the costs and obtaining the benefits from innovating. The latter is technology procurement, where the buyer takes the risk, by procuring the innovative good or service. With respect to this, pre-commercial procurement is a peculiar solution that can explain the debate found in the literature relative to its configuration either as a supply-side or a demand-side instrument. The separation from the commercial phase allows the procurer to take only (part of) the risks connected to R&D services. Also, competition among suppliers gives the opportunity of evaluating different solutions and to obtain, in the commercial phase, a lower price for the innovative good. The counterpart of all this is a large portion of risk being left to the supplier. As a consequence, suppliers need to obtain a larger share of the benefits of the innovation process. This economic reason, besides the legal restrictions on State aid, explains the need for a shared risks-shared benefits approach, centred on the agreements on the assignment of IPRs.
M38|Estimating the cost of strategic entry delay in pharmaceuticals: The case of Ambien CR|Abstract With the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, the FDA included an unchallengeable exclusivity period for newly approved drugs, independent of patents. This potentially generates an incentive for firms to strategically delay the introduction of new versions (reformulations) of drugs until just before patent expiration of the original drug. This way the reformulated drug competes mainly with newly introduced generics of the original drug. If instead, the reformulated drug was to be introduced well before the original drug’s patent expires, the reformulated drug would compete only with the original drug. While the pattern of strategic delay is well documented in the literature, its effects on consumers and firms are not. Reformulations may increase utility through improved efficacy and through fewer doses per day or a more even molecule decay rate. However, as suggested in the press and literature, it is also possible that the adoption of reformulated products is mostly the result of advertising rather than product-related benefits. Using detailed prescribing and pricing data from the prescription sleep aid market, I document significant adoption of the reformulation Ambien CR and show that it is not only driven by advertising. I use these estimates to evaluate two different policies designed to induce earlier entry of Ambien CR. I find that there are large potential gains in consumer surplus and in revenue.
M38|A matching model of university–industry collaborations|In this paper, we present a model of university–industry collaborations with heterogeneous agents. It develops one of the original intuitions by Leyden and Link (Small Bus Econ 41:797–817. doi: 10.1007/s11187-013-9507-7 , 2013b ) about the mechanisms by which innovative firms search for collaborative research partners. We study the characteristics of the matching process between universities and innovative firms that makes this exchange in technology transfer (TT) either efficient or unfeasible. We show that the functioning of the TT market implies dual-trading externalities. These arise because there is a high probability that a firm searching for a university collaboration will not meet a suitable researcher, and another positive probability that an unemployed researcher will not find a suitable innovative firm, whatever the market prices and the costs are. According to the matching model literature, we refer to these externalities as congestion. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016
M38|Donatello Strangio & Giuseppe Sancetta (Eds.), Italy in a European Context: Research in Business, Economics, and the Environment|Contributing to support the diffusion of an European culture and sense of citizenship. This is the aim of the book “Italy in a European Context: Research in Business, Economics, and the Environment” edited by Donatella Strangio & Giuseppe Sancetta. It is a collection of scholarly articles that cover the main issues related to role of Italy offering different perspectives ranging from economics and management, among others. It is a good read not only for students and scholars with a specific interest in the subject, but also for the institutions willing to reflect on the various issues surrounding the book. The authors contributing to this handbook are leading scholars conducting research on different fields. In fact, one of the main strengths of the book is the variety of perspectives offered by its chapters. After an introduction by the editors, the book is structured into two parts. The first section helps in understanding the critical role played by EU economic policies and aspects that concern political and social inequality. The second section of the book focuses on issues concerning counterfeiting, finance and environment.
M38|International Economic Sanctions:Analyses Of The Case With Russia In 2014|The topic of international economic sanctions is particularly relevant in the domestic scientific literature since the implementation of sanctions by a number of states toward Russia in 2014. If until then, the analysis of sanctions in Russia belonged mainly to the legal sciences, in 2014 economic studies on this subject began to emerge, relating exceptionally to the estimation of the current situation with Russia. Due to the relative novelty of the topic in the national economic discussion, the goal of this article is to clarify the frameworks of categories of the subject of study and to analyze the motives and consequences of Russia's counter-sanctions in the area of agricultural sector and food industry.
M38|Assessment Of Competitiveness Of Shipbuilding Industry In Russia|Shipbuilding is one of the most important sectors of the Russian economy. The competitiveness of naval shipbuilding is at a high level. The proof is Russia's position in the world market of naval equipment. Civilian shipbuilding is not only uncompetitive in the global market, but poorly represented in the internal. The future of civil shipbuilding is connected with such promising niches as the producing of machinery to develop fields in the Arctic, ice technicians to service the Northern sea route, sea and river vessels for domestic transport. Due to the nature of the industry, in particular the duration, the complexity and costs of building ships that need state support. In the last decade, the state has adopted a number of policy documents, carried out a structural transformation of the industry.
M38|Determinants of emotional regulation among marketing staff in the Jordanian banking sector|This study empirically verifies the determinants of emotional regulation as observed among marketing staff in the Jordanian banking sector. In particular, it examines the relationship between participants’ cognitive flexibility capabilities, their levels of response inhibition and their levels of mindfulness on the degree of emotional regulation they exhibited. Data was collected from a sample of 120 respondents who were administered four standardized survey questionnaires. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the data, and results show no significant relationship between cognitive flexibility, inhibition levels, and a combination of both factors on emotional regulation. However, it found that mindfulness had a low but significant and positive relationship with emotional regulation.

In this paper, we present the case of Korea as the e-government leader with the highest scores in ‘E-government Development Index’ according to the latest edition of the United Nations E-Government Survey, followed by the e-government of El Bahrain that took serious action to improve e-government, and as a result, the only Arab country to be classified among the very high-performing countries within the EGDI, and to bring out the reasons behind their success. Finally, we review Algeria e-government project, Some critical factors that affect its implementation.
M38|Governance Innovation for SOEs in Bulgaria: Based on Korean Experience|The recent financial performances of many Bulgarian SOEs have revealed the shortcomings in the management of its SOEs. The main direction of Bulgarian reforms should be improving transparency, better selection and appraisal of management, sustainable dividend policy, strengthening financial discipline and coherent ways to reduce the debt burden. The institutional status quo is clearly inefficient and needs to be replaced. The direction of SOE governance reforms in Korea and Bulgaria are substantially different. Korea has maintained a very centralized grip over SOEs for an extended period of time, and it needs to reduce government intervention by guaranteeing more autonomy for SOEs. On the other hand, Bulgaria needs more centralized control over SOEs, which is expected to improve their performance. The Korean experience in reforming its SOE management system is highly relevant for Bulgaria and it complies with the OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises. This paper asks 31 questions regarding a system of good governance and presents options for each question regarding positive and negative aspects, followed by specific recommendations for the Bulgarian government. It is recommended that a centralized authority responsible for the management of SOEs be established which is composed of line vice-ministers and experts from academia and the private sector. Major tasks and responsibilities should be transferred gradually from line ministries to this new setting. Among these include increasing transparency, the introduction of an evaluation system with strict consequences and related open competitive procedures for the selection, the appointment and appraisal of CEOs, as well as an annual bonus system. SOE governance reform in Bulgaria will touch off strong resistance from both line ministries and their SOEs. Therefore, it will require a good deal of effort and strategy to accomplish the task. It is important to win the minds of the people and the political leadership in that the current system is subject to a number of problems, and that reform of the system is critical to a more efficient economy and provision of better public services to its citizens.
M38|The Label - An Essential Tool For Keeping The Consumer Informed And For Promoting Products In The Economic Area|The lifestyle and the technology evolution have significantly changed the consumers’ expectations and behaviors for the alimentary products. Paying more attention to health and welfare, consumers are looking for healthy products, which induces a special sensitivity to all information on the packaging and to the guarantees offered by the presence of official signs of quality. The quality of the product itself is undoubtedly the key to success, but before arriving there, the consumer must be convinced that the product should be bought from all the others that are available in the same category, moment at which the visual appearance of the product must fulfill his role. Deepening the analysis, we can say that although the shape, color, packaging originality are particularly important points, finally, the element that will really make the difference for consumers, today, is the label and the containing information.
M38|The Impact of Market Orientation, Brand Image and Internal Marketing on Brand Orientation and Strengthening Br|Brand performance related concepts, such as brand strength and brand equity have been proven out to provide several positive outcomes for a firm. This research study aims to estimate the impact of market orientation, internal marketing and brand image on brand orientation and strengthening brand performance. The study tests whether market orientation, internal marketing and brand image affects brand orientation and in turn whether brand orientation affects brand performance in coffee industry of Aceh - Indonesia. A standardized questionnaire was distributed among different people pertinent to coffee industry (distributors, whole sellers, retailers, sales force and employees etc). A total of 200 questionnaires were used by random sampling technique. A model with hypotheses of the relationships between the constructs was built. The results of the structural equation model suggest that market orientation and internal marketing, has positive effect on brand orientation, while brand image has a non-significant effect. Moreover, the study concludes that brand orientation has a substantial impact on strengthening brand performance. Results of this study can help organizations to improve their company performance through more awareness of the determinants of brand performance.
M38|Corporate Social Responsibility of Chinese SMEs: Implementation and Challenges (Spoleczna odpowiedzialnosc chinskich MSP: wdrozenie, realizacja i wyzwania)|The research scope of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been growing increasingly popular in emerging economies, whereas the knowledge relating to CSR in the case of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is still limited. This study starts with the definition of CSR and an explanation regarding the relation between CSR and marketing. Descriptions of CSR in China and Chinese SMEs are presented as well. This research aims to identify the situation of CSR as adopted by Chinese SMEs in the current economic environment as well as to analyze the challenges of their implementation. To achieve these research objectives, twenty different SMEs in Guangdong Province were investigated through in-depth semi-structured interviews. This study shows that CSR is still in an infant stage for the majority of Chinese SMEs due to the incomplete legal system, weak CSR awareness, and deficient financial resources. Moreover, several appropriate suggestions for policy makers and the enterprises themselves are recommended in order to improve the future CSR performance of Chinese SMEs.
M38|The relationship between culture and information privacy policy|Abstract Operating in a global market provides challenges for managers concerned with information privacy. This work builds on a branch of research that has evolved to examine the relationship between culture and attitudes to information privacy. Our approach is unique in that our dependent variable is a count variable designed to measure the rate of uptake of privacy laws. It is a departure from studying cultural variables at the individual level. We also identify the cultural impact of legislation at the national level. Previous models generally use a relatively crude division of legislative codes. By contrast, this work examines the impact of culture on baskets of privacy elements drawn from the EU directive. These attributes are candidates for codification in law, but are taken up at varying rates. A key originality and challenge of the work is the use of the GLOBE variables for culture. Results suggest that group collectivism, power distance, assertiveness and uncertainty avoidance are the most powerful cultural predictors of the level of privacy legislation provision.
M38|Medical Tourism Market And Inter-Stakeholders’ Relations In Turkey: A Comparative Investigation From Reverse Innovation And Destination Governance Viewpoint|This study aims to analyze inter-stakeholders’ interactions, destination governance, reverse innovation and the tasks of central government within Turkish medical tourism market. The investigation’s objective is to shed lights on scientists and practitioners regarding to what extent medical tourism is affected by stakeholders. Likewise, the originality of this investigation is that this study is the first attempt that links up reverse innovation and stakeholder approach as a holistic strategy and competitive advantage tool in medical tourism. The statistical evidences of Turkey also support the fact that the incline of medical tourism incomes and benefits is tightly bound on key inter-stakeholders’ collaborations, marketing tools, specific strategies, effective governance mechanism and cooperation with civil society organizations. This study is a thematic case that comprises particular research fields and formulates advanced arguments that are embedded in enriched relevant literature review and the highlights of the 7th International Health Tourism Congress.
M38|Psychological Frictions and the Incomplete Take-Up of Social Benefits: Evidence from an IRS Field Experiment|"We address the role of ""psychological frictions"" in the incomplete take-up of EITC benefits with an IRS field experiment. We specifically assess the influence of program confusion, informational complexity, and stigma by evaluating response to experimental mailings distributed to 35,050 tax filers who failed to claim $26 million despite an initial notice. While the mere receipt of the mailing, simplification, and the heightened salience of benefits led to substantial additional claiming, attempts to reduce perceived costs of stigma, application, and audits did not. The study, and accompanying surveys, suggests that low program awareness/understanding and informational complexity contribute to the puzzle of low take-up. (JEL C93, D03, H24, M38)"

M38|Predictors of gambling among university students: the role of gender, sociality and attitudes towards risk|In this paper, we seek to integrate the socio-psychological analysis of gambling behavior with the economic one. In particular, on the base of a questionnaire administered to university students, we analyze how attitudes towards risk, more precisely, the amount at stake at which preference for certainty prevails, contribute to predicting the probability of becoming a gambler.
M38|El papel de las bluelaws en los modelos de evolución de los for¬matos comerciales|La literatura sobre las bluelaws (regulación de horarios comerciales) es muy amplia e importante, pero sus resultados son muy dispersos y distintos, y siempre ha trabajado con una perspectiva estrictamente sectorial y una metodología univariable. Es necesario estudiar la desregulación de horarios comerciales dentro de un modelo global de cambio, incorporando variables económicas externas (PIB) y variables de competencia endógenas (como las cuotas de superficie comercial). Nuestro modelo destaca que la desregulación de horarios afecta de forma inmediata a las estrategias de tiempo como servicio al con¬sumidor ofertado por los supermercados y los centros comerciales. Que la competencia determina los cambios en la estructura comercial, la productividad y en el empleo del sector.

M38|A Comparison Of User Perceptions And Frequency Of Use Of Social Media To Use Of Social Media|Social media has increasingly become a place consumers go to for interpersonal communication, information gathering and sharing, and recreation. Understanding social media user perceptions in relation to how they use social media can benefit marketers in developing social media strategies and content, as well as selecting the specific social media networks to use. This research examined user perceptions and frequency of use of social media in relation to the uses of selected social media â€“ Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest â€“ among undergraduate university students 18 to 23 years old. The findings indicate the importance of frequency of use, perceived usefulness and enjoyment, and showed a relevant though lesser role of enjoyment on the uses of social media
M38|The Young And The Restless: Grappling With The Young Chinese Consumer Mindset|China will boast a population of almost 500-million young people under age 30 by 2015. The sheer size of the Chinese youth market and young peopleâ€™s discretionary income make this market one of the most sought-after in the world. The status and continuing development of Chinese youth culture is especially interesting to marketers and scholars worldwide. Recent media reports depict Chinese youth as restless and as experiencing an internal psychological conflict between private selves and public selves, between private identity and public identity(Griffiths, 2012). Few studies have provided analysis of the causes of this seemingly bi-polar psychological state. The paper explores this situation by delving into the core values of Chinese tradition in the context of Chinaâ€™s contemporary socioeconomic realitiesâ€”focusing on the paradoxical, conflicting, and even opposing cultural values that are rooted in Chinaâ€™s past and present. Among the dilemmas are standing out and fitting in, individual freedom and societyâ€™s demands, and â€œsoaring aspirations and limited opportunities. This paper demonstrates that the restlessness of contemporary Chinese youth is the logical results of feeling trapped and directionless at the seismic boundaries between the cultureâ€™s unshakable Confucian values and group orientation, and the ever-shifting trends in individual consumerism that China is embracing.
M38|On the price elasticity of demand for trademarks|This paper provides econometric estimates of the fee elasticity of demand for international trademarks. The analysis focuses on monthly trademark applications submitted to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). The elasticity ranges from -0.31 to -0.42, which is in a similar range to the fee elasticity of demand for patents.
M38|Deconstructing Financial Services Advertising in the Run Up to the Great Recession: The Case of the Live Richly Campaign|The paper uses critical theory to analyze the impact of financial services advertising on consumer behavior in the run up to the Great Recession. One influential advertising campaign, the Citibank Live Richly campaign, is examined as an important situational variable, setting the context for poor consumer decision-making regarding financial services and consumer debt-related products. Critical realism is offered up as a promising methodology to examine the broader institutional and regulatory framework surrounding financial services advertising.

M38|Relations, Assessment Methods and Development Strategies in Travel Industry|"The main goal of this paper is to analyse the tourism development strategy, which is the art of selecting and optimizing resources and means that any travel company may have at its disposal, in order to achieve one or more progress objectives, imposing the location, timing and the conditions of the ""competitive struggle"" to its competition. The research methodology consists of an inventory and analysis of assessment methods, as well as of the identification of strategy types (market penetration, retention and loyalty) of the travel industry, all being meant to support tourism and the success of the companies operating in this field. In principle, these methods and strategies are designed to offer alleged advantages, fully observing the quality standards of tourism products. This connection is not always real, but the preference for these strategies is prevalent among American managers, as well as the European ones. The research should result in identifying certain strategies in the travel industry; likewise, it considers that any individual working in this field should know when and how to apply them in order to bring profits to the tourist organisation he belongs to."
M38|Strategic and Operational Challenges for Tourist Air Transport|The main objective of this paper is to identify the strategic and operational challenges that will face air transport by 2030. The authors noted that in tourism, air transport is of great importance for the business, because it provides the movement of the tourist from the place of residence to the chosen destination. Methodology and assumptions were based on information, indicators, processed by the relevant international organisations. Correction factors were determined based on some assumptions: the importance of that activity to achieve tourist consumption; the recommendations of international organisations (WTO, EUROSTAT) on the role of each activity in the development of the tourism phenomenon; the results of various surveys conducted in time. The research results can have a degree of approximation, but the authors’ analysis pursues achieving a first attempt to quantify the transport activities in tourism and the role of the latter in the national economy. The results obtained by the authors will be furthered by research and analyses to be performed for each and every component of air transport, independently or within macroeconomic strategies.

M38|Voluntary environmental and organic standards in agriculture: Policy implications|While public regulation in food and agriculture is attracting attention at both policy and research level for their potential implications on international food trade, policy implications of agricultural standards – understood to be legally not mandatory and hence voluntary – are much less well understood. Yet, environmental and organic standards have grown in importance in agriculture and agri-food chains, making also their potential trade effects more relevant. In this context, understanding the linkages between governments and standards has become a key element in the debate. This report analyses possible roles of public authorities in the area of environmental and organic standards, including policy objectives, options for interaction and means for the use of standards for achieving public policy goals. It identifies the main objectives behind government activity on environmental and organic standards in the area of consumer protection and fraud prevention, the enabling of functioning food markets and the improvement of efficiency in the design, implementation and monitoring of public policies. Countries have taken very different approaches towards dealing with standards on organic agriculture which frequently, though not always, are seen as a subset of environment-related standards. Choices for organic standards range between market self-regulation and the development of government-owned public standards. More generally, the level of public intervention often reflects OECD governments’ perception on the environmental benefits of organic agriculture itself.
M38|Green packaging from a company’s perspective: Determining factors for packaging solutions in the German fruit juice industry|In Germany, extensive legislation aims at getting companies to engage in eco-friendly packaging. A common packaging challenge centers on fruit juice products the packaging of which ranges from carton container, to glass or plastic bottles. This study examined the prevalence of Green Packaging in the Baden-Württemberg fruit juice industry. Expert interviews reveal that these companies make packaging decisions based on bottling volume and financial resources and not on Green Packaging concerns. Concerns about product quality, packaging functionality and convenience prevail because the market values these factors above all. This means Green Packaging will be implemented only when eco-friendly packaging becomes a ‘must-have’ product feature. The study also revealed that the retail channels used by these companies push back against returnable bottles because of their handling costs. Interviewees also expressed their opinion that consumers’ demand for Green Packaging does not suffice to drive change in existing practices. Our recommendation is that smaller companies focus their packaging decisions on existing returnable glass bottles thereby both minimizing change over costs and maximizing green marketing potential. For larger companies it is possible to take on a pioneer role in the field of Green Packaging.
M38|Dynamic Support of Government in Online Shopping|Advancements in online shopping for consumers requires consistent government support policies and the introduction of substantial government laws and regulations. In order to establish innovative developments in online shopping market environment that makes online shopping faster and stable, the government perspective is vital with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for research and development in online shopping behavior for consumer’s confidence and their purchase intention. The proposed conceptual framework in the study establish that governments’ supports positively impact on perceived ease of online shopping, and positively influence consumer’s online shopping intentions. In addition, the study results are consistent to the empirical researches that focus on perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness that will affect consumer online shopping behavior.
M38|Global Tourism and Implications for the Czech Republic|Tourism is characterized by constant spatial expansion and diversification. It is one of the fastest growing global economic sectors. Local economic fluctuations undoubtedly have a significant influence on the development of tourism. The aim of this study is to highlight the crucial importance particularly of stimulating and realisation presumptions, which greatly influence the demand for tourist activities on a global scale in recent years with implications for the Czech Republic. The theoretical base of the paper consists of an overview of concepts of market performance, and multi-criteria competitiveness of tourism destinations is introduced here. The analytical part of the study examines major shifts in the distribution of tourism on a global scale and the impact of changing assumptions of development and determinants, such as information technology, transport, political factors, environmental factors, demographic factors and the degree of urbanisation, travel security, as well as a whole range of social and economic impacts. A special emphasis is devoted to the consistence of the tourism industry with economic fluctuations and recessions. Global trends are then applied to the tourism sector in the Czech Republic.
M38|Top Level Results of a Study of Czech Households´ Awareness of the Food Advertising Industry’s Self-Regulation Related to Children|This paper is primarily focused on analyses of the research undertaken to understand the awareness of food advertising’s self-regulation authority (Council for Advertising) and of the Czech Code of Conduct in the context of the growing issue of child obesity. The objective is to find out the perception of food advertising to children and awareness of regulation and industry self-regulation amongst Czech mothers. Our theoretical framework presumes dependence between the awareness levels and selected demographic variables. We conclude several actions to overcome low awareness of the Council of Advertising and its Code of Conduct and to transfer the industry’s self-regulation into an efficient and recognized tool of shaping the culture of responsible advertising in the Czech Republic. The conclusions lead towards stronger protection of children.

M38|Tax Policy Response to Market Changes: The Case of the Gaming Services Sector. - L’adeguamento della politica fiscale ai cambiamenti di mercato: il caso del settore del gioco pubblico|ABSTRACT Beginning with the 1990’s, the gaming services sector has undergone several changes that have induced governments to review gambling taxes. We examine the economic rationale behind actual and prospected reforms, analysing the effects of gambling taxes on profits and extending existing industrial organisation results on the effects of cost changes in oligopolistic industries to different types of taxation instruments. - I cambiamenti che hanno interessato il settore del gioco pubblico in Italia nell’entità e nella struttura della spesa dei giocatori hanno indotto i governi a ripensare profondamente la modalità di imposizione. Questo articolo prende in esame le motivazioni economiche alla base degli interventi riformatori, estendendo alcuni risultati tipici dell’organizzazione industriale relativi agli effetti dei cambiamenti nei costi di produzione di industrie oligopolistiche alle diverse regole di tassazione.
M38|Relationship Marketing By Energy Companies|New two hour schedule tariffs were introduced on 1st July 2010 by AEEG. They distinguish use of electric energy between night and daylight hours and Sundays and public holidays, creating three different price bands (F1, F2, F3), thus eliminating one hour schedule tariff for the vulnerable customers. This study is proposed to understand the basic research problem “How much Italian energy companies have implemented relationship marketing and what are the characteristics of their marketing policies”. We suggest this approach increases competition which is the aim of liberalization processes. In fact, according to the principle of the “conservation of relationship energy”, an Uppsala model, relationship energy cannot be destroyed and it can only be transformed and transferred to other relationships, manifesting itself in a variety of ways. So if relationship marketing is better implemented switching increases but trade relationships can be reactivated at a later time by social links which continue during the time. To answer that question we compare the data of three recent researches that analyze switching energy supplier in Italy, the UK and State of Victoria in Australia.
M38|Impact of Corporate Social Responsibility on OTC Medicines Consumers|In the article is presented the case of trust-based marketing of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. The relationship between the hypotheses was tested by means of structural equation modelling. The results of the first model show that the predictor variable (consumer satisfaction with safety and information) has a significant effect on the mediator variable (consumer trust). The results of the second model show that the consumer trust also has a significant effect on virtual brand loyalty (dependent variable). Model 3 was developed by including consumer perception of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and consumer trust as independent predictor variables and virtual brand loyalty as the mediator variable with the specific intention to determine whether the effects of consumer perception of CSR on virtual brand loyalty became insignificant or less significant. The results of Model 3 show a partial mediator effect of consumer trust regarding the relationship between consumer perception of CSR and virtual brand loyalty.

M38|Cluster – Structural Tool To Support Business|The opportunities to access grants have led to institutionalisation of cooperation between partners in a relationship of business in a geographical area organized as a cluster or pole of competitiveness, being a prerequisite to obtain the financing of activities by European programs. In EU view, the cluster is an ”engine” of economic growth and innovation, and represents an appropriate framework for business development through cooperation between companies, universities, research, training, suppliers, customers and competitors located in an area geographical, which creates competitive advantage. The study approach is the cluster as a tool to support the Romanian businesses with financing from structural instruments and highlights the strategic importance for the economic and social progress.

M38|Fundamental Aspects Of Communication Management, In The Case Of Public Administration|Efficient communication is one the most important instruments used for the purpose of generating change inside and outside an organization. It can contribute to adjusting attitudes and the manner of approaching the present and future challenges and to changing behavioral patterns. The mission and the objectives of organizational communication are highly interrelated with organizational change and environment characteristics, in which the organization functions. The communication performed by the public administration institution outside is an institutional communication, extra-organizational, which presents the following purposes: strengthening its image, stimulating an environment of trust and affinity from the citizens (Kotler & Lee, 2007). We are of opinion that the management of communication performed by a public administration institution features three fundamental aspects, relevant for institutional communicators when designing and managing the institutional communication: communication efficiency, communication process and the implications of the new information and communication technologies (ICT) for this process.
M38|Public Relations In Public Administration: Role And Management, In A Socio-Political Marketing Context|Many agree that PR and marketing are at their best when used together, when it comes to local public administration institutions there is the need for both an individual and symbiotic approach of the two. Taking into consideration that public interest organizations act within public space, PR represents a public communication strategy. Thus they present the role of generating a climate and state of social normality and, especially in democratic societies, PR plays the part of generator of communication flows between public institutions, citizens and stakeholders. In a social-political marketing context, envisaged as an aggregate of processes, with a multiple purpose, the generator which is PR must unfold coherently for each of the processes. It is our purpose in this paper to depict the PR role and management in the case of one local public administration institution (Bacau Prefect Institution), in a socio-political marketing context.
M38|The Impact Of The Legislative Environment On The European Parliamentary Elections In Romania|The accession of Romania to the European Union on the 1st of January, 2007, after the Accession Treaty, signed on the 25th of April, 2005, was ratified by all the Member States of the Union, led to changes in the legislative environment governing the electoral market. Our country organized in May 2014, for the third time, elections for the European Parliament. The election system practiced in Romania does not provide incentives for candidates to develop a competitive election bid, explained in detail to the electorate, so the performance during the mandate can be assessed. The Romanian representatives in the European Parliament are elected under a system of closed national list vote, which reduces the power of voters to distinguish the candidates in the vote. At the European Union level, there is not a unique voting system adopted, in the context that most Member States practice competitive electoral systems, in which candidates have the opportunity to differentiate themselves by an electoral offer.

M38|L’Influence Du Brand Politique Sur Le Comportement De L’Electeur : Une Theorisation Du Comportement Du Consommateur|In this article we speak about the application of marketing in the field of politics. We want to analyse the transposition of customer's behaviour in politics and the transposition of the influence of the brand on customer's behaviour as well as the influence of the brand on elector's behaviour. As method, we have chosen the abductive approach: the deduction approach at the beginning in order to see the parallel between the customer and the elector and then the induction approach (examples from politics). In this study we used direct documentation on the reality, the observation and the bibliography. We want to show, through in examples, the implication of the perceptions, attitudes, emotions and electors' satisfaction within choosing a candidate.
M38|Beneficios y perjuicios de la estrategia de imitación|Este artículo analiza la estrategia de imitación resaltando sus potenciales beneficios y perjuicios. Utilizando una metodología exploratoria, se usan 15 casos en los que se argumenta competencia desleal por imitación. La discusión ofrece un paralelo entre las razones que tiene una empresa para imitar y para no hacerlo. Se concluye que la imitación es una estrategia viable siempre que la marca se reconozca como atributo distintivo, al tiempo que las marcas seguidoras ganan participación de mercado y comunican atributos acordes a la categoría. Por el contrario, si la imitación afecta negativamente el esfuerzo de una marca por ser distintiva, vulnera la decisión del consumidor al generar confusión y desmotiva el esfuerzo empresarial por la innovación.
M38|Targeted advertising, platform competition, and privacy|Targeted advertising can benefit consumers through lower prices for access to websites. Yet, if consumers dislike that websites collect their personal information, their welfare may go down. We study competition for consumers between websites that can show targeted advertisements. We find that more targeting increases competition and reduces the websites' profits, but yet in equilibrium websites choose maximum targeting as they cannot credibly commit to low targeting. A privacy protection policy can be beneficial for both consumers and websites. If consumers are heterogeneous in their concerns for privacy, a policy that allows choice between two levels of privacy will be better. Optimal privacy protection takes into account that the more intense competition on the high-targeting market segment also benefits consumers on the less competitive segment. Consumer surplus is maximized by allowing them a choice between a high targeting regime and a low targeting regime which affords more privacy.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
M38|Rethinking Nudges|Nudge is a semantically multifarious concept that originates in Thaler and Sunstein's (2008) popular eponymous book. In one of its senses, it is a policy for redirecting an agent's choices by only slightly altering his choice conditions, in another sense, it is concerned with bounded rationality as a means of the policy, and in still another sense, it is concerned with bounded rationality as an obstacle to be removed by the policy, when the latter has a benevolent aim. The paper centres on the interrelations, both semantic and factual, of these three nudge concepts. It argues that the first and second are basically disconnected on Thaler and Sunstein's major examples of nudges, and that this has gone unnoticed to them because they wrongly equate the second with the third concept, and also because they overestimate the explanatory power of behavioural economics, compared with that of classical rational choice theory, to account for successful interventions. After completing this analysis, the paper moves to some of the normative issues raised by Thaler and Sunstein. Their thought-provoking claim that liberalism and paternalism can be reconciled within one and the same doctrine of social ethics - libertarian paternalism – has been subjected to thorough philosophical criticism. Rather than following this abstract line, the paper takes the shortcut of arguing that Thaler and Sunstein lose their best defence of libertarian paternalism after the nudge concepts are disentangled. They had effectively based their case on the view that slight interventions could have powerful effects through a clever use of bounded rationality, and it has been shown that the latter is not really at work in the interventions they consider. The paper finally concludes that the three nudge concepts are worth pursuing, though independently of each other, and in particular that the third one, which involves correcting the pitfalls of bounded rationality, should receive sustained attention from policy analysts
M38|Should jet fuel surcharges be regulated, and if so, how?|By adding fuel surcharges to base fares, airlines pass on the impact of higher jet fuel prices to consumers. Given the wide range of design options for fuel surcharge schemes, the reduced price transparency and the question of fair cost recovery, fuel surcharges have become a consumer protection issue. The paper reviews the regulatory approach to fuel surcharges in Brazil, the European Union, Japan and the United States. Further, it addresses the complexity of attempts to construct fuel surcharge schemes that rely on estimates of per-passenger fuel costs. The paper concludes that regulatory activities should aim to include fuel surcharges in all initial fare quotes and advertising. Enforcing fuel surcharge schemes that ensure a fair cost recovery would result in high regulatory costs and would also be in conflict with deregulation policies of removing restrictions on airline pricing.
M38|Creating Value in Ecosystems: Crossing the chasm between knowledge and business ecosystems|Policy makers take initiatives to stimulate knowledge ecosystems in technology hotspots. It is implicitly assumed that these ecosystems will lead to value networks through which the participating companies can realise a competitive advantage. Value networks refer to business ecosystems where the value proposition is offered by a group of companies which are mutually complementary. The strategy literature suggests that business ecosystems lead to competitive advantages for each of the partners in the ecosystem. Based on a unique hand-collected database of 138 innovative start-ups in the region of Flanders, we analyse the knowledge and business ecosystem and the financial support network. We find that the knowledge ecosystem is well structured and concentrated around a number of central actors while the business ecosystem is almost non-existent at the local level. Further, we find that the financial support network is almost 100% publicly backed and fails to bridge the knowledge and business ecosystem. The implications for policy makers who tend to focus on the development of local ecosystems are discussed.
M38|Implementation of Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior on the Adoption of E-Filling Systems Taxation Policy in Indonesia|The increased in internet and telecommunication usage has become the reason for the adopting of e-filling systems for annual tax report or SPT (based on Indonesian Taxation Authority Decree Number Kep.88/PJ/2004 on 14th May 2004 about electronic based annual tax report). On the contrary, this development does not show in the usage of the e-filling systems. This condition is the reason for this study to investigate the implementation of e-filling systems taxation policy by using decomposition theory of planned behavior. This theory is used to understand and test the influenced factors in the usage of electronic based annual tax report (e-filling) and the persistent of e-filling system in Indonesia. Population in this study is the Indonesian citizen’s tax payers who have got tax registration number (NPWP) both who have or have not used e-filling to report the annual tax return in Surabaya area, East Java-Indonesia. Sample is taken using a non-probability sampling, with convienient sampling method. Analytical technique used in this observation is Structural Equation Method (SEM). The results showed that e-filling user’s attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavior control influence the users’ intention to use e-filling systems. These results indicated that Indonesian citizens’ intention to use the e-filling facilities to report their annual tax income is depend upon their attitudes and controls on the systems. Even if Indonesian tax payers realized that with e-filling systems they will be able to increase the effectiveness, more optimize services, hasten and improved efficiency in annual tax reporting, the taxpayer does not completely understand about how to operate the e-filling system. Therefore, it is imperative for the government to socialize and educate them on the importance of e-filling systems.
M38|Rethinking Nudges|Nudge is a semantically multifarious concept that originates in Thaler and Sunstein's (2008) popular eponymous book. In one of its senses, it is a policy for redirecting an agent's choices by only slightly altering his choice conditions, in another sense, it is concerned with bounded rationality as a means of the policy, and in still another sense, it is concerned with bounded rationality as an obstacle to be removed by the policy, when the latter has a benevolent aim. The paper centres on the interrelations, both semantic and factual, of these three nudge concepts.

M38|Efficiency of Research and Innovation Systems for Economic Growth and Employment|The concept of a holistic innovation policy is defined in this paper, and it is discussed what it is, why it is relevant and how it can be implemented. One of the main conclusions is that the innovation policies in European countries are still linear (and not holistic), in spite of the fact that the linear view has been completely abandoned by innovation researchers – and replaced by a systemic view on innovation processes. Why innovation policy is still linear is also discussed. Further it is noted that a considerable number of EU Member States have created public organizations (Councils) for innovation and/or research policy placed above ministries and usually chaired by the Prime Minister. The role and character of these bodies is discussed. The empirical results are based on a questionnaire sent to 23 EU Member States, out of which 19 (83%) responded. The work with this report was carried out for the European Research and Innovation Area Committee (ERAC) of the European Commission (DG RTD).
M38|Innovation Policy for Knowledge Production and R&D: the Investment Portfolio Approach|Who produces scientific and technical knowledge these days? What type of knowledge is being produced and for what purposes? Why are firms and governments funding research and development? This chapter studies the role of knowledge production (especially R&D activities) in the innovation process from an innovation system perspective. It examines how governments and public agencies in different countries and at different times have actually approached the issue of building, maintaining and using knowledge production in their innovation systems. It also examines the critical and most important issues at stake from the point of view of innovation policy, looking in particular at the unresolved tensions and systemic unbalances related to knowledge production and last but not least, it elaborates a set of overall criteria for the selection and design of relevant policy instruments and addresses those tensions and unbalances. This chapter suggests that innovation policy develops a portfolio approach to the public investment in R&D and knowledge production.
M38|Striving Towards a Holistic Innovation Policy in European Countries - But Linearity Still Prevails!|The concept of a holistic innovation policy is defined in this article, with discussions of what it is, why it is relevant, and how it can be implemented to enhance product innovation. It is shown that the innovation systems approach has diffused rapidly during the latest decades and has completely replaced the linear view in the field of innovation research. The majority of European countries are striving in the direction of developing a more holistic innovation policy. However, it is concluded that the innovation policies in European countries are still dominantly linear despite the fact that holistic policy seems to be the driving vision. Innovation policy is behindhand. Why innovation policy is still linear is also preliminarily discussed. Policymakers attending conferences on innovation are practically always in favor of holistic (systemic, broad-based, comprehensive, etc) innovation policies, have abandoned the linear view by learning from innovation research. The division between “linear” and “holistic” seems to be located within the community where innovation policies are designed and implemented, a community composed of policymakers (administrators/bureaucrats) and elected politicians. Perhaps the dividing line is between these two groups in that politicians, who actually make the decisions, may still reflexively believe in the linear view. Nevertheless, there seems to be a failure in communication between researchers and politicians in the field of innovation and there is therefore a strong need to involve innovation researchers in policy design and implementation to a much higher degree. Another way to increase the degree of holism could be to separate innovation policy from research policy, since their integration tends to cement the linear character of innovation policy. The empirical results are based on a questionnaire sent to twenty-three EU Member States, out of which nineteen (83%) responded. Part of the work for this article was carried out for the European Research and Innovation Area Committee (ERAC) of the European Commission (DG RTD).
M38|Institutions and Regulations in Innovation Systems: Effects, Problems and Innovation Policy Design|Institutions (including regulations) are constitutive elements of innovation systems, and therefore cornerstones of innovation policy. Focusing on (soft and hard) regulation, the paper identifies the most salient regulatory areas from the perspective of the innovation system. When asking about the effects of regulation on innovation, the paper argues that there are three key issues that need careful empirical analysis; namely, whether regulation is effective and efficient in terms of reducing uncertainty and generating incentives, whether it is able to generate ultimately wider social benefits for the innovativeness of the society at large; and the extent to which regulation is adapting to new (social, economic and technological) contexts and is socially legitimate and accepted. These are potentially the three problems that innovation policy needs to address in this area. This provides guidance for the design and re-design of innovation policy, so that policy makers may analyse empirically the social dynamics actually generated by regulation rather than simply assuming deductively their effects.

M38|Business Ethics in Financial Sector: Case of Romania|In this paper we intend to bring to readers' attention the need for financial education and best practices in the financial sector, their forms of expression and final implications on consumers’ satisfaction of financial products and services with a special focus on the Romanian space. In order to assess the level of business ethics in Romania we analyzed the number of complaints and litigation in financial sector in Romania during the period 2009-2013, making comparisons by time, space and types of banks providing the service. Thus, we used the information provided by the National Consumer Protection Authority (NCPA) and Romanian Ministry of Justice. Our study’s results highlight the continuous concerns of Romanian financial institutions to adopt the best practices in relation to consumer, compared to the European average. However, the percentage of complaints regarding the financial products and services from the total and the number of litigation on the issue of the banks’ abusive clauses is alarming. In this regard we note the active involvement of NCPA in protecting consumers’ rights of financial products and services, including the amendment of the Law No.193/2000 on unfair terms in contracts concluded between professionals and consumers, which has brought since 1st of February 2014 extra financial protection for consumers.
M38|Relationship Between Mobile Number Portability And Consumer Choice Of Active Multiple Mobile Phone Numbers In Ghana|The use of multiple mobile phone numbers in Ghana has become a dominate phenomenon in recent years. The introduction of mobile number portability (MNP) makes it possible for a subscriber to conveniently switch from one mobile network to another without losing his or her number. Because of mobile number portability, we expected that use of multiple numbers would become less attractive. This study examines how mobile number portability has affected the use of multiple phone numbers. We use top, middle and lower level managers of both private and public formal sectors of the economy for examination. Thousands of multiple mobile phone number subscribers were surveyed from Accra where all the mobile networks operate and porting is well known. This study uses the mean and standard deviation to measure the relationship between mobile number portability and multiple phone number use. The study revealed low customer appreciation for mobile number portability, and customersâ€™ negative perception of service quality since introduction of mobile number portability. The article further showed weak or no relationship between number portability and use of multiple mobile numbers. Further, we show the introduction of number portability cannot be a panacea to the use of multiple phone lines even in the near future.
M38|Privacy Concern in Western Balkan Countries: Developing a Typology of Citizens|This study examines which segments of population with similar attitudes towards privacy, data protection and surveillance exist in selected Western Balkan countries, and whether they can be differentiated by demographic characteristics and by country of residence. The data collected by survey were analyzed using factor analysis, k-means cluster analysis and chi-square test. The findings indicate that there are three groups of citizens with similar attitudes in selected Western Balkan countries: (1) pro-surveillance oriented citizens, (2) citizens concerned about being surveilled, and (3) citizens opting for better data protection. The identified groups of citizens differ in age, education, employment and country of residence. The results provide insights on how individuals form their attitudes on contemporary privacy, data protection and surveillance issues.
M38|Statistical detection of fraud in the reporting of Croatian public companies|Statistical methods based on Benfordâ€™s distribution, Z- and I‡2-statistics are being successfully applied to detect likely accounting and reporting fraud, for example in the daily usage of the Internal Revenue Service in the USA, and in historical analysis of Greek macroeconomic reporting. We adapt and apply the methodology to the analysis of the reporting of some leading Croatian public companies. We find indications of reporting fraud in several of the companies analyzed. In particular we find correlation between the likelihood of reporting fraud, measured as a deviation from Benfordâ€™s law, and reported net income losses, for companies large enough (with a revenue of at least 1 billion kuna). Finally, we suggest application of the methodology to improve the internal processes, efficiency and effectiveness of the State Auditing Office.Data availability: The data used in the study are corporate data in the public domain. For legal reasons, however, the identities of the companies are disguised. Contact the first author for the sanitized data sets that can be used to verify and replicate the analysis.
M38|The influence of FDA advisory information and black box warnings on individual use of prescription antidepressants|We examine how use of antidepressant medications is influenced by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warnings about the increased risk of suicidality associated with pediatric antidepressant use. With individual-level data on antidepressant use from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we consider whether consumer responses to FDA warnings differ among targeted (children) and non-targeted (adult) age-groups. Because the warning labels specifically mentioned new users, we examine separately the effects of the warnings on initiations of antidepressant therapy and on continued use of antidepressants. We find evidence consistent with reduced initiation of antidepressant use among the intended population of children, and that usage among children with more highly educated parents responded earlier to FDA information. However, we also find spillover effects of reduced initiation among the non-targeted population of adults. Overall, our results indicate that the FDA warning may have led consumers to perceive risks beyond those specifically mentioned. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2014
M38|New Instruments Of Economic Policy: Political Lobbying|The article deals with role of political lobbying as an instrument of economic policy. It describes the ways for studying the lobbying and the problem of its regulation. Moreover, the author gives examples of lobbying in Russia, analyses the necessity of lobbying legalisation for more effective implementation of economic policy.
M38|Advertising and Environmental Stewardship: Evidence from the BP Oil Spill|This paper explores whether private markets can incentivize environmental stewardship. We examine the consumer response to the 2010 BP oil spill and test how BP's investment in the 2000-2008 “Beyond Petroleum” green advertising campaign affected this response. We find evidence consistent with consumer punishment: BP station margins and volumes declined by 2.9 cents per gallon and 4.2 percent, respectively, in the month after the spill. However, pre-spill advertising significantly dampened the price response, and may have reduced brand switching by BP stations. These results indicate that firms may have incentives to engage in green advertising without investments in environmental stewardship.
M38|Dark Tourism, Romania And Dracula. The Perceptions Of Potential American Tourists|"From a touristic point of view, Romania is a country with an extraordinary potential. In terms of consumers of touristic products, the United States of America (USA) is a country with a tremendous potential. If analysing the actual tendencies in the film industry and a part of mass-media in the last years, it is possible to identify the interests of movie fans, but also of a certain market segment with its own characteristics, for vampires. Moreover, people have always shown a high interest in the mystic or dark aspects of life, namely related to death. Which could be the connection between these elements? The answer seems simple: Dracula. Transylvania is known as the land of vampires or, better said, the birthplace of Dracula, the most popular vampire of all times, and this reputation can be a touristic opportunity possible to exploit in the current trend on the USA market, the land with the most successful screen adaption of the vampire legend. The current paper presents the results of an empiric research, which aims to identity the degree of interest shown by Americans for a touristic product specific to ""dark tourism"" build around Dracula's myth. The study was conducted on a sample of 254 respondents from the U.S.A, using as data collection means the questionnaire. Results have shown that over 70% of the persons interviewed agree that Romania is the land of vampires and the home of Dracula. Almost the same percentage considers attractive or very attractive a holiday in Romania for exploring the local myths and legends, visiting the land of vampires, respectively Dracula's house. The current study offers a valuable perspective on the way in which dark tourism is perceived, on Romania and on a thematic tourism product build around the myth of Dracula. An important contribution to the research is brought by the main characteristics of such a package tour, from the American consumers' point of view, information that could be used by almost any operator or tourism organization on the local or American market."
M38|Contemporary Monopolies In The Polish Economy – The Case Study Of Pwpw|The paper presents the role of PWPW, as a company with some attributes of a natural monopoly, in contemporary Polish economy. It shows that commercial companies – performing special tasks which are necessary for the functioning of state and which concern identification as well as transactional security and at the same time take advantages of the economy of scale and range as a condition of their presence and development – have a logically justified place in the econ-omy. They are a source of benefits for shareholders in the form of taxes, dividends and other economic benefits, as well as the value of the company itself. Moreover, they are creators of domestic employment and they enrich the national potential of technology. Also, such firms provide a right level of identification and transac-tional security, which influences the stability and reliability of legal and econom-ic relations.
M38|Motivations for gambling and the choice between skill and luck gambling products: an exploratory study|We analyze differences in gambling motivations for skill and luck gamblers on the basis of a questionnaire distributed to a sample of university students. We find that the probability of playing skill rather than luck games is positively correlated to being a male, to the socialization motive and to having a planning attitude, that we use to define the kind of amusement experienced in gambling, while it is negatively correlated to the money motive, the perceived risk of losing social esteem, and age. Results are then applied to marketing strategies and public policies, with particular attention to the online environment.

So Intellectual capital becomes the new basis and the most modern production’s factor which regard it as the essential resource to the erection of fortune even more important than the traditional factor of production such as : work, capital and raw materials. Intellectual capital plays important role to support sustained competitive advantage and developing SME`S in Arab countries.
M38|Effectiveness of the advertising targeted to children regulation and self-regulation with focus on food industry|The article deals with the effectiveness of current regulation and self-regulation of food advertising targeted to children. The objective of the article is to examine the degree of functionality and effi ciency of the current status to ensure meaningful regulation on food advertising aimed at children in the Czech Republic as one of the possible causes of rising obesity and overweight. To better understand the relations between all the institutions involved in regulatory and self-regulatory process in the Czech Republic, we have developed model of these relations. We also studied the impact of European institutions that infl uence the Czech model. In conclusion, we propose changes that could in the short term contribute to the effectiveness of the current system.
M38|Food Industry Approach to Rising Prevalence of Children Obesity in the Czech Republic|This paper explores the approach of the food industry towards the issue of rising children obesity in the context of the external regulatory environment and industry self-regulation. It presents the roles and positions of the industry associations, self-regulation and industry representatives through a case study of best practices in applying self-regulation rules. It proves that companies, acting in accordance with the long-term strategy of social responsibility, approach the self-regulation respectfully, because its absence would be a cause for development and implementation of stricter legislation over the long run.

M38|Are commercial ceilings appropriate for the regulation of commercial overload on free-to-air TV channels?|Commercial ceilings not only restrict broadcasters in their decisions about commercial broadcasting time, but also affect their differentiation of program content. This study examines the welfare effects of commercial ceilings in a two-sided free-to-air TV market, taking into account welfare with respect to content differentiation. We identify a second-best commercial ceiling that maximizes welfare in the absence of enforceable program content regulation and identify the situations in which laissez faire is optimal. The deregulation of commercial broadcasting can improve welfare, even if the laissez-faire level of commercial broadcasting time is excessive.
M38|A Friendly Turn: Advertising Bias in the News Media|This paper investigates whether newspapers report more favorably about advertising corporate clients than about other firms. Our identification strategy based on high-dimensional fixed effects and high frequency advertising data shows that advertising leads to more positive press coverage. This advertising bias in reporting is found among local and national newspapers. Further results show that advertising bias manifests particularly in less negative reporting after bad news events such as negative earnings surprises or extremely negative stock returns. Our findings cast doubt on the independence of the press from corporate pressure and hint at important information frictions.
M38|Technological Migration: The Case of Thai Digital Terrestrial Television|This study analyses the business strategies of entrepreneurs during a technological transition. The particular technological transition is the switch from analogue to digital TV in Thailand. The estimated net present values of the broadcasting operators’ net profit over a 15-year license period indicate that a long transition period reduces the benefit from upgrading to a better technology. The incumbents would like to join the technological migration from day one. The faster the transition process, the higher the new platform is worth in present value. The government should terminate the old platform as soon as possible and stimulate a rapid transition.
M38|Some hypotheses regarding the mobile telecommunications services marketing and consumers rights from Romania|The current research analysis consumers’ rights concerning personal data processing and confidentiality protection within the public communications sector as they are stated in the 2002/58/CE Directive of the European Parliament and Council from 12th of July 2002. The study objectives are: the way that users/ subscribers get informed about their rights in the field of mobile telephony services; the way that mobile telephony services operators inform their users/ subscribers about the subscription included services; the way that mobile telephony services operators inform their uses/ subscribers about the supplementary services that can be demanded; the rights regarding the personal data processing and confidentiality protection that mobile telephony services consumers agree with; the users/subscribers rights most frequently broken. The marketing research used a questionnaire based survey during January - March 2013 on a sample of 85 users/ subscribers from Romania. It has a preliminary character, shaping a further investigation activity with a higher thematic coverage and a smaller error under the limit of 5%. The data gathering method was a questionnaire based interview. Data were analyzed using the SPSS informatics program, version 16.0 for Windows. The following statistical functions were used for validating/invalidating the hypotheses: descriptive statistics, factor analysis and correlation function.
M38|Food Safety Concerns and other Factors Affecting Iran's Pistachio Exports to EU, Australia, and Japan|In this paper, the impact of food safety concerns on Iran's pistachio export demand was investigated. Panel data and panel cointegration analyses were used to estimate the export demand function of Iran's pistachio nuts to the European Union (EU), Japan, and Australia for the period of 1997 to 2006 so that the relationship between factors affecting Iran's pistachio exports can be examined. The results show the existence of long-run relationships among the variables that have a significant impact on Iran's pistachio exports. The empirical results indicate that food safety shocks had a statistically significant negative impact on the import demand of those countries.

M38|Southeast asian regionalism: theoretical systemic obligingness in disarray|The Association of Southeast Asian Nations - ASEAN was born in 1967, in the breastplate of the strategic comotions of the Cold War. Originally, there were five founding members: Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and Philippines.Vietnam joined the ranks in 1995, after the ultimate reverberations of the Last Indochin War. In 1997, Laos nd Myanmar followed Vietnam. In 1999, Cambodia decided to make its partaking in ASEAN a fact, especially after its political domestic situation received much needed handling. As important as these guidebooks are, they are involved in the scope of this article only secondarily. Thi article reports the fact that the meekness of three important theoretical anchors – the security complex theory, the security regime theory, the collective security theory, the community security theory and ASEANology– instaurations utilized to explain ASEAN`s birth and predict its development, are tailored in half-abidince. Ever since its derivation, ASEAN became able-bodied to furnish one of the most successful forms of regionalism, after the global high-ranking position of European Regionalism. Southeast Asian New Security Regionalism has plenty of theoretical orthodoxies to apply or to commence applying. The aftermath of their empirical workings can sometimes be unconfident of the very ideas it implemented. The approach of this article is to review some of the major theoretical conceptual contributions utilized to describe findings about Southeast Asian New Security Regionalism’s connotations. While supporting the idea that neither one of the research programs mentioned is grounded enough in Southeast Asian security dynamics, the last part of the article claims that a rediscovery of Southeast Asian Regionalism, under the New Regionalism framework, is very likely to underplay its distinctiveness.
M38|Indonesia now. Between Pancasila and crisis of democracy in Indonesia|Normally in politics will be colored by political activities such as lobbying, transactional politics, money politics, and the most risky trend is likely more rampant corruption because the party trying to increase purse from a variety of sources. The political year 2013 called for Indonesia to meet the 2014 election in which all political parties who passed the verification will prepare themselves for the competition and contestation for legislative elections that will be held April 2014. The year 2013 was marked by increasing political climate warming caused by not building trust or mutual trust among the parties. Moreover, the pattern of relations between civil society and political parties are also less communicative. Political flare-up in 2013 was also driven by competition parties in preparing to compete in a presidential candidate. Unlike the presidential election 2009, election 2014 not only brings parties and vice presidential candidates, civil society leaders will also deliver an alternative candidate for the party. Civil society demands increasingly shrill make political climate gets hotter. The battle between political parties in convincing the public is not about easy. Meanwhile, fears of losing the election not rule parties would justify all the all the way to win. As an open ideology, Pancasila should provide orientation to the future which requires the Indonesian people to always be aware of the lives that are being and will face, especially the era of globalization and democracy. Pancasila ideology calls for the Indonesian people still survive in the soul and culture of Indonesia and within the bounds of the State unitary Republic of Indonesia. And now, the values of Pancasila must constantly be revitalized, to prevent them from becoming obsolete, and at all times be relevant and able to solve issues concerning the nation and State, toward the attainment of a better future, which is a common future. This common future is the future of all ethnic groups, of all ethnic classes and religions, the future of all of us that have determined to be united in an Archipelagic State which is multiethnic, multiracial, and although possessing a large number of disintegrating factors, are strongly bonded in unity, with, by and because of Pancasila. Indonesia’s own version of a secular-oriented ideology is “Pancasila” (designed by the nation’s first president, Soekarno) since independence, Pancasila has been a sore point for the diversity, who seek at the very least some form of constitutional requirement for the state to enforce democracy
M38|Quality culture in romanian public administration|The idea of quality applied in public administration can sometimes seem utopian. However, it is not utopian, given that citizens are taxpayers and as such are entitled to impeccable service. Therefore, I consider it necessary to implement a real culture of quality in public administration, in order to ensure good quality services for citizens and achieve their interests, on one hand. On the other hand, the culture of quality is mandatory for serving the national public interest.

M38|Regionalism and its shelters. The probes of the cold war era and the post cold war era|Nowadays, the world`s stares of wonderment revolve around how successful regional actors have become in channeling the regional organizations they created in envisioning a set of prescriptions for a law-abiding regional conduct. Many of the regional products of today`s were blueprinted by the socialization of normative convergence of former periods. Our article is not intended to disseminate on-look perspectives upon the state of the regional security environment in different parts of the world, nor to disseminate the anemoscope of how wide the regional organizations have shot in furnishing the appropriate results for the regional security environment. Our purposeful aim is to deliver an extradite of how regionalism has been bestowed upon an attendant position in global arena, by juxtaposing the Cold War Era and the post-Cold War Era. We jibed the agreement that transitive acquiescing has been performed between the two types of regionalism during these two time-frames. Also, we account for the consideration that regionalism enlarges on the expatiations of compounded interestingness between the actors, geographically encroached into a regional area, which entertain topics of engagement, based on a considerable amount of concern with each other and on an equivalency of interest in a plurality of security situations.
M38|A Framing Of Future European Parliament Elections 2014 In A Social Media Context|Communication in marketing has always been a continuous conceptual hybrid of input from various domains: marketing, P.R., communication, sociology. With the constant transformation of web 2.0. phenomenon the demarcation lines between these domains and their influence has become more blured and difficult to pinpoint. As a result, specific research methods and theories have become adaptable instruments, laying the path for grounded theory approaches or new research methods. Framing theory having as basis that the media focuses attention on certain events and then places them within a field of meaning has shifted towards organizations and further on to institutions. Framing is a quality of communication that leads others to accept one meaning over another. Framing theory suggests that how something is presented (the “frame”) influences the choices people make. In online communicative contexts, their own personal framings allow the communicative actors to make use of language and forethought so that specific embodiments of future evolutions may be depicted. In our case, we shall focus on the topic: European Parliament elections, which are to take place in 2014, and on the manner in which it has been framed in two online chat session with three MEPs. It is our intention to identify the framing techniques used, the framing links and the framing alignments.

In this paper, the “first home” product is presented through the legislative aspects that regulate its presence on the market, as well as its evolution from the launching moment to present.
M38|Communication Policies of the Agriculture Companies in Bulgaria|Communication policies of farms in Bulgaria: The development of marketing communications at the Bulgarian agricultural enterprises faces serious difficulties. Therefore the main objective of this study is to discover the appropriate forms for the implementation of successful marketing communications of the farms with customers and the public. The main tools for communicating with individuals, groups and organizations: public relations (PR), advertising, sales promotion, personal selling, direct marketing (DM) are analyzed in details. The wide-ranging role of agricultural policies in the field of communications activity of agricultural enterprises is explored. The possibilities of application of the communication policies of agricultural enterprises at micro, meso, macro and mega level are analyzed. It is estimated that in perspective the areas of application, tools and budgets for communication policies of agricultural enterprises should increase steadily at all levels. As the most appropriate in terms of opportunities for utilization and outcomes emerge PR and DM in combination with the Internet and the new information technologies and devices.

M38|The Symphony Of Tulips In The Post-Accession Strategy Of The City Of Pitesti|This paper aims to analyse an identity element of the city of Pitesti, based on the results of a study that helped design the town’s post-accession strategy. Local development strategies have become essential for administrative reform in Central and Eastern European countries, ensuring the competitiveness of cities in the context of an increasing regional and international competition. Urban marketing approaches the problems of urban design and organization, as it seeks to meet the needs of a community concerned about urban development. With a history of over 30 years, the Symphony of Tulips is a management and strategic marketing tool used to strengthen the city's brand and a promoter of the city’s strategic development after the accession. The conclusions of this paper are based on statistical processing of values recorded for specific indicators of socio-cultural events in the period under review.
M38|The role of social consultation in the management of a local government unit: the case study of Wasilkow|This article draws mostly on the issue of consultation as a manifestation of social participation. The author aims to show the role and importance of public consultation in the management of gmina (administrative district) Wasilkow. To achieve the purpose of this study, two models will be used, i.e. consultations based on the relations: the government – the residents and the government – the investor – the residents.
M38|Shrinking Goods|If producers have more information than consumers about goods’ attributes, then they may use non-price (rather than price) adjustment mechanisms and, consequently, the market may reach a new equilibrium even if prices don't change. We study a situation where producers adjust the quantity per package rather than the price in response to changes in market conditions. Although consumers should be indifferent between equivalent changes in goods' prices and quantities, empirical evidence suggests that consumers often respond differently to price changes and equivalent quantity changes. We offer a possible explanation for this puzzle by constructing and empirically testing a model in which consumers incur cognitive costs when processing goods’ price and quantity information.
M38|Attention Manipulation and Information Overload|When a decision-maker’s attention is limited, her decisions depend on what she focuses on. This gives interested parties an incentive to manipulate not only the substance of communication but also the decision-maker’s attention allocation. This paper models such attention manipulation. In its presence, competitive information supply can reduce the decision-maker’s knowledge by causing information overload. Further, a single information provider may deliberately induce information overload to conceal information. These findings, pertinent to consumer protection, suggest a role for rules that restrict communication, mandate not only the content but also the format of disclosure, and regulate product design.
M38|Competence Building: A Systemic Approach to Innovation Policy|The main question that guides this paper is how governments are focusing (and must focus) on competence building (education and training) when designing and implementing innovation policies. With this approach, the paper aims at filling the gap between the existing literature on competences on the one hand, and the real world of innovation policy-making on the other, typically not speaking to each other. With this purpose in mind, this paper discusses the role of competences and competence-building in the innovation process from a perspective of innovation systems; it examines how governments and public agencies in different countries and different times have actually approached the issue of building, maintaining and using competences in their innovation systems; it examines what are the critical and most important issues at stake from the point of view of innovation policy, looking particularly at the unresolved tensions and systemic unbalances related to competences in the system; and last but not least, it elaborates a set of overall criteria for the selection and design of relevant policy instruments addressing those tensions and unbalances.
M38|Hypertargeting, Limited Attention, and Privacy: Implications for Marketing and Campaigning|Using personal data collected on the internet, fi?rms and political campaigners are able to tailor their communication to the preferences and orientations of individual consumers and voters, a practice known as hypertargeting. This paper models hypertargeting as selective disclosure of information to an audience with limited attention. We characterize the private incentives and the welfare impact of hypertargeting depending on the wariness of the audience, on the intensity of competition, and on the feasibility of price discrimination. We show that policy intervention that bans the collection of personally identi?able data (for example, through stricter privacy laws requiring user consent) is bene?ficial when consumers are naive, competition is limited, and fi?rms are able to price discriminate. Otherwise, privacy regulation often back?fires. Keywords: Hypertargeting, selective disclosure, limited attention, consumer privacy regulation, personalized pricing, competition.

M38|The Effect of Deceptive Advertising on Consumption of the Advertised Good and its Substitutes: The Case of Over-the-Counter Weight Loss Products|This paper is the first to estimate the impact of exposure to deceptive advertising on consumption of the advertised product and its substitutes. We study the market for over-the-counter (OTC) weight-loss products, a market in which deceptive advertising is rampant and products are generally ineffective with potentially serious side effects. We control for the targeting of ads using indicator variables for each unique magazine read and television show watched. Our estimates indicate that exposure to deceptive advertising is associated with a lower probability that women, and a higher probability that men, consume OTC weight loss products. We find evidence of spillovers; exposure to deceptive print ads is associated with a higher probability of dieting and exercising for both men and women. We also find evidence that better-educated individuals are more sophisticated consumers of advertising and use it to make more health-promoting decisions.
M38|Research collaboration in universities and academic entrepreneurship: the-state-of-the-art|There is abundant evidence that research collaboration has become the norm in every field of scientific and technical research. We provide a critical overview of the literature on research collaboration, focusing particularly on individual-level collaborations among university researchers, but we also give attention to university researchers’ collaborations with researchers in other sectors, including industry. We consider collaborations aimed chiefly at expanding the base of knowledge (knowledge-focused collaborations) as well as ones focused on production of economic value and wealth (property-focused collaborations), the latter including most academic entrepreneurship research collaborations. To help organize our review we develop a framework for analysis, one that considers attributes of collaborators, collaborative process and organization characteristics as the affect collaboration choices and outcomes. In addition, we develop and use a “Propositional Table for Research Collaboration Literature,” presented as an “Appendix” to this study. We conclude with some suggestions for possible improvement in research on collaboration including: (1) more attention to multiple levels of analysis and the interactions among them; (2) more careful measurement of impacts as opposed to outputs; (3) more studies on ‘malpractice’ in collaboration, including exploitation; (4) increased attention to collaborators’ motives and the social psychology of collaborative teams.

M38|Product Warnings, Debiasing, and Free Speech: The Case of Tobacco Regulation|The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 requires the display of graphic health warnings on cigarette advertising and packaging in the United States. Debates over the permissibility of these new mandated health warnings under the unusually broad Free Speech Clause of the United States Constitution have paid insufficient attention to empirical evidence - to be presented in this article - of the warnings' salutary effects in reducing consumers' factual misperceptions about smoking risks. Although such empirical evidence does not, by itself, settle the First Amendment debate, this evidence warrants more attention in that debate than it has received to date.

M38|The Italian Model of Gambling Taxation: Fiscal Policy Guidelines for the «Sustainable Development» of an Important and Controversial Market|"The gaming sector has recently been characterized by a process of liberalization and technological innovation, which has increased the number of available products and operators, thus increasing the degree of market competition. On the fiscal side, the effect of these changes has been the paradox of a decrease in government revenues ""vis à vis"" the expansion undergone by the sector. If the interplay between different fiscal treatments and market evolutions of the various games is the immediate explanation of such a situation, the way out of it is a modernization of the taxation instruments applied to the sector."
M38|Are commercial ceilings adequate for the regulation of commercial overload on free-to-air TV channels?|Commercial ceilings not only restrict broadcasters in their decisions about commercial broadcasting time, but also affect their differentiation of program content. This study examines the welfare effects of commercial ceilings in a two-sided free-to-air TV market, taking into account welfare with respect to content differentiation. We identify a second-best commercial ceiling that maximizes welfare in the absence of enforceable program content regulation and identify the situations in which laissez faire is optimal. The deregulation of commercial broadcasting can improve welfare, even if the laissez-faire level of commercial broadcasting time is excessive.

M38|Designing Public Transportation Tariff Scale by Modeling Demand|(The Case of Moscow Region Commuter Railway) Currently fares on public transport in Russia are calculated on the basis of carrier’s costs. The subsidies and tariffs are annually approved by the regulator on the basis of the costs’ structure. This paper presents another approach to the determination of tariffs, which is widespread in developed countries. It is based on modeling passengers’ reaction to fares and is able to create appropriate incentives for the carrier. We apply it to the case of commuter rail pricing in Moscow region. To do this, we model the revenue function and evaluate people’s reaction to fares to find an optimal tariff menu. These results can form the basis of a new methodology of tariff regulation of public transport in Russia.
M38|Exploratory Research Regarding Romanians’ Perception About The Regional Brand “Maramureª”|In recent years, the expansion of touristic activities confirmed the importance of marketing activities in touristic regions. In tourism as well, globalization implies an unlimited number of options, and the traditional elements regarding competition and differences related to price or quality are no longer sufficient in efficiently differentiating the touristic region. A key factor in this sense is represented by the notion of place branding or, to be more precise, regional branding. Theoretical studies on this subject are relatively recent, and fewer compared with studies on traditional brands, for example. A practical research regarding a touristic region can thus provide a series of utile information that marketers can use in elaborating marketing strategies and, specifically, in the branding process. The study’s main objective aimed at shaping the regional brand “Maramureº” using mainly projective techniques, scarcely used in studies of this kind in Romania, based on a sample of more than 200 respondents. The information obtained focused on the respondents’ perceptions regarding the region of Maramureº as a touristic brand, the associations made, the values attributed to the region in terms of touristic potential, of touristic infrastructure, of weak and strong points of the touristic brand Maramureº, but also elements of the regional image and identity (at this point were considered certain associations with visual elements but also with its personality). By highlighting respondents’ subjective and diverse opinions, it was aimed to point out some directions that would eventually guide a new approach of the brand for this touristic region. Also, the results of this study could represent a starting point for a program of regional development, funded through various local or European funds. Furthermore, based on the information obtained from respondents, it has been proposed a new logo of the region, as a first step in running a promotion campaign of Maramureº as touristic destination.
M38|Students’ Perception About Management Education in India and USA|The purpose of this research was to gain an insight into students’ perception about the quality of management education especially the Masters of Business Administration (MBA) program; as structured and taught in India and USA. Specific objectives were comparing students’ perception regarding the quality parameters input, process and output of the two MBA programs. The study covered students who had successfully completed MBA in India and those Indians who had pursued an MBA in USA. The hypothetical associations of students’ perception of high quality education with input, process and output of management schools were tested. Findings indicated that students perceived high quality of education if processes and outputs were satisfactory. Indians completing MBA from USA, perceived good quality of all parameters, with the only problem of finding a good job in America after completion of an MBA.

M38|Food Marketing to Children - Introduction to Ethical Issues|The working paper provides an overview of key stakeholders involved in the food marketing to children in Europe and in the Czech Republic. It analyzes the role of the legislation as well as of voluntary codes of conduct in the food industry. The industry part of the issue is also covered by explanation of their role and position in the obesity issue. The form of food industry cooperation at the Food Chamber through a working group of involved companies is analyzed and an example of the corporate responsibility program is shown. The paper is going to serve as a review of the issue for further exploration needs.
M38|The Strategic Plan for Tourism Development in Italy|Conceptual works on tourism destination competitiveness affirm the central importance of planning the process of value creation within destination. Italy is an emblematic case of why and how a leading tourism destination may lose competitiveness along the years. Up to the 1980s Italy was in fact the top international tourism destination, but then such ranking gradually decreased, because of more complexity of sector and, over all, because of marginality of tourism in the government agenda and more in general of the country. After years of strategic myopia, Italy finally has a tool that formalizes its vision and indicates the key factors that can be leveraged in order to regain ground. In 2013, Italy adopted a National Strategic Plan. Therefore, this paper aims to describe an important turning point in tourism policies for the economic and cultural development of Italy. The research highlights the problematic areas of Italy’s tourism industry and explains how a new approach should make the Italian destination able to successfully compete on the international tourism market.
M38|Elektronik Haberleşme Sektöründe Rekabeti Bozucu Fiyat Uygulamaları: Yıkıcı Fiyatlandırma ve Düzenleyici Yaklaşımlar|Predatory price can be defined as the abuse of dominant position through low price practices in which the enterprise that has the dominant position in the market aims to eliminate its competitors from the marketplace or prevents its potential competitors from entering the market. In cases where predatory pricing is in question, it becomes critical how to decide whether predatory pricing exists or not. As a matter of fact one of the aims of sectoral competition regulation is to reduce market prices via encouraging operators for competition. However, sometimes low prices may also distort competition. Within this framework, it is necessary to analyze when and under which conditions competitive low pricing practices can be evaluated as predatory pricing. In this study, predatory pricing is dealt with regard to theoretical framework and tests to determine it.
M38|Principales problemas de internacionalización de las cooperativas agroalimentarias españolas<BR>[Major internationalization problems of Spanish food and agricultural cooperatives]|Es imprescindible que las cooperativas agroalimentarias, al igual que el resto de empresas agroalimentarias, se internacionalicen, y para ello es necesario partir del conocimiento de los problemas que las cooperativas encuentran en su desarrollo internacional. Utilizando una metodología que combina la revisión teórica con una investigación cualitativa, se identifican los principales problemas partiendo de una muestra de cooperativas españolas internacionalizadas. Una vez identificados, se clasifican diferenciando los externos de los internos. Los resultados obtenidos en este estudio exploratorio sugieren que las principales barreras externas son la competencia y la estructura de la distribución, mientras que las internas son la falta de recursos financieros, imagen y marca, e investigación y desarrollo. Identificados los problemas, los directivos y los organismos de apoyo, podrán articular las medidas necesarias para minimizarlos.

M38|Innovative Agro-food Technologies Implementation through Instructional Communication Mechanisms|The current research represents the valorization of the dissemination the design framework of an interdisciplinary area of research, validated through SPAS European FP6 project and a national BIOSIG- PN2 and has as objective to channel communication on target market, through personalized solution of instructional communication mechanisms. The main objective of the national research grant being the implementation of innovative biotechnology on agro-food market, in order to improve the fish diet’s benefits, the prospects must be provided with valuable explicit information. This paper is about the commitment to embedding the actual consumer experience from PN2 fish market research and agro-food agents’ capitalization knowledge behavior from SPAS virtual platform, through designing the adequate communication framework, in order to support and accelerate the implementation of the innovation biotechnology, through improving the target market experience. The projected solution is mainly concerning to offer adequate solutions to insure against current consumers fragilities, but we also underline the vulnerabilities of the whole agro food value chain, in terms of communication strategy, which is lacking of adequate common interest coordination. The current research solution is regarding the rising awareness about the translation from consumer preferences to perceived detriment by integrating previous validated solution of agro food market analysis.
M38|Advertising disclosures: Measuring labeling alternatives in internet search engines|In an online experiment, we measure users’ interactions with search engines, both in standard configurations and in modified versions with clearer labels identifying search engine advertisements. In particular, for a random subset of users, we change “Sponsored links” or “Ads” labels to instead read “Paid Advertisements.” Relative to users receiving the “Sponsored link” or “Ad” labels, users receiving the “Paid Advertisement” label click 25% and 27% fewer advertisements, respectively. Users seeing “Paid Advertisement” labels also correctly report that they click fewer advertisements, controlling for the number of advertisements they actually click. Results are most pronounced for commercial searches, and for vulnerable users with low education and little online experience.
M38|Managing town centres under increasing competitive conditions – The role of the property owners|To manage increased competition cooperation between stakeholders has become more important. Retailer’s role is well researched. Property owner’s role is not well researched. The aim is to analyse different stakeholder’s erceptions of what property owners contribute with and could contribute with in managing the town centre. Many stakeholders look at the property owner’s role as crucial for town centre development. Property owners do not see that they can contribute significantly to the development. The main reasons for this opinion are that they look at them self to have to small amount of properties to make a difference in the town development.
M38|Why Pre-Commercial Procurement is notInnovation Procurement|"In 2006 the European Commission introduced the concept of ""Pre-Commercial Procurement"" as an instrument to promote innovation and to mitigate grand challenges. One of the main motivations for the support of Pre-Commercial Procurement schemes was to use public needs as a driver for innovation. This concept was also introduced as a response to the need to reinforce the innovation capabilities of the EU, while improving the quality and efficiency of public services. However, there is still a certain degree of confusion as to what is meant by Pre-Commercial Procurement and what rationales are behind it. This paper addresses the differences between two public policy instruments, PreCommercial Procurement (PCP) and Public Procurement for Innovation (PPI), and clarifies what is meant by each of them. The analysis is based on three cases, one from the Netherlands, one from the UK and one from Australia. While PPI is a demand-side policy instrument, these cases provide evidence of the supply-side nature of Pre-Commercial Procurement in relation to innovation. The paper claims that PCP is a matter of R&D funding of a specific kind, geared towards very specific goals and in a focused way. Thus, we would like to raise a flag for going back to the origins of the PCP program, and calling it a precompetitive R&D program rather than talking about procurement."
M38|Rethinking the European Business Model|The notion of business models makes possible to describe how a company creates value through innovation, generally within a business ecosystem, and how the value will be distributed between the actors involved. The experiences corporate managers made in the recent economic recession, the existing volatility of the environment, and the resulting uncertainty is changing what is regarded as best practice in enterprise management. Companies will experience a new focus on entrepreneurial sustainability. The European Union has a role to play in this plan: it needs to promote a European business model that integrates sustainable development and social responsibility.
M38|The Value of Personal Information: Evidence from Empirical Economic studies|EC data protection policy is promoted with reference to economic benefits. However, the value of personal information in legitimate business models is rarely discussed. Various economic studies have tried to measure individuals' valuation of different kinds of personal data. We review empirical papers from the last 10 years and find evidence that more disclosure is associated with higher valuations. We find that the current research efforts can be extended to yield insights into the pricing of personal information, taking into account the actual value such information creates in legitimate business applications.
M38|Public Attitudes towards Surveillance and Privacy in Western Balkans: The Case of Serbia|As a part of the larger project that covers Western Balkan countries, this paper investigates the attitudes of Serbian citizens towards privacy, data protection, surveillance and security. It examines which segments of population with similar attitudes towards surveillance and privacy exist in this country, and can they be differentiated by demographic characteristics. The empirical analysis was based on public opinion survey with the nationally representative sample of 500 Serbian citizens. The findings indicate that Serbian citizens showed the highest concern about personal data manipulation, and they seem to be cautious about the effectiveness of surveillance, but some of them expressed the need for surveillance enforcement. There are three groups of citizens with similar attitudes: (1) citizens concerned about data and privacy protection, (2) pro-surveillance oriented citizens, (3) citizens concerned about being surveilled. Identified groups of citizens differ in age, education, and employment status. The empirical results of this paper could be used for comparison with other Western Balkan countries, and might be taken into consideration in the design of policies related to privacy, security, surveillance and data protection.

M38|The Social Problem Sensitivity of the Hungarian Population and Their Social Marketing Sensitivity|This study moves beyond the institutional approach to social marketing, interpreting social marketing as an integrated model and practice, with the objective of providing more complex solutions to social problems and promoting the achievement of social objectives. The research program, which has been in progress for two years, interprets social marketing as being a form of stakeholder management shaping behaviours acting along value communities. An empirical representative questionnaire inquiry is introduced that assesses sensitivity, undertaking activities and feeling of responsibility of Hungarian citizens towards social problems. This study also analyses the connections between the importance of values, problem-relatedness, individual responsibility, information gathering
M38|Customer Lifetime Value in Public Services|Public administration and public services, after a slow development and successive layers, from the beginning of the 90s witnessed a significant transformation. The legislation, by choice or necessity,imposed previously unknown areas of competition in the sector. In open markets where entry and exit barriers are absent or limited andswitching costs associated with the change of supplier minimized, competition is based on the value served to the customer; in turn, the relationship with the customer is a value for the company, a financial and reputational asset on which could be founded the future strategy. This work aims to illustrate the concept of customer lifetime value and the operability of the strategy of the utility company oriented towards efficiency and effectiveness for the citizen.

(Marginal Notes on Works of Modern Foreign Classics)|The article analyses the characteristics of small and medium sized enterprises and state policy towards SME in modern Russia – in the context of some rather unknown for the Russian experts evidences of last decades, formulated in the works of leading world researchers concerning the role of entrepreneurship, its conditions of development and institutional design of the state policy to promote entrepreneurial activity and innovations.
M38|Classical and Modern Approaches to Public Administration|Public administration has a long history which has been going in parallel with the very notion of government. The classical approach to public administration, derived from Weber, Wilson and Taylor, largely dominated most of the 20th century. In fact, Weber’s theory of bureaucracy is the most important theoretical principle of the traditional model of public administration. This model started to change in the mid 1980s to a flexible, market-based form of public management because the traditional public administration was discredited theoretically and practically. All this led not simply to a minor change in management style, but to a change in the role of government in society and the relation between government and citizenry. The introduction of modern managerial approach and the adoption of new forms of public management mean the emergence of a new paradigm in the public sector. The wave of reforms started from the Anglo-American countries as they were the first to attach bigger importance to the role of private sector forms and techniques in the process of modernizing government, though not all countries adopted the whole new public management package. There is another distinctive model of reform, which is followed by many European countries and requires selective and limited use of its elements and instruments.
M38|Romania's Tourism Brand – a Critical Analysis|Today the tourism is the fastest growing industry in the whole world. In comparison with other countries that have been taking advantage of these phenomena of travelling, Romania is lagging behind in terms of tourist arrivals. To capitalize our potential tourist destinations, the Romanian government launched a series of promotional campaigns in order to obtain a competitive advantage over their rivals. The article provides conceptual delimitations about tourist destination branding. Also, the paper intends to approach in an exploratory manner how Romania has been presented in the communication campaigns over the years and what efforts has been made by authorities to promote the country as a tourist destination. Finally conclusions were outlined that highlight why failed all campaigns that promoted Romania as tourist destination.

Most studies focused on the relationship: social performance-financial performance showed that the relationship is positive synergy within the theory and, moreover, were considered the manifestation of corporate global companies. In this context, we consider it appropriate to analyze expression of corporate responsibility in a representative sample of multinational companies operating in Romania, focusing on circular causality between the dimensions of corporate responsibility.
M38|Tax policy response to market changes: the case of the gaming services sector|Beginning with the 1990's, the gaming services sector has undergone several changes that have induced governments to review gambling taxes. We examine the economic rationale behind actual and prospected reforms, comparing different tax instruments with respect to their incidence.
M38|Self-regulation as a remedy for market turmoil: An over-the-counter or a prescription drug?|The paper tackles the problem of the overwhelming regulatory burden that marks its presence in a post-crisis environment. With evidence of regulatory overload in some cases, paths for more effective design of regulatory frameworks should be sought. Although self-regulation does not enjoy favorable publicity and happens to fail to prove its value in times of distress, it still may serve as a remedy. A number of studies shows that, under specific circumstances, the self-regulatory framework may operate seamlessly for the benefit of all stakeholders. The goal of this paper is to identify these circumstances and validate them on the basis of three concise case studies from the health care, advertising and financial services industry. It is instructive for policy makers in deciding on whether to abandon or reduce public oversight in certain areas, by allowing businesses more freedom in terms of setting and enforcing the rules.
M38|Women on Boards: Norway the Example to Follow|We explore the overall situation of women on boards in Norway, Germany and Italy and review the debate surrounding women’s involvement in governance. Italy and Germany are following the law path undertaken by Norway to reach the women quota in boardrooms. We use data to demonstrate the quota law is a success and argue it should be considered an example to follow. We discuss some propositions on how gender diversity brings different value creation within boardrooms accordingly with the critical mass approach. Moreover, the paper explores in a synoptic overview the micro and macro-level dimensions of the three countries considered.
M38|The Introduction of ICT for Sustainable Development of the Tourism Industry in Cambodia|Tourism industry/development constitutes one of only a few viable development options and is often the principal source of foreign exchange earnings without exporting any national wealth or resources. It plays an important role in the sustainable development of many developing countries. The current national strategic development goal of Cambodia has embraced the tourism sector is one of the major driving economics sources after garment industry and agricultural products. In the 2011 report of World Economic Forum (WEF), Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) which developed to measure the factors and policies that make it attractive to develop the Tourism sectors in different countries ranked Cambodia 109 (Cambodia’s overall score index is 3.44) out of 119 countries. TTCI was computed by using three principal sub indices while ICT (Information Communications Technology) infrastructure was one of the individual variable for computing the Travel and Tourism business environment and Infrastructure sub index. Seeing Cambodia sits in the low position in TTCI and the awareness of the command of the pivotal ICT role in all functions, the study attempts to look into in particular development of uses and applications of ICT in Tourism sector in Cambodia. Furthermore, the study uses the article on the Adoption of ICT on Chinese’s tourism industry for a benchmarking case study. As this paper is the initiative study on E-Tourism in Cambodia, the attempt is to bring the interest of the government and the tourism entrepreneurs to visualize the importance and competitiveness by utilizing ICT in the tourism application.
M38|Steps to be followed for egovernment implementation|eGovernment, or computerization of administration in order to improve access to public services, for the benefit of citizens, institutions and last but not least for the benefit of the administration employees, represents a field able to propel our country closer to the desideratum of being part of the European Information Society. In this context, a quantitative research was conducted and following this research, the replies of 342 employees from four public institutions were corroborated. The results revealed that despite the satisfactory degree of technical equipment, official communication is traditionally performed in a physical format. The main scope of the software used by employees is editing different documents. Public sector institutions still have difficulties in considering that organizing training sessions in the field of information and communication technologies is highly important, since only 25% of the employees participated to specific training sessions over the last 2 years.
M38|Savings adequacy uncertainty: Driver or obstacle to increased pension contributions?|Deciding how much to save for retirement is a difficult task that includes many uncertainties. In this paper, we use data from a representative Dutch household panel to study the impact of uncertainty regarding one’s savings adequacy on retirement savings contributions and information search processes. We combine ideas from the literature in psychology and economics that provide opposing predictions regarding the impact of uncertainty on retirement savings contributions. Our results indicate that the effect of uncertainty is moderated by two factors: an individual’s perceived adequacy of current savings and that individual’s financial constraints. In particular, we find that uncertainty increases retirement contributions for those who believe that they save adequately; however, it hinders retirement contributions for those who believe that they save inadequately. This effect of uncertainty is further moderated by the availability of financial means: a reduction in uncertainty results in greater contributions to savings only when financial constraints are absent. We also find that uncertainty has both indirect and direct effects on savings information search. In particular, uncertainty indirectly affects savings information search because it impacts individuals’ intentions to save, which consequently forces individuals to engage in purchase-oriented information search; however, uncertainty also has a direct effect because individuals engage in ongoing information search processes to directly reduce uncertainty. The implications of these findings are discussed.
M38|Packaging – The Silent Seller Of The Product|"Nowadays, packaging is one of the most important criteria for purchasing a product. A good overview of the products that are available for sale creates an initial image, which has an essential role in the consumer’s purchasing decision. Packaging should provide optimum conditions, flexibility and affordability. The packaging used is a link between the commercialized product - and the buyer in case of promotional packages, and it is intended to protect the product delivery. In most cases, the marketing of products could not occur without packaging. Its absence would make the exchange of goods inefficient, expensive or even impossible. The importance of packaging is evidenced by the basic functions that must satisfy: conservation and protection, handling, transportation, storage, information and promotion of the products. Packaging should be given greater importance because it can contribute to the success or failure of a business, which can be called ""recipe for success"". This is the reason why I chose this title,”Packaging – the silent seller of the product”, because it attracts the customer and sells the product. This research aims to emphasize the role of packaging, how it helps to sell a product and how much it matters in people's eyes. The research is based on the analysis of questionnaires completed by and for that was applied a questionnaire for students within the Faculty of Commerce from the Bucharest University of Economic Studies."
M38|Health Claims Regulation and Welfare| Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, 20 December 2006, requires functional foods manufacturers operating in Europe to provide evidence that the health claims reported on the packaging are truthful. However, most applications reviewed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have been rejected, leaving food manufacturers with the option of either selling products deprived of their claims or discontinuing their production. This paper analyzes changes in welfare (both producers’ and consumers’) that would occur if the implementation of Reg. (EC) No 1924/2006 resulted in a large-scale health-claim de-labeling of functional food products. To that end, we use one year (2007) of monthly scanner data of sales of conventional and functional yogurt in the Italian market and a discrete-choice random coefficient logit demand model which accounts for consumers’ heterogeneity using the MPEC algorithm developed by Dube et al. (2009) to improve numerical efficiency and accuracy, to assess the issue. Preliminary results show that both producers and consumers can be severely impacted if reporting health-claims on functional products is not allowed; as our results indicate that consumers’ welfare losses are twice as large than producers’ a loosening of EFSA’s requirements might be required to avoid such losses.
M38|Portuguese Retailers’ Motivations to Adopt Front of Pack Nutrition Labels: A Qualitative Analysis| Nutrition is an important food marketing differentiation criterion. There is growing evidence of the relation between diets and health conditions. Thus there is a potential conflict between industry and public health authorities over the use of nutrition labels. Understanding industry motivations for simplified nutrition labels use is paramount to scrutinize market dynamics, improve label policy design and its evaluation. The aim of this research is to ascertain how retailers perceive consumer’s attitudes to nutrition labels and what motivates their use. We conducted in-depth semi-structure interviews with senior managers in leading Portuguese retail chains. Our results suggest that retailers’ adopt FOP to aid their customers’ food choices, as a response to competitors’ moves and preempt labeling regulations. However, respondents were concerned on whether nutrition labels added value to their business, has a negative impact on sales in certain food categories and may hinder relations with suppliers.

M38|A Consolidated Model Of Analysis Of The Relations Between Politics And Management Within Public Organizations|An interdisciplinary approach which combines the theoretical, empirical and conceptual dimensions, the present study tries to offer a new work perspective on the assessment and modeling of the relation between the management of public organizations and the political environment. The theoretical research was centered on reviewing the literature on the relation between the management of public organizations and the political environment. The empirical research was materialized by modeling with the regression technique of several aspects integrated to the relations between the management of human resources within public organizations in the education field and the external political environment.
M38|Considerations Regarding Behavior And Strategic Orientations Of Romanian Retailers During The Economic Crisis|The paper presents the results of an empirical research having as a goal the identification of Romanian retailers’ behavior during the crisis and the establishment of the strategic alternatives that could be followed in conditions of uncertainty regarding the future evolutions of this sector. The research has at its basis an investigation realized on a representative sample at a national level. Starting from a few hypotheses, we propose to find some correlations between phenomena, facts and indicators related to Romanian retail sector, the research leads to highlighting some strategic options regarding prices, costs, the assortment, financial sources, etc.
M38|Comparative Analysis Concerning The Field Distribution Of The Companies With Liabilities To The State Budget In 2010|The purpose of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis regarding the field distribution of Romanian companies that have liabilities to the state budget at the end of 2010. In our approach, we have studied all the companies with debts to the state of the category of large companies in Romania. The database comprises 558 large companies, involved in the following activity fields: agriculture, processing industry, electricity and heat production and supply, gas, hot water and air conditioning, water distribution, sanitation, waste management, decontamination activities, civil engineering, commerce, transport and storage, brokerage, and insurance. We can notice an increase in the residual amounts owed to the state budget in comparison to the year 2009, as well as an increase in the number of indebted companies. The largest amount of liabilities comes from the value-added tax, interests and penalties, each having a different share depending on the activity field.
M38|Nutritional Labeling and Consumer Choices|In 1994, nutritional facts panels became mandatory for processed foods to improve consumer access to nutritional information and to promote healthy food choices. Recent applied work is reviewed here in terms of how consumers value and respond to nutritional labels. We first summarize the health and nutritional links found in the literature and frame this discussion in terms of the obesity policy debate. Second, we discuss several approaches that have been used to empirically investigate consumer responses to nutritional labels: (a) surveys, (b) nonexperimental approaches utilizing revealed preferences, and (c) experiment-based approaches. We conclude with a discussion and suggest avenues of future research.
M38|La responsabilité sociale de l'entreprise (RSE) comme discours ambigu|Corporate social responsibility (CSR) can be considered as a real discourse (creating the ‘elements of reality’ according to its content), but also as a ‘prison’ for big companies management, prisoners of this discourse in a circularity “signification built by the discourse – ‘elements of reality’ produced by the discourse”. And according to the existence of an important professional and academic literature on CSR, this literature is mainly zealot of a normative content because of the ‘elements of reality’ quoted in it. This text is built on the following argumentation: after having reminded the outlines of the ‘ethical evidence’ of the end of the 20th century, ‘ethical evidence’ which is founding the discourse on CSR, the main elements of the ideology of the ‘liberal period’ we live in will be presented, then the outlines of CSR before considering CSR as an ambiguous discourse.

M38|Murdoch’s ‘Romanian’Faces. Media Ownership in Romania: Risks of the High Concentration|This article aims at exposing about the risks which might occur when the high concentration of ownership and control combines with elements such as oligarchic tendencies, informal networks, the most often invisible, between oligarchs, politicians and/or former nomenklatura, lack of effective implementation of regulations in the competition field, and, last, but not least, the size of the market and its recent political and economic developments. In the vision of scholars, views adopted by the European Commission in its recent ‘Media Pluralism Monitor’ (2009), the ‘structural pluralism’ (pluralism of ownership and control) plays a role in shaping the whole concept of pluralism, along with other identified forms of pluralism: media types and genres, political viewpoints, cultural expression and local and regional interests. Written form a risk perspective, the article aims at analyzing some of the factors which might be relevant, in relation to structural pluralism, based on case studies which are generously offered by the recent developments in the country: the political affiliation of media owners, the judicial investigations some of them have been subject of, the increasing dominance of certain players, the openness of the market versus the state monopoly in certain fields (e.g. the nationwide terrestrial TV licences). The emergence of different factors and the different ways how they interact might transform an apparently ‘beneficent’ consolidation of the media (from the liberal perspective) into a danger for democracy.
M38|Economic Perspectives on Romanian Communist Press Case study: 1965|The main role of the communist press, that of „the party’s spokesperson”, according to Lenin’s definition, was supplemented in the Socialist Republic of Romania by another role, whose importance grew significantly in time, namely that of the party’s financier. A big part of the Romanian Communist Party’s budget consisted of the income brought in by the central and local press. In 1965, the Romanian Communist Party’s budget, in value of 887.400.000 lei, was supplemented with 20 de million lei, money generated exclusively by the increase in the daily newspapers’ selling price.
M38|Economical Forms of State Pressure in Russian Regional Media|This paper focuses on different new forms of state pressure in media, in particular – economical forms based on commodification of loyalty and different mechanisms of financing media. The peculiarity of Russian situation is that state-owned media (the simulacrum of “public media” because they are controlled by the state power and not by the social groups) are first players on the advertising market and uses the purely commercial model of financing. From the other hand to promote the manipulation and translation of state-oriented content the State should adopt the mechanism of distribution of this content to commercial model. The distribution of this content became a kind of “service” that media provides to the state organism and this service is paid by the State. So, the model of broadcasting and distribution of this “propagandist content” became absolutely the same than classic advertizing model of financing media. In this situation such kind of financing represents the parallel market and mechanism of control of editorial content without control of media ownership. The persistence of this model depends on regional peculiarities which structure very heterogeneous map of media market in Russia.
M38|Public Attitudes Towards Surveillance and Privacy in Croatia|This paper investigates public attitudes towards surveillance and privacy in Croatia. It segments the respondents based on their views on surveillance and privacy, and examines differences between them with regard to their demographic characteristics. The empirical analysis is based on data obtained from a public opinion survey. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, Cronbach alpha calculation, chi-square test, and cluster analysis. The factor analysis showed six distinct factors: (1) perceived surveillance effectiveness, (2) concern about being surveilled, (3) trust in privacy protection procedures, (4) concern about CCTV privacy intrusion, (5) concern about personal data manipulation, and (6) a need for surveillance enforcement. K-means cluster analysis indicated the following three groups of citizens: pro-surveillance oriented citizens, citizens concerned about being surveilled, and citizens concerned about data and privacy protection. Significant differences between the groups were found in age and education, while no significant differences exist in gender, employment status, and household income. The findings of this study support the existence of different groups of citizens regarding their attitudes towards surveillance and privacy.

M38|Virality, Network Effects and Advertising Effectiveness| Many video ads are designed to go viral, so that the total number of views they receive depends on customers sharing the ads with their friends. This paper explores the relationship between achieving this endogenous reach and the effectiveness of the ad at persuading a consumer to purchase or adopt a favorable attitude towards a product. The analysis combines data on the real-life virality of 400 video ads, and crowd-sourced measurement of advertising effectiveness among 24,000 consumers. We measure effectiveness by randomly exposing half of these consumers to a video ad and half to a similar placebo video ad, and then surveying their attitudes towards the focal product. Relative ad persuasiveness drops on average by 10\% for every one million views the ad had received. Taking into account the advantages of increased reach, this means that there was a decline in overall advertising effectiveness at 3-4 million views. Importantly, ads that generated both views \emph{and} online engagement in the form of comments did not suffer from the same negative relationship. We show that such ads retained their efficacy because they achieved virality due to humor or visual appeal rather than because they were provocative or outrageous.
M38|Can Marketing Support The Implementation Of Effective Egovernment? Analysis Of The Single Point Of Access Portal For Romanian Electronic Public Services|"The advances in technology hold great potential for helping Romanian government respond to its challenges namely, better service delivery, better procurement, efficient working and better communication with citizens and businesses. While the European Commission develops the main strategies on eGovernment, every member state has the freedom to identify its own necessities and decide according to specific social, administrative and economic context. Designing, cost setting, choosing the best supply channels or communicating with involved actors, are all marketing instruments which, if used accordingly, can ensure modern and efficient public services. This paper presents an analysis of the degree of development of public services available at the ""www.e-guvernare.ro"" portal, the single point of access for specific Romanian electronic public services."
M38|Corporate Responsibility and Control Risk|Control risk (CR) refers to the likelihood that material misstatement of the financial statements can not be prevented or detected and corrected by the entity's internal control. This risk is assessed by the auditor after obtaining an understanding of the entity's control environment risk assessment quizzes (TER) and after obtaining evidence of operating effectiveness of internal controls through control tests (TC). Typically, the auditor establishes a high level of control risk, even 100% as the confidence in the SCI is low. However, there are exceptions, such as identification by the auditor's internal controls well designed and operating effectively, or when the auditor plans to conduct tests to support the extended control that risk assessment at a lower level. However, one thing is certain: the RC is higher; the volume of evidence must be higher to support an audit risk as small. In this study we demonstrate that the correct estimation of risk control as an appropriate methodology will help to streamline the audit process and reduce its costs.
M38|Corporate Social Responsibility in Romania. Case Study|CSR starting premise that aims to harmonize economic, social and environmental. In Romania, CSR is a relatively new field, but now more and more business in the Romanian society, being promoted, especially through multinational companies. A sensitive issue, at least for companies doing business in Romania, is to ensure communication and transparency of information on socially responsible investment as they are involved. In this article we try to present the current situation regarding the practical implementation of CSR in Romania, but not before taking into account the dimensions of corporate social responsibility and issues of recognition or non-recognition investments in the accounts of social. The study concerns a sample of 40 companies (multi)national, which are considered matters such as: areas of interest are involved, different budgets for socially responsible actions, the main CSR projects, and most philanthropic companies past five years carrying out their business activities (and) in Romania.
M38|Il gioco pubblico in Italia fra tradizione e innovazione: aspetti economici e di marketing|In recent years there has been a substantial increase in the Italian gambling market and we have witnessed major changes in the taxation and regulation of gambling, as well as the introduction of new technological supports (e.g. the internet, mobile and fixed telephony, dedicated TV channels, new generation gaming machines). Together with the entrance of new suppliers and the widening of the product portfolio, these factors have induced a deep renewal of the industrial and supply structure for these services. This paper offers some reflections on the challenges that this important sector of the national economy faces today.
M38|Quality Management System in the Tourist Information Centre Sector|The paper deals with quality management in the sector of Tourist Information Centres (TIC) in the Czech Republic and the development of the quality management systems in the sector as part of the national quality management system in tourism. Since the TICs perform a prominent role in destination marketing management, the quality of their services seems to be of high importance. To set the particular quality criteria and to include the TIC segment in the national quality management system, an analysis and extensive research among visitors to TICs, employees and founders of TICs in the Czech Republic has been accomplished. Another analysis focused on twelve selected national quality management systems abroad using secondary research and on-line interviews with selected specialists on TIC quality. The analysis abroad comprised personal consultations with TIC specialists in England. The observed results implied the conclusion to use the SERVQUAL model and to integrate quality management systems in TICs into the national system based on the principles of the three-level Swiss quality management system.
M38|Consumer Preferences for Alternative Fuel Vehicles: A Discrete Choice Analysis|In this paper we analyze the potential demand for privately used alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), based on a nationwide survey in Germany among (potential) car buyers. For this purpose, we applied a stated preference discrete choice experiment, using a wide range of vehicle alternatives (gasoline/diesel, natural gas, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, electric, biofuel, hydrogen) and vehicle attributes. By applying both a multinomial logit model and a mixed (error components) logit model, we estimate the attributes’ influence on vehicle choice and calculate consumers’ willingness-to-pay for the improvement of these attributes. Furthermore, in a scenario analysis, we simulate the impact of monetary and non-monetary policy measures on vehicle choice probabilities. We find that the most promising target group for the adoption of all kinds of AFVs is that of younger, well-educated, and environmentally aware car buyers, who, in the case of electric vehicles, also have the possibility to plug-in their car at home, and who have a high share of city trips and thus need a small car. Moreover, we find that, depending on the vehicle alternative, environmental awareness, and budget constraints for the next vehicle purchase, households are willing to pay substantial amounts for the improvement of fuel cost, driving range, charging infrastructure, CO2 emissions, vehicle tax exemptions, and free parking or bus lane access. Furthermore, the scenario results suggest that conventional vehicles will maintain their dominance in the market, whereas electric and hydrogen vehicles will remain unpopular. The market share of the latter is only expected to rise markedly if massive and multiple policy interventions are implemented. Finally, we find evidence that an increase in the fully electric vehicle’s driving range to a level comparable with all other vehicle alternatives has the same impact on its choice probability as would a market-based, multiple measures policy intervention package.
M38|Successful Strategic Practices in Building Malaysia’s Country Brand|An analysis of the macroeconomic indicators for Malaysia show that tourism represents a gold mine: in just a few years, the number of tourists has tripled and revenue from this area have increased in only 16 years, over eight times, and the country has reached the top 10 most visited countries in the world.

M38|Alternative Dispute Resolution through Mediation in Romanian Retail Banking|This article aims at exploring the stage of implementation of mediation as method for the alternative resolution of disputes among consumers and providers of banking services, in Romania. The importance of the topic stems from the increase in the number of customer complaints about banking services in Romania and from the current preoccupation at European level to identify extra-judicial methods for consumer disputes. The main objectives of the research consist in studying: the regulatory framework relative to mediation at the European Union level; the mediation schemes focused on banking services, in the Member States; the present regulatory framework relative to mediation in Romania; the existing mediation schemes and their development level on the Romanian banking service market. The research method applied has an exploratory character. The conclusions clarify the present state of mediation related to banking service disputes in Romania. Within this framework, the recommendations refer, among other aspects, to the organization of a further research phase that may contribute to the substantiation of future decisions aiming to enhance the protection of the rights and interests of consumers.
M38|Demographic Variability In U.S. Consumer Responsiveness To Carbonated Soft-Drink Marketing Practices| Using three years of Nielson Homescan and advertising data from 16 major metropolitan areas across the U.S. to construct a panel data set that follows weekly consumer purchasing behavior, this paper investigates the impact of marketing activities on a representative cross-section of U.S. consumers. Because many consumers do not participate in the market week-in and week-out, I apply Heckman’s econometric selection model to recover the impact of pricing, advertising, and promotion on a wide range of consumer segments. Reduced-form estimates of consumer responsiveness to these marketing activities reveal different effects across consumer segments, which have numerous implications for marketing policy.

The survey contributes modestly in discussing sci-entifically what is needed for improving the climate of foreign direct investments in Albania.
M38|The particularities of the calculation and of the cost reduction in lignite production|In the market economy, the entities are, in an objective way, obliged to be preoccupied with the reduction of costs, taking into consideration the relationship of independence and indirect proportionality between the level of production costs and profit. The laws of competition oblige to the limitation of the waste channels, to the introduction of performant tehnological and tehnical solutions, to the systematic development of the work productivity. Because of this, we appreciated that is advisable that also in the extraction of lignite, we should determine a correct production cost, according to which should be possible the identification of the cost optimization possibilities. On the other hand, the effective cost of the lignite has a major importance because it represents the price which is registered in the accountancy, and, at the same time, through its size, concreted in stocks, it influences the total of the circulant actives and the net active, and the financial result of the exercise. These aspects can be arguments for the option of approaching this work’s theme, in which there are analised the following problems: the general structure and the particularities of the production cost in lignite extraction and the directions for the minimization of the effective production cost, including for the applying of the standard-cost method.
M38|Trademarks As Power Means In International Relations|The paper studies the role of trademarks in the international system of power. Trademarks are an important asset to a company who struggles to develop and impose it on the market. States are not indifferent to these trends because they have certain benefits after a trademark. The connection is analyzed from the point of view of hard and soft power because a trademark for a state represents soft power or the power of an image and it tries to protect it by the means of hard power, meaning imposing legislation and restrictions to other states.
M38|Considerations On Social Marketing In Romania|Social marketing, a concept that has only recently reached its maturity, it’s starting to win ground in Romania as well, although it is many times used clumsily or confused with other concepts that are similar either from a phonetically point of view, either from the point of view of the ways of implementation. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to present briefly, from a theoretical point of view, this concept, to present the elements that distinguish it from the other branches of marketing and to present examples of good practice in its implementation abroad in order to be able to finally point out the concept of social marketing in Romania.

M38|Measuring Service Quality And Customer Satisfaction: An Empirical Study In The Senior-Care Organizations In Rural Areas Of Central Taiwan|With rapid aging of the Taiwan population, the senior-care market has been growing in rural areas of Taiwan. Competition among senior care market players also soared in the past decade and consumers have been demanding better quality performances. This has forced the Senior Care Organizations (SCOs) to fine-tune their employee training programs to meet specific customer needs. The authors examined the relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction of the SCOs residents in rural areas of central Taiwan based on the ten dimensions: access, communication, competence, courtesy, credibility,reliability, responsiveness, security, tangibles, and employeeâ€™s understanding their customer. The 143 effective data were collected from 3,008 senior residents living in the 94 private SCOs in rural areas of central Taiwan, where a random sample was selected to participate the survey through drop-off and face to face interview. T-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple regression analysis were used to test the relationship. The statistical results showed that courtesy and security were significantly and positively related to customer satisfaction. The results also show that demographic factors of age and health conditions have highly significant impact on customer satisfaction when living in the senior-care organizations. This finding, among others, suggests that senior-care operators in rural areas of central Taiwan might have overlooked the above mentioned major dimensions as factors leading to customer satisfaction and, ultimately, to a sustainable competitive edge. To pinpoint what the senior residents really need, the SCOs in central Taiwan should keep communicating with them, to identify the priority dimensions towards customer satisfaction.

M38|Explaining International Differences in Entrepreneurship: The Role of Individual Characteristics and Regulatory Constraints|We use a micro dataset that collects information across individuals, countries, and time to investigate the determinants of entrepreneurial activity in thirty-seven developed and developing nations. We focus both on individual characteristics and on countries' regulatory differences. We show that individual characteristics, such as gender, age, and status in the workforce are important determinants of entrepreneurship, and we also highlight the relevance of social networks, self-assessed skills, and attitudes toward risk. Moreover, we find that regulation plays a critical role, particularly for those individuals who become entrepreneurs to pursue a business opportunity. The individual characteristics that are impacted most by regulation are those measuring working status, social network, business skills, and attitudes toward risk<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
M38|Social Networks, Personalized Advertising, and Privacy Controls| This paper investigates how internet users' perception of control over their personal information affects how likely they are to click on online advertising. The paper uses data from a randomized field experiment that examined the relative effectiveness of personalizing ad copy to mesh with existing personal information on a social networking website. The website gave users more control over their personally identifiable information in the middle of the field test. The website did not change how advertisers used anonymous data to target ads. After this policy change, users were twice as likely to click on personalized ads. There was no comparable change in the effectiveness of ads that did not signal that they used private information when targeting. The increase in effectiveness was larger for ads that used less commonly available private information to personalize their message. This suggests that giving users the perception of more control over their private information can be an effective strategy for advertising-supported websites.
