H57|Technological Learning and Innovation Gestation Lags at the Frontier of Science: from CERN Procurement to Patents|This paper contributes to the literature on the impact of Big Science Centres on technological innovation. We exploit a unique dataset with information on CERN’s procurement orders to study the collaborative innovation process between CERN and its industrial partners, mostly European firms. Since 19 out of the 23 Member Countries of CERN belong to the EU, public procurement for innovation through CERN can be seen as factor contributing to European innovation policies. After a qualitative discussion of case studies, survival and count data models are estimated; the impact of CERN procurement on suppliers’ innovation is captured by the number of patent applications. The fact that firms in our sample received their first order over a long time span (1995-2008) delivers a natural partition of industrial partners into “suppliers” and “not yet suppliers”. This allows estimating the impact of CERN on the hazard to file a patent for the first time and on the number of patent applications, as well as the time needed for these effects to show up. We find that a “CERN effect” does exist: being an industrial partner of CERN is associated with an increase in the hazard to file a patent for the first time and in the number of patent applications. These effects require a significant “gestation lag” in the range of five to eight years, pointing to a relatively slow process of absorption of new ideas.
H57|Organizing Competition for the Market|The paper studies competition for the market in a setting where incumbents (and, to a lesser extent, neighboring incumbents) benefit from a cost advantage. The paper first compares the outcome of staggered and synchronous tenders, before drawing the implications for market design. We find that the timing of tenders should depend on the likelihood of monopolization. When monopolization is expected, synchronous tendering is preferable, as it strengthens the pressure that entrants exercise on the monopolist. When instead other firms remain active, staggered tendering is preferable, as it maximizes the competitive pressure that comes from the other firms.
H57|Data Driven Regulation: Theory and Application to Missing Bids|We document a novel bidding pattern observed in procurement auctions from Japan: winning bids tend to be isolated. There is a missing mass of close losing bids. This pattern is suspicious in the following sense: it is inconsistent with competitive behavior under arbitrary information structures. Building on this observation, we develop a theory of data-driven regulation based on “safe tests,” i.e. tests that are passed with probability one by competitive bidders, but need not be passed by non-competitive ones. We provide a general class of safe tests exploiting weak equilibrium conditions, and show that such tests reduce the set of equilibrium strategies that cartels can use to sustain collusion. We provide an empirical exploration of various safe tests in our data, as well as discuss collusive rationales for missing bids.
H57|Projected Costs of U.S. Nuclear Forces, 2019 to 2028|The nationâ€™s nuclear forces are reaching the end of their service life. CBO estimates that the Administrationâ€™s current plans to operate, maintain, and modernize them would cost $494 billion over the 2019â€“2028 period, or about 6 percent of the total 10-year costs of the plans for national defense outlined in the Presidentâ€™s 2019 budget submission. The current estimate is 23 percent (or $94 billion) higher than CBOâ€™s 2017 estimate for the 2017â€“2026 period, largely because modernization programs are further along in their development and some new programs have been added.
H57|Long-Term Implications of the 2019 Future Years Defense Program|If the Department of Defense (DoD) implemented the plans described in its 2019 Future Years Defense Program, its base budget (which funds normal peacetime activities) would climb from the $617 billion requested for 2019 to $735 billion (in 2019 dollars) in 2033, CBO estimates. Most of that increase would result from increased costs for military personnel and operation and maintenance. Base-budget costs would substantially exceed the share of funding that DoD has previously received under the Budget Control Actâ€™s funding caps in both 2020 and 2021, the final years subject to those
H57|Costs of Submarine Maintenance at Public and Private Shipyards|Public shipyards, which are owned and operated by the Navy, conduct a large majority of all submarine maintenance. To reduce delays at public shipyards, the Navy sent 29 submarines to private shipyards for Docking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA) overhauls between 1993 and 2017. During that period, 117 DSRA overhauls were done at public shipyards. The overhauls conducted at private shipyards have been 31 percent less expensive, on average, by CBOâ€™s estimate. That gap has narrowed in recent years, but CBOâ€™s data include only one overhaul at a private shipyard after 2010.
H57|The Personnel Requirements and Costs of New Military Space Organizations|In this report, CBO considers five ways in which the Department of Defense (DoD) might be reorganized to increase its focus on space. The Administration has proposed three of themâ€”creating a new military service within the Air Force, a new combatant command, and a new development agencyâ€”but has provided few details.
H57|The Cost of Replacing Todayâ€™s Army Aviation Fleet|The U.S. Army has about 4,300 piloted aircraft. The replacement of three large helicopter fleets (Apaches, Black Hawks, and Chinooks) dominates the Armyâ€™s future aviation procurement costs. Because the Army made considerable investments in aircraft between 2007 and 2016, CBO projects that the annual costs of replacing the aircraft in the Armyâ€™s current fleet would decline during the 2020s, from about $4 billion in 2018 to about $1.5 billion in 2027. It would then rise to a peak of about $4.7 billion in 2032 before drifting downward between 2035 and 2045.
H57|Long-Term Implications of the 2020 Future Years Defense Program|As part of the Presidentâ€™s budget request, the Department of Defense (DoD) develops a plan called the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) that reflects DoDâ€™s expectations about its programs and costs over the next five years. According to CBOâ€™s projections, if the plans described in the 2020 FYDP were implemented, DoDâ€™s costs would increase from the $718 billion requested for 2020 to $776 billion (in 2020 dollars) by 2034.
H57|Political donations, public procurement and government efficiency|Firms’ political donations can induce distortions in the allocation of public procurement contracts. In this article, we employ an advanced non-parametric efficiency model to study the public sector (cost) efficiency implications of such distortions. Using a unique dataset covering the Czech regions over the 2007-2014 period, we find that the efficiency of public good provision is lower when a larger share of public procurement contracts is awarded to firms donating to the party in power (‘party donors’). We link this efficiency difference to two underlying mechanisms: i.e. shifts in procurement contract allocations from firms with previous procurement experience to party donors, and the use of less restrictive allocation procedures that benefit party donors.
H57|Examining the Impact of E-Procurement in Ukraine|This paper examines the impact of Ukraineâ€™s ambitious procurement reform on outcomes amongst a set of procurements that used competitive tendering. The ProZorro system placed all of the countryâ€™s government procurement online, introduced an auction approach as the default procurement method, and extended transparency. The reform was introduced with a dramatic increase in the proportion of government procurement that was conducted competitively. This paper examines the impact of ProZorro and reform on contracts that were procured competitively both prior to and after the introduction of the new system. It finds some evidence of impact of the new system on increasing the number of bidders, cost savings, and reduced contracting times.
H57|Organizing Competition for the Market|The paper studies competition for the market in a setting where incumbents (and, to a lesser extent, neighboring incumbents) benefit from a cost advantage. The paper first compares the outcome of staggered and synchronous tenders, before drawing the implications for market design. We find that the timing of tenders should depend on the likelihood of monopolization. When monopolization is expected, synchronous tendering is preferable, as it strengthens the pressure that entrants exercise on the monopolist. When instead other firms remain active, staggered tendering is preferable, as it maximizes the competitive pressure that comes from the other firms.
H57|Public Procurement as a Demand-side Policy: Project Competition and Innovation Incentives|We develop a model of project competition to compare two alternative and widely used approaches: (i) A (demand-side) procurement approach, in which the public authority specifies the type of project it will finance and (ii) a (supply-side) grant system, in which any type of project can be funded. The public authority can verify the characteristics of the projects submitted, but does not know which other projects are available. The paper sheds light on the role of public procurement to foster innovation.
H57|Buyers' Role in Innovation Procurement|What is the impact of buyers on the performance of innovation procurement? In which phase of the procurement process are buyers most crucial and why? We address these questions by exploiting a novel dataset that links U.S. federal R&D contracts to their follow-on patents, citations and claims. Using the deaths of managers in the offices close to where contracts are performed as shocks to the functioning of these offices, we measure a positive and sizable effect of public buyers on all three outcome measures. The buyer's role is stronger in the pre-award, tender-design phase, where cooperation between different specialists is essential, than in the following contract-management phase typically performed by individual officers. Consistently, bureaus where employees perceive high level of cooperation within the office are associated with better R&D outcomes.
H57|Green Public Procurement and the Innovation Activities of Firms|This paper provides first empirical insights on the relationship between green public procurement (GPP) and firms' innovation activities. Considering that the public sector is a large buyer in the economy, public procurement is able to work as demand-pull factor for new products and thus innovations - given that the procurement is aimed at such objectives. GPP is specifically implemented to contribute to more sustainable production and consumption. Using a novel firm-level dataset, this paper analyses whether GPP is able to trigger innovation activities within firms, and if so, whether these innovations are environmental innovations or not. The results show some support for a demand-pull effect of GPP on the probability of general product innovations but no conclusive evidence is found for environmental innovations.
H57|Anatomy of public procurement| We provide novel stylized facts about competition, bidding, entry and bidders across a wide spectrum of public procurement auctions using comprehensive and rich Finnish data. Competition for publicly procured contracts is relatively low with a median bidder count of two (three conditional on receiving any bids). Bidders typically are very heterogeneous in size, which likely limits competition further. Competition seems to work roughly as expected as on average (standardized) bids mainly decrease with the number of actual and potential bidders. Using information on registrations as a good proxy for potential bidders, we show that the ratio of actual to potential bidders increases with the number of actual bidders. We also show that being present in the contracting authority's municipality or province correlates positively with registering, entry (bidding) and winning, but other firm characteristics matter less. While attracting more competition by means of contract and auction rule design is a desirable policy goal and we show suggestive evidence that the use of scoring rule can be an entry barrier, increasing competition may be in practice difficult. Therefore, reservation prices may be a more useful policy tool to alleviate issues associated with the lack of competition.
H57|Le Phénix renaîtra-t-il de ses cendres ? Réflexions sur le recours des collectivités territoriales aux marchés de partenariats public-privé|This article describes the use of public-private partnerships by local governments since their creation in France in 2004. We argue that the municipalities' objectives and constraints explain the development of such contracts. We also study the reason of their current neglect. We conclude that the recent lack of interest for public-private partnerships is also due to the diversification of the contractual tools made available to municipalities. Classification JEL : H11, H57, H72, H75, R53.
H57|Empirical analysis of unbalanced bidding on Swedish roads|Based on anecdotal evidence, claims are made that unbalanced bidding is a major problem in the construction industry. This concept refers to a sealed price auction setting with asymmetric information and unit prices, where information rents are extracted. Theoretical literature has shown that it is rational for an informed contractor to skew unit prices. However, empirical studies on the magnitude of the problem are lacking. As the first quantitative study based on European data, it is shown that unbalanced bidding exists, but in small magnitudes. The result is in line with earlier studies from the US.
H57|On the Competitive Effects of Screening in Procurement|Procuring authorities frequently use screening in order to mitigate risky bids. This study estimates the effect of bid screening and litigation on entry and bidding using a unique data set on highway construction procurement auctions in Poland. The market exhibits a screening method that ex post selects eligible offers. We demonstrate with an empirical model that this method disproportionately affects small firms and creates a barrier to entry. Our results suggest that screening increases bids by two channels. First, it directly inflates bids as well as decreasing entry. Second, in a competitive market, lower entry also inflates bids and prices.
H57|Agrarian distress in India: Possible solutions|Agrarian distress in India, built-up over time, has further deteriorated recently. At the height of the farm output, Indian farmers are a disappointed lot. Despite spectacular rise in agricultural production, they continue to languish in poverty. The underlying reasons for agrarian distress in India are: a) unviable agriculture; b) ineffective Minimum Support Prices (MSP) system; c) adverse terms of trade; d) rural indebtedness; and e) inefficient value chain in agriculture. There is a need to provide medium term solutions to the problem so that sub-optimal solution like loan waiver can be avoided. Among available solutions, government procurement operation covering all major crops may not be feasible, while price-hedging mechanism through derivative instruments like forward/future trading in farm products is yet to be popular among farmers. There is a great potential to protect farmers from distress sale through a composite insurance scheme, which can cover risks arising out of both crop failure and market failure. The value chain of agricultural products needs to be completely revamped to integrate farmers directly to the ultimate consumers. Long-term solution of the agrarian distress lies in improving farm productivity by a series of measures like mass irrigation programme through inter-linking of rivers, diversification of agriculture, smart farming by using latest technology. A scheme of exit route for distress farmers may go a long way in alleviating the situation.

H57|Procurement in Big Science Centres: politics or technology? Evidence from CERN|Procurement from Big Science Centers (BSC) yields a variety of spillover effects that can ultimately have growth enhancing consequences for their partner countries. We study the determinants of procurement for the biggest research infrastructure ever built: the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Using a unique cross-section database of firms that have registered to become industrial partners of the LHC program, we estimate the determinants for potential suppliers of receiving an order from CERN. We compare the relative weight of firms’ technological features and CERN’s procurement rules aimed at securing a juste retour for its Member States. Our results point to a strong impact of technological factors, while also highlighting the importance of political constraints related with CERN’s procurement rules as well as the presence of a home bias. Since the constraints related with the achievement of a juste retour affect–directly or indirectly–the procurement policy of many European BSCs, our results have policy implications that go beyond the CERN case study.

H57|Renegotiations and corruption in infrastructure: The Odebrecht case|In 2016, Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht was fined $2.6 billion by the US Department of Justice (DOJ). According to the plea agreement, between 2001 and 2016 Odebrecht paid $788 million in bribes in 10 Latin American and two African countries in more than 100 large projects. The DOJ estimated that bribe payments increased Odebrechtâ€™s profits by $2.4 billion. Judicial documents and press reports on the Odebrecht case reveal detailed information on the workings of corruption in the infrastructure sector. Based on these sources we establish five facts. First, for projects where Odebrecht paid bribes, renegotiations amounted to 71.3 percent of initial investment estimates, compared with 6.5 percent for projects where Odebrecht paid no bribes. Second, Odebrechtâ€™s bribes were of the order of one percent of a projectâ€™s final investment. Third, the profits Odebrecht obtained from bribes as well as its overall profits were small, somewhere between 1 and 4 percent of its sales. Fourth, the creation of the Division of Structured Operations (DSO) by Odebrecht in 2006 led to major reductions in the firmâ€™s costs of paying bribes and recipientsâ€™ costs of hiding the illegal proceeds. Fifth, following the creation of the DSO, Odebrechtâ€™s sales increased more than three-fold while its profits remained small. We build a model where firms compete for a project, anticipating a bilateral renegotiation at which their bargaining power is larger if they pay a bribe. Conditional on paying a bribe and cost dispersion among firms being small, firmsâ€™ profits are small in equilibrium. When one firm unilaterally innovates by reducing the cost of paying bribes, its market share increases substantially while profits, which are proportional both to the cost advantage and to the magnitude of bribes, remain small. A parametrization with the DOJâ€™s data suggests that Odebrecht enjoyed a substantial cost advantage in bribing, of the order of 70 percent.
H57|How (Not) to Foster Innovations in Public Infrastructure Projects|The government wants an infrastructure-based public service to be provided. First the infrastructure has to be built, subsequently it has to be operated. Should the government bundle the building and operating tasks in a public-private partnership? Or should it choose traditional procurement, i.e. delegate the tasks to different firms? Each task entails unobservable investments to come up with innovations. It turns out that depending on the nature of the innovations, bundling may either stimulate or discourage investments. Moreover, we find that if renegotiation cannot be prevented, a public-private partnership may lead the government to deliberately opt for a technologically inferior project.
H57|Bunching Below Thresholds to Manipulate Public Procurement|I examine a manipulation scheme that public authorities can use to exercise more discretion in public procurement. I propose that regression discontinuity manipulation tests can be implemented to identify manipulative authorities. I investigate the European Union public procurement data set. I find that 10-13% of examined authorities have high probabilities of bunching estimated costs just below thresholds. Manipulative authorities have significantly lower probabilities of employing competitive procurement procedure. The bunching manipulation scheme significantly diminishes cost-effectiveness of public procurement. On average, prices of below threshold contracts are 18-28% higher when the authority has an elevated probability of bunching.
H57|Corrupt Reserve Prices|We develop a new methodology to identify corruption in public procure- ment auctions with reserve prices and apply it to Russian public procure- ment auctions of gasoline in 2011-2013. We identify corrupt procurer-seller pairs by exploiting the variation in reserve prices. Since auction reserve prices are set by the procurer before the auction, they should be indepen- dent from the identity of the winning seller. We estimate reserve prices as a function of the local market price, contract, procurer and time controls, and procurer-seller fixed effects. A procurer-seller pair is labeled as poten- tially corrupt if its pair fixed effect is significantly larger than the average procurer fixed effect. Despite their reserve price overpricing, corrupt sell- ers face less competition in auctions organized by procurers with whom they form a corrupt pair and have a higher probability of wining these auc- tions. Auctions won by corrupt pairs exhibit higher final contract prices, leading to considerable welfare losses. The detrimental effect of reserve price manipulation on final prices is mitigated by higher competition and fully offset by electronic auctions with sufficient competition.

H57|Firm performance and participation in public procurement: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa|This paper exploits a firm-level dataset for nineteen Sub-Sharan African countries that provides information on the share of total sales to government entities to provide new insights into the relative importance of participation in public procurement activity for different types of firms. We investigate whether participation in public procurement is associated with realization of the types of goals that underlie industrial policy - an improvement in measures of firm performance - and find that firms that sell a larger share of their output to government entities have better productivity performance. This is most strongly the case for domestically-owned firms, especially small companies, firms engaged in manufacturing activities and those located in the capital city. A positive relationship between participation in public procurement and performance is not observed for foreign-owned firms or companies that are in the service sector.
H57|Industrial policy for a Europeanindustrial renaissance. A few reflections|This paper raises and attempts to address three questions that add to the recent debate on industrial policies to promote a European “industrial renaissance”. We ask (i) What type of de-industrialisation represents a threat for Europe? (ii) What type of structural change can industrial policy steer in a context of increasing international fragmentation of production, both across European countries and worldwide? (iii) What type of industrial policy shall we advocate, that goes beyond the manufacturing sectors? With no pretence to provide all the answers or yet another wish list of policy tools, we argue that we are “doomed to choose” (Hausmann and Rodrik, 2006) what type of structural transformation is Europe in need of, in a context of harsher global competition from the emerging countries; of staggering income polarisation within Europe itself; of relentless international fragmentation of production processes. First, we claim that industrial policy should target sectors and segments of value chains that support the manufacturing sector and not necessarily represent a hollowing out of the industrial base. Second, industrial policy should target structural transformation alongside large “missions” and learn from classical debates on industrialisationled development. Interventions should therefore go beyond the traditional vertical versus horizontal tools distinction and complement a “mission oriented” plea with other tools, to avoid yet another “one size fits all” approach.
H57|Public Procurement and Reputation: An Agent-Based Model|Based on the literature on public procurement regulation, we use an Agent-Based Model to assess the performance of different selection procedures. Specifically, we aim at investigating whether and how the inclusion of reputation of firms in the public procurement selection process affects the final cost of the contract. The model defines two types of actors: i) firms potentially competing to win the contract; ii) a contracting authority, aiming at minimizing procurement costs. These actors respond to environmental conditions affecting the actual costs of carrying on the project and unknown to firms at the time of bidding and to the contracting authority. The results from the model are generated through simulations by considering different congurations and varying some parameters of the model, such as the firms' skills, the level of opportunistic rebate, the relative weight of reputation and rebate. The main conclusion is that reputation matters and some policy implications are drawn.
H57|Conservation auctions, collusion and the endowment effect|We contribute to the literature on the optimal design of auction mechanisms for the procurement of nature conservation activities. We use an economic experiment to examine whether the market efficiency of conservation auctions increases or decreases with repetition. Theory predicts that repetition facilitates collusion among sellers in procurement auctions, while behavioral economics suggests that repetition may increase market efficiency because it attenuates the endowment effect - the phenomenon that ownership of a good tends to increase one's valuation of the good. We find that of these two countervailing effects, the latter has the upper hand; average bids decrease monotonically over the consecutive auctions. Since repetition increases market efficiency, conservation contracts can be of shorter duration and procured at a higher frequency than has been suggested before.
H57|A multi-regional model of electric resource adequacy|The paper analyzes the determinants of optimal electric capacity and contrasts these with the requirements typically applied in a multi-regional model. We first analyze the relationship between usual reliability criteria such as the value of lost load and the targeted probability of failure, on the one hand, and the conditions that define optimal level of capacity on the other. Secondly, we characterize the social gains from energy trading between two interconnected regions that differ in terms of technologies or demand. Market mechanisms are sufficient to reach the first best allocation, irrespective of the correlation between national demand levels, provided that firms have no market power and fully internalize the value of lost load due to power rationing when supplies are inadequate. Thirdly, we explain the impact of various compensation mechanisms such as capacity payments when producers face a regulatory capacity constraint.
H57|The Race for an Artificial General Intelligence: Implications for Public Policy|An arms race for an artificial general intelligence (AGI) would be detrimental for and even pose an existential threat to humanity if it results in an unfriendly AGI. In this paper an all-pay contest model is developed to derive implications for public policy to avoid such an outcome. It is established that in a winner-takes all race, where players must invest in R&D, only the most competitive teams will participate. Given the difficulty of AGI the number of competing teams is unlikely ever to be very large. It is also established that the intention of teams competing in an AGI race, as well as the possibility of an intermediate prize is important in determining the quality of the eventual AGI. The possibility of an intermediate prize will raise quality of research but also the probability of finding the dominant AGI application and hence will make public control more urgent. It is recommended that the danger of an unfriendly AGI can be reduced by taxing AI and by using public procurement. This would reduce the pay-off of contestants, raise the amount of R&D needed to compete, and coordinate and incentivize co-operation, all outcomes that will help alleviate the control and political problems in AI. Future research is needed to elaborate the design of systems of public procurement of AI innovation and for appropriately adjusting the legal frameworks underpinning high-tech innovation, in particular dealing with patents created by AI.
H57|An Econometric Identification of Abnormally Low Bids in Procurement Market: Discriminant Analysis|In the public construction procurement market, 'abnormally low bids (ALB)' are prevalent and they cause many social and economic problems. Also, when the procurement bids are colluded, ALB make the competitive price systematically underestimated. As many countries regulate ALB, their criteria to identify ALB are not homogenous. Most of the criteria are based on construction cost, which is usually inaccurate, vulnerable to accounting manipulation, and limited to the supply side information of the market. We propose an econometric identification process of ALB using a discriminant analysis. It is based on a switching regression with incomplete separation information and easily estimable by MLE. Through a Monte Carlo simulation, we show that our new method works well. We apply our method to Korean public construction bidding data from 2007 to 2016. The estimation results identify the determinants of the bid prices, along with the determinants of ALB, and presents a more accurate assessment of the collusion damage.
H57|Public procurement as policy instrument for innovation|The use of public procurement to promote private innovation activities has attracted increasing attention recently. Germany implemented a legal change in its procurement framework in 2009, which allowed government agencies to specify innovative aspects of procured products as selection criteria in tender calls. We analyze a representative sample of German firms to investigate whether this reform stimulated innovation in the business sector. Across a wide set of specifications - OLS, nearest-neighbor matching, IV regressions and difference-in-differences - we find a robust and significant effect of innovationdirected public procurement on turnover from new products and services. However, our results show that the effect is largely attributable to innovations of more incremental nature rather than market novelties.
H57|Can the Private Sector Ensure the Public Interest? Evidence from Federal Procurement|We empirically investigate the effect of oversight on contract outcomes in public procurement. In particular, we stress a distinction between public and private oversight: the former is a set of bureaucratic checks enacted by contracting offices, while the latter is carried out by private insurance companies whose money is at stake through so-called surety bonding. We analyze the universe of U.S. federal contracts in the period 2005-2015 and exploit an exogenous variation in the threshold for both sources of oversight, estimating their causal effects on costs and execution time. We find that: (i) public oversight negatively affects outcomes, in particular for less competent buyers; (ii) private oversight has a positive effect on outcomes by affecting both the ex-ante screening of bidders - altering the pool of winning firms - and the ex-post behavior of contractors.
H57|Discration and Supplier Selection in Public Procurement|Public procurement outcomes depend on the ability of the procuring agency to select well-performing suppliers. Should public administrations be granted more or less discretion in their decision making? Using Italian data on municipal public works tendered in the period 2009-2013, we study how a reform extending the scope of bureaucrat discretion affects supplier selection. We find that the share of contracts awarded to politically connected firms increases while the (ex-ante) labor productivity of the winning firm decreases, thus suggesting a potential misallocation of the public funds. These effects are concentrated among lower quality procuring agencies.
H57|Full surplus extraction in mechanism design with information disclosure|I study mechanism design settings with quasi-linear utility where the principal can provide agents with additional private information about their valuations beyond the private information they hold at the outset. I demonstrate that the principal can design information and a mechanism so as to fully extract the complete information first-best surplus if agentsâ€™ ex ante information only affects their beliefs about, yet not their valuations. Otherwise, the result holds if each agentâ€™s initial private beliefs satisfy a spanning condition.
H57|Strategic Behaviour in a Capacity Market? The New Irish Electricity Market Design|The transition to a low-carbon power system requires growing the share of generation from (intermittent) renewables while ensuring security of supply. Policymakers and economists increasingly see a capacity mechanism as a way to deal with this challenge. Yet this raises new concerns about the exercise of market power by large players via the capacity auction. We present a new modelling approach that captures such strategic behaviour together with a set of ex ante empirical estimates for the new Irish electricity market design (I-SEM) - in which a single firm controls 44% of generation capacity (excluding wind). We find significant costs of strategic behaviour, even with new entry: In our baseline scenarios, procurement costs in the capacity auction are around 150-400 million EUR (or 40-100%) above the competitive least-cost solution. From a policy perspective, we also examine how market power can be measured and mitigated through auction design.
H57|The Depot-Level Maintenance of DoD's Combat Aircraft: Insights for the F-35|Depot-level maintenance of military aircraft consists of in-depth maintenance that is beyond the capability of maintenance staff at an aircraftâ€™s operating location. Depot-level maintenance is essential to ensuring an aircraftâ€™s capability to perform missions and can influence whether an aircraftâ€™s life can be extended cost-effectively. This report focuses on depot-level maintenance practices for the Air Forceâ€™s and Navyâ€™s combat aircraft as sources of insights for the new F-35 fighter aircraft.
H57|Comparing a 355-Ship Fleet With Smaller Naval Forces|In 2016 the Navy released a new force structure assessment that called for a fleet of 355 ships. CBO has estimated the costs of achieving such a fleet under two alternative approaches and has compared those scenarios with alternatives involving a fleet of 280 ships or 230 ships in 2047. This report explores the effects on shipbuilding and operating costs, the composition and capabilities of the fleet, and the shipbuilding industry.
H57|A Historical Survey of Ship Reactivations|In December 2016, the Navy released a new force structure assessment that called for a ï¬‚eet of 355 shipsâ€”substantially larger than the current force of 283 ships. This report focuses on one of several approaches that the Navy could use to increase the size of its fleet: reactivating decommissioned ships. It draws insights from past experiences that might inform lawmakersâ€™ decisions about reactivating retired ships in the future.
H57|The Cost of Replacing Todayâ€™s Air Force Fleet|The U.S. Air Force has about 5,600 aircraft, which range in age from just-delivered to 60 years old. Many of those aircraft are nearing the end of their service life. In this report, CBO estimates that replacing those aircraft would cost an average of $15 billion a year in the 2020s. That figure would rise to $23 billion in the 2030s and then fall back to about $15 billion in the 2040s. In comparison, appropriations for procuring new aircraft averaged about $12 billion per year between 1980 and 2017 (in 2018 dollars).
H57|Funding for International Affairs Activities, Within and Outside Agenciesâ€™ Base Budgets|The Congress provides the State Department, the Agency for International Development (USAID), and other agencies a â€œbase budgetâ€ each year to fund ongoing activities related to international affairs. The agencies have received other â€œnonbaseâ€ funding in recent years, in the form of supplemental appropriations, emergency appropriations, and funding for overseas contingency operations. In this report, CBO analyzes the recent use of such nonbase appropriations for international affairs activities.
H57|Do Higher Wages Produce Career Politicians? Evidence from Two Discontinuity Designs|Wages paid to politicians affect both the selection of candidates into electoral races and the on-the-job performance incentives of incumbents. We differentiate between selection and incentive effects using two regression discontinuity designs based on: 1) population thresholds shifting politicians' wages and 2) electoral seat thresholds splitting candidates into those who narrowly won or lost. We find that higher wages do not increase the electoral incumbency advantage, suggesting that the incentive effect of higher wages does not impact re-election rates. We further show that higher wages motivate narrowly elected incumbents to run again much less often than past narrowly non-elected candidates.
H57|Procurement Centralization in the EU: the Case of Italy|This paper analyzes the process of centralization of public procurement in Europe, with an emphasis on the Italian case. It illustrates the main normative and regulatory reforms that took place between 2000 and 2016 at both EU and Italian levels. It then empirically evaluates the potential distortions induced by the most recent wave of centralization reforms. Using procurement data on all Italian public contracts awarded between 2015 and 2017, it finds that administrations expecting to lose their ability to contract independently game the centralization requirements in three ways. In the short run, they anticipate their purchases to avoid delegating to a central body. In the longer run, they both manipulate contract values, breaking down purchases into smaller lots of amounts below the thresholds driving centralization requirements, and, when given the option, aggregate into the smallest types of centralized purchasing bodies. These three distortions partially offset the potential benefits of the centralization reforms.
H57|Firm performance and participation in public procurement: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa|This paper exploits a firm-level dataset for nineteen Sub-Sharan African countries that provides information on the share of total sales to government entities to provide new insights into the relative importance of participation in public procurement activity for different types of firms. We investigate whether participation in public procurement is associated with realization of the types of goals that underlie industrial policy – an improvement in measures of firm performance – and find that firms that sell a larger share of their output to government entities have better productivity performance. This is most strongly the case for domestically-owned firms, especially small companies, firms engaged in manufacturing activities and those located in the capital city. A positive relationship between participation in public procurement and performance is not observed for foreign-owned firms or companies that are in the service sector.
H57|The WTO Government Procurement Agreement as a Commitment Device: A First Appraisal|This paper presents novel reduced form evidence on the association between international trade agreements that include disciplines on public procurement practices reflected in the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) and preferential trade agreements (PTAs) and public sector imports following the 2008 financial crisis. The results are suggestive of such international disciplines acting as an effective commitment device: GPA membership is associated with a significantly higher import share following the crisis than is observed for countries that are not members. We also find evidence that the GPA and PTAs that cover public procurement are partial substitutes.
H57|The Role of Budget Contraints in Sequential Elimination Tournaments|Motivated by the EU concept of Pre-Commercial Procurement and the massivepresence of SMEs in the European economy, we study how budget constraints affect R&D effort in sequential elimination tournaments. We show that introducingbudget constraints leads to a non-monotonicity in unconstrained contestants' effort.Furthermore, we show that if the budget asymmetry is not too large, unconstrainedcontestants exert higher effort than when faced with unconstrained contestants only.
H57|Discretion and supplier selection in public procurement|Public procurement outcomes depend on the ability of the procuring agency to select high-performing suppliers. Should public administrations be granted more or less discretion in their decision making? Using Italian data on municipal public works tendered in the period 2009-2013, we study how a reform extending the scope of bureaucrat discretion affects supplier selection. We find that the share of contracts awarded to firms having a local politician among its administrators or shareholders increases, while the (ex-ante) labor productivity of the winning firms decreases, thus suggesting a potential misallocation of public funds. These effects are concentrated among lower quality procurement agencies.
H57|Strategic behaviour in a capacity market? The new Irish electricity market design|The transition to a low-carbon power system requires growing the share of generation from (intermittent) renewables while ensuring security of supply. Policymakers and economists increasingly see a capacity mechanism as a way to deal with this challenge. Yet this raises new concerns about the exercise of market power by large players via the capacity auction. We present a new modelling approach that captures such strategic behaviour together with a set of ex ante empirical estimates for the new Irish electricity market design (I-SEM) – in which a single firm controls 44% of generation capacity (excluding wind). We find significant costs of strategic behaviour, even with new entry: In our baseline scenarios, procurement costs in the capacity auction are around 150-400 million EUR (or 40-100%) above the competitive least-cost solution. From a policy perspective, we also examine how market power can be measured and mitigated through auction design.
H57|Public Procurement Transaction Costs: A Country-Level Assessment Based On Microdata|Public procurement cost evaluation is important both for procurement optimization at the company level and for evaluating the public procurement regulatory system. This paper presents a survey-based methodological approach to public procurement cost evaluation at the macro level. Our approach is based on a methodology for assessing the efficiency of public procurement developed by PwC for the European Union. The PwC methodology was adapted to developing and transitional economies and piloted on Russian data. Average costs of each type of procurement procedure implemented in 2016 were evaluated. A regression analysis of factors impacting public procurement cost evaluation revealed considerable differences between respondents who have and do not have experience with complex procurement procedures. Although the average overall costs of public procurements in Russia amounted to about 1% of the total value of concluded contracts, the figure stands at 6.6–8.1% for small purchases. This exceeds the economy from price decreases and calls for a need to simplify regulation of such procurements.
H57|The race for an artificial general intelligence: Implications for public policy|An arms race for an artificial general intelligence (AGI) would be detrimental for and even pose an existential threat to humanity if it results in an unfriendly AGI. In this paper an all-pay contest model is developed to derive implications for public policy to avoid such an outcome. It is established that in a winner-takes all race, where players must invest in R&D, only the most competitive teams will participate. Given the difficulty of AGI the number of competing teams is unlikely ever to be very large. It is also established that the intention of teams competing in an AGI race, as well as the possibility of an intermediate prize is important in determining the quality of the eventual AGI. The possibility of an intermediate prize will raise quality of research but also the probability of finding the dominant AGI application and hence will make public control more urgent. It is recommended that the danger of an unfriendly AGI can be reduced by taxing AI and by using public procurement. This would reduce the pay-off of contestants, raise the amount of R&D needed to compete, and coordinate and incentivize co-operation, all outcomes that will help alleviate the control and political problems in AI. Future research is needed to elaborate the design of systems of public procurement of AI innovation and for appropriately adjusting the legal frameworks underpinning high-tech innovation, in particular dealing with patents created by AI.
H57|Bureaucratic Competence and Procurement Outcomes|Does a more competent public bureaucracy contribute to better economic outcomes? We address this question in the context of the US federal procurement of services and works by combining contract-level data on procurement performance and bureau-level data on competence and workforce characteristics. Using an instrumental variable strategy, we find that an increase in bureau competence causes a significant and economically important reduction in: i) delays, ii) cost overruns, and iii) number of renegotiations. Cooperation within the office appears to be a key driver of the findings.
H57|Industry Input in Policymaking: Evidence from Medicare|In setting prices for physician services, Medicare solicits input from a committee that evaluates proposals from industry. We investigate whether this arrangement leads to prices biased toward the interests of committee members. We find that increasing a measure of affiliation between the committee and proposers by one standard deviation increases prices by 10%, demonstrating a pathway for regulatory capture. We then evaluate the effect of affiliation on the quality of information used in price-setting. More affiliated proposals produce less hard information, measured as lower quality survey data. However, affiliation results in prices that are more closely followed by private insurers, suggesting that affiliation may increase the total information used in price-setting.
H57|Public Contracting for Private Innovation: Government Expertise, Decision Rights, and Performance Outcomes|We examine how the U.S. Federal Government governs R&D contracts with private-sector firms. The government chooses between two contractual forms: grants and cooperative agreements. The latter provides the government substantially greater discretion over, and monitoring of, project progress. Using novel data on R&D contracts and on the geo-location and technical expertise of each government scientist over a 12-year period, we test implications from the organizational economics and contracting literatures. We find that cooperative agreements are more likely to be used for early-stage projects and those for which local government scientific personnel have relevant technical expertise; in turn, cooperative agreements yield greater innovative output as measured by patents, controlling for endogeneity of contract form. The results are consistent with multi-task agency and transaction-cost approaches that emphasize decision rights and monitoring.
H57|The Impact of Industry Consolidation on Government Procurement: Evidence from Department of Defense Contracting|We study the relationship between market structure and public procurement outcomes. In particular, we ask whether and to what extent consolidation-driven increases in industry concentration affect the way in which the government procures its goods and services. We focus on the defense industry, by far the largest contributor to federal procurement spending in the U.S. This industry experienced a sharp increase in the level of concentration during the 1990s, driven by a series of large mergers between defense contractors. Using detailed microdata on Department of Defense (DoD) contract awards, we estimate the causal effect of industry concentration on a series of procurement outcomes, leveraging the differential impact of these mergers across product markets. We find that market concentration caused the procurement process to become less competitive, with an increase in the share of spending awarded without competition, or via single-bid solicitations. Increased concentration also induced a shift from the use of fixed-price contracts towards cost-plus contracts. However, we find no evidence that consolidation led to a significant increase in acquisition costs of large weapon systems, nor to increased spending at the product market level. We infer that the government’s buyer power, especially relevant in this context given the government is often the only purchaser, constrained firms from exercising any additional market power gained by consolidation.
H57|Mapping the OECD Government Procurement Taxonomy with International Best Practices: An Implementation to ASEAN Countries|The OECD developed a taxonomy of measures affecting government procurement which provides a classification system for different GP measures, policies and procedures, which can impact cross-border government procurement. This project aims to further assist countries in assessing their procurement regimes by mapping the taxonomy against international good practices. The project maps the taxonomy against both the WTO Government Procurement Agreement and the UNCITRAL Model Law on Public Procurement (2011). It further tests this methodology with data collection in four ASEAN countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Viet Nam).
H57|Number of Bidders and the Winner’s Curse|Within an affiliated value auction setting, we study the relationship between the number of bidders and the winner’s curse in terms of its frequency of occurrence and its expected harm. From a design perspective, we find that both the number of bidders and the level of affiliation are instrumental when choosing an auction format and whether to encourage or discourage bidder participation.
H57|Does Leadership Matter for Healthcare Service Quality? Evidence from NHS England|In this paper we provide first-hand evidence that leadership quality matters for the quality of healthcare provision, based on NHS England hospital trust data between 2010 and 2014. This is the first paper to study this relationship using individual leadership styles, namely, task-, relations-, change- and integrity-oriented, and for different metrics of quality of healthcare provision, including staff and patient satisfaction survey measures and clinical performance indicators. We find that task-oriented leadership has the strongest relationship with staff-rated hospital quality while change-oriented leadership relates most to patient satisfaction and the clinical measure. We also find some evidence that organizational autonomy and competition across hospitals moderates the effect of leadership quality on healthcare quality. Overall, our results indicate that ideal healthcare leaders should behave as integrated leaders and that leadership matters at all levels of organizational hierarchy. This has important policy implications for continued support for the development and funding of integrated leadership programs in healthcare.
H57|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.
H57|Government Procurement and the Growth of Small Firms|I estimate the causal effects of demand shocks, stemming from government procurement, on the growth of small firms in Ecuador. I assemble a unique dataset using several new administrative sources and, as identification strategy, exploit a governmental procurement process that allocates public contracts through a randomized contest. This paper provides three main contributions to the literature. First, it shows the positive and significant effect of demand shocks on firm growth. On average, an increase in demand of 10% will increase wage expenses by 4% and fixed assets by 5% during the year of the shock. Second, it finds no evidence of spill-over effects from demand shocks on sales to the public or private sector. Finally, as in other studies, it is shown that demand positively impacts firm growth but, contrary to other findings, this effect is temporary and only observed during the year of the shock.
H57|Innovation induced by public procurement: A firm-level analysis for Italy and Norway|In this paper, we focus on public procurement for innovation. We provide a broad characterization of the firms involved in “innovative public procurement” as opposed to firms participating in “regular” (i.e. non innovative) public procurement, including those firms that perform innovation in an autonomous way (i.e. not related to public procurement). Moreover, we identify the main determinants of the firms’ propensity to innovate, when innovative activities are related to a public procurement contract. We carry out this study by using micro-data from two Community Innovation Surveys for Italian and Norwegian firms, which have released information on firms having public procurement contracts. Our main findings highlight important differences between firms engaged in regular or innovative public procurement, in particular regarding the role of firm size and sectors, the presence of in-house R&D activities and the educational level of employees.
H57|Bid Rigging And Entry Deterrence In Public Procurement: Evidence From An Investigation Into Collusion And Corruption In Quebec|We study the impact of an investigation into collusion and corruption to learn about the organization of cartels in public procurement auctions. Our focus is on MontrealÂ’s asphalt industry, where there have been allegations of bid rigging, market segmentation, complementary bidding and bribes to bureaucrats, and where, in 2009, a police investigation was launched. We collect procurement data and use a difference-in-difference approach to compare outcomes before and after the investigation in Montreal and in Quebec City, where there have been no allegations of collusion or corruption. We find that entry and participation increased, and that the price of procurement decreased. We then decompose the price decrease to quantify the importance of two aspects of cartel organization, coordination and entry deterrence, for collusive pricing. We find that the latter explains only a small part of the decrease.
H57|Bayesian Implementation and Rent Extraction in a Multi-Dimensional Procurement Problem|We consider a multi-dimensional procurement problem in which sellers have private information about their costs and about a possible design flaw. The information about the design flaw is necessarily correlated. We solve for the optimal Bayesian procurement mechanism that implements the efficient allocation under the constraint that sellers are protected by limited liability. We show that the rents obtained from reporting costs truthfully can be used to reduce the rents sellers must get for reporting the flaw. We compare the optimal Bayesian mechanism to the optimal ex post incentive compatible mechanism that is informationally less demanding.
H57|Barriers to Public Procurement: A Review and Recent Patterns in the EU|The international dimension of public procurement has gained in importance in the last decade and has attracted the attention of economist and policy makers. A number of trade agreements were signed with the intention to remove barriers to procurement markets and favour entry of foreign firms and products. However, empirical evidence shows that, despite the existence of trade agreements, discrimination towards foreign firms still applies in a number of countries around the world. In this paper, we discuss the methodologies used in the economic literature for the identification of overt and covert barriers to public tenders and some empirical evidence from the EU, TED database. We stress the importance of collecting high quality data for meliorating the ability of international traders to detect procurement barriers.
H57|Efficiency versus transaction costs in multidimensional auctions: the case of Brazilian oil and gas lease auctions|In Brazil, a scoring auction decides which firm has the right to explore oil and gas in a region. One of its dimensions is the amount of local content that firms are willing to implement. However, local content programs are subject to significant uncertainty and complexity so mal-adaptation costs are relevant. We characterize players’ bidding behavior when they have information on local content implementation and when they do not. We test those predictions using historical bids. Our tests suggest that the mechanism would be more efficient if the definition of local content programs was left out of the auction.
H57|Public works procurement in the new code: a legal and economic assessment of the main measures|In the light of the economic literature, this paper provides an analysis of the main measures for public works, introduced by the new Public Contracts Code, in order to assess whether they could help to solve the problems of the Italian market, characterized by fragmented public demand and a high level of cost overruns and delays in the execution phase. The paper highlights both the progress made, also thanks to the recently approved corrective decree, and the remaining shortcomings, such as the inconsistencies in the definition of the contracting authorities’ qualification requirements and firms’ rating factors, as well as the uncertainties affecting the wider margins of autonomy and flexibility granted to the contracting authorities. Overcoming these problems will also depend on the ANAC as a regulatory body that supports the functioning of the system. Moreover, both before and after the execution phase of works, the legal framework still needs to be completed with the introduction of independent reviews of the projects’ ex-ante appraisals and the definition of a systematic process for ex-post evaluations of finished projects.
H57|Market Power in the Capacity Market? The Case of Ireland|An electricity market coupled with a capacity market is modelled as a two-stage game that allows for strategic behaviour both in the electricity market and in the capacity market. The model is applied to the Irish electricity market, where a capacity market based on reliability options is established by the end of 2017. As Ireland has one dominant firm in the electricity market, there have been concerns that the new market design provides it an opportunity to abuse market power in these two markets. Using Ireland as an example this article examines the kinds of strategic behaviours that can be expected if a capacity market is implemented in an imperfectly competitive market. It is found that the potential for the abuse of market power in the capacity market is significant for the dominant firm in Ireland and that there is no simple way to mitigate it. The relative amount of procured capacity, the amount and characteristics of potential entrants, and the competitiveness of the electricity market are the main determinants of the possibilities and incentives for abusing market power in the capacity market.
H57|Costs of Building a 355-Ship Navy|CBO estimates that construction costs to build a fleet of 355 ships would average $26.6 billion (in 2017 dollars) per year over the next 30 years, which is 60 percent more than what the Navy has spent on average over the past 30 years. In addition, operating costs for a larger fleet would increase substantially compared with those of todayâ€™s Navy.
H57|Approaches for Managing the Costs of U.S. Nuclear Forces, 2017 to 2046|The Obama Administrationâ€™s 2017 plans for nuclear forces would cost about $1.2 trillion (in 2017 dollars) over the 2017â€“2046 period, CBO estimates. About $400 billion of that total would pay for modernization, according to CBOâ€™s assessment of the most recent detailed plans for the Departments of Defense and Energy. CBO analyzed nine options that would reduce the 30-year costs of nuclear forces by between 2 percent and 11 percent if they were implemented for the next generation of systems (and more if they were implemented now).
H57|Tenure in Office and Public Procurement|"We study the impact of politicians' tenure in office on the outcomes of public procurement using a dataset on Italian municipal governments. To identify a causal relation, we first compare elections where the incumbent mayor barely won or barely lost another term. We then use the introduction of a two-term limit, which granted one potential extra term to mayors appointed before the reform. The main result is that an increase in tenure is associated with ""worse"" procurement outcomes. Our estimates are informative of the possibility that time in office progressively leads to collusion between government officials and local bidders."
H57|Contracting out the Last-Mile of Service Delivery: Subsidized Food Distribution in Indonesia|Outsourcing government service provision to private firms can improve efficiency and reduce rents, but there are risks that non-contractible quality will decline and that reform could be blocked by vested interests exactly where potential gains are greatest. We examine these issues by conducting a randomized field experiment in 572 Indonesian localities in which a procurement process was introduced that allowed citizens to bid to take over the implementation of a subsidized rice distribution program. This led 17 percent of treated locations to switch distributors. Introducing the possibility of outsourcing led to a 4.6 percent reduction in the markup paid by households. Quality did not suffer and, if anything, households reported the quality of the rice improved. Bidding committees may have avoided quality problems by choosing bidders who had relevant experience as traders, even if they proposed slightly higher prices. Mandating higher levels of competition by encouraging additional bidders further reduced prices. We document offsetting effects of having high rents at baseline: when the initial price charged was high and when baseline satisfaction levels were low, entry was higher and committees were more likely to replace the status quo distributor; but, incumbents measured to be more dishonest on an experimental measure of cheating were also more likely to block the outsourcing process. We find no effect on price or quality of providing information about program functioning without the opportunity to privatize, implying that the observed effect was not solely due to increased transparency. On net, the results suggest that contracting out has the potential to improve performance, though the magnitude of the effects may be partially muted due to push back from powerful elites.
H57|Prizes versus Contracts as Incentives for Innovation|The procurement of an innovation involves motivating a research effort to generate a new idea and then implementing that idea efficiently. If research efforts are unverifiable and implementation costs are private information, a trade-off arises between the two objectives. The optimal mechanism resolves the tradeoff via two instruments: a monetary prize and a contract to implement the project. The optimal mechanism favors the innovator in contract allocation when the value of innovation is above a certain threshold, and handicaps the innovator in contract allocation when the value of innovation is below that threshold. A monetary prize is employed as an additional incentive but only when the value of innovation is sufficiently high.
H57|Procurement with Unforeseen Contingencies|The procurement of complex projects is often plagued by large cost overruns. One important reason for these additional costs are flaws in the initial design. If the project is procured with a price-only auction, sellers who spotted some of the flaws have no incentive to reveal them early. Each seller prefers to conceal his information until he is awarded the contract and then renegotiate when he is in a bilateral monopoly position with the buyer. We show that this gives rise to three inefficiencies: inefficient renegotiation, inefficient production and inefficient design. We derive the welfare optimal direct mechanism that implements the efficient allocation at the lowest possible cost to the buyer. The direct mechanism, however, imposes strong assumptions on the buyer\'s prior knowledge of possible flaws and their payoff consequences. Therefore, we also propose an indirect mechanism that implements the same allocation but does not require any such prior knowledge. The optimal direct and indirect mechanisms separate the improvement of the design and the selection of the seller who produces the good.
H57|Can Audits Backfire? Evidence from Public Procurement in Chile|Audits are generally intended to monitor compliance with existing rules. However, audits can also create unintended impacts and incentives through the specific protocol by which they are executed. In particular, audits can discourage the use of complex administrative procedures with more rules for auditors to check. This paper investigates the effects of procurement audits on public entities' choice of purchase procedures in Chile. While the national procurement legislation tries to promote the use of more transparent and competitive auctions rather than discretionary direct contracts for selection of suppliers, auctions are significantly more complex and the audit protocol mechanically leads to more scrutiny and a higher probability of further investigation for auctions than for direct contracts. Using a regression discontinuity design based on a scoring rule of the National Comptroller Agency, we find that audits lead to a decrease in the use of auctions and a corresponding increase in the use of direct contracts. In order to further test the underlying mechanism, we develop a new approach to conduct subgroup analysis in regression discontinuity designs while holding other observables constant.
H57|Decentralization and Public Procurement Performance: New Evidence from Italy|We exploit a new dataset based on EU procurement award notices to investigate the relationship between the degree of centralization of public procurement and its performance. We focus on the case of Italy, where all levels of government, along with a number of other public institutions, are involved in procurement and are subject to the same EU regulation. We find that i) municipalities and utilities, which currently award the largest shares of contracts, perform worse than all other institutional categories; and ii) decentralization implies lower performance only when it comes with weak competences of procurement officials. The evidence seems to suggests that a re-organization of the procurement system, both in terms of partial centralization and better professionalization of procurement officials, would help improve overall procurement performance.
H57|Equilibrium Competition, Social Welfare and Corruption in Procurement Auctions|We study the effects of corruption on equilibrium competition and social welfare in a public procurement auction. In our model, firms are invited to the auction at positive costs, and a bureaucrat who runs the auction on behalf of a government may request a bribe from the winning Örm. We Örst present the over-invitation results in the absence of corruption, in which more than a socially optimal number of firms will be invited. Second, we show that the e§ects of corruption on equilibrium outcomes vary across di§erent forms of bribery. For a Öxed bribe, corruption has no e§ect on equilibrium competition, although it does induce social welfare loss. For a proportional bribe, a corrupt bureaucrat may invite fewer or more firms to the auction depending on how much he weights his personal interest relative to the government payoff. Thus, corruption may result in either Pareto-improving or deteriorating allocations. Finally, we show that information disclosure may consistently induce more firms to be invited, regardless of whether there is corruption.

H57|The European space-industrial complex: New myths, old realities|This article is an economic analysis of the main factors affecting the evolution of the European space industry. The critical role of the government is analyzed with regard to both military alliances and civilian intergovernmental collaboration. The analysis explores how moving from a pure public goods paradigm in collaborative projects toward a commercially-oriented, competitiveness-enhancing paradigm leads to duplication of effort and rivalries within the space agencies and other organizations. Drawing on the example of defense alliances such as NATO, the article illustrates cooperation challenges faced both at European and transatlantic levels as competition and rivalry result from inter-alliance specialization and the difficulties involved in the allocation of benefits.
H57|Global perspectives on the European arms industries|The authors of this article offer perspectives on the symposium on the European arms industries published in volume 12, number 1 of The Economics of Peace and Security Journal. The symposium contributions cover the history, current situation, and likely future prospects of the European naval, land armaments, military helicopter, aerospace, and outer space industries. The perspectives then comment on the articles as a group and do so from a global vantage point inasmuch as the commentators constitute a group of prominent researchers and policy analysts drawn from around the world.
H57|Public Procurement in India: Assessment of Institutional Mechanism, Challenges, and Reforms|The present study assesses the public procurement system and recent reform initia-tives in India and outlines the need for changes in the institutional frameworks. There are several issues in the public procurement activities in India, which stem from fragmented pro-cedures and rules, lack of transparency, widespread irregularities, and unavailability of suf-ficient procurement professionals. The recent initiatives to establish a consistent and trans-parent public procurement system have not yielded the desired results. The emergence of the practice of e-procurement as a vital tool in integrating the public service delivery and good governance, however, shows some forward movement towards a transparent, accountable, and competitive procurement regime. Although General Financial Rules (GFRs) and other procurement manuals are exhaustive in nature, these need to be backed by legislative power.
H57|Court Efficiency and Procurement Performance|Disputes over penalties for breaching a contract are often resolved in court. A simple model illustrates how inefficient courts can sway public buyers from enforcing a penalty for late delivery in order to avoid litigation, thereby inducing sellers to delay contract delivery. By using a large dataset on Italian public procurement, we empirically study the effects of court inefficiency on public work performance. Where courts are inefficient, we find the following: public works are delivered with longer delays; delays increase for more valuable contracts; contracts are more often awarded to larger suppliers; and a higher share of the payment is postponed after delivery. Other interpretations receive less support from the data.
H57|Sophisticated Bidders in Beauty-Contest Auctions|"We study bidding behavior by firms in beauty-contest auctions, i.e., auctions in which the winning bid is the one which gets closest to some function (average) of all submitted bids. Using a dataset on public procurement beauty-contest auctions, we show that firms' observed bidding behavior departs from equilibrium and can be predicted by a ""sophistication"" index, which captures the firms' capacity of bidding close to optimality in the past. We show that our empirical evidence is consistent with a Cognitive Hierarchy model of bidders' behavior. We also investigate whether and how firms learn to bid strategically through experience."
H57|On the benefits of set-asides|Set-asides programs consist in forbidding access to specific participants, and they are commonly used in procurement auctions. We show that when the set of potential participants is composed of an incumbent (who bids for sure if allowed to) and of entrants who show up endogenously (in such a way that their expected rents are fixed by outside options), then it is always beneficial for revenues to exclude the incumbent in the second-price auction. This exclusion principle is generalized to auction formats that favor the incumbent in the sense that he would always gets the good when he values it most. By contrast, set-asides need not be desirable if the incumbent's payoff is included into the seller's objective or in environments with multiple incumbents. Various applications are discussed.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another ve<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H57|From fixed to state-dependent duration in public-private partnerships|A government delegates a build-operate-transfer project to a private OÌˆrm. In the contracting stage, the operating cost is unknown. The OÌˆrm can increase the likelihood of facing a low cost, rather than a high cost, by exerting costly eÂ§ort when building the infrastructure. Once this is in place, the OÌˆrm learns the true cost and begins to operate. We show that, under limited commitment, if the break-up of the partnership is suÂ¢ciently costly to the government and/or information problems are suÂ¢ciently severe, the contract is not robust to renegotiation unless it has a longer duration when the realized cost is low. This result is at odds with the prescription of the literature on aÌ exible-term contracts, which recommends a longer duration when operating conditions are unfavourable.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
H57|Accountability in Complex Procurement Tenders|This paper addresses the issue of favoritism at the design stage of complex procurement auctions. A local community of citizens wants to procure a complex good or project and lacks the ability to translate its preferences into operational technical specifications. This task is delegated to a public officer who may collude with one of the firms at the design stage of the procurement auction in exchange of a bribe. Assuming that it is prohibitively costly to provide a justification for many aspects, we investigate two simple accountability mechanisms that ask the public officer to justify one aspect of the project, with the threat of being punished if he fails: a random challenge mechanism and an alert-based mechanism that requires justifying one aspect on which the rivals of the winning contractor send a red ag. Relying on losing contractors enables the community to deter favoritism significantly more easily than the random challenge procedure as it allows to use information that is shared by potential contractors in the industry. The level of penalty needed to fully deter corruption is lower, independent of the complexity of the project and depends on the degree of differentiation within the industry. Below this threshold, favoritism occurs in some states of nature and we characterize and compare the different equilibrium patterns of corruption under both mechanisms. A more elaborate example suggests that the alert-based mechanism tends to lead to more standard specifications of projects.
H57|How many want to drive the bus? Analyzing the number of bids for public transport bus contracts|This paper examines how different factors related to contract characteristics and the operational and tender environments affect the number of unique bidders placing bids in tenders for bus contracts. A generalized Poisson model is used with a comprehensive data set containing most of the recently tendered bus contracts in Sweden, spanning the period 2007–2015.
H57|The distance factor in Swedish bus contracts: how far are operators willing to go?|One of the factors differentiating operators the most in bus services is, arguably, the respective distances from their workplaces to the area of a procured contract. More dead running kilometers implies higher costs, and the same should affect operators’ probability to participate in tenders. As previous studies have discussed, this is a relevant competitive factor, but the transport literature lacks studies aiming to assess the size of this distance factor. This paper examines what impact operators’ distance to tendered bus contracts has on their probability to participate in the tender, and how this probability differs across operator types. To address this, an econometric analysis was undertaken using probit regressions with data on tendered Swedish bus contracts over the period 2007–2015 along with operator workplace data. The results show that operators’ distance from a contract has a significantly negative effect on their probability of placing a bid for the contract. While being located near the contract gives, on average, an over 90 percent probability of participating, being 10 kilometers away results in a 30 percent probability. The rival’s distance to the contract also has an effect, but only to a limited extent. Large operators are found to be less affected by their distance to a contract, and they are also more inclined to bid if the procuring authority offers a depot to use.
H57|Allotment in first-price auctions: an experimental investigation|Abstract We experimentally study the effects of allotment—the division of an item into homogeneous units—in independent private value auctions. We compare a bundling first-price auction with two equivalent treatments where allotment is implemented: a two-unit discriminatory auction and two simultaneous single-unit first-price auctions. We find that allotment in the form of a discriminatory auction generates a loss of efficiency with respect to bundling. In the allotment treatments, we observe large and persistent bid spread, and the discriminatory auction is less efficient than simultaneous auctions. We provide a unified interpretation of our results that is based on both a non-equilibrium response to the coordination problem characterizing the simultaneous auction format and a general class of behavioral preferences that includes risk aversion, joy of winning and loser’s regret as specific cases.
H57|Economic importance of the Belgian ports: Flemish maritime ports, Liège port complex and the port of Brussels - Report 2015|This paper is an annual publication issued by the Microeconomic Analysis service of the National Bank of Belgium. The Flemish maritime ports (Antwerp, Ghent, Ostend, Zeebrugge), the Autonomous Port of Liège and the port of Brussels play a major role in their respective regional economies and in the Belgian economy, not only in terms of industrial activity but also as intermodal centers facilitating the commodity flow. This update paper1 provides an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports, the Liège port complex and the port of Brussels for the period 2010 - 2015, with an emphasis on 2015. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, the report also provides some information based on the social balance sheet and an overview of the financial situation in these ports as a whole. These observations are linked to a more general context, along with a few cargo statistics. Annual accounts data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. The indirect effects of the activities concerned were estimated in terms of value added and employment, on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. As a result of the underlying calculation method the changes of indirect employment and indirect value added can differ from one another. The developments concerning economic activity in the six ports in 2014 - 2015 are summarized in the table on the next page. In 2015 the growth of maritime traffic in the Flemish maritime ports was due to developments in the port of Antwerp and the port of Ghent. Direct value added increased in all Flemish maritime ports in 2015. However, direct employment is continuing to decline. Investment was down everywhere except in the port of Zeebrugge. Cargo traffic in the Liège port complex declined in 2015, whereas it slightly slowed down in the port of Brussels. At the same time, direct value added in Liège shrank while it rose sharply in the port of Brussels. By contrast, direct employment was down in both ports. This report provides a comprehensive account of these issues, giving details for each economic sector, although the comments are confined to the main changes that occurred in 2015.
H57|Can Audits Backfire? Evidence from Public Procurement in Chile|Audits are generally intended to monitor compliance with existing rules. However, audits can also create unintended effects and incentives through the specific protocol by which they are executed. In particular, audits can discourage the use of complex administrative procedures with more rules for auditors to check. This paper investigates the effects of procurement audits on public entities' choice of purchase procedures in Chile. While the national procurement legislation tries to promote the use of more transparent and competitive auctions rather than discretionary direct contracts for selection of suppliers, auctions are significantly more complex and the audit protocol mechanically leads to more scrutiny and a higher probability of further investigation for auctions than for direct contracts. Using a regression discontinuity design based on a scoring rule of the National Comptroller Agency, we find that audits lead to a decrease in the use of auctions and a corresponding increase in the use of direct contracts. In order to further test the underlying mechanism, we develop a new approach to conduct subgroup analysis in regression discontinuity designs while holding other observables constant.
H57|Public Procurement in India: Assessment of Institutional Mechanism, Challenges, and Reforms|The present study assesses the public procurement system and recent reform initiatives in India and outlines the need for changes in the institutional frameworks.
H57|Enhancing public sector efficiency and effectiveness in the Czech Republic|Spending on public administration itself is relatively low and so are indicators of its performance. Challenges include wastage in public procurement, insufficient management of the investment cycle and high levels of staff turnover. This paper considers ways of building on recent reforms, including better procedures for EU-financed projects and the new Civil Service Act, to raise the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector. Performance monitoring is underused but could help drive improvements in service delivery. The structure of local government, which includes over 6 200 municipalities, exacerbates the challenges of the public administration by complicating co-ordination and stretching capacity. Accordingly, the second part of the paper focuses on ways of improving the efficiency and quality of public service delivery and realising greater benefits from decentralisation. Rendre le secteur public plus efficient et fonctionnel dans la République tchèque Les dépenses consacrées à l'administration publique proprement dite sont relativement faibles, et il en va de même de ses performances. Parmi les défis à relever, on peut citer notamment des gaspillages dans les marchés publics, une gestion insatisfaisante du cycle d'investissement et une rotation rapide des personnels. Le présent article est consacré aux moyens qui permettraient de prolonger les réformes récentes, en s’appuyant par exemple sur une amélioration des procédures qui régissent les projets financés par l'UE et sur la nouvelle loi sur la fonction publique, qui vise à rendre le secteur public plus efficace et plus efficient. Le suivi des résultats est peu pratiqué alors qu'il pourrait entraîner des progrès dans la prestation des services. La structure des collectivités locales, avec plus de 6 200 communes, aggrave les problèmes d'administration publique en compliquant la coordination et en dispersant les capacités. La deuxième partie de l’article porte donc sur les moyens d'améliorer l'efficience et la qualité de la prestation de services publics ainsi que de mieux tirer parti de la décentralisation.
H57|OECD taxonomy of measures affecting trade in government procurement processes|This paper develops a taxonomy of government procurement (GP) measures to provide a basis for further analysis. It aims to undertake a more comprehensive, albeit not exhaustive, collection of GP barriers across countries, and to develop a classification system of GP measures to facilitate further data collection and analysis. The output is a taxonomy of different GP measures, policies and procedures which can impact cross-border public procurement.
H57|How government procurement measures can affect trade|A number of countries used discriminatory government procurement policies as part of stimulus packages designed to alleviate the effects of the global economic crisis. This paper collates and updates the evidence related to the size of procurement markets, the level of home bias they exhibit, and the effectiveness of multilateral and bilateral procurement agreements in reducing that bias. The share of procurement in GDP has been increasing gradually since 1995 with clear spikes during 2000-2002 and 2008-2010, the latter in response to the global economic crisis. The analysis presents evidence of domestic bias in government procurement markets, bias which has been increasing over recent years. The analysis in this paper suggests that the results of international efforts to address home bias in government procurement have been mixed to date. The World Trade Organisation's Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) is found to reduce discrimination in procurement markets, although available -- but limited -- evidence does not indicate a significant effect for bilateral agreements. The evidence suggests liberalisation of investment barriers undertaken in parallel with trade agreements increases the ability of those agreements to reduce discrimination. This suggests that countries negotiating procurement agreements could also benefit from negotiating investment agreements in parallel.
H57|Pre- and post-award outsourcing: Temporary partnership versus subcontracting in public procurement|This paper studies the impact of qualification rules for entry into public procurement auctions on firm bids and contract execution, contributing to the debate about which regulations foster the efficient participation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Using rich and detailed microdata on all public work contracts awarded by the regional government of Valle d’Aosta from 2000 to 2008, we investigate the differences between pre-award outsourcing by temporary partnerships (TPs) and post-award outsourcing by firms in optional or mandatory subcontracting. We find that both outsourcing status and firm size affect bids and the probability of time and cost overruns. TPs bid lower prices than mandatory and large optional firms and perform well in contract execution, similar to small optional firms. Mandatory firms are more likely to exceed expected cost and are no better in timely delivery. The evidence holds when we disentangle horizontal and vertical subcontracting. Our results highlight the TPs’ advantage of freedom in choosing economic size and technical boundaries before entering the auction.
H57|Evaluating the effectiveness of the Procurement Acts in public financial administration; the case study in Ghana|This paper dissect into the deepest fiber of Ghana Procurement Acts, empirically examine it effectiveness and economic impact on Public Financial Administration and define the required improvement
H57|Auctions versus Negotiations|For the procurement of complex goods the early exchange of information is important to avoid costly renegotiation. If the buyer can specify the main characteristics of possible design improvements in a complete contingent contract, a scoring auction implements the efficient allocation. If this is not feasible, the buyer must choose between a price-only auction (discouraging early information exchange) and bilateral negotiations with a preselected seller (reducing competition). Bilateral negotiations are superior if potential design improvements are important, if renegotiation is particularly costly, and if the buyer\'s bargaining position is strong. Moreover, negotiations provide stronger incentives for sellers to investigate design improvements.
H57|Sequential versus static screening: An equivalence result|We show that every sequential screening model is equivalent to a standard text book static screening model. We use this result and apply well-established techniques from static screening to obtain solutions for classes of sequential screening models for which standard sequential screening techniques are not applicable. Moreover, we identify the counterparts of well-understood features of the static screening model in the corresponding sequential screening model such as the single-crossing condition and conditions that imply the optimality of deterministic schedules.
H57|Ex-post optimal knapsack procurement|We consider a budget-constrained mechanism designer who selects an optimal set of projects to maximize her utility. Projects may differ in their value for the designer, and their cost is private information. In this allocation problem, the quantity of procured projects is endogenously determined by the mechanism. The designer faces ex-post constraints: the participation and budget constraints must hold for each possible outcome, while the mechanism must be strategyproof. We identify settings in which the class of optimal mechanisms has a deferred acceptance auction representation which allows an implementation with a descending-clock auction. Only in the case of symmetric projects do price clocks descend synchronously such that the cheapest projects are implemented. The case in which values or costs are asymmetrically distributed features a novel tradeoff between quantity and quality. The reason is that guaranteeing allocation to the most favorable projects under strategyproofness comes at a price of a diminished expected number of implemented projects.
H57|Procurement with Unforeseen Contingencies|The procurement of complex projects is often plagued by large cost overruns. One important reason for these additional costs are flaws in the initial design. If the project is procured with a price-only auction, sellers who spotted some of the flaws have no incentive to reveal them early. Each seller prefers to conceal his information until he is awarded the contract and then renegotiate when he is in a bilateral monopoly position with the buyer. We show that this gives rise to three inefficiencies: inefficient renegotiation, inefficient production and inefficient design. We derive the welfare optimal direct mechanism that implements the efficient allocation at the lowest possible cost to the buyer. The direct mechanism, however, imposes strong assumptions on the buyer's prior knowledge of possible flaws and their payoff consequences. Therefore, we also propose an indirect mechanism that implements the same allocation but does not require any such prior knowledge. The optimal direct and indirect mechanisms separate the improvement of the design and the selection of the seller who produces the good.
H57|Optimal Cost Overruns: Procurement Auctions With Renegotiation|Cost overrun is ubiquitous in public procurement. We argue that this can be the result of a constrained optimal award procedure: The procurer awards the contract via a price‐only auction and cannot commit not to renegotiate. If cost differences are more pronounced for a fancy than a standard design, it is optimal to fix the standard design ex ante. If renegotiation takes place and the fancy design has higher production costs or the contractor's bargaining position is strong, the final price exceeds the initial price. Moreover, the procurer cannot benefit from using a scoring auction.
H57|Teaching an old dog a new trick: reserve price and unverifiable quality in repeated procurement|In procurement markets, unverifiable quality provision may be obtained either by direct negotiation or by competitive processes which discriminate firms on the basis of their past performance. However, discrimination is not allowed in many institutional contexts. We show that a non-discriminatory competitive process with a reserve price may allow the buyer to yield an efficient allocation of the contract and to implement the level of quality desired by the buyer. Quality enforcement arises out of a relational contract whereby the buyer threatens to set a `low' reserve price in future competitive tendering processes if any contractor fails to provide the required quality. We study an infinitely repeated procurement model with many firms and one buyer imperfectly informed on the firms' cost, in which, in each period, the buyer runs a standard low-price auction with reserve price. We study the cases of players using grim trigger strategies, analysing both the case of a committed and uncommitted buyer. We find that a competitive process with reserve price is able to elicit the desired level of unverifiable quality provided that the buyer's valuation of the project is not too high and the value of quality is not too low; under these conditions, the buyer can credibly threaten the firms to set, in case a contractor fails to deliver the required quality level, a reserve price so low that no firm is willing to participate to the tender. A committed buyer can elicit the desired quality level for a wider range of preference parameters.
H57|Direct Propagation of a Fiscal Shock: Evidence from Italy's Stability Pact|This paper documents: the channels through which local governments propagate a fiscal shock; and the corresponding reaction by firms in the affected upstream sector (municipal procurement). The shock is provided by an Italian fiscal rule, called Patto di stabilita' dei comuni, which was tightened unexpectedly in 2008 and applied only to municipalities with population greater than 5,000. Using a difference-indifference identification strategy, we estimate that this shock led to a 13-20% reduction of infrastructure spending in treated municipalities, or equivalently, an 80% reduction in the average municipality. In contrast, current expenditure was not affected. In the upstream sector, i.e., the infrastructure procurement sector, firms reacted to the demand shock by cutting capital rather than labor. In both cases, then, the capital/investment sector is found to be a pre-eminent channel of direct shock propagation. In addition, the fiscal demand shock is found to propagate disproportionately through those private-sector firms which are most exposed to the shocked sector. This finding suggests that direct shock transmission depends on the higher moments of the exposure distribution, beyond the average sectoral exposure that is represented by the input-output linkages. Using procurement-market data we rule out the possibility that our estimates are attenuated by spillover effects operating through competition in the procurement market.
H57|Kurumsal Yaklaşım Perspektifinden İnovasyon ve Yenilikçi Kamu Alımları|Innovation policies and national innovation systems are the main determinant of countries development level. Innovative public procurement is an exceptional role among innovation policies. In this study examined innovative public procurement in the context of institutional approach. According to institutional approach countries’ innovation capacities are affected by formal and informal institutions and innovative public procurement process can be understood as a set of institutions with a particular inter-relationship between governmental institutions as a buyer and private firms as a suppliers. Therefore, government should set the rules for innovative public procurement process. Government should establish the formal rules for legal infrastructure, tender methods awarded to the firms offering innovative solutions, lead to firms for adequate and more effective level of R&D activities and increase competition in the market. On the other hand, government should give the sufficient importance to innovative solutions in public procurement process.
H57|The effect of old age pensions on child deprivation: revisiting the role of gender|Existing work suggests that the South African state old age pension, through, increasing female decision-making, has a positive impact on the well being of children. This study investigates this concept in two parts. Part 1 aims to answer the question of whether the old age pension has a different impact on child depravation depending on the gender of the pension recipient. Part 2 investigates whether the old age pension influences household decision-making dynamics. Using all four waves of the national income dynamics study, identification comes from comparing each individual before and after receiving a pension. This study finds some evidence of a gender bias by both male and female pension recipients; females favour girls while males favour boys. The effect of the state old age pension on child deprivation (as measured by weight for height) is however not found to be robust to different model specifications. This paper exploits the effect of income on bargaining power to explain the effect of pensions on the relative decision making power within a household. We find evidence of shifts in the decision-making dynamics with pension receipt. These shifts are greater when the pension recipient is female. The results indicate that resources held by grandmothers enable woman within the household to be primary decision makers. We conclude that the reason we see a differential effect on child outcomes depending on the gender of the pension recipient is because of a change in household decision-making dynamics. The gains in decision-making power of females, caused by the pensions, lead to lower child deprivation rates. The evidence indicates that although the state old age pension is meant for the elderly it has important implications for child deprivation. Some light is shed on the mechanism through which the pension results in positive impacts for children – by increasing the decision making power of women. The evidence supports the hypothesis that resource control matters for intra-household allocation.
H57|Buyouts and Agglomeration Bonuses in Wildlife Corridor Auctions|We present a general model of bidding behavior in wildlife corridor auctions. Given (i) some spatial configuration of landowners in a landscape, (ii) the landowners’ opportunity costs, and (iii) the value of establishing the corridor, our model predicts individual landowners’ bids, overall participation rates in the auction, as well as the expected net benefits to the conservation agency. We find that market efficiency of the auction increases in the number of potential corridors. We use simulations to compare a benchmark auction with two policy scenarios in a hypothetical landscape. In one scenario, members of a winning corridor receive an agglomeration bonus. In the other scenario, we buy out a pivotal landowner (one that is part of many potential corridors) prior to the auction. Given equal budgets for the agglomeration bonus and the buyout policy, an agglomeration bonus is less efficient than a buyout for conservation agencies facing low budgets, and vice versa. A risk-averse conservation agency is however always better off using a buyout policy.
H57|The Value of Revolving Doors in Public Procurement|This paper investigates the impact of revolving door movements on public procurement outcomes. We combine 10 years of procurement contracts in the Brazilian health sector with a comprehensive employer-employee dataset tracing individual job experience and characteristics to identify how movements of individuals between public administrations and private providers affect the total number of contracts, quantities, and acquisition prices. We analyze career changes in both directions between public bodies and private suppliers, and provide evidence of significant direct effects, spillovers to other firms and administrations, impact on workers’ remuneration, and on aggregate spending. We uncover positive and negative effects of revolving door on the efficiency of procurement, which are, respectively, consistent with reward for high-skill workers’ signaling competence and collusive behavior. In particular, we find that effects of administration-to-supplier connections are beneficial to public bodies, while effects of supplier-to-administration ones are detrimental. Their aggregate impacts on spending are, respectively, –3% and +2% of total procurement outlays. These results point to specific and unexpected policy implications related to the tolerance of revolving door practices.
H57|The Infant Industry Argument: Tariffs, NTMs and Innovation|One rationale for the infant industry argument is that, by protecting domestic firms from foreign competition, this increases rents and investment in innovation and other growth enhancing measures. Using data on 4,750 firms across 13 developing countries, we examine whether protection via tariffs or non-tariff measures (SPS and TBT specifically) increase innovation in either products or processes. We find no such evidence; instead we find a small negative impact of protection, particularly tariffs and TBTs, on innovation.
H57|In the Shadow of a Giant: Medicare’s Influence on Private Physician Payments|We analyze Medicare’s influence on private insurers’ payments for physicians’ services. Using a large administrative change in reimbursements for surgical versus medical care, we find that private prices follow Medicare’s lead. A $1.00 increase in Medicare’s fees increases corresponding private prices by $1.16. A second set of Medicare fee changes, which generates area-specific payment shocks, has a similar effect on private reimbursements. Medicare’s influence is strongest in areas with concentrated insurers and competitive physician markets, consistent with insurer-doctor bargaining. By echoing Medicare’s pricing changes, these payment spillovers amplify Medicare’s impact on specialty choice and other welfare-relevant aspects of physician practices.
H57|An Experimental Study on Sequential Auctions with Privately Known Capacities|We experimentally study bidding behavior in sequential first-price procurement auctions where bidders’ capacity constraints are private information. Treatment differs in the ex-ante probability distribution of sellers’ capacities and in the (exogenous) probability that the second auction is actually implemented. Our results show that: (i) bidding behavior in the second auction conforms with sequential rationality; (ii) while first auction’s bids negatively depend on capacity, bidders seem unable to recognize this link when, at the end of the first auction, they state their beliefs on the opponent’s capacity. To rationalize this inconsistency between bids and beliefs, we conjecture that bidding in the first auction is also affected by a hidden, behavioral type – related to the strategic sophistication of bidders – that obfuscates the link between capacity and bids. Building on this intuition, we show that a simple level-k model may help explain the inconsistency.
H57|Buyers' Ability and Discretion in Procurement: An Empirical Analysis on Standardised Medical Devices|Using a dataset of medical devices purchased by Italian Public Buyers (PBs), for each purchase, we measure the difference between each item's price and its marginal cost. We define PBs' ability in purchasing as PBs' fixed effect (FE) on that difference. We find that average prices vary substantially amongst PBs, and this variation is largely captured by PBs' FE. We then exploit the exogenous termination of the mandatory reference price regime to assess how discretion affects procurement performance, given each PB's ability. Our results highlight that reduced PBs' discretion - in presence of mandatory prices - determines efficiency gains and losses for low- and high-ability PBs, respectively.
H57|The impact of oil rents on military spending: Does corruption matter?|This study shows that the level of corruption matters in how oil rents affect the military spending within countries. Using panel data covering the 1984–2014 period for the Middle East and North Africa countries, we find that the effect of oil rents on military budget depends on the extent of political corruption. Oil wealth boosts military spending when corruption (measured by the re-scaled ICRG index) exceeds a critical score of 5 (out of 6) in the MENA region.
H57|The revised WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA): Key design features and significance for global trade and development|"The WTO's plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement (""the GPA"" or ""the Agreement"") is an important ongoing success story for the Organization. In March 2012, the GPA Parties completed a comprehensive revision of the Agreement, encompassing both its text and coverage (market access commitments). The revised GPA, the negotiating processes that led to its adoption and coming into force, and the continuing gradual broadening of its membership are of therefore interest for the evolution of the international trading system. The GPA's successful renegotiation, the continuing growth of its membership and its vitality as an instrument of public policy were not achieved through happenstance. The paper discusses a number of specific design features of the GPA that clearly facilitated the successful conclusion of the renegotiation and that, as such, may in the future be relevant to other areas of global trade liberalization. In addition to the Agreement's plurilateral nature, of particular interest are the approach taken with respect to application of the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle in the Agreement; the GPA's continuing strong emphasis on principles of reciprocity in market access concessions; and its approach to special and differential treatment for developing countries, in all of which it differs from approaches that are widely used in other WTO Agreements. Apart from the above, the GPA revision is important for the merging of trade and good governance concerns that it exemplifies. As discussed in the paper, the themes of governance and the sound management of public resources that are treated in the revised Agreement were not afterthoughts to the renegotiation; rather, they permeated the revised text and received focused attention from the Parties in their own right. As well, the GPA has direct implications for investment policy and for domestic economic reforms, and is an important tool of e-commerce. And, the revision has made possible very significant synergies between the GPA and other international instruments and activities in reducing barriers to participation and strengthening governance in public procurement markets. For all these reasons, the revised Agreement is likely to have a wider impact than meets the eye, and well merits the support and attention that it has received from the participating WTO Member governments."
H57|Is the Bureaucrat the Main Responsible for Corruption?|The combination of a simple game-theoretic interaction between two firms bidding for a public project and the possibility of moral hazard on the part of the public official who is in charge of this project results in the proposition that there cannot be corruption unless the public official signals so. The result is lower quantity and quality of the goods and services offered through public projects. The combination of a simple game-theoretic interaction between two firms bidding for a public project and the possibility of moral hazard on the part of the public official who is in charge of this project results in the proposition that there cannot be corruption unless the public official signals so.

H57|Is Environmental Policy by Public Procurement Effective?|Advocates of green public procurement (GPP) argue that the public sector can use its purchasing power to influence producers and consumers to reduce their negative impact on the environment. Our aim is to assess GPP as an environmental policy instrument and its ability to lead to the achievement of environmental objectives. Central to our analysis is the extent to which polluting firms choose to adapt to the public sectorâ€™s environmental requirements and to invest in greener technologies. Our theoretical finding is that the potential of GPP to function as an objective effective instrument of environmental policy is limited and can actually be counterproductive. From an environmental policy point of view, it is crucial that the GPP aims for an environmental standard beyond the technology of the polluting firms and is designed with reference to defined environmental objectives.
H57|The Determinants of the Contract of Corruption: Theory and Evidence|This paper develops the notion that corruption is a contract between a public official and a private agent and that the features of this contract depend on the allocation of bargaining power between the parties. Active corruption thus occurs when the public official fixes the terms of the contract and is otherwise considered passive. Employing Italian data on various corruption-based regional-level crimes, the paper empirically reassesses the causes of corruption. A simple theoretical model highlights the differences between these two forms of corruption in terms of bribery and emphasizes the implications both for aggregate corruption and its measurement.
H57|Contratos públicos adjudicados a sociedades cooperativas en el País Vasco entre 2010 y 2012<BR>[Public contracts awarded to cooperative societies in the Basque Country betweem 2010 and 1020]|La Contratación Pública constituye una fuente muy importante de la demanda de bienes y servicios, especialmente en la Comunidad Autónoma del País Vasco en donde el Gobierno Autonómico, también llamado la Administración General Vasca, desarrolla un papel capital como impulsor de dicha contratación pública. Por otro lado, la Economía Social, y especialmente el movimiento cooperativo, tiene en ese mismo ámbito geográfico un papel de gran peso en el conjunto de la Economía Vasca, por sus cifras de empleo y aportación al PIB, así como por tradición y arraigo social. Cabe preguntarse en tal caso, cuál es el papel que desempeñan las cooperativas en la Contratación Pública en aquella Comunidad Autónoma, cómo y cuáles son los contratos de los que resultan adjudicatarias, qué importes suponen esos contratos para las cuentas públicas y, en definitiva, si su papel de adjudicatarias se corresponde con el que desempeñan en el conjunto de la Economía Vasca. Del examen de los contratos publicados en el Perfil del Contratante del Gobierno Vasco, se obtienen datos suficientes que, una vez procesados y analizados, se visualizan en tablas y porcentajes que constituyen la base de un diagnóstico que responde a las preguntas planteadas y evidencia la situación de debilidad de las cooperativas en el campo de la contratación pública vasca.
H57|From broken windows to broken bonds: Militarized police and social fragmentation|Expansion of police militarization in the U.S. raises questions about how such policing affects society and minority communities. We estimate the impact of one particular aspect of police militarization—the Department of Defense’s Excess Property Program 1033—on civic engagement—which we capture primarily by examining charitable giving among households—via an instrumental variables approach. The instrument stems from plausibly exogenous variation in federal defense spending, which affects awareness of military culture and capabilities, and thus encourages the adoption of military equipment and tactics by local police departments. Estimates show that the 1033 Program has a fragmenting effect on society: As the transfer of surplus military equipment to local law enforcement increases, black households reduce their total charitable donations more than all other households.
H57|Staatliche Nachfrage als Treiber privater Forschungs- und Entwicklungsaktivitäten|Der Staat fragt Produkte und Dienstleistungen mit ganz unterschiedlichem technologischen Niveau nach – von Büroklammern bis zu Forschungssatelliten. Dieser Beitrag zeigt zunächst in einem theoretischen Modell, dass der Staat durch die technologische Intensität seiner Nachfrage den Markt für technologieintensive Produkte und Dienstleistungen erweitern kann. Denn eine stärkere staatliche Nachfrage nach innovativen Produkten und Dienstleistungen erlaubt es privaten Unternehmen, die überwiegend fixen Kosten für Forschung und Entwicklung auf größere Absatzmengen umzulegen, lässt die privaten Erträge aus Forschung und Entwicklung ansteigen und generiert somit zusätzliche Anreize, in die Entwicklung neuer Technologien zu investieren. Anhand von Daten aus den USA wird auch empirisch belegt, dass eine – budgetneutrale – Erhöhung der technologischen Intensität der staatlichen Nachfrage die privaten FuE-Ausgaben erhöht. Damit rückt die staatliche Nachfrage erneut in die Diskussion über mögliche Instrumente einer effektiven Wirtschafts- und Innovationspolitik.
H57|Dual Sourcing under Risky Public Procurement|This paper examines the provision of a public service subject to a risk of disruption. To hedge against this risk, a public authority may use a dual sourcing policy. Instead of awarding the production to one supplier, it may split it between two suppliers. If the primary supplier is disrupted, the production may still be provided by the secondary supplier. However, dual sourcing increases the procurement cost, since the secondary supplier might be more expensive than the primary one. The public authority thus faces a trade-off when deciding upon its procurement policy. This trade-off is analysed under asymmetry of information on the secondary supplier's cost. We therefore determine the choice of the appropriate set of suppliers and the quantity to be produced by each selected supplier. We then extend our model by allowing the primary supplier to exert an effort to reduce its probability of disruption. Finally, our model is extended to consider the influence of lobbying on the public authority's choice of procurement policy.
H57|Does the Technological Content of Government Demand Matter for Private R&D? Evidence from US States|Governments purchase everything from airplanes to zucchini. This paper investigates the role of the technological content of government procurement in innovation. In a theoretical model, we first show that a shift in the composition of public purchases toward high-tech products translates into higher economy-wide returns to innovation, leading to an increase in the aggregate level of private R&D. Using unique data on federal procurement in US states and performing panel fixed-effects estimations, we find support for the model's prediction of a positive R&D effect of the technological content of government procurement. Instrumental-variable estimations suggest a causal interpretation of our findings. (JEL H57, H76, O31, O32, O38)
H57|Detecting Bidders Groups in Collusive Auctions|We study entry and bidding in procurement auctions where contracts are awarded to the bid closest to a trimmed average bid. These auctions, common in public procurement, create incentives to coordinate bids to manipulate the bid distribution. We present statistical tests to detect coordinated entry and bidding choices. The tests perform well in a validation dataset where a court case makes coordination observable. We use the tests to detect coordination in a larger dataset where it is suspected, but not known. The results are used to interpret a major market shakeout following a switch to first price auctions. (JEL D44, D47, H57, R42)
H57|Corruption in Procurement and the Political Cycle in Tunneling: Evidence from Financial Transactions Data|"We provide evidence of corruption in allocation of public procurement and assess its efficiency. Firms with procurement revenue increase tunneling around regional elections, whereas neither tunneling of firms without procurement revenue, nor legitimate business of firms with procurement exhibits a political cycle. Data are consistent with the corruption channel—cash is tunneled to politicians in exchange for procurement contracts—and inconsistent with alternative channels. Using the strength of correlation between procurement revenue and tunneling around elections as a proxy for local corruption, we reject the ""efficient grease"" hypothesis: in more corrupt localities, procurement contracts go to unproductive firms. (JEL D22, D72, H57, K42, P26, P31, P37)"
H57|Can Electronic Procurement Improve Infrastructure Provision? Evidence from Public Works in India and Indonesia|This paper examines whether electronic procurement (e-procurement), which increases access to information and reduces personal interactions with potentially corrupt officials, improves procurement outcomes. We develop unique datasets from India and Indonesia and use variation in adoption of e-procurement within both countries. We find no evidence of reduced prices but do find that e-procurement leads to quality improvements. In India, where we observe quality directly, e-procurement improves road quality, and in Indonesia, e-procurement reduces delays. Regions with e-procurement are more likely to have winners come from outside the region. On net, the results suggest that e-procurement facilitates entry from higher quality contractors.
H57|Free Riding in Procurement Design|Low-powered contracts do not provide proper incentives to reduce cost; still empirical studies show that they are quite pervasive in public and private procurement. This paper argues that low-powered contracts arise due to a free-riding problem when the contractor enjoys economies of scale/scope working for different buyers. A buyer, offering a procurement contract to the contractor, does not fully internalize that higher-powered incentives provide cost reduction in the contractor's activities, benefiting other buyers. As a result, buyers offer lower-powered contracts than what would be designed by cooperative buyers. Strikingly, the higher the contractor's benefits from economies of scope/scale are, the lower the power of the procurement contracts will be. In addition, laws which force buyers to award fixed-price contracts can be welfare-enhancing.
H57|Pre-commercial procurement, procurement of innovative solutions and innovation partnerships in the EU: rationale and strategy| We discuss public procurement instruments for acquiring innovation, focusing on the European Pre-commercial Procurement, Procurement of Innovative Solutions and Innovation Partnerships. We analyse, in particular, how firms’ innovation incentives are affected by: (i) economies of scope and externalities between R&D and large-scale production; (ii) the degree of specificity of the innovation; (iii) the presence of Small and Medium Enterprises in the market and the level of market competition; (iv) the risk of market foreclosure and supplier lock-in. Our study contributes to the literature on incentives in demand-side innovation policy by tapping into the contractual design features and by offering relevant implications for academics and policy-makers.
H57|The Impact Of Artificial And Cognitive Intelligence On Romanian Public Procurement|This conceptual paper discusses the Romanian Public Procurement System in the context of the World Economic Forum (Davos, 2016) addressed trends. The paper addresses trends impacting public procurement in the context of artificial and cognitive intelligence and advances the hypothesis of a new age for public procurement. The paper is discussing possible impacts of the fourth industrial revolution on public procurement. The environment used to contextualize the information is Romania. The paper ends with arguments supporting a proposal for a new perspective on the Romanian public procurement system: that of a social system instead of a mechanistic one.
H57|Innovationsorientierte öffentliche Beschaffung und Leitmärkte: Politische Initiativen in der EU|The present study examines whether an innovation-oriented public procurement process can contribute to the development of lead markets. It is shown that the state, as a procurer of innovative products and services, respectively, can indeed influence leading market factors. Thus, the state can, with the procurement of a particular innovative design, generate a price advantage. However, it also appears that the state either cannot, or can only marginally, influence certain lead market factors. Furthermore, it will be shown that innovation-oriented public procurement may, under certain circumstances, maximize welfare. With the additional demand from the side of the state, the diffusion of innovative products can be accelerated. The study indicates that via innovation-oriented public procurement, lock-ins and path dependencies could be avoided or even eliminated. Moreover, an innovation-centric public procurement can lead to an increase in Research & Development (R&D) expenditures by private firms. Via this channel, a stronger public demand for innovative products and services gives rise to positive employment effects. So that innovation focused public procurement can lead to the emergence or development of lead markets and an expansions of R&D, in the past number of years an increasing number of political initiatives have been launched at the supranational, national and regional levels. Thus, as will be shown in the present study, procurement law at an EU-level was reformed with the goal of strengthening the public procurement of innovative products and services. The analysis shows that the reforms to EU procurement law will definitely have a beneficial effect on the extent of public acquisition of innovative products and services. In addition, this study explores the political initiatives of both the Federal Republic of Germany and the federal German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
H57|Does competition from private surgical centres improve public hospitals' performance? Evidence from the English National Health Service|This paper examines the impact of a government programme which facilitated the entry of for-profit surgical centres to compete against incumbent National Health Service hospitals in England. We examine the impact of competition from these surgical centres on the efficiency – measured by pre-surgery length of stay for hip and knee replacement patients – and case mix of incumbent public hospitals. We exploit the fact that the government chose the broad locations where these surgical centres (Independent Sector Treatment Centres or ISTCs) would be built based on local patient waiting times – not length of stay or clinical quality – to construct treatment and control groups that are comparable with respect to key outcome variables of interest. Using a difference-in-difference estimation strategy, we find that the government-facilitated entry of surgical centres led to shorter pre-surgery length of stay at nearby public hospitals. However, these new entrants took on healthier patients and left incumbent hospitals treating patients who were sicker. This paper highlights a potential trade-off that policymakers face when they promote competition from private, for-profit firms in markets for the provision of public services.
H57|Optimal Cost Overruns: Procurement Auctions and Renegotiation|Cost overrun is ubiquitous in public procurement. We argue that this can be the result of a constraint optimal award procedure when the procurer cannot commit not to renegotiate. If cost differences are more pronounced for more complex designs, it is optimal to fix a simple design ex ante and to renegotiate to a more complex and costlier design ex post. Specifying a simple design initially enhances competition in the auction. Moreover, the procurer cannot benefit from using a multi-dimensional auction, as the optimal scoring rule depends only on the price.
H57|Results Through Transparency: Does Publicity Lead to Better Procurement? - Working Paper 437|Governments buy about $9 trillion worth of goods and services a year, and their procurement policies are increasingly subject to international standards and institutional regulation including the WTO Plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement, Open Government Partnership commitments and International Financial Institution procurement rules. These standards focus on transparency and open competition as key tools to improve outcomes. While there is some evidence on the impact of competition on prices in government procurement, there is less on the impact of specific procurement rules including transparency on competition or procurement outcomes. Using a database of World Bank financed contracts, we explore the impact of a relatively minor procurement rule governing advertising on competition using regression discontinuity design and matching methods.
H57|La responsabilidad institucional pública: un análisis para el mejoramiento de la gestión y la gerencia en la administración pública|Las crecientes demandas de organizaciones sociales y defensoras de Derechos Humanos frente a la gestión de las Entidades públicas y privadas, exigen que éstas busquen superar la simple producción de bienes o servicios a usuarios internos y externos, en razón a que los ciudadanos reclaman una relación basada en su reconocimiento como sujetos de derechos y en una gestión ética que no se limite a la básica aplicación formal de normas legales. Desde esta perspectiva, en el marco de la Responsabilidad social y partiendo del concepto de lo público (en el que está implícito lo social), este estudio pretende señalar lineamientos para la construcción de la Responsabilidad Institucional Pública (RIP) -equivalente a la Responsabilidad Social Empresarial del sector privado-, con el fin de contribuir al fortalecimiento del sentido misional y legitimidad de las Entidades Estatales, desde una llamada a lo ético; ello, a partir de los resultados del diagnóstico de las prácticas de RIP evidenciadas en tres entidades del sector público colombiano: una entidad del nivel ejecutivo central, una empresa social del estado(ejecutora) y un organismo de control . De los resultados obtenidos se encuentra que, el factor que alcanza mayor coincidencia en la afirmación de tales prácticas, es el de transparencia (en lo que hace referencia al cumplimiento de requisitos formales); en tanto que el de desarrollo del capital humano, es en el que se da menor reconocimiento de su aplicación.
H57|Protection in government procurement auctions|Discrimination against foreign bidders in procurement auctions has typically been achieved by price preferences. We demonstrate that in the bidding game, each level of protection via a price preference can be achieved by an equivalent tariff. When government welfare depends only on net expenditures, this equivalence carries over to the government's decision. As such, this equivalence provides a justification that agreements to eliminate price preferences to be taken in tandem with agreements to lower tariffs; e.g., the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) in the broader context of the WTO.
H57|Optimal Cost Overruns: Procurement Auctions and Renegotiation|Cost overrun is ubiquitous in public procurement. We argue that this can be the result of a constraint optimal award procedure when the procurer cannot commit not to renegotiate. If cost differences are more pronounced for more complex designs, it is optimal to fix a simple design ex ante and to renegotiate to a more complex and costlier design ex post. Specifying a simple design initially enhances competition in the auction. Moreover, the procurer cannot benefit from using a multi-dimensional auction, as the optimal scoring rule depends only on the price.
H57|Design of public procurement auctions: evidence from cleaning contracts|We analyze a regime change from beauty contests to firstâ€ price sealedâ€ bid and scoring auctions, using Swedish data on public procurement of cleaning services. In beauty contests, the lowest bid often lost, leaving substantial money on the table. The procurement costs were similar before and after the regime change: (i) Entry strongly decreases the procurement cost but did not change. Entry would have decreased had the municipalities not adjusted the objects of auctions. (ii) Municipalities favored inâ€ house suppliers in the old regime, leading to more aggressive bidding by others. With favoritism reduced, these changes balanced each other out.
H57|Discrimination in Dynamic Procurement Design with Learning-by-doing|Discriminatory programs that favor local and small firms in government procurement are common in many countries. This paper studies the long-run impact of procurement discrimination on market structure and future competition in industries where learning-by-doing makes incumbent firms more efficient over time. We consider a sequential procurement design problem in which local and global firms compete for public good provision. Both firms benefit from learning-by-doing if they provide the public good in the previous period but global firms only may be able to transfer learning-by-doing from different markets. We find that the optimal procurement has to be biased in favor of the local firm even when all firms are symmetric with respect to their initial cost distribution. This bias fosters future competition and reduces intertemporal expected transfers to providers.
H57|Corruption and Incompetence in Public Procurement|We study a game where inefficiencies in public procurement managed by politicians comefrom two sources: corruption (moral hazard) and incompetence (adverse selection). We characterizethe respective impact of judicial and accounting courts on the cost effectiveness ofprocurement and the level of corruption. Although improving the quality of both courts mattersas a direct deterrent of corruption, it may also indirectly decrease the quality of the poolof politicians and hence deteriorates the cost efficiency of procurement.
H57|The Interactional Impact of Defense Expenditure and Arms Importation on Economic Growth in Nigeria: An Autoregressive Approach|Little is done on the empirical analyses of the impact of defense expenditure on arms and economic growth. The few conducted concentrated on developed countries, which are exporters of arms. This study examines the short-run and long-run impact of arms importation on the economic growth in Nigeria, using autoregressive distributed lag model. Literature on defense expenditure and economic growth are often conflicting and inconclusive. These outcomes are due to the non-linear growth effects of defense and incorrect model specifications. The crucial growth effects of defense expenditure can be traced by properly controlling the interaction term. This paper examines the defense-arms interaction on Nigeria in the context of Aizeiman and Glick (2006) models. The result reveals that defense-arms interaction in Nigeria exerts negatively on the economic growth. It therefore recommends that defense R and D as well Defense Industrial Cooperation of Nigeria should be properly financed and managed for efficiency and self-reliability
H57|Rational bidding in a procurement auction with subjective evaluations|In practice, procurement auctions often involve subjective evaluations of bids, especially when consisting of quality or design parameters which are hard to quantify. We formally define a notion of subjectivity in an auction environment and analyze the implications for rational bidding behavior. Our findings explain some observed bidding behaviors that are inconsistent with standard equilibrium predictions. Finally we examine the way subjectivity facilitates the practice of favoritism on part of the auctioneer.
H57|Privatization and quality: Evidence from elderly care in Sweden|Non-contractible quality dimensions are at risk of degradation when the provision of public services is privatized. However, privatization may increase quality by fostering performance-improving innovation, particularly if combined with increased competition. We assemble a large data set on elderly care services in Sweden between 1990 and 2009 and estimate how opening to private provision affected mortality rates – an important and not easily contractible quality dimension – using a difference-in-difference-in-difference approach. The results indicate that privatization and the associated increase in competition significantly improved non-contractible quality as measured by mortality rates.
H57|To bid or not to bid: That is the question: Public procurement, project complexity and corruption|The main aim of this study is to improve our comprehension of the role played by project complexity and institutional quality as possible drivers of the choice between open auctions and negotiations in a sample of Italian municipalities. Controlling for project characteristics, for observed and unobserved heterogeneity at municipality level, our main results suggest that projects that are more complex are more likely to be procured with negotiated procedures. On average, a rise in the project complexity index from the 25th to the 75th percentile of its distribution increases the probability of procuring the project with a negotiated procedure by about 6%–8%. However, our results also suggest that the impact of complexity might be more relevant in the case of projects procured by municipalities located in provinces characterized by low levels of corruption. Moreover, we also find that complex projects are associated to longer delays in their execution, larger rebates and to higher probabilities to be awarded to local firms.
H57|Public Procurement and Rent-Seeking: The Case of Paraguay|A model of entrepreneurial choices in an economy with a corrupt public procurement sector is built, providing predictions along two dimensions. First, corrupt public institutions operate by offering contracts without competition and more corrupt entities channel larger share of their budget in this way. Second, these firms enjoy extra returns, so that procurement related activities attract the best entrepreneurs. A large-scale microeconomic database, including all public procurement operations over a 4-year period in Paraguay, amounting annually to approximately 6% of the country’s GDP, is then used to corroborate these predictions.
H57|Can Paying Firms Quicker Affect Aggregate Employment?|In 2011, the federal government accelerated payments to their small business contractors, spanning virtually every county and industry in the US. We study the impact of this reform on county-sector employment growth over the subsequent three years. Despite firms being paid just 15 days sooner, we find payroll increased 10 cents for each accelerated dollar, with two-thirds of the effect coming from an increase in new hires and the balance from an increase in earnings. Importantly, however, we document substantial crowding out of non-treated firms employment, particularly in counties with low rates of unemployment. Our results highlight an important channel through which financing constraints can be alleviated for small firms, but also emphasize the general-equilibrium effects of large-scale interventions, which can lead to a substantially lower net impact on aggregate outcomes.
H57|L’influenza dell’enforcement contrattuale sulla qualità della prestazione negli appalti pubblici: una rassegna teorica|In questo articolo analizziamo l’influenza dell’ipotesi di prestazione non perfettamente verificabile sulla corretta esecuzione della promessa contrattuale. Proponiamo una rassegna sulla letteratura economica che ha affrontato questa problematica. Presentiamo dapprima i risultati di alcuni modelli che trattano tale tema in un contesto di mercati competitivi. Illustreremo poi i lavori che utilizzano il concetto di reputation for past behavior per punire comportamenti opportunistici in un contesto di appalti pubblici. Discuteremo inoltre dei risultati di Kim (1998) derivanti dall’adozione di una regola di esclusione delle imprese con cattiva reputazione e quelli di Doni (2005) derivanti dall’uso di una politica di premio per la buona reputazione della P.A. (Doni, 2005). Infine accenneremo ai vantaggi dell’adozione di un’asta pesata per la reputazione -------- (2007) o di un meccanismo di competitive discretionary tendering (Albano, Cesi e Iozzi, 2011)
H57|Criminalità e scelte degli amministratori locali in tema di procedure di acquisto|"Il lavoro analizza il nesso esistente tra il ricorso da parte dei Comuni agli strumenti ""centralizzati"" per l’acquisto di beni e servizi e il contesto in cui tali amministrazioni operano. Pur tenendo conto di un’ampia serie di fattori che possono spingere verso un maggiore o minore ricorso alla centrale unica di committenza a livello nazionale (Consip), il lavoro si concentra sul legame tra tale scelta e la presenza di criminalità a livello locale. L’analisi empirica mostra come soltanto in corrispondenza di bassi livelli di criminalità un aumento dei fenomeni delittuosi accresce la frequenza con cui si ricorre a fornitori selezionati da una terza parte, in connessione alla possibilità di limitare i rischi di inefficienza (passive waste). Di contro, in corrispondenza di livelli elevati di criminalità, il nesso si inverte, segnalando una crescente propensione a mantenere una gestione autonoma degli acquisti, che potrebbe essere connessa alla possibilità di estrarre parte delle relative rendite (active waste)."
H57|zIndex – Benchmarking Municipalities in Public Procurement|This paper presents a methodology and first results of the zIndex – a public procurement benchmarking tool for contracting authorities that measures a deviation from best practice recommendations. zIndex is a composite index mapping many issues in the areas of openness, competition and transparency. Indirectly it measures efficiency and corruption potential in public procurement. The pilot application of our methodology on a sample of 194 Czech municipalities and their procurement in the period 2011-2013 worth 3 billion EUR showed several remarkable results such as very low share (30%) of public procurement on actual purchases volume or large portion (50%) of contracts that were cancelled or modified. Finally we find correlation of zIndex with procurement law violations and detected price savings. This implies, that proposed measure of best practice relates both to efficiency and legality, making it usable metric for various further research as well as practical monitoring of procuring agencies.
H57|Fiscal Stimulus and Consumer Debt|In the aftermath of consumer debt-induced recession, policymakers have questioned whether fiscal stimulus is effective during the periods of high consumer indebtedness. This study empirically investigates this question. Using detailed data on Department of Defense spending for the 2006-2009 period, we document that the open-economy relative fiscal multiplier is higher in geographies with higher consumer indebtedness. The results suggest that fiscal policy can mitigate the adverse effect of consumer (over)leverage on real economic output during a recession. We then exploit detailed microdata to evaluate aggregate demand and aggregate supply-side economic mechanisms potentially underlying this result.
H57|Local and aggregate fiscal policy multipliers|Using a newly constructed panel of state-level defense contracts, this paper studies the effect of defense spending on the U.S. macroeconomy. Summing observations across states, we estimate aggregate income and employment multipliers. Comparing these to local multipliers estimated with the panel provides evidence that local multiplier estimates may be reliable indicators of fiscal policy’s aggregate effects. Furthermore, evidence of small positive spillovers is found. Across several specifications, we estimate income and employment multipliers between zero and 0.5. This result is reconciled with the greater-than-one multipliers found in Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) by analyzing the Korean War years’ impact on the estimation.
H57|Innovation, competition and public procurement in the pre-commercial phase|Should the supply or the demand side bear the risk connected to innovation? The two polar cases identified in the literature are the supply push and the demand pull. The former is the typical one, with the supplier bearing the costs and obtaining the benefits from innovating. The latter is technology procurement, where the buyer takes the risk, by procuring the innovative good or service. With respect to this, pre-commercial procurement is a peculiar solution that can explain the debate found in the literature relative to its configuration either as a supply-side or a demand-side instrument. The separation from the commercial phase allows the procurer to take only (part of) the risks connected to R&D services. Also, competition among suppliers gives the opportunity of evaluating different solutions and to obtain, in the commercial phase, a lower price for the innovative good. The counterpart of all this is a large portion of risk being left to the supplier. As a consequence, suppliers need to obtain a larger share of the benefits of the innovation process. This economic reason, besides the legal restrictions on State aid, explains the need for a shared risks-shared benefits approach, centred on the agreements on the assignment of IPRs.
H57|On the benefits of set-asides|Set-asides programs consist in forbidding access to specific participants, and they are commonly used in procurement auctions. We show that when the set of potential participants is composed of an incumbent (who bids for sure if allowed to) and of entrants who show up endogenously (in such a way that their expected rents are fixed by outside options), then it is always beneficial for revenues to exclude the incumbent in the second-price auction. This exclusion principle is generalized to auction formats that favor the incumbent in the sense that he would always gets the good when he values it most. By contrast, set-asides need not be desirable if the incumbent's payoff is included into the seller's objective or in environments with multiple incumbents.

H57|The Employment Effects of Faster Payment: Evidence from the Federal Quickpay Reform|We study the impact of Quickpay, a federal reform that indefinitely accelerated payments to small business contractors of the U.S. government. We find a strong direct effect of the reform on employment growth at the firm-level. Importantly, how-ever, we also document substantial crowding out of non-treated firms' employment within local labor markets. While the overall net employment effect was positive, it was close to zero in tight labor markets - where crowding out was stronger. Our results highlight an important channel for alleviating financing constraints in small firms, but also emphasize the general-equilibrium effects of large-scale interventions, which can lead to lower aggregate outcomes depending on labor market conditions.
H57|Buyer Quality and Procurement Outcomes: Explorative Evidence From the US|We explore empirically the impact of buyer quality on public procurement outcomes. Using purchases data (Federal Procurement Data System) and survey data (Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey) from US federal agencies, we find that procurement quality is highly heterogeneous across different agencies and persistent over time. The qualitative aspect that better predicts procurement performance is the perceived degree of cooperation within the unit, followed by the presence of appropriate incentives. We then assess the main channels through which public procurer quality affects outcomes. We find that buyer quality improves the selection of suppliers and strengthens the association between the use of cost plus contracts and the negotiation procedure.
H57|Public procurement for innovation: lessons from the procurement of a navigable storm surge barrier|Public Procurement for Innovation (PPI) is a powerful, underutilized demand-side innovation policy instrument that can be used to stimulate innovation, meet sectoral policy goals and mitigate grand challenges. Further research is required to analyze how PPI contributes to these goals and how it operates in practice; more case studies are needed to achieve this. We analyze a case of direct developmental PPI, the procurement of a navigable storm surge barrier in the Netherlands. Data from policy documents, reports and interviews were used in an event history analysis which serves to capture dynamic patterns of innovation activities. We interpret our findings in relation to the tentative lessons on PPI available in the literature. We also draw policy conclusions with respect to dealing with multiple policy goals and user needs; specifying functional requirements; levels of expertise within governments; balancing competition and cooperation; and taking risks.
H57|A Comparison of Techniques to Evaluate Policies in Public Procurement|Empirical evaluations of policies implemented through public procurements are commonly carried out using linear regressions or by more involved nonlinear structural models. The aspiration is typically to determine a marginal effect. Here, I compare marginal effects generated under both types of specifications. I study how a political initiative to make firms less environmentally damaging implemented through public procurements influence Swedish firms’ behavior. The collected evidence brings about a statistically as well as economically significant effect on firms’ bids and costs.
H57|On Specification and Inference in the Econometrics of Public Procurement|In Paper [I] we use data on Swedish public procurement auctions for internal regular cleaning service contracts to provide novel empirical evidence regarding green public procurement (GPP) and its effect on the potential suppliers’ decision to submit a bid and their probability of being qualified for supplier selection. We find only a weak effect on supplier behavior which suggests that GPP does not live up to its political expectations. However, several environmental criteria appear to be associated with increased complexity, as indicated by the reduced probability of a bid being qualified in the postqualification process. As such, GPP appears to have limited or no potential to function as an environmental policy instrument. In Paper [II] the observation is made that empirical evaluations of the effect of policies transmitted through public procurements on bid sizes are made using linear regressions or by more involved non-linear structural models. The aspiration is typically to determine a marginal effect. Here, I compare marginal effects generated under both types of specifications. I study how a political initiative to make firms less environmentally damaging implemented through public procurement influences Swedish firms’ behavior. The collected evidence brings about a statistically as well as economically significant effect on firms’ bids and costs. Paper [III] embarks by noting that auction theory suggests that as the number of bidders (competition) increases, the sizes of the participants’ bids decrease. An issue in the empirical literature on auctions is which measurement(s) of competition to use. Utilizing a dataset on public procurements containing measurements on both the actual and potential number of bidders I find that a workhorse model of public procurements is best fitted to data using only actual bidders as measurement for competition. Acknowledging that all measurements of competition may be erroneous, I propose an instrumental variable estimator that (given my data) brings about a competition effect bounded by those generated by specifications using the actual and potential number of bidders, respectively. Also, some asymptotic results are provided for non-linear least squares estimators obtained from a dependent variable transformation model. Paper [VI] introduces a novel method to measure bidders’ costs (valuations) in descending (ascending) auctions. Based on two bounded rationality constraints bidders’ costs (valuations) are given an imperfect measurements interpretation robust to behavioral deviations from traditional rationality assumptions. Theory provides no guidance as to the shape of the cost (valuation) distributions while empirical evidence suggests them to be positively skew. Consequently, a flexible distribution is employed in an imperfect measurements framework. An illustration of the proposed method on Swedish public procurement data is provided along with a comparison to a traditional Bayesian Nash Equilibrium approach.
H57|State Fund of Regional Development: Problems and Ways of Functioning Improvement|The article is devoted to the analysis of the functioning of the State Fund of Regional Development (SFRD) and to the improvement of approaches to the formation of consumption requirements at the regional level during the implementation of capital investments in the infrastructure of local significance from the state budget resources. Legal and regulatory framework of the State Fund of Regional Development was disclosed. It was made the analysis of the scope dynamics of the State Fund of Regional Development for the period from 2012 to 2016 and the composition of objects to which funds was allocated. It was revealed that due to imperfect budget allocation procedure the excessive fragmentation takes place. Special attention is paid to the criteria for allocation of SFRD funds between regions. The suitability of using an index of regional human development in the allocation of SFRD funds was justified. It was proposed to establish appropriate funds for regional development in the regions and to give regions the opportunity to carry out the preparation, evaluation, selection and approval of investment programs and projects in accordance with the procedure established by the legislation in accordance with the procedure established by the legislation.
H57|Economic importance of the Belgian ports: Flemish maritime ports, Liège port complex and the port of Brussels - Report 2014|This paper is an annual publication issued by the Microeconomic Analysis service of the National Bank of Belgium. The Flemish maritime ports (Antwerp, Ghent, Ostend, Zeebrugge), the Autonomous Port of Liège and the port of Brussels play a major role in their respective regional economies and in the Belgian economy, not only in terms of industrial activity but also as intermodal centers facilitating the commodity flow. This update paper1 provides an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports, the Liège port complex and the port of Brussels for the period 2009 - 2014, with an emphasis on 2014. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, the report also provides some information based on the social balance sheet and an overview of the financial situation in these ports as a whole. These observations are linked to a more general context, along with a few cargo statistics. Annual accounts data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. The indirect effects of the activities concerned were estimated in terms of value added and employment, on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. As a result of the underlying calculation method the changes of indirect employment and indirect value added can differ from one another. The developments concerning economic activity in the six ports in 2013 - 2014 are summarised in the table on the next page: In 2014 the growth of maritime traffic in the Flemish sea ports was once again due solely to developments in the port of Antwerp. However, that did not necessarily mean that direct value added followed the same trend: except for the port of Zeebrugge, all other lemish ports recorded an increase. Direct employment is continuing to decline, except in the port of Ghent where it remains steady. Investment appears to be picking up, after last year’s weak figures. Cargo traffic in the ports of Liège and Brussels was up in 2014, but that did not result in any increase in value added. The decline in direct employment also persisted, certainly in the port of Liège. This report provides a comprehensive account of these issues, giving details for each economic sector, although the comments are confined to the main changes that occurred in 2014. This report is available for download at the following address http://www.nbb.be.

Despite firms being paid just 15 days sooner, we find payroll increased 10 cents for each accelerated dollar, with two-thirds of the effect coming from an increase in new hires and the balance from an increase in earnings. The result of this study highlights an important channel through which financing constraints can be alleviated for small firms, and emphasizes the general-equilibrium effects of large-scale interventions, which can lead to a substantially lower net impact on aggregate outcomes.

H57|Past Performance and Procurement Outcomes|Reputational incentives may be a powerful mechanism for improving supplier performance. We analyze their role in contract awarding, exploiting an experiment run by a firm which introduced a new vendor rating system scoring suppliers' past performance and linking it to the award of future contracts. We study responses in both price and performance to the announcement of the switch from price-only to price-and-rating auctions. Across the 136 parameters scored, overall compliance improves from 25 percent to 80 percent. Improvements involve all parameters and suppliers, but are more pronounced for parameters receiving a higher weight in the announced scoring auction. Prices do not significantly change overall, but we find some evidence of lower prices right after the announcement when suppliers compete to win contracts to get scored, and of higher prices once they have established a good reputation. Even under an upper bound estimate for this price increase, however, the cost of the policy is below its lower bound benefit estimate, which derives from a reduction in fatal accidents driven by improvements on the subset of parameters involving worksite safety.

The paper identifies the contributions of research, included in the monograph, to economic theory and effectiveness of public procurement in the Russian Federation."
H57|Raising Public Spending Efficiency in Switzerland|Despite having low government spending, Switzerland scores highly in various public policy outcomes, including health, education and transportation. But, as the population grows and ages, efficiency of public spending will have to rise to maintain low tax rates. Given its high returns, the provision of early childhood education and care should be boosted, especially for children from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds, including those from immigrant families. Cantons should avoid oversupplying baccalaureates, thereby lowering university dropout rates. Policies will also need to adapt to structural changes in the labour market, by boosting the supply and attractiveness of fields of study that are facing high demand on the labour market, and by further clarifying study streams across tertiary education. Health-care efficiency could be raised by further developing managed-care networks. Enforcing systematic data collection for the quality of care would also help patients and providers make better informed choices. Generic drugs’ prices are too high due to a poorly designed price-fixing mechanism. Transportation suffers from congestion that could be reduced by implementing peak-load pricing on roads and trains. But efficiency in public spending is also about allocating public funds optimally. Switzerland’s rapidly rising social security entitlements and its fiscal equalisation system constrain public spending and risk crowding out important expenditures. Fast-rising social security entitlements could be addressed via indexing the retirement age to life expectancy. Fiscal equalisation weakens tax-raising incentives for some cantons; this could be addressed by allowing them to keep a larger part of their increased revenues. Efficiency in allocating public expenditure could also be raised by increasing the share of public spending allocated by tender and harmonising procurement regulations across all levels of government. This Working Paper relates to the 2015 OECD Economic Review of Switzerland (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-switzerland.htm) Accroître l'Efficience des Dépenses Publiques en Suisse Malgré un volume de dépenses publiques faible, la Suisse obtient de très bons résultats dans de nombreux domaines de la politique publique, dont la santé, l’éducation et le transport. Toutefois, compte tenu de la croissance démographique et du vieillissement de la population, l’efficience des dépenses publiques devra être renforcée pour conserver des taux d’imposition bas. Compte tenu de ses effets très positifs, l’offre de structures d’éducation et d’accueil des jeunes enfants devrait être accrue, notamment pour les enfants issus de milieux socio-économiques défavorisés, comme les enfants d’immigrés. Les cantons devraient éviter une situation d’excès de bacheliers, afin de réduire les taux de décrochage universitaire. Les politiques devront aussi s’adapter aux changements structurels sur le marché du travail en améliorant l’offre et l’attractivité des domaines d’études qui suscitent une forte demande sur le marché de l’emploi, et en simplifiant encore les filières dans l’enseignement supérieur. Dans la santé, le développement des réseaux de soins intégrés pourrait renforcer l’efficience. Le recueil systématique de données sur la qualité des soins aiderait aussi patients et prestataires à faire des choix mieux informés. Les prix des médicaments génériques sont trop élevés en raison d’un mécanisme de fixation des prix mal conçu. Dans les transports, la congestion pourrait être réduite en adoptant une tarification de période de pointe sur les routes et les rails. Mais l’efficience des dépenses publiques a aussi trait à la répartition optimale des deniers publics. Les droits à prestations de sécurité sociale qui augmentent rapidement en Suisse et le système de péréquation budgétaire contraignent les dépenses publiques et risquent de supplanter des catégories de dépenses importantes. L’indexation de l’âge de la retraite sur l’espérance de vie pourrait permettre de faire face à l’augmentation rapide des droits à prestations de sécurité sociale. La péréquation budgétaire incite moins certains cantons à collecter les impôts. Pour remédier à cette situation, ils pourraient être autorisés à conserver une part plus importante de leurs recettes supplémentaires. La répartition des dépenses publiques pourrait aussi devenir plus efficiente en augmentant le pourcentage des marchés publics alloués par appels d’offres et en harmonisant les procédures de passation de marché à tous les niveaux de l’administration. Ce Document de travail se rapporte à l’Étude économique de l’OCDE de la Suisse 2015 (http://www.oecd.org/fr/eco/etudes/etude-economique-suisse.htm).
H57|Improving transport and energy infrastructure investment in Poland|Poland has significantly upgraded its infrastructure network over the past decade. However, bottlenecks still weigh on productivity growth and environmental and health outcomes. The EU 2014-20 programming period is an opportunity to improve the management of infrastructure investment. In the transport sector, the country allocated most recent funding to roads, but it plans significant investment in railway and urban public transport in 2014-20. Strengthening metropolitan governance, building up medium-term infrastructure management capabilities and reducing funding uncertainty would ensure more efficient spending. In the energy sector, electricity generation capacity is tight, while regulatory uncertainty, administrative burdens and a lack of interregional and international trade capacity has hampered the development of renewables. The authorities are seeking to develop nuclear power, but they need to take fully into account tail risks involved and its long-term costs. More energy efficiency investment would also be valuable, as current support systems do not provide sufficient incentives. Améliorer l'investissement en infrastructures de transports et énergétiques en Pologne La Pologne a significativement renforcé son réseau d’infrastructures au cours de la dernière décennie. Cependant, des goulets pèsent toujours tant sur la croissance de la productivité que sur la santé de la population et l’environnement. La période de programmation 2014-20 de l’UE est une opportunité d’améliorer la gestion de l’investissement en infrastructures. Dans le secteur des transports, après avoir financé principalement les infrastructures routières, la Pologne prévoit de consacrer d’importants investissements aux transports ferroviaires et publics urbains entre 2014 et 2020. Une meilleure gouvernance des métropoles, des capacités accrues de gestion des infrastructures à moyen terme et une réduction de l’incertitude des financements garantiraient une plus grande efficience des dépenses. Par ailleurs, dans le secteur de l’énergie, les installations de production électrique satisfont tout juste les besoins, tandis que l’incertitude réglementaire, le poids des charges administratives et les capacités commerciales insuffisantes aux niveaux interrégional et international freinent le développement des énergies renouvelables. Les autorités cherchent à développer le nucléaire, mais elles doivent tenir pleinement compte des risques extrêmes et de ses coûts à long terme. La Pologne aurait également intérêt à investir davantage dans l’efficacité énergétique car les dispositifs de soutien actuels ne fournissent pas des incitations suffisantes.
H57|Review of budget oversight by parliament: Ireland|Budget oversight by the Irish parliamentary chambers, the Houses of the Oireachtas, is under-developed by international standards. Many stakeholders and participants question whether the existing process is meaningful or impactful. Nevertheless, there is a strong momentum for reform with Ireland’s public administration. Against this background, the OECD presents in this report an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of Ireland’s system of parliamentary engagement in budgeting, and outlines a number of proposals for continued reform by reference to international experience, for consideration by the Houses of the Oireachtas and by other institutional actors and by the political system more generally.

H57|Overview of public governance of public-private partnerships in the Russian Federation|Good infrastructure is crucial to a country’s development and continued success. Russia’s developmental goals require new and upgraded infrastructure throughout its territory. Private investment in capital projects will be vital for Russia to meet these goals. To facilitate private investment, the Russian government has embarked on a series of reforms aimed at improving the investment climate and creating a robust institutional framework for private sector participation in concessions and Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). The OECD’s 2012 Council Recommendation on Principles for Public Governance of Public-Private Partnerships (the PPP Recommendation) aims to support governments facing trade-offs between three demands inherent in a PPP project process. This article provides an overview of the alignment of the policies of the Russian Federation in the area of public governance of PPPs with these recommendations.

H57|Developments in Public Procurement in Hungary – Opportunities and Challenges|The article provides a brief overview of the status of public procurements, made relevant by the 20th anniversary of the introduction of the public procurement system in Hungary and the entry into force of the new Act on Public Procurement on 1 November 2015. It is intended to present the backbone of public procurement statistics released in the past 20 years to give an insight into the most important trends in Hungarian public procurements. Another goal of the study is to outline the structure of public procurement regulations and the relevant institutional system and to point out the most prominent novelties of the new Public Procurement Act. Statistics and trends are examined with the assistance of charts and tables. The novelties of the Public Procurement Act are presented by analysing the text of the legislation and by providing a summary of the relevant rules, and the institutional system is described by using a similar method. Readers gain an insight into the situation of public procurements through an analysis that is not only easy to utilise but that can also serve as a point of reference on the subject of the Public Procurement Act and the relevant institutional system.
H57|Utilisation of the Hungarian SAO's Work in the Light of Auditing Public Procurements|In the last two years, the State Audit Office of Hungary has played a major role in uncovering irregularities in public procurements. 30-40 per cent of the public procurement legal remedy cases were initiated on the basis of recommendations provided by the office. As an audit organisation and the initiator of public procurement legal remedy proceedings, the SAO has an insight into the reasons of irregularities. The basis for good public procurement can and must be created by observing the relevant legal regulations regarding the internal control system. Whether public procurement procedures are conducted in the required manner depends on keeping appropriate records, collecting the right data in a targeted way as well as making thorough preparations. If a given organisation does not provide all the sufficient and required information or the information is not available on site, there is a very high risk of irregularities to occur. These risks can be reduced through the effective control of public finances – especially through the internal control system.
H57|Public Sector Procurement - the Challenges Facing a Small Country|Public sector organisations within small countries have some significant advantages. They are small enough to have a good understanding of local needs and often have in-depth knowledge of the experience and skills available in local labour markets. However, these advantages can be off-set and even outweighed by the challenges of dealing with lack of economy of scale, scarcity of specialist procurement expertise and a greater risk of supplier collusion. This article focuses on public procurement in Wales and examines how the Welsh Government has been seeking to confront the challenges facing public procurement in a small country through the development and improvement of public procurement practice and capacity. The article concludes by looking at how the Auditor General for Wales is contributing to addressing the challenges facing public procurement in Wales through the exercise of his audit powers.
H57|Resident Bid Preference, Affiliation, and Procurement Competition: Evidence from New Mexico|In public procurement auctions, governments typically offer preferences to qualified businesses in the form of bid discounts. Previous studies that examine how these bid preferences affect auction outcomes fail to address affiliation -- a particular type of correlation among costs that can be generated in a public procurement setting. This paper addresses that issue by studying the joint effect of bid preferences and affiliation in project-completion costs on procurement auctions using novel data from the New Mexico Department of Transportation's Resident Preference Program. Bidders, heterogeneous in residency status, compete in an auction with endogenous entry and affiliated project-completion costs for the opportunity to complete a construction project. Here affiliation is modeled using copulas, and an empirical model is developed to disentangle a bidder's participation and bidding decisions. I find that accounting for affiliation in project-completion costs considerably changes the evaluation of how offering preferences to resident bidders affects the cost of procurement and the number of resident bidders who ultimately win these preference auctions. The estimates indicate that the New Mexico Department of Transportation can increase the current level of preference to increase the number of winning resident bidders without a major change in the cost of procurement.
H57|Border Effects in European Public Procurement|This paper documents border effects in public procurement in the European Union Single Market. We use a data set of 2.3 million European public procurement contracts awarded between 2010 and 2014 to estimate a gravity model of bilateral procurement flows between European NUTS3 region pairs. Controlling for numerous variables, we find border effects on both the intra- and international level. Cross-national border effects are especially sizeable: firms located in the home region of the tendering authority are about 1300 times more likely to be awarded a contract than foreign firms. Our results hold for goods, services, and construction works procurement and cannot be explained by common currency, same language, and variables capturing cultural distance.
H57|Political Business Cycle in the Czech Republic: Case of Municipalities|"The study analyses expenditures of all municipalities of the Czech Republic over the period 2003-2013. It aims to examine whether changes in municipal spending get affected by the electoral cycle. The analysis has proven that expenditures of municipalities of the Czech Republic are influenced by the political cycle. However, the political business cycle has at the level of municipalities (compared to the macroeconomic level) its peculiarities. These arise mainly from limited options of municipal politicians to use economic instruments to win electoral votes in elections. To receive electoral votes, municipal politicians use mainly public investments and projects that are at the level of municipalities so apparent that they may influence voters in their electoral decision-making. Prior to elections, expenditures on investments significantly increase for all municipal size groups. For municipal size groups of over 50,000 residents, however, they are (per capita) higher compared to smaller municipal size groups. This may be explained by the fact that these municipalities have higher disposable resources (higher per capita own budgetary revenues, higher potential to acquire resources to co-finance municipal projects and broader portfolio of debt financing). Expenditures on transfers do not significantly change prior to municipal elections. We interpret this finding in a way that politicians prefer such investment projects that are ""visible"". Transfers are used to pay for certain current expenses for which municipalities may (in accordance with the established rules) apply through grants."
H57|Stanovení nabídkových cen ve veřejných zakázkách: simulace<BR>[Price Determination in Public Procurement: Simulation]|The article examines a mechanism of bid price determination in public procurement by individual tenderers. An auction model based on game theory, which maximizes expected profit of a firm bidding for public contract, is used to analyse this process. Firm within the model decides by comparing expected profit and transaction costs associated with submitting the bid whether to submit the bid or not. Furthermore, the article analyzes empirical data on public works contracts in the field of construction and reconstruction of wastewater treatment plants in the Czech Republic. The probability distribution of bid prices submitted by individual firms is mainly examined on these data. Based on the presented model and some finding from the data, a simulation of sequential biddings is executed consequently in which individual firms in their decision making use available data on submitted bids from the previous contracts.
H57|On Discrimination in Auctions with Endogenous Entry|When entry is exogenous, strong buyers should be discriminated against weak buyers to maximize revenues (Myerson 1981). When entry is endogenous so that entrants' expected payoffs do not depend on the proposed mechanism, optimal discrimination takes a completely different form. The revenue-maximizing equilibrium requires that there should be no discrimination with respect to entrants irrespective of their ex ante characteristics. Besides, those buyers who always participate should be discriminated against entrants independently of their strength. These predictions are independent of the equilibrium selection when the number of potential entrants grows large. The optimality of first-price auctions is also discussed. (JEL D44, H57)
H57|Demand of food energy, food availability and nutrient intake in Venezuela: Main changes and their nutritional implications| The main objective of this article is to analyze food demand in Venezuela, in order to examine the influence of real food prices, real income and its distribution, as well as other factors (such as domestic production, domestic agribusiness, land tenure, imports, shortages and food public networks), on the consumption of food and nutrients in Venezuela during the 1970-2014 period. Thus, based on official data and other secondary sources, a regression model using Ordinary Linear Square was estimated and some food and nutrition indicators were also constructed. Main findings show significant estimators and with expected signs for real prices, imports, domestic food production and real income and its distribution as explanatory variables of food demand in Venezuela. Nevertheless, future food and nutrition policies should focus on improving income distribution and stimulate domestic food production, rather than maintaining low prices and overvalued exchange rates, since such policy tools have discouraged domestic production and increased external dependence of Venezuela in terms of food security.
H57|Crime and public procurement, evidence from municipalities|The paper analyzes the link between the centralized purchasing of goods and services by municipalities and the context in which these administrations operate. While taking into account a number of factors that can lead to a greater or lesser use of Consip, the work focuses on the link between that choice and the local crime rate. The empirical analysis shows that, in low-crime areas only, an increase in crime is positively correlated with the frequency with which municipalities entrust vendor selection to a third party in order to attempt to limit the risk of inefficiency (passive waste) that would otherwise arise. The relationship is the inverse in high-crime areas, suggesting a growing willingness by municipalities to maintain autonomous control over purchasing, which may be linked to the possibility of extracting some of the rents produced from this activity (active waste).
H57|Optimal monitoring in dynamic procurement contracts|Which information should government authorities monitor when they procure goods from private suppliers? I analyze this question in a principal-agent model of procurement with moral hazard concerning cost-reducing investments and dynamic adverse selection about investment cost and a production cost shock. The principal can monitor the investment, the shock, or both at a cost. I show that it is never optimal to monitor investment and shock. Monitoring investment is always at least as effective as monitoring the shock. The two instruments are equivalent if the level of investment cost is high. Monitoring may decrease efficiency in the optimal contract.
H57|Procurement Design with Corruption|I investigate the design of optimal procurement mechanisms in the presence of corruption. After contracting with the sponsor, the contractor may bribe the inspector to misrepresent quality. The mechanism affects whether bribery occurs. I discuss the cases of both fixed and variable (with the size of misrepresentation) bribes, and also uncertainty about the bribe amount. In all cases, the optimal contract curtails quality for low efficiency contractors but also for the most efficient contractors. I also present models of bribe negotiations whose reduced form coincide with the model analyzed in the paper, and discuss implementation and the effect of competition.
H57|The Simple Microeconomics of Public-Private Partnerships| We build on the existing literature in public-private partnerships (PPP) to analyze the main incentive issues in PPPs and the shape of optimal contracts in those contexts. We present a basic model of procurement in a multitask environment in which a risk-averse firm chooses noncontractible efforts in cost reduction and quality improvement. We first consider the effect on incentives and risk transfer of bundling building and management stages into a single contract, allowing for different assumptions on feasible contracts and information available to the government. Then we extend the model in novel directions. We study the relationship between the operator and its financiers and the impact of private finance. We discuss the trade-off between incentive and flexibility in PPP agreements and the dynamics of PPPs, including cost overruns. We also consider how institutions, and specifically the risk of regulatory opportunism, affect contract design and incentives. The conclusion summarizes policy implications on the desirability of PPPs.
H57|Public-Private Contracting under Limited Commitment| A government delegates a build-operate-transfer project to a private firm in a limited-commitment framework. When the contract is signed, parties are uncertain about the operating cost. The firm can increase the likelihood of facing a low cost by exerting some noncontractible effort while building the facility. Once the facility is in place, the firm learns the marginal cost and begins to operate. We characterize the contract which stipulates the efficient allocation. We study the financial structure and duration that secure its enforcement. To this end, we take into account that break-up of the partnership occasions a replacement cost for the government and an expropriation cost for the firm and its lender. Furthermore, both these costs are higher the earlier the contract is terminated. Enforcement is achieved as follows. The firm is instructed to invest some intermediate amount of own and borrowed funds. Under the aegis of a third party that can commit, the government provides guarantees to the lender, conditional on continuation of the partnership. Duration may be shortened, though not to the point where the initial effort of the firm is uncompensated.
H57|Political Rent-Seeking in Public Procurement: Evidence from the Entry of Political Challengers at Electoral Thresholds|This paper shows that political challengers affect rent-seeking in public procurement. I use data from municipal governments in the Czech Republic to construct new measures of political rent-seeking in procurement and test whether the entry of additional challengers into municipal legislatures affects the rent-seeking practices. Because the entry of challengers is endogenous to the performance of incumbents, I predict the challenger entry using quasirandom variation in the vote share of challengers near the threshold in proportional elections. I show that legislatures with additional challengers allocate fewer procurements to political donors, double price savings in procurement and use more competitive procurement auctions. The entry of extra challengers leads to greater economic benefits in legislatures with fewer political parties and in legislatures entered by local-level political movements. My findings highlight the role of local-level movements in enhancing political accountability and the value of monitoring the behavior of politicians.
H57|Auctions vs. Negotiations:The Effects of Inefficient Renegotiation|For the procurement of complex goods the early exchange of information is important to avoid costly renegotiation ex post. We show that this is achieved by bilateral negotiations but not by auctions. Negotiations strictly outperforms auctions if sellers are likely to have superior information about possible design improvements, if renegotiation is costly, and if the buyer's bargaining position is sufficiently strong. Moreover, we show that negotiations provide stronger incentives for sellers to investigate possible design improvements than auctions. This provides an explanation for the widespread use of negotiations as a procurement mechanism in private industry.
H57|The Value of NATO Option for a New Member|The paper introduces a welfarist approach to the national safety of a nation with membership in a defense alliance as an option. The members are risk averse but heterogeneous in their safety classification. There are two public goods as insurance devices, the domestic military budget and the incremental safety provided by the membership in the alliance. The commitment of the alliance in the creation of safety is, however, imperfect. A sufficient condition is stated for the non-membership. Under a positive option value of the membership, several adverse incentive effects shaping the option value are identified, including the incentive to free ride in domestic defense investment and a moral hazard effect in terms of national commitment to the defense effort. The cost of participation is determined in the spirit of the median voter theorem. The alliance equilibrium is shown to be of two potential types, a stable alliance equilibrium with a positive mass and or a degenerate one with one member only. The driving force in the adjustment of the alliance is its size relative to the safety class of the median voter. Expectations of the decision making of the co-members concerning the commitment can result in multiple equilibria.
H57|Political Connections and Firm Value: Evidence from the Regression Discontinuity Design of Close Gubernatorial Elections|Using the network of university classmates among corporate directors and politicians and the regression discontinuity design of close gubernatorial elections from 1999 to 2010, we identify the positive and significant impact of social-network based political connections on firm value. Firms connected to elected governors increase value by 1.36% on average surrounding the election date. Political connections are more valuable in a state with a higher level of regulation and corruption, in smaller firms, and in firms dependent on external finance. Firms connected to election winners invest more, earn better operating performance, hold more cash, and enjoy better long-term stock performance.
H57|Is centralization a solution to the soft budget constraint problem?|This paper focuses on the centralization program implemented in Israel in 2004 to analyze whether the administrative subordination of municipalities is an effective policy to deal with problems related to soft-budget constraint of lower level governments. The results consistently show, for different specifications and samples of municipalities, that this program brought a substantial decrease of municipalities’ expenditures (mostly because of decreases in salary payments), and an increase of local property tax collection. Our analysis shows that all of the fiscal impact of the program is due to the appointment of an accountant that reports directly to the central government, a relatively mild form of administrative subordination. In contrast, more intrusive forms of subordination, like the central imposition of a recovery program, do not result in any substantial improvement of municipalities’ fiscal situation. This leads us to conclude that a mild form of administrative subordination is an effective tool to cope with problems related to soft-budget constraints, whereas political subordination is not an effective tool to reach that goal.
H57|Renegotiation of public contracts: An empirical analysis|Using a dataset of public contracts awarded in Italy between 2000 and 2007, we document two facts: (i) both price and time renegotiations are systematic, but nearly uncorrelated to each other; (ii) renegotiations are linked to the project design stage.
H57|Advances in Auctions|As a selling mechanism, auctions have acquired a central position in the free market economy all over the globe. This development has deepened, broadened, and expanded the theory of auctions in new directions. This chapter is intended as a selective update of some of the developments and applications of auction theory in the two decades since Wilson (1992) wrote the previous Handbook chapter on this topic.
H57|Ex post information rents in sequential screening|We study ex post information rents in sequential screening models where the agent receives private ex ante and ex post information. The principal has to pay ex post information rents for preventing the agent to coordinate lies about his ex ante and ex post information. When the agent's ex ante information is discrete, these rents are positive, whereas they are zero in continuous models. Consequently, full disclosure of ex post information is generally suboptimal. Optimal disclosure rules trade off the benefits from adapting the allocation to better information against the effect that more information aggravates truth-telling.
H57|The unintended effects of the Medicare Part D low income subsidy|Medicare Part D is the voluntary program that provides insurance for prescription drugs to 37 million US elderly. This form of public insurance is delivered exclusively through a choice-based private insurance market, where Medicare pays various types of subsidies. The objective of this paper is to analyze how the subsidy paid to low income enrollees induces insurers to distort their plan premiums.
H57|Bundling decisions in procurement auctions with sequential tasks|This paper investigates the principal's bundling decision during a procurement auction for a project consisting of two sequential tasks, in which task externality exists and information arrives sequentially. We show that, although increasing the number of bidders in the market for the second task always tilts the principal's choice toward unbundling, increasing the number of consortiums that can perform both tasks tilts the principal's preference toward bundling if the externality is negative.
