P37|Inclusive development in environmental sustainability in sub‐Saharan Africa: Insights from governance mechanisms|This research examines the relevance of inclusive development in modulating the role of governance on environmental degradation. The study focuses on 44 countries in sub‐Saharan Africa for the period 2000–2012. The generalised method of moments is employed as the empirical strategy, and CO2 emissions per capita is used to measure environmental pollution. Bundled and unbundled governance dynamics are employed, notably political governance (consisting of political stability/no violence and “voice and accountability”), economic governance (encompassing government effectiveness and regulation quality), institutional governance (entailing corruption‐control and the rule of law), and general governance (a composite measure of political governance, economic governance, and institutional governance). The following main findings are established. First, the underlying net effect in the moderating role of inclusive development in the governance‐CO2 emissions nexus is not significant in regressions pertaining to political governance and economic governance. Second, there are positive net effects from the relevance of inclusive development in modulating the effects of regulation quality, economic governance, and general governance on CO2 emissions. The significant and insignificant effects are elucidated. Policy implications are discussed.
P37|Economic Development Thresholds for a Green Economy in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study investigates how increasing economic development affects the green economy in terms of CO2 emissions, using data from 44 countries in the SSA for the period 2000-2012. The Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) is used for the empirical analysis. The following main findings are established. First, relative to CO2 emissions, enhancing economic growth and population growth engenders a U-shaped pattern whereas increasing inclusive human development shows a Kuznets curve. Second, increasing GDP growth beyond 25% of annual growth is unfavorable for a green economy. Third, a population growth rate of above 3.089% (i.e. annual %) has a positive effect of CO2 emissions. Fourth, an inequality-adjusted human development index (IHDI) of above 0.4969 is beneficial for a green economy because it is associated with a reduction in CO2 emissions. The established critical masses have policy relevance because they are situated within the policy ranges of adopted economic development dynamics.
P37|Governance,CO2 emissions and inclusive human development in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study investigates the relevance of government quality in moderating the incidence of environmental degradation on inclusive human development in 44 sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. Environmental degradation is measured with CO2 emissions and the governance dynamics include: political stability, voice and accountability, government effectiveness, regulation quality, the rule of law and corruption-control. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments. Regulation quality modulates CO2 emissions to exert a net negative effect on inclusive development. Institutional governance (consisting of corruption-control and the rule of law) modulates CO2 emissions to also exert a net negative effect on inclusive human development. Fortunately, the corresponding interactive effects are positive, which indicates that good governance needs to be enhanced to achieve positive net effects. A policy threshold of institutional governance at which institutional governance completely dampens the unfavourable effect of CO2 emissions on inclusive human development is established. Other policy implications are discussed.
P37|Inclusive development in environmental sustainability in sub-Saharan Africa: insights from governance mechanisms|This research examines the relevance of inclusive development in modulating the role of governance on environmental degradation. The study focuses on forty-four countries in sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2000-2012. The Generalised Method of Moments is employed as the empirical strategy and CO2 emissions per capita is used to measure environmental pollution. Bundled and unbundled governance dynamics are employed, notably: political governance (consisting of political stability/no violence and â€œvoice and accountabilityâ€ ), economic governance (encompassing government effectiveness and regulation quality), institutional governance (entailing corruption-control and the rule of law), and general governance (a composite measure of political governance, economic governance and institutional governance). The following main findings are established. First, the underlying net effect in the moderating role of inclusive development in the governance-CO2 emissions nexus is not significant in regressions pertaining to political governance and economic governance. Second, there are positive net effects from the relevance of inclusive development in modulating the effects of regulation quality, economic governance and general governance on CO2 emissions. The significant and insignificant effects are elucidated. Policy implications are discussed.

P37|Linkages between Globalisation, Carbon dioxide emissions and Governance in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study investigates linkages between environmental degradation, globalisation and governance in 44 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa using data for the period 2000-2012. The Generalised Method of Moments is employed as empirical strategy. Environmental degradation is proxied by carbon dioxide emissions whereas globalisation is appreciated in terms of trade openness and net foreign direct investment inflows. Bundled and unbundled governance indicators are used, namely: political governance (consisting of political stability/no violence and â€œvoice & accountabilityâ€ ), economic governance (encompassing government effectiveness and regulation quality), institutional governance (entailing corruption-control and the rule of law) and general governance (a composite measurement of political governance, economic governance and institutional governance). The following main finding is established. Trade openness modulates carbon dioxide emissions to have positive net effects on political stability, economic governance, the rule of law and general governance.
P37|FDI in Selected Developing Countries: Evidence from Bundling and Unbundling Governance|The objective of this study is to assess governance drivers of FDI in a panel of BRICS and MINT countries for the period 2001-2011. We bundle and unbundle governance determinants using a battery of contemporary and non-contemporary estimation techniques. Our findings reveal the following: Firstly, for both contemporary and non-contemporary specifications, while the majority of our governance determinants of Gross FDI are significant, they are overwhelmingly insignificant for Net FDI. Secondly, the significance of the governance dynamics in increasing order of magnitude are general governance, political governance, economic governance, political stability, regulation quality and government effectiveness. Thirdly, for non-contemporary specifications, the significance of governance variables is as follows in ascending order of magnitude: economic governance, institutional governance, general governance, corruption-control, political governance and political stability. The importance of combining governance indicators is captured by the effects of political governance, economic governance and institutional governance. The results indicate that the simultaneous implementation of the various components of governance clarifies a countryâ€™s attractiveness for FDI location. Policy implications are discussed with particular emphasis on the timing of FDI and its targeting.
P37|Environmental Pollution, Economic Growth and Institutional Quality: Exploring the Nexus in Nigeria|The interaction between environmental pollution and economic growth determines the achievement of the green growth objective of developing economies. An economy turns around the inverted U-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) when pollution is effectively dampened by social, political and economic factors as such economy grows. Thus, this study examines the EKC considering the impact of institutional quality on six variables of environmental pollution [carbon dioxide (CO2), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Suspended Particulate Maters (SPM), Rainfall, Temperature and Total Green House Emission (TGH)] using the case of Nigeria. The EKC model includes population density, education expenditure, foreign direct investment, and gross domestic investment as control variables, and it was analysed using the Auto Regressive Distribution Lag (ARDL) econometric technique, which has not been applied in the literature on Nigeria. The results, inter alia, indicate that there is EKC for CO2 and SPM. This implies that the green growth objective can be pursued in Nigeria with concerted efforts. Other environmental pollution indicators did not exert significant influence on economic growth. Therefore, it is recommended that Nigeria’s institutional quality be strengthened to limit environmental pollution in light of economic growth.
P37|Proceso de paz con las FARC y cultivos de coca en el período 2013-2017|Las negociaciones de paz emprendidas por el Gobierno Nacional y las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia –Ejército del Pueblo (FARC-EP), coincidieron con un repunte de las hectáreas sembradas con coca en el país. El repunte en el área cultivada puede estar explicado por la acción de grupos armados diferentes a las FARC que buscan controlar las zonas cocaleras abandonadas por las FARC o por los incentivos que generó el acuerdo de paz. El contenido del cuarto punto de los acuerdos hace referencia a la solución del problema de las drogas e incluye programas de sustitución de cultivos con beneficios para las familias que se acojan a dichos programas. Estos beneficios pueden haber operado como un incentivo perverso, estimulando la siembra de coca. A partir de un modelo de diferencias en diferencias para múltiples períodos, de 2012 a 2017, controlando por las políticas estatales de control de oferta, se encontró que en municipios donde las FARC tuvieron presencia continua durante el período de negociación, hubo un aumento de 604 hectáreas en promedio por municipio para el 2016, y 1032 para 2017. En los años 2013, 2014, 2015 no se observan diferencias significativas comparado con el año base 2012.

P37|Environmental Degradation and Inclusive Human Development in subâ€ Saharan Africa|In the light of challenges to sustainable development in the post-2015 development agenda, this study assesses how increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions affect inclusive human development in 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2000-2012. The following findings are established from Fixed Effects and Tobit regressions. First, unconditional effects and conditional impacts are respectively positive and negative from CO2 emissions per capita, CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption and CO2 intensity. This implies a Kuznets shaped curve because of consistent decreasing returns. Second, the corresponding net effects are consistently positive. The following findings are apparent from Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) regressions. First, unconditional effects and conditional impacts are respectively negative and positive from CO2 emissions per capita, CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption and CO2 intensity. This implies a U-shaped curve because of consistent increasing returns. Second, the corresponding net effects are overwhelmingly negative. Based on the robust findings and choice of best estimator, the net effect of increasing CO2 emissions on inclusive human development is negative. Policy implications are discussed.
P37|CO2 emission thresholds for inclusive human development in Sub-Saharan Africa|We provide policy-relevant critical masses beyond which, increasing CO2 emissions negatively affects inclusive human development. This study examines how increasing CO2 emissions affects inclusive human development in 44 Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Fixed Effects and Tobit regressions. In order to increase the policy relevance of this study, the dataset is decomposed into fundamental characteristics of inclusive development and environmental degradation based on income levels (Low income versus (vs.) Middle income); legal origins (English Common law vs. French Civil law); religious domination (Christianity vs. Islam); openness to sea (Landlocked vs. Coastal); resource-wealth (Oil-rich vs. Oil-poor) and political stability (Stable vs. Unstable). All computed thresholds are within policy range. Hence, above these thresholds, CO2 emissions negatively affect inclusive human development.
P37|The role of inclusive development and military expenditure in modulating the effect of terrorism on governance|Purpose- The study investigates the role of inclusive human development and military expenditure in modulating the effect of terrorism on governance. Design/methodology/approach- It is based on 53 African countries for the period 1998-2012 and interactive Generalised Method of Moments is employed. Six governance indicators from the World Bank and two terrorism variables are used, namely: domestic and transnational terrorism dynamics. Findings- The following main findings are established. There is a negative net effect on governance (regulation quality and corruption-control) when inclusive human development is used to reduce terrorism. There is a positive net impact on governance (“voice and accountability” and rule of law) when military expenditure is used to reduce domestic terrorism. Originality/value- We have complemented the sparse literature on the use of policy variables to mitigate the effect of policy syndromes on macroeconomic outcomes.
P37|The Mobile Phone as an Argument for Good Governance in sub-Saharan Africa|The study presents theoretical and empirical arguments for the role of mobile telephony in promoting good governance in 47 sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012
P37|The Comparative Economics of ICT, Environmental Degradation and Inclusive Human Development in Sub-Saharan Africa|Abstract This study examines how information and communication technology (ICT) could be employed to dampen the potentially damaging effects of environmental degradation in order to promote inclusive human development in a panel of 44 Sub-Saharan African countries. ICT is captured with internet and mobile phone penetration rates whereas environmental degradation is measured in terms of CO2 emissions per capita and CO2 intensity. The empirical evidence is based on fixed effects and Tobit regressions using data from 2000 to 2012. In order to increase the policy relevance of this study, the dataset is decomposed into fundamental characteristics of inclusive development and environmental degradation based on income levels (low income vs. middle income); legal origins (English Common law vs. French Civil law); religious domination (Christianity vs. Islam); openness to sea (landlocked vs. coastal); resource-wealth (oil-rich vs. oil-poor) and political stability (stable vs. unstable). Baseline findings broadly show that improvement in both of measures of ICT would significantly diminish the possibly harmful effect of CO2 emissions on inclusive human development. When the analysis is extended with the above mentioned fundamental characteristics, we observe that the moderating influence of both our ICT variables on CO2 emissions is higher in the group of English Common law, middle income and oil-wealthy countries than in the French Civil law, low income countries and oil-poor countries respectively. Theoretical and practical policy implications are discussed.
P37|Determinants of foreign direct investment in fast-growing economies: evidence from the BRICS and MINT countries|Abstract The flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) into a country can benefit both the investing entity and host government. This study employed panel analysis to examine the factors that determine the direction of FDI to the fast-growing BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and MINT (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Turkey) countries. First, we used a pooled time-series cross sectional analysis of data from 2001 to 2011 to estimate and model the determinants of FDI for three samples: BRICS only, MINT only, and BRICS and MINT combined. Then, a fixed effects approach was employed to provide the model for BRICS and MINT combined. The results demonstrate that market size, infrastructure availability, and trade openness play the most significant roles in attracting FDI to BRICS and MINT, while the roles of availability of natural resources and institutional quality are insignificant. To sustain and promote FDI inflow, the governments of BRICS and MINT must ensure that their countries remain attractive for investment by offering a level playing field for investors and political stability. BRICS and MINT governments also need to invest more in their human capital to ensure that their economies can absorb substantial skills and technology spillovers from FDI and promote sustainable long-term economic growth. This study is significant because it contributes to the literature on determinants of FDI by extending the scope of previous studies that often focused on BRICS only.
P37|Governance and social media in African countries: An empirical investigation|This study assesses linkages between social media and governance dynamics in 49 African countries for the year 2012. The empirical evidence is based on ordinary least squares and quantile regressions. Ten bundled and unbundled governance dynamics are used, notably: (i) political governance (entailing “voice & accountability” and political stability/no violence); (ii) economic governance (involving regulation quality and government effectiveness); (iii) institutional governance (comprising the rule of law and corruption-control) and (iv) general governance (entailing political, economic and institutional governance). Social media is measured with Facebook penetration. The findings show that Facebook penetration is positively associated with governance dynamics and these positive nexuses differ in terms of significance and magnitude of significance throughout the conditional distribution of the governance dynamics.
P37|The Comparative African Economics of Governance in Fighting Terrorism|This study assesses the comparative economics of governance in fighting terrorism in 53 African countries for period 1996-2012. Four terrorism variables are used, namely: domestic, transnational, unclear and total terrorism dynamics. Nine bundled and unbundled governance variables are employed, notably: political stability/no violence, voice & accountability, political governance, government effectiveness, regulation quality, economic governance, corruption-control, the rule of law and institutional governance. The empirical evidence is based on Fixed Effects regressions. In the analytical procedure, we first bundle governance indicators by means of principal component analysis before engaging the empirical exercise with the full sample. In the final step, specifications are based on a decomposed full sample in order to articulate the fundamental characteristics for comparative purposes. The following broad findings are established. First, good governance is an appealing tool in fighting terrorism. Second, the relevance of the good governance dynamics is as follows in order of increasing relevance: economic governance, institutional governance and political governance. The findings are presented in increasing order of magnitude to emphasise fundamental features in which governance dynamics have the highest effect in mitigating terrorism.
P37|Economic Security and Political Governance Crisis in the Central African Republic|Nowadays the Central African Republic (CAR) is experiencing huge economic insecurity which mostly derives from the political governance crisis that the country has been continuously undergoing since its independence in 1960. This paper examines the relationship between political governance crisis and economic security in the country covering the period of 1996-2015, using two stage instrumental analysis and second order asymptotic tests. The results show that political stability and absence of violence/terrorism ,voice and accountability, proxies of political governance crisis played a different role on national income per capita, agricultural raw materials exports, agriculture value added, external balance on goods and services, food exports, food imports, foreign direct investment, GDP growth, GDP per capita growth, inflation, wage and salaried workers, industry value added, total natural resources rent and trade , proxies of economic security. The importance of sustainable political governance stability and the implementation of appropriate reforms at institutional level are a preconditions to economic security.
P37|Fragility of State in Central African Republic: An Econometric Approach to Efficiency Understanding|A fragile state contributes to the underdevelopment of the nation and its consequences can be very devastating on the stateâ€™s cohesion. Characterized by high level of corruption which lead the country to an incessant political instability and continuous presence of foreign troops . This paper used the vector autoregressive model (VAR) covering the period of 2005-2015 to examine the impact of control of corruption on fragility of state in Central African Republic (CAR). The results show that control of corruption is significant and has negative impact on fragility of state in the short run. The impulse response shows a negative impact of control of corruption in short-run but positive in long-run on fragility of state. The policies implications of this fragility are that the CAR must pursue better governance as well as in the investment choices. Unless CAR leaders and citizens recognize their own fragility, things can only get worse.
P37|Environmental Degradation and Inclusive Human Development in subâ€ Saharan Africa|In the light of challenges to sustainable development in the post-2015 development agenda, this study assesses how increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions affect inclusive human development in 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2000-2012. The following findings are established from Fixed Effects and Tobit regressions. First, unconditional effects and conditional impacts are respectively positive and negative from CO2 emissions per capita, CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption and CO2 intensity. This implies a Kuznets shaped curve because of consistent decreasing returns. Second, the corresponding net effects are consistently positive. The following findings are apparent from Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) regressions. First, unconditional effects and conditional impacts are respectively negative and positive from CO2 emissions per capita, CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption and CO2 intensity. This implies a U-shaped curve because of consistent increasing returns. Second, the corresponding net effects are overwhelmingly negative. Based on the robust findings and choice of best estimator, the net effect of increasing CO2 emissions on inclusive human development is negative. Policy implications are discussed.

P37|Corruption in Russia - Historic Legacy and Systemic Nature|This paper argues that corruption in Russia is systemic in nature. Low wage levels of public officials provide strong incentives to engage in corruption. As corruption is illegal, corrupt officials can be exposed any time, which enforces loyalty towards the powers that be; thus corruption is a method of governance. We trace the systemic corruption back to the Mongolian empire and demonstrate its persistence to the current regime. We show the geographic distribution of contemporary corruption within Russia, survey the literature on the causes, consequences, and cures of corruption in Russia, and discuss entry points to fighting it.
P37|Conflicto Armado, Estado y Homicidios en Colombia: Una Aproximación a Nivel Local|En este documento se estudian las relaciones causales entre conflicto armado, disuasión del crimen y violencia homicida. Se emplean datos de corte transversal a nivel municipal que comprenden el periodo del 2000 al 2014. El estudio utiliza una muestra que contiene aquellos municipios que tuvieron presencia del Estado en 1794 y a los municipios adyacentes. Lo anterior con el fin de tener una muestra más homogénea y realizar comparaciones entre municipios similares. La estrategia de identificación emplea efectos fijos de municipios vecinos, variable instrumental y análisis de mediación. Como variable instrumental se utiliza la distancia lineal de la cabecera municipal a la frontera de la zona de distensión, creada en 1998. Los resultados muestran que indicadores de disuasión del crimen, como fuerza policial y capturas, se afectan negativamente por la presencia del conflicto armado. Pero que este efecto negativo no es la causa de un aumento en los homicidios municipales. Por tanto, se muestra que la fuerza policial y las capturas no son canales a través de los cuales el conflicto afecta a los homicidios. Por último, se encuentran efectos heterogéneos de la presencia histórica de Estado. En aquellos municipios con una presencia más larga del Estado en el tiempo, el gobierno asigna mayor número de policías como respuesta al conflicto armado. Como consecuencia de esto, las tasas de homicidios en esos municipios disminuyen.
P37|El Efecto Globo: identificación de regiones propensas a la producción de coca|La lucha contra las drogas, especialmente contra la cocaína, ha empleado una gran porción de los recursos económicos, ambientales y humanos de Colombia en las últimas cuatro décadas. No obstante, no parece que haya avances significativos en la reducción del tráfico de cocaína ni en la reducción de cultivos de coca. Una de las principales razones por la que las estrategias que atacan la oferta de narcotráfico han fracasado es el llamado Efecto Globo, según el cual represiones en la producción de drogas de una región están asociados a aumentos en otras regiones por efectos de desplazamiento. Con el objetivo de reducir de manera definitiva los cultivos de coca en Colombia durante la implementación de los acuerdos de paz, se busca identificar los municipios susceptibles a las consecuencias del Efecto Globo, es decir, encontrar los municipios que son potencialmente cocaleros a través de un ejercicio de predicción. Este ejercicio permitirá alertar al gobierno para que implemente políticas focalizadas que eviten el desarrollo de producción de hoja de coca. La metodología empírica se centra en técnicas de análisis supervisado de aprendizaje de máquinas (machine learning), en particular ensambles de modelos a través de subbagging, los cuales permiten el desarrollo de un modelo de predicción agregado que pueda clasificar los municipios potencialmente cocaleros.

P37|Leniency, Asymmetric Punishment and Corruption: Evidence from China|Leniency policies and asymmetric punishment are regarded as potentially powerful anticorruption tools, also in the light of their success in busting price-fixing cartels. It has been argued, however, that the introduction of these policies in China in 1997 has not helped fighting corruption. Following up on this view, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party passed, in November 2015, a reform introducing heavier penalties, but also restrictions to leniency. Properly designing and correctly evaluating these policies is difficult. Corruption is only observed if detected, and an increase in convictions is consistent with both reduced deterrence or improved detection. We map the evolution of the Chinese anti-corruption legislation, collect data on corruption cases for the period 1986-2010, and apply a new method to identify deterrence effects from changes in detected cases developed for cartels by Miller (2009). We document a large and stable fall in corruption cases starting immediately after the 1997 reform, consistent with a negative effect of the reform on corruption detection, but under specific assumptions also with increased deterrence. To resolve this ambiguity, we collect and analyze a random sample of case files from corruption trials. Results point to a negative effect of the 1997 reform, linked to the increased leniency also for bribe-takers cooperating after being denounced. This likely enhanced their ability to retaliate against reporting bribe-givers – chilling detection through whistleblowing – as predicted by theories on how these programs should (not) be designed.
P37|Establishing A New State under Human Resource Constraint: The Experience of the German Reunification|The human resources of East Germany were short in the terms of political integrity and professional qualification to establish the new public institutions modeled to those of West Germany. Dispatching West-German personnel, extensive re-training, and creation of informal personal network were the solution to compensate the shortage and to transfer knowledge and know-hows to East Germany. Reunified Germany established the new public institutions quickly, although the sudden change might discourage East-German personnel’s self-efforts to improve their capacities. The German experience suggests that it is difficult for the other ex-socialist countries those cannot expect quick transfer of knowledge and know-hows from the democratic market countries to establish their new public institutions quickly. It would take a long time of a generation and more for those countries to complete the systemic transformations, because the accumulation of the human capital needs the long period., Highlights: ・Human capital for operating state institutions is short in systemic transformation. ・Transfer of knowledge and know-hows is needed to solve the problem. ・Dispatching West-German personnel, re-training, and informal network solved it. ・Applying the German solution to the other ex-socialist countries are difficult. ・A generation or more are needed to complete the systemic transformation.
P37|Former Communist party membership and bribery in the post-socialist countries|We study the effect of former Communist party membership on paying bribes to public officials and motivations for bribery, 25 years after the fall of communist rule. Data come from a large representative survey, conducted in post-socialist countries in 2015/16. To deal with endogeneity, we instrument party membership with information on whether family members were affected by the Second World War. Instrumental variable results suggest that links to the former Communist party increase the likelihood of paying bribes today; this result applies to the former party members as well as their children and relatives. Among bribe payers, people with the party links are more likely to offer bribes as well as think that bribe payments are expected. Overall, our findings suggest that the proclivity to corruption of the former Communist party members has been transmitted through family and thus sustained over time, contributing to corruption decades after the demise of the Socialist bloc.
P37|CO2 emission thresholds for inclusive human development in Sub-Saharan Africa|We provide policy-relevant critical masses beyond which, increasing CO2 emissions negatively affects inclusive human development. This study examines how increasing CO2 emissions affects inclusive human development in 44 Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Fixed Effects and Tobit regressions. In order to increase the policy relevance of this study, the dataset is decomposed into fundamental characteristics of inclusive development and environmental degradation based on income levels (Low income versus (vs.) Middle income); legal origins (English Common law vs. French Civil law); religious domination (Christianity vs. Islam); openness to sea (Landlocked vs. Coastal); resource-wealth (Oil-rich vs. Oil-poor) and political stability (Stable vs. Unstable). All computed thresholds are within policy range. Hence, above these thresholds, CO2 emissions negatively affect inclusive human development.
P37|The Mobile Phone as an Argument for Good Governance in Sub-Saharan Africa|Purpose- This study presents theoretical and empirical arguments for the role of mobile telephony in promoting good governance in 47 sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. Design/methodology/approach- The empirical inquiry uses an endogeneity-robust GMM approach with forward orthogonal deviations to analyse the linkage between mobile phone usage and the variation in three broad governance categories â€” political, economic and institutional. Findings- Three key findings are established: First, in terms of individual governance indicators, mobile phones consistently stimulated good governance by the same magnitude, with the exception of the effect on the regulation component of economic governance. Second, when indicators are combined, the effect of mobile phones on general governance is three times higher than that on the institutional governance category. Third, countries with lower levels of governance indicators are catching-up with their counterparts with more advanced dynamics. Originality/value- The study makes both theoretical and empirical contributions by highlighting the importance of various combinations of governance indicators and their responsiveness to mobile phone usage.
P37|The Comparative African Economics of Governance in Fighting Terrorism|This study assesses the comparative economics of governance in fighting terrorism in 53 African countries for period 1996-2012. Four terrorism variables are used, namely: domestic, transnational, unclear and total terrorism dynamics. Nine bundled and unbundled governance variables are employed, notably: political stability/no violence, voice & accountability, political governance, government effectiveness, regulation quality, economic governance, corruption-control, the rule of law and institutional governance. The empirical evidence is based on Fixed Effects regressions. In the analytical procedure, we first bundle governance indicators by means of principal component analysis before engaging the empirical exercise with the full sample. In the final step, specifications are based on a decomposed full sample in order to articulate the fundamental characteristics for comparative purposes. The following broad findings are established. First, good governance is an appealing tool in fighting terrorism. Second, the relevance of the good governance dynamics is as follows in order of increasing relevance: economic governance, institutional governance and political governance. The findings are presented in increasing order of magnitude to emphasise fundamental features in which governance dynamics have the highest effect in mitigating terrorism.
P37|Comparative Analysis of Ethical Boundaries and Regulations for Lawyers in The United States, European Union and Russia/Legal Profession in a Comparative Context|This presentation is intended to expose participants to various types of regulation of lawyers in different parts of the world. It will comparatively examine the structure and ethical framework of the legal profession in the United States (mainly based on the ?Model Rules of Professional Conduct? issued by the American Bar Association), European Union (covered in the well-accepted cross-border legal practice regulation of lawyers-document titled the ?CCBE?), and in Russia (described in the ?Code of Professional Ethics for the Attorney?), as an example of a post-Soviet country, including the recourse that may be taken against attorneys for ethical misconduct and professional malpractice. Other topics to be covered will include a range of accompanying ethical and legal issues, such as the role of lawyers and judges, beginning and ending of the attorney-client relationship, globalization of the legal profession and the image and expectations of lawyers in parts of the world mentioned above. The presentation will also address various aspects of ethical law practice in selected countries described and analyze the reasons behind established traditions and practices in various legal systems.
P37|Democratic support and corruption: Lessons from East Europe|It has been recognized that the support for democracy seems to be increasing with the time spent in a democratic system. An individual's life experience living under democratic rule positively affects the support for democracy as a political system. Therefore it seemed inevitable that the newly democratic eastern European member countries of the European Union would reap the benefits of democratization and slowly foster democratic support. However, recent backlashes to democratic rule in those countries seem to be contradictory. Therefore this paper investigates whether people's rising democratic capital in these new democracies also increases the support for democracy in those countries. Furthermore we examine if the quality of other institutions and especially corruption play a role in shaping the support for democracy and whether the positive effect of democratic capital on democratic support might be undermined. We find that the recent repercussions to democratic rule in eastern European countries are no coincidence. The effect of people's rising democratic capital on the support for democracy is negative in those countries. It has therefore been falling. Moreover, we establish that the increased experiences of corruption in these states undermine the support for democracy. Specifically, that democracy and corruption are complementary institutions. Only in the absence of corruption can the experience of democracy have its full effect on prodemocratic attitudes.
P37|The Impact of Terrorism on Governance in African Countries|This study investigates how terrorism affects governance in 53 African countries for the period 1998–2012. Four terrorism indicators are used namely: domestic, transnational, unclear, and total terrorism. Ten bundled and unbundled governance indicators are also employed namely: political governance (consisting of political stability and voice and accountability), economic governance (encompassing government effectiveness and regulation quality); institutional governance (entailing corruption-control and the rule of law), and general governance. The governance indicators are bundled by means of principal component analysis. The empirical evidence is based on Generalized Method of Moments. Three key findings are established. First, all selected terrorism dynamics negatively affect political governance and its constituents. Second, evidence of a negative relationship is sparingly apparent in economic governance and its components. Third, no proof was confirmed in relation to the impact of terrorism and institutional governance with its elements. Fourth, compared with domestic terrorism, transnational terrorism more negatively and significantly affects political, economic, and general governances. Policy implications are discussed.
P37|Government quality determinants of ICT adoption in sub-Saharan Africa|Abstract This study investigates government quality determinants of ICT adoption using Generalised Method of Moments on a panel of 49 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries for the period 2000-2012. ICT is measured with mobile phone penetration, internet penetration and telephone penetration rates while all governance dimensions from the World Bank Governance Indicators are considered, namely: political governance (consisting of political stability and “voice & accountability”); economic governance (entailing government effectiveness and regulation quality) and institutional governance (encompassing the rule of law and corruption-control). The following findings are established. First, political stability and the rule of law have positive short-run and negative long-term effects on mobile phone penetration. Second, the rule of law has a positive (negative) short-run (long-term) effect on internet penetration. Third, government effectiveness and corruption-control have positive short-run and long-term effects on telephone penetration. Institutional governance appears to be most significant in determining ICT adoption in SSA.
P37|Mobile Phone Innovation and Environmental Sustainability in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study investigates how the mobile phone can complement knowledge diffusion in order to influence CO2 emissions in 44 Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments. Three knowledge diffusion variables representing three of the four pillars of the World Bank’s Knowledge Economy Index are employed: educational quality, information and communication technology (ICT) and scientific output. Six CO2 emission variables are used, namely: CO2 per capita, CO2 from electricity and heat, CO2 from liquid fuel, CO2 from manufacturing and construction, CO2 from transport and CO2 intensity. In the assessments, a decreasing tendency in these variables translates into positive conditions for environmental sustainability. Based on net effect from complementarities, the following findings are established. First, the mobile phone complements education to have a net negative effect on CO2 emissions per capita and CO2 emissions from the consumption of liquid fuel. Second, where some positive net effects of knowledge diffusion are apparent, corresponding marginal effects are negative. Corresponding mobile phone penetration thresholds at which the positive net effects on CO2 emissions can be dampened and reversed are largely within policy range. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.
P37|Openness, ICT and Entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study has examined how information and communication technology (ICT) influences openness to improve the conditions of doing business in sub-Saharan Africa. The data is for the period 2000-2012. ICT is proxied with Internet and mobile phone penetration rates whereas openness is measured in terms of financial and trade globalisation. Ten indicators of doing business are used, namely: (i) cost of business start-up procedures; (ii) procedure to enforce a contract; (iii) start-up procedures to register a business; (iv) time required to build a warehouse; (v) time required to enforce a contract; (vi) time required to register a property; (vii) time required to start a business; (viii) time to export; (ix) time to prepare and pay taxes and (x) time to resolve an insolvency. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments with forward orthogonal deviations. While we find substantial evidence that ICT complements openness to improve conditions for entrepreneurship, the effects are contingent on the dynamics of openness, ICT and entrepreneurship. Theoretical and practical policy implications are discussed. The inquiry is based on two contemporary development concerns: the need for policy to leverage on the ICT penetration potential in the sub-region and the relevance of entrepreneurship in addressing associated issues of population growth such as unemployment.
P37|Environmental Degradation, ICT and Inclusive Development in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study examines how information and communication technology (ICT) complements carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to influence inclusive human development in forty-four Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000-2012. ICT is measured with internet penetration and mobile phone penetration. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments. The findings broadly show that ICT can be employed to dampen the potentially negative effect of environmental pollution on human development. We establish that: (i) ICT complements CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption to increase inclusive development; (ii) ICT interacts with CO2 intensity to negatively affect inclusive human development and (iii) the net effect on inclusive human development is positive from the complementarity between mobile phones and CO2 emissions per capita. Conversely, we also establish evidence of net negative effects. Fortunately, the corresponding ICT thresholds at which these net negative effects can be completely dampened are within policy range, notably: 50 (per 100 people) mobile phone penetration for CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption and CO2 intensity. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.
P37|Enhancing ICT for Environmental Sustainability in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study examines how increasing ICT penetration in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) can contribute towards environmental sustainability by decreasing CO2 emissions. The empirical evidence is based the Generalised Method of Moments and forty-four countries for the period 2000-2012. ICT is measured with internet penetration and mobile phone penetration while CO2 emissions per capita and CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption are used as proxies for environmental degradation. The following findings are established: First, from the non-interactive regressions, ICT (i.e. mobile phones and the internet) does not significantly affect CO2 emissions. Second, with interactive regressions, increasing ICT has a positive net effect on CO2 emissions per capita while increasing mobile phone penetration alone has a net negative effect on CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption. Policy thresholds at which ICT can change the net effects from positive to negative are computed and discussed. These policy thresholds are the minimum levels of ICT required, for the effect of ICT on CO2 emissions to be negative. Other practical implications for policy and theory are discussed.
P37|Fighting terrorism in Africa: evidence from bundling and unbundling institutions|This study assesses government mechanisms in the fight against terrorism with particular emphasis on the bundling and unbundling of ten governance dynamics. The empirical evidence is based on a panel of 53 African countries for period 1998-2012 and Generalized Method of Moments. The following findings are established. First, for the most part, political governance and its constituents respectively have negative effects on all terrorism dynamics, with the following consistent increasing order of negative magnitude: unclear terrorism, transnational terrorism, domestic terrorism and total terrorism. Second, overwhelmingly for economic and institutional governances, the governance dynamics and their constituent components affect terrorism negatively, with the magnitude on domestic terrorism consistently higher than that on transnational terrorism. Third, for most specifications, the effect of general governance is consistently negative on terrorism variables. Theoretical and practical policy implications are discussed.
P37|The Role of Openness in the Effect of ICT on Governance|The study investigates how openness influences information and communication technology (ICT) penetration for improved government quality in sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2000-2012. Openness is measured in terms of trade and financial globalisation whereas ICT is proxied with mobile phone and internet penetration rates. Ten bundled and unbundled governance indicators are used. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments with forward orthogonal deviations. The main findings are: First, financial openness has an edge over trade openness when combined with ICT to affect both economic and institutional governance. Second, mobile phones have an edge over internet penetration in complementing (i) trade openness for economic governance and (ii) financial openness for institutional governance. Third, net effects on political governance are consistently negative. Taken together, in the short-run, openness-driven ICT policies are more rewarding in terms of economic and institutional governance than political governance. Fourth, catch-up in governance is facilitated by the interaction between openness and ICT. Contributions of these findings to literature are discussed.
P37|ICT, Openness and CO2 emissions in Africa|This study investigates how information and communication technology (ICT) complements globalisation in order to influence CO2 emissions in 44 Sub-Saharan African countries over the period 2000-2012. ICT is measured with internet penetration and mobile phone penetration whereas globalisation is designated in terms of trade and financial openness. The empirical evidence is based on the Generalised Method of Moments. The findings broadly show that ICT can be employed to dampen the potentially negative effect of globalisation on environmental degradation like CO2 emissions. Practical, policy and theoretical implications are discussed.
P37|Comparative Sustainable Development in Sub-Saharan Africa|Motivated by sustainable development challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa, this study assesses the comparative persistence of environmental unsustainability in a sample of 44 countries in the sub-region for the period 2000 to 2012. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments. Of the six hypotheses tested, it is not feasible to assess the hypothesis on resource-wealth because of issues in degrees of freedom. As for the remaining hypotheses, the following findings are established. (i) Hypothesis 1 postulating that middle income countries have a lower level of persistence in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is valid for CO2 per capita emissions, CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production and CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption. (ii) Hypothesis 2 on the edge of French civil law countries is valid for CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption and CO2 intensity, but not for CO2 per capita emissions. (iii) Hypothesis 3 on the postulation that politically-unstable countries reflect more persistence is valid for CO2 per capita emissions. (iv) Hypothesis 5 on the propensity for landlocked countries to be associated with more persistence in CO2 emissions is valid for CO2 per capita emissions but not for CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption. (v) Hypothesis 6 maintaining that Christianity-dominated countries are more environmentally friendly with regard to CO2 emissions is valid for CO2 per capita emissions but not for CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption and CO2 intensity. Implications for policy and theory are discussed.
P37|The Slow growth of Foreign Direct Investment in Central African Republic|Large amounts of foreign direct investment have been attracted by many African countries. Yet the Central African Republic is by far less attractive in the perspective of potential investors. The aim of this paper is to investigate the slow inflows and growth of FDI in the country. In the short-run and long-run we found out that the Gross Domestic Product growth, the domestic credit to private sector, the electricity production and the quality of public administration are not significant. The Error Correction Mechanism is significant at 0.05 which demonstrates that the speed of adjustment of the model from short-run to long-run is about 46%. It is very important for Central African Republic to renovate the national electricity supply company by increasing the hydro- electric production.

P37|Secrecy and State Capacity: A Look Behind the Iron Curtain|This paper reviews two decades of research on the political economy of secrecy, based on the records of former Soviet state and party archives. Secrecy was an element of Soviet state capacity, particularly its capacity for decisiveness, free of the pressures and demands for accountability that might have arisen from a better informed citizenry. But secrecy was double-edged. Its uses also incurred substantial costs that weakened the capacity of the Soviet state to direct and decide. The paper details the costs of secrecy associated with “conspirative” government business processes, adverse selection of management personnel, everyday abuses of authority, and an uninformed leadership.

P37|The effect of Western TV on crime: Evidence from East Germany|This paper explores the potential causal influence of Western television programming on crime rates. We exploit a natural experiment involving access to West German TV within the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in which only geography and topography determined the allocation of individuals to treatment and control groups. Focusing on violent and property crime (as these domains were most likely to be affected by the marked differences in TV content), we find that in the post-reunification decade in which TV content was harmonized, regions that had access to Western TV broadcasts prior to the reunification experienced lower rates of violent crime, sex crime, and theft, but more fraud.
P37|Media content's role in the making of a democrat: Evidence from East Germany|This paper explores the causal infl uence of access to Western television programming on voting behavior. We exploit a natural experiment involving access to West German TV within the German Democratic Republic in which only geography and topography determined the allocation of individuals to treatment and control groups. Focusing on both the shares of extremist parties and voter turnout, we find that in the post-reuni cation decade in which TV content was harmonized, regions that already had access to Western TV broadcasts before reunification experience lower vote shares of extremist parties and higher voter turnout.
P37|Legal Systems and Blockchain Interactions|A large amount of money is spent globally in the litigation process. A significant chunk of litigations can actually be prevented from even arising if the policies, contracts and laws can be fully objectivised. Presently, the interpretation of law, contracts, policies etc. lead to a lot of confusion and ambiguities. This complicates the justice process. This paper deals with simplifying the legal procedures by using Blockchain Technology. Firstly I introduce the concept of Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies. Then we discuss the present legal services. The ways in which Blockchain technology can be applied to legal processes is identified. Civil and Common law systems are the most widespread in the world. The probable impact of Blockchain on law systems is evaluated. The paper concludes by summarizing the consequences and suitability of using Blockchain Technology in Law systems and Legal services.
P37|The Role of Openness in the Effect of ICT on Governance|The study investigates how openness influences information and communication technology (ICT) penetration for improved government quality in sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2000-2012. Openness is measured in terms of trade and financial globalisation whereas ICT is proxied with mobile phone and internet penetration rates. Ten bundled and unbundled governance indicators are used. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments with forward orthogonal deviations. The main findings are: First, financial openness has an edge over trade openness when combined with ICT to affect both economic and institutional governance. Second, mobile phones have an edge over internet penetration in complementing (i) trade openness for economic governance and (ii) financial openness for institutional governance. Third, net effects on political governance are consistently negative. Taken together, in the short-run, openness-driven ICT policies are more rewarding in terms of economic and institutional governance than political governance. Fourth, catch-up in governance is facilitated by the interaction between openness and ICT. Contributions of these findings to literature are discussed.
P37|Economic Crimes in the Shortage Economy|Rational agents react on the incentives in the market economy as well as in the centrally planned economy. Economic laws are persistent regardless the economic system. Legislative system changes the outcome of the game between economic agents and managers. Base on the original survey among former managers as well as on the legislative sources from the 1970?s and 1980?s the taxonomy of economic reactions on the shortage economy was made. We distinguish plan manipulation in order to ensure payment bonuses; bribery in order to gain the short-supplied inputs and reserves? creation for the purpose of the fulfilling the plan. It was shown, that if the rational agent wanted to obey the higher law, he was forced to ignore lower legislation.
P37|The Impact of Marketization on Entrepreneurship in China: Recent Evidence|"While marketization has been linked to provincial-level economic growth in China, how marketization leads to growth has not been explored. We hypothesize that marketization creates an environment that encourages entrepreneurship, which manifests itself in economic growth. While this argument is not new, it has not been explored in the Chinese context. We fill this gap by empirically testing the relationship between marketization and measures of entrepreneurship across Chinese provinces. Our primary measures of entrepreneurship are level changes in the number of ""private enterprises"" and ""self-employed individuals"". We find that higher levels of marketization are positively related to higher levels of entrepreneurship. These positive effects are largely driven by three areas of marketization. ""Government and market"" drives both measures of entrepreneurship, while ""Legal frameworks"" in uences only private enterprises and ""ownership structure"" in uences self-employment."
P37|Economic Freedom and Government Efficiency: Recent Evidence from China|We investigate the effects of economic freedom (marketization) on governance efficiency defined with the newest provincial level economic indicator data (NBSC, 2017) and economic freedom data (Fan et al., 2017) from 2008 to 2014 in China. With two different measures, the results suggest that economic freedom is positively correlated with governance efficiency. Moreover, the liberalization and marketization progress in the â€œfactors marketâ€ is the single most significant area for both governance efficiency measures, while other areas like â€œmarket intermediary & legal systemâ€ have no significant effects.
P37|Corruption in Procurement and the Political Cycle in Tunneling: Evidence from Financial Transactions Data|"We provide evidence of corruption in allocation of public procurement and assess its efficiency. Firms with procurement revenue increase tunneling around regional elections, whereas neither tunneling of firms without procurement revenue, nor legitimate business of firms with procurement exhibits a political cycle. Data are consistent with the corruption channel—cash is tunneled to politicians in exchange for procurement contracts—and inconsistent with alternative channels. Using the strength of correlation between procurement revenue and tunneling around elections as a proxy for local corruption, we reject the ""efficient grease"" hypothesis: in more corrupt localities, procurement contracts go to unproductive firms.

P37|The role of governance in mobile phones for inclusive human development in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study assesses the synergy effects of governance in mobile phone penetration for inclusive human development in Sub-Saharan Africa with data for the period 2000â€“2012. It employs a battery of interactive estimation techniques, namely: Fixed effects, Generalised Method of Moments and Tobit regressions. Concepts of political (voice and accountability and political stability/no violence), economic (government effectiveness and regulation quality) and institutional (corruption-control and rule of law) governance are employed. The following findings are established. The previously apparent positive correlation between mobile phones and inclusive development can be extended to a positive effect. Although political governance is overwhelmingly not significant across estimated models, the average effects from economic governance are higher relative to institutional governance. On the interactions between mobile phones and governance variables, while none are apparent in Fixed effects regressions, there are significant synergy effects in Generalised Method of Moments and Tobit estimations, notably, from: regulation quality in the former and political stability, voice and accountability and rule of law in the latter. There is consistent evidence of convergence in inclusive human development. Policy implications are discussed.
P37|The Mobile Phone in the Diffusion of Knowledge for Institutional Quality in Sub-Saharan Africa|This study assesses the mobile phone in the diffusion of knowledge for better governance in Sub-Saharan Africa from 2000 to 2012. For this purpose we employ Generalised Method of Moments with forward orthogonal deviations. The empirical evidence is based on three complementary knowledge diffusion variables (innovation, internet penetration and educational quality) and 10 governance indicators that are bundled and unbundled. The following are the main findings. First, there is an unconditional positive effect of mobile phone penetration on good governance. Second, the net effects on political, economic, and institutional governances that are associated with the interaction of the mobile phone with knowledge diffusion variables are positive for the most part. Third, countries with low levels of governance are catching-up their counterparts with higher levels of governance. The above findings are broadly consistent with theoretical underpinnings on the relevance of mobile phones in mitigating bad governance in Africa. The evidence of some insignificant net effects and decreasing marginal impacts may be an indication that the mobile phone could also be employed to decrease government quality. Overall, this study has established net positive effects for the most part. Five rationales could elicit the positive net effects on good governance from the interaction between mobile phones and knowledge diffusion, among others, the knowledge variables enhance: reach, access, adoption, cost-effectiveness, and interaction. In a nut shell, the positive net effects are apparent because the knowledge diffusion variables complement mobile phones in reducing information asymmetry and monopoly that create conducive conditions for bad governance. The contribution of the findings to existing theories and justifications of the underlying positive net effects are discussed.
P37|FDI and Growth in the MENA countries: Are the GCC countries Different?|This paper examines the relationship between Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region for the period 1985-2009. The empirical evidence is based on an endoeneity-robust Generalised Method of Moments. Results show that the effect of FDI on per capita income in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries is positive but negative in Non-GCC countries. Results also reveal that in contrast to the GCC countries, the financial openness policy in the Non-GCC countries have reduced the benefits of FDI on growth, this finding is explained by the fact that most of the Non-GCC countries that have engaged in the process of financial reforms have poor quality of institutions. These results are confirmed with both annual data and five year average data.
P37|Fighting Capital Flight in Africa: Evidence from Bundling and Unbundling Governance|Abstract This study investigates the effect of governance on capital flight by bundling and unbundling governance. The empirical evidence is based on 37 African countries for the period 1996–2010 and the Generalised Method of Moments. Governance is bundled by principal component analysis, namely: (i) political governance from political stability and ‘voice and accountability’; (ii) economic governance from government effectiveness and regulation quality and (iii) institutional governance from corruption-control and the rule of law. The following findings are established. (i) Political stability and ‘voice and accountability’ reduce capital flight while the collective effect of political governance is not significant. (ii) Economic governance increases capital flight whereas the individual effects of regulation quality and government effectiveness are not significant. (iii) Corruption-control and institutional governance negatively affect capital flight whereas the impact of the rule of law is not significant. (iv) Taken together, Corruption-control is the most effective governance weapon in the fight against capital flight. (v) Priority in the Washington Consensus is more effective at fighting capital flight compared to the Beijing Model. Policy implications are discussed.
P37|Debt Recovery in Firm Liquidations: Do Liquidation Trustees Matter?|Insolvency systems play a crucial role in protection of creditor rights, yet micro-level empirical evidence on the functioning of insolvency regimes worldwide is sparse. We investigate whether creditors’ recovery of outstanding claims, a measure of ex-post efficiency of an insolvency regime, depends on the characteristics of the trustee delegated the administration of the liquidation proceedings. To this end, we draw on a novel dataset of firm liquidations from Slovenia and exploit courts’ de facto random assignment of firm liquidation cases to licensed liquidation trustees. Using a wide range of specifications and controls, we find that a subset of trustee characteristics indeed matters for debt recovery. Thus, ex-post efficiency of an insolvency regime depends not only on its formal rules and procedures, but also on who implements them in practice.
P37|Courts in a transition economy: Case disposition and the quantity–quality tradeoff in Bulgaria|The lack of an effective judiciary in post-socialist countries has been a pervasive concern and successful judicial reform an elusive goal. Yet to date little empirical research exists on the functioning of courts in the post-socialist world. We draw on a new court-level panel dataset from Bulgaria to study the determinants of court case disposition and to evaluate whether judicial decision-making is subject to a quantity–quality tradeoff. Addressing endogeneity concerns, we find that case disposition in Bulgarian courts is largely driven by the demand for court services. The number of serving judges, a key court resource, matters to a limited extent only in a subsample of courts, a result suggesting that judges adjust their productivity based on the number of judges serving at a court. We do not find evidence implying that increasing court productivity would decrease adjudicatory quality. We discuss the policy implications of our findings.
P37|Inside and outside: The modernized hierarchy that runs China|Describes the process through which China has rebuilt and strengthened its bureaucracy since 1978 without moving toward rule of law. Internally, the bureaucracy has become more rule-governed, and new procedures have been introduced, including regular rules for promotion, credentialing, and turnover, including term limits. However, external accountability is absent. The huge difference between “inside” and “outside” may be a unique feature of the Chinese system.
P37|Corporate governance following mass privatization|Using vouchers to privatize state-owned firms was an innovative but controversial aspect of transition. In the Czech Republic, voucher privatization created a large group of minority shareholders who coexisted with large shareholder–managers who controlled firms. Critics allege that the structure of shareholdings and regulatory failures allowed pervasive theft of corporate assets, much of it financed by irresponsible bank lending, and led to a financial crisis and an economic downturn. I argue that neither anecdotal evidence of managerial malfeasance nor the theories of tunneling and looting provide strong evidence for this view of corporate governance in the Czech Republic. A lack of small shareholder protection seems to have imposed small costs on the economy, and it may have facilitated rather than hampered the restructuring of firms.
P37|О некоторых свойствах наблюдаемого экономического роста в Китае (On Some Features of the Observed Economic Growth in China)|Экономический рост современного Китая впечатляет многих. Эта страна предлагается в качестве модели для подражания экономистами с совершенно противоположными взглядами: от либертарианских до этатистских. Авторы попытались показать, что: - китайский экономический рост менее устойчив, чем кажется; - власти страны, особенно в последние годы, совершают действия, подрывающие стабильность роста; Феномен быстрого экономического роста с огромным притоком иностранных инвестиций и бурным ростом экспортоориентированного сектора. Ключевую роль для Китая сыграло прекращение массовых репрессий при легализации бизнеса, создании индивидуальных неформальных гарантий для отечественных и иностранных предпринимателей. То есть предприниматель не лишался свободы и имущества только из-за воли властей, которая была не ограничена законом или какой-либо внутренней или внешней силой. Изменение политической ситуации вместе с накопленным запасом финансовой прочности создали соблазн усилить контроль над экономикой путем отказа от гарантий сначала для отечественного бизнеса, а затем и для иностранного. Именно это и происходит сейчас: когда начались аресты не только предпринимателей – граждан Китая, но и предпринимателей-нерезидентов. In this article authors focused on factors of Chinese economic miracle. Majority of economists are deeply impressed by high rate of China's economic growth. They are going to search for explanations of the coming new successes of this country. The missed point of these assessments is lack of attention to the new trend of poor formalized China institutions' development. Clearly observable in the modern Peoples Republic of China deterioration of entrepreneur's personal immunity informal guaranties means broken guaranties for private property. The government failure to defend (at least not make a threat) to private property could cause negative influence on China's economic growth in very Long Run.
P37|Legality Of Tax Reform For Civil Societies And Associations Dedicated To Education, Its Effect On Competitiveness, Legalidad De La Reforma Fiscal Para Sociedades Y Asociaciones Civiles Dedicadas A Ensenanza, Efecto En Su Competitividad Operativa|This research addresses the issue of how tax reform applies to societies and associations dedicated to education in Mexico, its legality and the effect on competitiveness of operations. These associations are recognized by the Mexican tax law as legal persons not taxpayers for income tax purposes. However, the tax reforms effective as of January 2014 are conditional on the recognition of authorized donees as taxpayers not otherwise be subject to tax. Fiscal area specialists were consulted and interviewed in various accounting firms to identify their opinion on the legality of the tax reform. Questionnaires were also applied to managers of these companies to identify the effect of tax reforms in its operational competitiveness. This research is quantitative, descriptive and documentary. We gather information for a measuring instrument whose reliability was determined by statistical analysis. It was then applied to the sample population. The information obtained was processed through statistical analysis to arrive at the results of the investigation.
P37|Regulatory responsiveness in India: A normative and empirical framework for assessment|This paper seeks to measure the extent to which Indian regulators are responsive in the performance of their functions. The paper focuses on one function common to all Indian statutory regulators, namely, regulation making. To measure responsiveness, the paper constructs an index of benchmarks of responsive conduct, with corresponding quantifiable outputs. It empirically measures the responsiveness of the telecom and securities markets regulators in India, on this index. The paper finds that there are significant differences among the laws governing Indian regulators in the context of the requirement to be responsive, and that the degree of responsiveness of Indian regulators is directly proportional to the legal requirement for following participatory processes.
P37|Inside post-socialist courts: the determinants of adjudicatory outcomes in Slovenian commercial disputes|Despite the judiciary’s central role in the capitalist market system, micro-level empirical analyses of courts in post-socialist countries are remarkably rare. This paper draws on a unique hand-collected dataset of commercial claims filed at Slovenian courts to examine the determinants of two salient adjudicatory outcomes: whether a case was resolved via trial or settlement and if the case was tried, whether the plaintiff was awarded the initial claim. Consistent with the divergent expectations theories of litigation, we find that trial-based resolution is less likely when parties use mediation and more likely when the case is complex as proxied by appointment of an expert. In contrast, stakes do not predict the prospects of trial. Addressing sample selection concerns, we show that defendants’ legal representation, plaintiffs’ profitability, and court identity are robust predictors of plaintiff victory at trial. We discuss possible explanations for these data patterns. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016
P37|Does the External Monitoring Effect of Financial Analysts Deter Corporate Fraud in China?|Abstract We examine whether analyst coverage influences corporate fraud in China. The fraud triangle specifies three main factors, i.e. opportunity, incentive, and rationalization. On the one hand, analysts may reduce the fraud opportunity factor through external monitoring aimed at discouraging managerial misconduct, which can moderate agency problems. On the other hand, analysts may increase the fraud incentive factor by pressurizing managers to achieve short-term performance targets, which can exacerbate agency problem. In either case, the potential influence of analysts on the fraud rationalization factor may be more pronounced among firms that are more dependent on the capital market for corporate finance. Using a sample of Chinese listed firms, we show a negative association between corporate fraud propensity and analyst coverage, and that this effect is more pronounced among non-state-owned enterprises, which are more reliant on the stock market for external funding. These findings suggest that analyst coverage contributes to corporate fraud deterrence in emerging economies characterized by weak investor protection. The main policy implication is that further development of the analyst profession in emerging economies may benefit investors and strengthen business ethics.
P37|The effects of liberal reforms in Russian criminal law on conviction and sentencing of economic offenders|During the presidency of Dmitry Medvedev in 2008—2012 the Russian economy still remained highly regulated, so almost every economic activity could be recognized by the enforcement agencies as illegal. Under pressure of business some liberal reforms were launched in the criminal law and criminal procedure law related to economic crimes. The reforms were supposed to protect entrepreneurs from unwarranted prosecution and wrong conviction, and to make punishment less punitive. Using the data on 2 million defendants prosecuted for economic and property crimes in Russian criminal courts in 2009—2013, the paper examines how policy change affected the judicial decision making in criminal cases. Quasi-experimental design is used to test the impact of policy change on conviction and sentencing decisions. The results suggest that sentencing practices became more lenient rather due to the general changes in criminal law than the changes related specifically to economic offenders.
P37|Presidential Control of the Judiciary via the Appointment Power: Evidence from Russia|In many countries, the president is involved in appointing judges. Does this lead to selection of friendly judges who then promote the president’s interests? This question is explored here in the context of Russia, where judges are often said to favor the executive. I gather data on 2000 court cases, and analyze them by exploiting changes in the appointment rules. I find clear evidence that judges selected by the president favor the government more than do their peers. In the process, the article develops a new solution to the sample selection problem endemic to the analysis of court decisions. (JEL D02, K40, P37)
P37|Measuring Income Tax Evasion Using Bank Credit: Evidence from Greece|We document that in semiformal economies, banks lend to tax-evading individuals based on the bank’s assessment of the individual’s true income. This observation leads to a novel approach to estimate tax evasion. We use microdata on household credit from a Greek bank and replicate the bank underwriting model to infer the banks estimate of individuals’ true income. We estimate that 43–45% of self-employed income goes unreported and thus untaxed. For 2009, this implies €28.2 billion of unreported income, implying forgone tax revenues of over €11 billion or 30% of the deficit. Our method innovation allows for estimating the industry distribution of tax evasion in settings where uncovering the incidence of hidden cash transactions is difficult using other methods. Primary tax-evading industries are professional services—medicine, law, engineering, education, and media. We conclude with evidence that contemplates the importance of institutions, paper trail, and political willpower for the persistence of tax evasion. JEL Codes: G21, H22, H24, H26, P37.

P37|The Healthcare System and the Hidden Traps of ITS Logistics|The analysis of the society development is more complex than one might think at first glance. So is the market. There are angles and activities not easy to see and one needs high capabilities and strength to look beyond the appearances and notice whatâ€™s not visible. One of the grey areas is linked to the crossing boarder sectors that no men land between legal and black activities; this territory is very vivid and actions and profits are higher than ever can one imagine. This side of the economy has its tentacles piercing the legal boarder of the sound economy and functions through movements that effect all sectors and activities pushing to get huge black profits. Romanian health sector makes no exception. The wish to getting higher and higher profits doesnâ€™t go with performing and satisfactory management when the corporate liaisons are oriented more on discussions and less on integrative quality and satisfaction of people concerned; thus the so called guys in white coats are necessarily oriented to another sort of motivation â€“ linked to networked process of getting black money and laundering it through the backing support of the informal more than legal procedures. The loss is always paid by individuals and community as: fewer funds from taxes, stratified salaries caused subjective application of norms and procedures, decreased labour quality, inappropriate economic behaviour, losses in the robustness of the future generations. Through such channels, the informal economy last running building up a strong logistic that develops parallel activities, utterly designed to respect specific customs based on gestural understanding and communication that encourage the unfairness, the aggressiveness in competition and hot money/short run investments. This paper intends to catch some of the general aspects of what black and informal economy can carry out, through procedures that use the imperfect legal methodology decision and its implementation into informal possibility to fraud both the public funds and peoples savings. The present paper touches also the public consequences of the undeclared work of employees of public and private sectors. This paper seeks to emphasise also the need to identifying some specific roles to play in the future by the services business planning, the law application and the policy of autonomy to help the medical market blossom vigorously. In conclusion, we imply that the fair action is not an alternative conception of developing, in the fashion neither of human evolution nor of need-based growth. There is a higher need to model individual awareness and motivation in the direction of increasing the self-responsibility for building a better environment based on a proactive personal development, from within and connected to the outer world. In conclusion, we sustain that the fair action is not an alternative conception of developing, in the fashion neither of human evolution nor of need-based growth. There is a higher need to model individual awareness and motivation in the direction of increasing the self-responsibility for building a better environment based on a proactive personal development, from within and connected to the outer world.
P37|Corruption perceptions versus corruption incidence: Competition for rents across Russian regions|This paper examines the effects of different competitions for favors on the prevalence and perceptions of corruption across Russian regions. Results show that while greater general competition (measured by regional population size), increases both perceived and actual corruption, competition among enterprises only increases corruption perceptions, while competition among government employees increases actual, but not perceived, corruption. Privatization activity and unemployment fail to affect either measure of corruption. Finally, the effects of urbanization differ on perceived and actual corruption. Besides Russia, these findings are somewhat unique to the broader literature. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016
P37|Drivers of FDI in Fast Growing Developing Countries: Evidence from Bundling and Unbundling Governance|We assess drivers of FDI in a panel of BRICS and MINT countries for the period 2001-2011. We bundle and unbundle governance determinants using a battery of contemporary and non-contemporary estimation techniques. The following findings are established. First, for both contemporary and non-contemporary specifications, while determinants for gross FDI are significant, they are not for net FDI. Second, for contemporary specifications, the significance of the governance dynamics is as follows in increasing order of magnitude: general governance, political governance, economic governance, political stability, regulation quality and government effectiveness. The motivation to bundle governance variables is articulated by the effect of political governance. Third, for non-contemporary specifications, the significance of governance variables is as follows in ascending order of magnitude: economic governance, institutional governance, general governance, corruption-control, political governance and political stability. The importance of combining governance indicators is captured by the effects of political governance, economic governance and institutional governance. The results indicate that the simultaneous implementation of the various components of governance clarifies a country’s attractiveness for FDI location. Policy implications are discussed with particular emphasis on the timing of FDI and its targeting.
P37|Determinants of Growth in Fast Developing Countries: Evidence from Bundling and Unbundling Institutions|Purpose – We assess growth determinants in the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and MINT (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey) fast-developing nations for the period 2001-2011. Particular emphasis is laid on the bundling and unbundling of ten governance dynamics. Design/methodology/approach- Contemporary and non-contemporary Fixed- and Random-Effects regressions are employed as empirical strategies. GDP growth and real GDP output are used as dependent variables. The governance variables are bundled by means of principal component analysis. Findings- The following are some findings. First, governance is more positively significant in non-contemporary specifications as opposed to contemporary regressions. Second, there is some interesting evidence on the heterogeneity of political governance as a driver. Political governance and its constituents (political stability and voice & accountability) are significantly positive in GDP growth but insignificant in real GDP output regressions. Third, the other governance dynamics are more significant determinants of real GDP output, as opposed to GDP growth. Accordingly, they are insignificant in contemporary regressions and negatively significant in non-contemporary regressions for GDP growth. Fourth, the constituents of economic governance have the highest magnitude in the positive effects of governance dynamics on real GDP output. Practical implications- The following are some practical implications. First, lag determinants are necessary for growth targeting or timing of growth dynamics. Growth drivers for the most part are more significantly determined by past information. Second, political governance is the most important driver of economic growth, with the significance of effects more apparent in non-contemporary regressions. Third, economic governance and institutional governance are more positively predisposed to driving real GDP output than GDP growth. Originality/value- As far as we have reviewed, it is the first study to investigate growth determinants in the BRICS and MINT nations. It has strong implications for other developing countries on the contem
P37|If You Do Not Change Your Behaviour: Managing Threats to State Security in Lithuania under Soviet Rule|"In Soviet Lithuania (and elsewhere) from the 1950s to the 1980s, the KGB applied a form of ""zero-tolerance"" policing, or profilaktika, to incipient threats to state security. Petty deviation from socio-political norms was regarded as a person's first step towards more serious state crimes, and as a bad example for others. As long as petty violators could be classed as confused or misled rather than motivated by anti-Soviet conviction, their mistakes would be corrected by a KGB warning or ""preventive discussion."" Successful prevention avoided the costly removal of the subject from society. This represented a complete contrast to the Stalin years, when prevention relied largely on eliminating the subject from society. Preventive discussions were widely practised in many different circumstances. KGB internal evaluations concluded that these discussions were extremely effective in preventing further violations. This was the front line of the Soviet police state; it was perhaps the largest programme for personally targeted behaviour modification anywhere in the world at that time outside the education sector. It was also a front line of the Cold War because the foreign adversary was seen as the most important source of misleading or confusing influence. My work in progress aims to understand the origins and operation of profilaktika, including how and to whom it was applied, how it worked on the individual subject, and its wider influence on the Soviet Union’s social and political order."
P37|Bribery Environment and Firm Performance: Evidence from Central and Eastern European Countries|We examine the relation between bureaucratic corruption and firm performance in CEE countries. While previous research uses data from BEEPS, which suffers from excessive non-reporting of corporate performance, we combine reliable firm financials from the Amadeus database with information on bribery practices from BEEPS. We show that differing consequences of corruption found in previous studies could be explained by the corruption environment in which a firm operates. Basically, higher mean bribery is associated with lower performance, while higher dispersion of individual firm bribes appears to facilitate firm performance. A detailed analysis is conducted by firm sector and size, and countries’ institutional environments.
P37|Telejustice - a phenomenon at the border between the right to information of the public and the right to image of accused persons|In this article we analysed a new fast-growing phenomenon â€“ Telejustice which seems to spread more and more in Romania and we proposed a solution - the open justice system. In our opinion, if the open-justice system would be adopted in Romania, it would be a gain both for Justice, which could provide the evidence of transparency, as well as for journalists, who could provide exact information, not taken from sources.
P37|Fighting corruption or elections? The politics of anti-corruption policies in India: A subnational study|This paper extends political budget cycles theory to corruption, where an incumbent government considers controlling corruption based purely on political considerations. Using panel data on 30 Indian states during the 1988–2009 period, I investigate whether the timing of elections affects the incumbent government’s efforts to control corruption. Consistent with the idea that an incumbent politician might exert greater effort to control corruption during election years, I find that scheduled elections (as opposed to unscheduled elections) are associated with an increase in the number of corruption cases registered by the respective state’s anti-corruption agencies, although the substantive impact is small. Furthermore, I find this effect in ‘swing states’ where margin of victory for the incumbent in previous elections has been narrow. On the other hand, there is no effect of scheduled elections on corruption cases being investigated by anti-corruption agencies. Thus, the argument that Indian politicians engage in ‘cheap talk’ on controlling corruption, especially during election periods is suggestive at best.
P37|Foreign corporations and the culture of transparency: Evidence from Russian administrative data|Firms from developed countries carry a culture of transparency in business transactions that is opposite to the culture of hiding and insider dealing in developing and transition economies. We employ Russian administrative data on reported earnings and market values of cars to measure wage misreporting for individual employees of domestic firms in Moscow. We show that closer ties to multinationals lead to improved transparency of wage reporting in private Russian companies. Employees located closest to movers from multinationals in the job quality space experience the largest gains in transparency. We find a robust correlation between wage misreporting and accounting fraud.
P37|Foreign Corporations and the Culture of Transparency: Evidence from Russian Administrative Data|Foreign-owned firms from advanced countries carry the culture of transparency in business transactions that is orthogonal to the culture of hiding and insider dealing in many developing economies and economies in transition. In this paper, we document this using administrative data on reported earnings and market values of cars owned by workers employed in foreign-owned and domestic firms in Moscow, Russia. We examine whether closer ties to foreign corporations result in the diffusion of transparency to private Russian firms. We find that Russian firms initially founded in partnerships with foreign corporations are twice as transparent in reported earnings of their workers as other Russian firms, but they are still less than half as transparent as foreign firms themselves. We also find that increased links to foreign corporations, such as hiring more workers from them, raise the transparency of domestic firms. An important channel for this transmission appears to be the need to keep official wages and salaries of incumbent workers close to wages domestic firms have to pay to their newly hired workers with experience in multinationals.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

P37|Determinants Of Corruption Perceptions: Transitional Vs. Developed Economies|"In this paper we explore relationships between corruption perceptions and such characteristics as the size of shadow economy, GDP per capita, well-being, the Happy Planet Index (HPI), and quality of institutions. Special attention is paid to the comparison of transitional economies with countries that joined the European Union in 2004 and 2007, and developed countries. It is shown that irrespective of whether the economy is developed or transitional, negative dependence of corruption perceptions on shadow economy switches to positive if the size of the shadow economy increases over 15% of the official GDP. After the shadow economy passes 45%, the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index ceases to respond to growth of the shadow economy. Our estimates confirm that transition in countries is accompanied by growth of GDP per capita and a decrease in the level of corruption perceptions. For these reasons, transitional countries and countries where transition is over belongs to different clusters according to these indicators. This is not true for well-being and the HPI. It is not surprising that a regression analysis shows that ""control of corruption"" and ""regulatory quality"" are significant for reducing corruption perceptions both in transitional and other economies. It is interesting that ""government effectiveness"" and ""voice and accountability"" are significant only for transitional economies and insignificant in others. ""Rule of law"" and ""political stability"" are insignificant both in transitional and in developed countries"
P37|Corruption and Productivity: Firm-level Evidence|Using enterprise data for the economies of Central and Eastern Europe and the CIS, this study examines the effects of corruption on productivity. Corruption is narrowly defined as the occurrence of informal payments to government officials to ease the day-to-day operation of firms. The effects of this “bribe tax” on productivity are compared to the consequences of red tape, which may be understood as imposing a “time tax” on firms. When testing effects in the full sample, only the bribe tax appears to have a negative impact on firm-level productivity, while the effect of the time tax is insignificant. We also find that the surrounding environment influences the way in which firm behaviour affects firm performance. In particular, in countries where corruption is more prevalent and the legal framework is weaker, bribery is more harmful for firm-level productivity.
P37|Constitutional property rights protection and economic growth: evidence from the post-communist transition|This paper seeks to estimate the economic growth effect of constitutional provisions for property rights protection. It does so using the unique situation in formerly communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the Caucasus where all but two introduced new constitutions after the fall of the Iron Curtain. The effects of implementing different constitutional provisions can therefore be observed in a group of countries with similar formal starting points. Estimates provide no evidence of positive effects and mainly point towards a negative conclusion: the introduction of constitutional protection of property rights is not associated with economic development in the long run, but tends to impose costs during a period of institutional transition and implementation proportional to the constitutional change.

P37|Incompatible institutions: socialism versus constitutionalism in India|There has been a decline in rule of law in India, reflected in the frequent amendments to the Indian Constitution. This paper analyzes the historical, ideological, and economic context for constitutional amendments to understand the reason for the deterioration of constitutionalism in India. I argue that the formal institutions of socialist planning were fundamentally incompatible with the constraints imposed by the Indian Constitution. This incompatibility led to frequent amendments to the Constitution, especially in the area of Fundamental Rights. Consequently, pursuit of socialist policies gradually undermined the Constitution. The contradictory mixture of socialism and constitutionalism led to economic and political deprivations that were never intended by the framers. I demonstrate this incompatibility using evidence from five-year-plans and constitutional amendments in India. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015
P37|Entrepreneurship and the intergenerational transmission of values|There is mounting empirical evidence that there is intergenerational transmission of parental preferences for entrepreneurship. However, much of the work on this topic is not explicit about the role of values in this transmission process. Furthermore, nearly all studies neglect potential heterogeneity of values among entrepreneurial parents. This paper contributes to the literature by making use of a natural experiment that allows (1) identifying a group of entrepreneurial parents who have a distinct priority of challenging existing conditions (“mastery”) and (2) detecting whether this value orientation is transmitted. Comparing German entrepreneurs two decades after Reunification reveals that the children of self-employed parents who encountered a great deal of resistance in the socialist German Democratic Republic due to their self-employment are much more likely to give mastery as the reason for running their own venture compared to entrepreneurs whose parents did not have to overcome this sort of challenge.

P37|Economic Dimension of Crimes against Cultural, Historical and Archaeological Heritage|The publication is one of the first studies of the economic dimension of crimes against cultural and archaeological heritage. Lack of research in this area is largely due to irregular global prevalence vague definition of economic value of the damage they cause to society at the national and global level, to present and to future generations. The author uses classical models of Becker and Freeman, by modifying and complementing them with the tools of economics of culture based on the non-use values. The model tries to determine the opportunity cost of this type of crime in several scenarios and based on this to determine the extent of their limitation at an affordable cost to society and raising public benefits of conservation of World and National Heritage.
P37|(Former) Informal Networks As A Reflection Of Informal Institutions In East European Transitional Societies: Legacy Or Opportunism?|Only recently has the influence of culture on economic development been increasingly discussed among theoretical economists. Besides observing culture through cultural traditions inherited from ancestors, current social interactions are also considered as an influential factor. Over a long period of time, the research on East European transitional societies has been focused on formal institutions. Throughout that period, informal networks, many of which originated from the previous socio-political system, have mostly strengthened their position in the society and gained power in the formal structures. They helped in building the new capitalist states and therewith had positive effects by speeding up the transition process. Yet, in medium and long term, their activities typically resulted in state capture. This paper explores the persistence of tight informal and mostly inefficient formal business-government-society relations in Eastern Europe. It emphasises the influence of informal networks in the interaction of formal and informal institutions, and questions the possibility of new generations to make a turnaround in the functioning of the networks. Newly emerging social interactions are contextualised in the cultural dimensions: Power Distance and Collectivism versus Individualism. This paper argues that even when informal communities solely serve their own opportunistic purposes, the prevailing collectivist culture in the society provides tacit support to their existence and therewith delays the transformation from relation-based to rule-based governance. The empirical findings confirm the oversocialised view of the society and networks suggested by economic sociologists. Additionally, the changes in transitional institutional environment are deemed to be in line with the claims of institutional economists on durability and impact of informal institutions.
P37|On The Evolution Of Corruption Patterns In The Post-Communist Countries|In this paper, we study the evolution of corruption patterns in 27 post-communist countries during the period 1996-2012 using the Control of Corruption Index and the corruption category Markov transition probability matrix. This method allows us to generate the long-run distribution of corruption among the post-communist countries. Our empirical findings suggest that corruption in the post-communist countries is a very persistent phenomenon that does not change much over time. Several theoretical explanations for such a result are provided.
P37|Drivers of FDI in Fast Growing Developing Countries: Evidence from Bundling and Unbundling Governance|We assess drivers of FDI in a panel of BRICS and MINT countries for the period 2001-2011. We bundle and unbundle governance determinants using a battery of contemporary and non-contemporary estimation techniques. The following findings are established. First, for both contemporary and non-contemporary specifications, while determinants for gross FDI are significant, they are not for net FDI. Second, for contemporary specifications, the significance of the governance dynamics is as follows in increasing order of magnitude: general governance, political governance, economic governance, political stability, regulation quality and government effectiveness. The motivation to bundle governance variables is articulated by the effect of political governance. Third, for non-contemporary specifications, the significance of governance variables is as follows in ascending order of magnitude: economic governance, institutional governance, general governance, corruption-control, political governance and political stability. The importance of combining governance indicators is captured by the effects of political governance, economic governance and institutional governance. The results indicate that the simultaneous implementation of the various components of governance clarifies a country’s attractiveness for FDI location. Policy implications are discussed with particular emphasis on the timing of FDI and its targeting.
P37|Determinants of Growth in Fast Developing Countries: Evidence from Bundling and Unbundling Institutions|Purpose – We assess growth determinants in the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and MINT (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey) fast-developing nations for the period 2001-2011. Particular emphasis is laid on the bundling and unbundling of ten governance dynamics. Design/methodology/approach- Contemporary and non-contemporary Fixed- and Random-Effects regressions are employed as empirical strategies. GDP growth and real GDP output are used as dependent variables. The governance variables are bundled by means of principal component analysis. Findings- The following are some findings. First, governance is more positively significant in non-contemporary specifications as opposed to contemporary regressions. Second, there is some interesting evidence on the heterogeneity of political governance as a driver. Political governance and its constituents (political stability and voice & accountability) are significantly positive in GDP growth but insignificant in real GDP output regressions. Third, the other governance dynamics are more significant determinants of real GDP output, as opposed to GDP growth. Accordingly, they are insignificant in contemporary regressions and negatively significant in non-contemporary regressions for GDP growth. Fourth, the constituents of economic governance have the highest magnitude in the positive effects of governance dynamics on real GDP output. Practical implications- The following are some practical implications. First, lag determinants are necessary for growth targeting or timing of growth dynamics. Growth drivers for the most part are more significantly determined by past information. Second, political governance is the most important driver of economic growth, with the significance of effects more apparent in non-contemporary regressions. Third, economic governance and institutional governance are more positively predisposed to driving real GDP output than GDP growth. Originality/value- As far as we have reviewed, it is the first study to investigate growth determinants in the BRICS and MINT nations. It has strong implications for other developing countries on the contemporary and non-contemporary dynamics of governance in driving economic prosperity.
P37|Constitution, Institutions and A Model for Economic Development in Nepal|Nepal made significant progress in removing monarchy and terrors of Maoists in the last decade. It however lacks a stable solution for speedier economic growth and development as the major political parties are still struggling to institutionalize the new political framework set up by the new constitution of Nepal that was promulgated by the Constitution Assembly of Nepal (CAN-II ) for the federal democratic republic of Nepal on 20 September 2015. Nepalese economy crippled by the terrible earthquake of April 2015 got further paralyzed by the undeclared blockade from India that was afraid of separatist movements in southern Nepal. NC led government managed to conduct free and fair elections of central, provincial and local governments by the end of 2017 in which the NCP, a new allaince of communist CPN-UML and CPN-Maoist parties was able to secure the absolute majority based on radical manifesto promises relegating the NC to a weak opposition. The NCP government has however failed totally to implement its promises in practice bringing inclusive programmes suitable to multi-ethnic, multi-climatic and multi-cultural and multi-linguistic economy and society. Corruption has spread further from the top to the bottom. Quality of institutions, leadership and the governance has further deteriorated. Faster growth and economic growth and development is not possible unless the new system sticks to a dynamic model for a decentralized economy updating beliefs that can improve the well-being of people and transform Nepal into a modern, vibrant, and market oriented dynamic economy. Nepal should avoid economically and topographically unrealistic trans-Himalayan trade-efforts with China and should improve mutual and natural understanding and cooperation with India to sustain growth in the long run.

P37|If You Do Not Change Your Behaviour: Managing Threats to State Security in Lithuania under Soviet Rule|" In Soviet Lithuania (and elsewhere) from the 1950s to the 1980s, the KGB applied a form of ""zero-tolerance"" policing, or profilaktika, to incipient threats to state security. Petty deviation from socio-political norms was regarded as a person's first step towards more serious state crimes, and as a bad example for others. As long as petty violators could be classed as confused or misled rather than motivated by anti-Soviet conviction, their mistakes would be corrected by a KGB warning or ""preventive discussion."" Successful prevention avoided the costly removal of the subject from society. This represented a complete contrast to the Stalin years, when prevention relied largely on eliminating the subject from society. Preventive discussions were widely practised in many different circumstances. KGB internal evaluations concluded that these discussions were extremely effective in preventing further violations. This was the front line of the Soviet police state; it was perhaps the largest programme for personally targeted behaviour modification anywhere in the world at that time outside the education sector. It was also a front line of the Cold War because the foreign adversary was seen as the most important source of misleading or confusing influence. My work in progress aims to understand the origins and operation of profilaktika, including how and to whom it was applied, how it worked on the individual subject, and its wider influence on the Soviet Union’s social and political order."
P37|The labor market consequences of political imprisonment in the former GDR|Barely any quantitative research has been devoted yet to the labor market consequences of incarceration for political offenses, which seems particularly unfortunate against the background of Europe's history of state persecution in the 20th century. Drawing on the example of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), our paper seeks to gain a deeper understanding of how the experience of political imprisonment affected individuals subsequent career outcomes. In our empirical analysis, we exploit a one-percent sample drawn from a unique large-scale administrative data set (BASiD). To the best of our knowledge, our study provides unprecedented evidence on the labor market effects of political imprisonment, by (1) exploiting information on political imprisonment using administrative records; (2) differentiating between possible short and long-run consequences of political imprisonment; and (3) measuring outcomes before and after the transition from a centrally planned towards a market economy, thereby permitting us to distinguish the consequences of incarceration under different political and economic regimes.
P37|Financial development, institutions and banks|This paper presents a framework for understanding the interactions between political and legal institutions, property rights protection, and their implications for financial development. Whereas the literature has answered questions on why some countries lag behind in terms of financial and economic development, the current study suggests how to get around some institutional attributes to spearhead financial intermediation and economic growth through a set of institutional, information, and banking reforms. It finds little support that common law legal heritage is more suitable than French civil law for some key features of financial development. It concludes that types of institutional and market reforms are more relevant to financial intermediation than legal systems. It proposes some ways forward to increase financial intermediation; and expects, over the long run, the proposed approach to financial development to be beneficial for a number of developing countries.
P37|Understanding modes of civil case disposition: Evidence from Slovenian courts|We contribute to the scant empirical literature on the functioning of courts in the post-socialist world by analyzing civil case disposition in Slovenia. We first characterize basic empirical patterns in modes of civil case disposition in Slovenian local courts. We then examine court-level determinants of the incidence of in-court settlements versus trial-based judgments. Consistent with the theory that both judges and disputing parties take into account their respective private benefits and costs when choosing their preferred mode of case disposition, we find evidence that the incidence of in-court settlements versus trial-based judgments increases with the number of all case filings per judge. Thus, court resources and demand for court services influence not only total court output, as previously established in the literature, but also how cases are disposed of.
P37|Economia sommersa: ULA irregolari in Italia dal 1980 al 2009|The paper analyzes the units of full-time employment (ULA) as estimated by Istat National Accounts. The cyclical analysis can highlight the role that irregular employment (dependent and independent) play on the dynamics of the Italian economy, emphasizing the relationship of substitution between irregular and regular sector. The irregular (both dependent and independent) are not true leading of the cycle, but when the GDP grows, they move earlier, while the regular are slower to adapt. Results from VAR models suggest that there are no connections, contemporaneous correlation or Granger causality, between the dark and the regular side of the Italian market. These findings provide important implications in terms of policy on the complex phenomenon of undeclared work.
P37|Le droit du travail et les migrants ruraux : instituer un nouveau salariat en Chine|Les normes du travail sont problématiques en Chine, mais constater l’impuissance du droit du travail à réguler le marché du travail est insatisfaisant. Pour dépasser les apparences, nous sommes amenée alors à replacer la législation du travail d’une part dans la dynamique de la transition chinoise et de l’autre dans une perspective analytique propre à l’institutionnalisme de J. R. Commons. La Chine rencontre en effet les « problèmes du travail » engendrés par un capitalisme non-raisonnable qui fait porter aux travailleurs migrants ruraux un coût exorbitant et déstabilisateur. Le droit du travail se présente alors comme une solution qui assure la viabilité de ce nouveau salariat chinois à travers des politiques socialement inclusives qui visent sa sécurité économique, une voie « raisonnable » de dépassement des conflits. Mais au-delà, dans un contexte marqué par l’héritage socialiste et l’absence de démocratie, il faut aussi s’interroger sur le rapport à la loi et à l’État. La Law & Economics forgée par J. R. Commons nous offre l’opportunité de comprendre en quoi consistent l’enjeu autour du conflit sur les règles et l’édification d’un nouveau compromis. Le droit du travail, clairement instrumentalisé par le Parti Communiste et au service de sa politique de stabilité sociale, apparaît alors au cœur du processus d’institutionnalisation du salariat des migrants ruraux.
P37|Corruption Perceptions In Russia: Economic Or Social Issue?|The efficiency of social reforms in different countries mostly depends on the extent to which they can be accepted by the population. However, even if problems are similar, the reasons may differ, which can make it difficult to apply existing laws of one state to another. Bribery is a typical problem for developing countries as shown in the Corruption Perception Index (calculated by Transparency International) and recent research (Levin and Satarov, 2000) (Ilzetzki, 2011). Corruption can have roots in socialist regimes as in recently established political stability instable economic situation may lead to growth in crime. The main challenge within the scope of this project is to identify the relation between corruption perception and levels of trust in society and to distinguish the differences in factors affecting these characteristics. The research reveals that distrust matters a lot for the problem in Russia and suggests further examination of the dynamics of trust between post Soviet countries and European countries.
P37|Heterogeneity in Institutional Effects on Economic Growth: Theory and Empirical Evidence|This article explains the peculiarities of institutional effects on growth rates in post-communist countries. By proposing a certain dependence of the institution-growth nexus on the nature of institutional emergence, the distinction between revolutionary and evolutionary processes of institution formation is introduced. Theoretical and empirical juxtapositions show that transition countriesâ€™ institutions which are constructed revolutionarily differ from those that emerge evolutionarily in a twofold manner in their relationship to growth. Growth rates of their economies are less likely to depend on the quality of economic institutions and are more likely to be a function of the maturity of political institutions. In addition, economic institutions in post-communist countries are a product of the quality of political bodies to a greater extent than their evolutionary alternatives.
P37|The State's Enforcement Monopoly and the Private Protection of Property|The modern state has monopolized the legitimate use of force. This concept is twofold. First, the state is empowered with enforcement rights; second, the rights of the individuals are restricted. In a simple model of property rights with appropriation and defense activity, we show that a restriction of private enforcement is beneficial for the property owner, even if there are no economies of scale from public protection. We emphasize the role of the state as a commitment device for a certain level of enforcement. However, commitment will only work if the state can regulate private protection, such as private armies and mercenaries.
P37|Endogenous Enforcement Institutions|We model the State as a self-enforcing agreement over the use of force. A principal contracts with an agent, and a powerful ruler enforces their contracts through a mix of monetary fines and coercion. If the ruler fails to enforce, or if he uses his power to expropriate, all parties revert to low production forever after. Our model has two important implications. First, a better coercion technology moves the optimal system from private ordering, where contracts are enforced by the threat of termination, to the State, where they are enforced by the threat of coercion. This is consistent with the historical correlation between improvements in coercion and the transition from the Law Merchant enforcement system to the State. Second, contract enforcement and non-expropriation are complementary inputs in the State, in the sense that improvements in the enforcement technology increase the agents effort only if the ruler has limited expropriation power, so that the rulers incentive constraint on contractual enforcement is binding. This result relates to the Acemoglu and Johnson (2005) finding that constraints on rulers have affected the development of nations more than improvements in contractual enforcement. Using their data we find that, consistent with our model, contractual enforcement does affect development, but only when the rulers expropriation power is sufficiently constrained.
P37|Rent-Seeking Russia|"The Russian economy is in transition period ""from plan to market"", which is characterized by immature institutions and expansion of rent-seeking behavior. In this article, the authors consider rent as a?possible excess return above the minimum income needed to encourage an agent to implement the actions specified by the principal. In this paper the authors present and analyze the following types of rent: natural, exclusive, political, administrative and transitional. They also consider the consequences of the rent-seeking behavior for Russian economy."
P37|Redefining The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem Within Spatial Econometrics, The Case Of The Aggregation Problem|The paper focuses on the issue of the aggregation problem, which is frequently discussed within spatial econometrics. The aggregation problem is one of the two aspects of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). The aggregation problem is connected with the volatility of the obtained results occurred when various com-positions of territorial units for the same aggregation scale were applied. The objective of the present paper is to consider the redefinition of aggregation prob-lem and showing positive solution of the aggregation problem based on the em-pirical example of determining agricultural macroregions. In the article the ag-gregation problem was defined as a problem of establishing a particular compo-sition of territorial units at a selected aggregation scale in a such a way that is remains in the quasi composition of regions within the undertaken research prob-lem. The paper also presented the procedure for determining agricultural macroregions where the analysis of the spatial volatility of the agrarian structure and the current knowledge on the agriculture in Poland were applied. In addi-tion, the paper considered the final areal interpretation problem connected with the incorrect determination of the area in relation to which final conclusions are drawn. The problem was presented basing on the example of the establishment of the average concentration of the area of agricultural land in Poland with the use of the Gini index calculated for districts. The paper emphasised that ignoring the final areal interpretation problem in spatial analyses may lead to an apparent identification of the modifiable areal unit problem.
P37|Corporate Bankruptcies in Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia and Serbia|The corporate bankruptcies legal frameworks and their economic implications are compared for two pairs of post-communist countries (Czech Republic and Slovakia and Croatia and Serbia) originating from common federative republics. Their process of gradual divergence from the common legal and economic framework is shown. All four countries are identified as creditor friendly (Czech Republic, Croatia, Serbia) or neutral countries (Slovakia). The possibilities of further development of bankruptcy proceeding in these countries are outlined.

P37|Corruption In The Land Sector| The corruption is both a major cause and a result of poverty around the world. Corruption in the land sector can be generally characterized as pervasive and without effective means of control. In this paper we analyze the risks and forms of corruption in the land sector citing some documented examples from the world and from Serbia. The paper concludes that all countries facing a problems with land administration needs the rebuilding of land administration institutions to provide access to land as essential to rekindle economic growth and social stability. It can also be concluded that Serbia is on the path of mild progress in planning land administration and land management.
P37|Institutional Quality – Determinant Of Transition Performances In Central And Eastern European Nations|This study attempts to investigate the impact of institutions on the effectiveness of transition results achieved by emerging economies from Central and Eastern Europe. After more than two decades significant economic and social disparities have arisen between these nations. Consequently, the relationship between institutional efficiency and progress is investigated using a multiple linear regression model. Given the Romanian poor transition performances, the purpose of this paper is to highlight that even if Romania had followed a shock therapy, the resultant of institutional interaction at formal-informal level would have been the same. As results emphasize, the inertial character of informal values inherited from the past faded the echo of good formal initiatives. In the light of such circumstances, performances of countries such as Poland or the Czech Republic become not only understandable, but far from being reached in Romania.
P37|Análisis Espacial De La Violencia Homicidaen El Pacífico Colombiano|La teoría que explica la violencia homicida es nutrida. Algunas corrientes apuntan a causas objetivas, como la pobreza y las condiciones sociales, mientras otras proponen que la causan las empresas criminales. En el presente artículo se realiza un análisis espacial de la violencia utilizando como instrumento de medición la tasa de homicidio para los años 2000, 2003 y 2005 al 2010, ejercicio aplicado a nivel municipal para Valle del Cauca, Cauca y Nariño. A través de la técnica de la econometría espacial se confronta la hipótesis de que la violencia homicida se distribuye aleatoriamente. Los resultados revelan la presencia de hot spots altamente contagiosas en términos de violencia; se encontraron zonas en las que estos actos de la violencia homicida persistieron durante el periodo en estudio, y el Valle del Cauca demostró ser, en términos espaciales, un clúster de la violencia.
P37|What Determines State Capture in Poland?|In this paper we examine the determinants of ex-ante state capture analyzing all the legal acts that have been passed in the period 1990-2011 in Poland. We find that during this the majority of legal acts were passed with the aim to satisfy the interest of particular groups. Furthermore, the regression analysis shows that the likelihood of state capture increases during the period of economic growth and local elections. The likelihood of state capture, however, declines during presidential elections. The results we attribute to different interests of political parties in the period of local and presidential election. Finally, we find that the state capture increased over the years in Poland. Additionally, we show that the EU accession did not prevent state capture in Poland. In contrast, the financial crisis of 2007 resulted in a wake-up effect and the likelihood of state capture declined in Poland.
P37|Exploring tax evasion in the context of political uncertainty|We present a model of agents facing the uncertainty of two future forms of government who are able to insure against this uncertainty by hiding funds from taxation. In order to choose whether or not to hide funds from taxation, agents need to know policy choices that each government would make should it come to power. But each government, before it could make its decision, would need to know the choices of the agents who would, for example, produce tax revenues. This informational tension is resolved endogenously. We derive the resulting level of tax evasion in society and the optimal choices made by the potential governments. We examine how changes in governmental structure would affect the level of tax evasion, and how that, in turn, would affect a particular form of capital flight.
P37|Social networks and bribery: The case of entrepreneurs in Eastern Europe|Using a survey of new firms in Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, I explore how an entrepreneur’s social networks affect the amount paid in bribes to government officials. Lower levels of bribe payments are associated with ownership by a former manager of a state-owned enterprise (SOE), with being a spin-off from a SOE, and with trade association membership. The results also suggest that these networks have a larger impact on bribe payments than do firm characteristics such as profits, sales, or resale value. For the average firm, having a former SOE manager as an owner can be expected to reduce bribe payments by over 50%, while, by contrast, doubling the firm’s profits results in only a 7% increase in bribe payments.
P37|Kritika metodološkog individualizma|Cilj rada je da se prikaže kritika metodološkog individualizma kao realne podloge raznih oblika institucionalnog monizma, koji služe kao baza ekonomske politike u nekim tranzicijskim državama. Polazi se od hipoteze da on predstavlja dominirajucu monisticko-ideološku platformu savremenih ekonomskih teorija, iz kojih pojedine ekonomske politike selektivno crpe neoliberalne osnove. Ne spori se originalnost i respektabilnost rezultata pojedinih ekonomskih teorija, posebno ne neoinstitucionalne. Pokušavaju se uociti nedostaci metodološkog individualizma i dokazati potreba utvrdivanja granica optimalnog i pozitivnog djelovanja ekonomskih institucija državnog i tržišnog regulisanja, a samim tim i ekonomske politike. Istice se ideja realnog institucionalnog pluralizma kao ekonomske paradigme razvijenih privreda, koja treba da bude u funkciji održivog privrednog razvoja. Ukazuje se na apsolutizam privilegovanog, netržišnog i anti-institucionalnog ponašanja u praksi vecine postsocijalistickih privreda, koje se cesto opravdava apologetskim jednostranostima u ekonomskoj teoriji, prvenstveno neoliberalnoj.

P37|In the name of my parents: Entrepreneurship and the intergenerational transmission of values|Mounting empirical evidence shows that kids of self-employed parents are very likely to become entrepreneurs themselves. These findings are often attributed to the intergenerational transmission of parental norms and values. However, many papers in the field are not that explicit about parental values. Furthermore, nearly all studies neglect potential heterogeneity of entrepreneurial parents and their values. I argue that values of entrepreneurial parents can be quite different due to context factors like their motivation for being self-employed (e.g., necessity- vs. opportunity driven). I also think that direct information on values should be exploited to understand their intergenerational transmission. To this end, I fill research gaps and contribute to the literature by making use of a natural experiment. This allows identify- ing a group of entrepreneurial parents with a distinct value orientation and detecting a trans- mission of these parental values.
P37|Special Confiscation – An Analysis Based on New Legal Regulations|The article deals with the recent legislative amendments and the perspectives existing in the field of the special confiscation within the Romanian criminal Law. The author remarks the tendency of the European legislator and, consequently, Romanian’s extended sphere of assets which may be confiscated, the new “extended confiscation” and the “non-conviction based confiscation” concepts and notices that these are not in accordance with the Romanian Constitution.
P37|Breaking Promises: Hungarian Experience|The article analyzes the role of promises and obligations in economic life, delineates the major types of obligations and shows the devastating consequences of breaking the promises. Various additional circumstances are also considered that have to be accounted for in the balanced judgment of the situations in which the obligations are not met. The examples of breaking promises, logics of such a breaking and the factors precluding it are discussed in the ethical and political contexts as well.
P37|Impact of Corruption on Business Development: Empirical Estimates|The paper considers the relationship of corruption and domestic business environment. The authors propose a method of quantitative estimation of the impact of corruption on the business climate through the use of international ratings. The quantitative estimations obtained allow to construct an alternative rating of business environment, free of the influence of corruption, and estimate, with its help, the comparative advantages of Russia as of late 2012. In addition the paper determines the limits of possible improvement of the business climate in Russia on the assumption that the effectiveness of anti-corruption policy would be low.
P37|Property Rights As A Factor Of Foreign Direct Investment. The Case Of Poland|Clearly defined property rights enable people and business to make contracts over such property, and thus to engage in business – most business transactions concern the transfer of some sort of property, or rights to property. It seems that property rights have huge influence on foreign direct investment inflow, especially in the Polish economy. Therefore, the aim of this article is to verify the hypothesis that property rights are an important factor for foreign direct investment flow. The object of the research is the Polish economy in the years 1994-2011. The first part of this paper shows the dynamics and structure of FDI inflows to the Polish economy in the years 1994-2011. Next two parts clarify the idea of property rights, their transformation, importance to the growth and foreign direct investment inflow. Verification of the hypothesis will be made on the basis of domestic and foreign literature.
P37|What Determines State Capture in Poland>|In this paper we examine the determinants of ex-ante state capture analyzing all the legal acts that have been passed in the period 1990-2011 in Poland. We find that during this period 37 percent of legal acts were passed with the aim to satisfy the interest of particular groups. Furthermore, the regression analysis shows that the likelihood of state capture increases during the period of economic growth and local elections. The likelihood of state capture, however, declines during presidential elections. The results we attribute to different interests of political parties in the period of local and presidential election. Finally, we find that the state capture increased over the years in Poland. Additionally, we show that the EU accession did not prevent state capture in Poland. In contrast, the financial crisis of 2007 resulted in a wake-up effect and the likelihood of state capture declined in Poland.
P37|Институциональные Факторы Государственной Регуляторной Эффективности<BR>[Institutional factors of state regulatory efficiency]|Corruption as an institutional factor of the state regulatory efficiency is seen in disfunction of distributed decision-making system at the national level. The effectiveness of state power is determined by the development of non-discretionary decision-making mechanisms and institutional frameworks that limit officials' voluntarism by establishing clear criteria for evaluating their performance. Thus, there are two polar set of institutional factors of state regulatory efficiency: negative (corruption) and positive (institutions of social responsibility and social control).
P37|Ekonomie náboženství a její relevance pro ekonomy ve střední Evropě<BR>[Economics of Religion and its Relevance for Economists in Central Europe]|This paper introduces possibilities for applying the economics of religion in Central European context. It reviews economic literature on religion, both the modern tradition of economic analysis of religious behavior and the Weberian tradition of analyzing consequences of religion for economy. Two local applications are used for illustration. The first one is an analysis of religious participation in post-communist countries; the second one is an examination of the role of religion in the post-communist transition. Changes in religious participation can be interpreted, among other models, using a model of individual time allocation. This model provides a good explanation for the post-communist period. The examination of the role of religion in the post-communist transition indicates that Western Christianity provides better conditions for introducing free market institutions as compared to Orthodox Christianity and Islam.

P37|Vigilante Justice and Police Protocols in the Latin American South Cone|There is a wide debate worldwide, and particularly in Latin America with respect to citizen insecurity and the proliferation of more punitive claims from the society itself. In this article we analyze the attitude of the citizens belonging to the countries of the Latin American South Cone towardsmaintaining the law regarding persecuting and punishing criminals. In particular, we tackle the approval of vigilante justice in some circumstances and the justification of police procedures outside the law as a form of guaranteeing the capture of criminals. For this, we use the LAPOP (Latin American Public Opinion Project, Vanderbilt University) database from the year 2008. Analyzing the data using probit estimations, we observe that the approval of vigilante justice is related to the experience and particular situation of the respondent. In this sense, having beenvictimized in the last months and feeling unsafe in his or her own neighborhood increase the probability of taking that position regarding vigilantism. On the other side, sticking to police procedures is more strongly related to the general political beliefs and the level of concern for the respondents' insecurity. These findings indicate that the formation of these beliefs has a differential dynamic and that when actions outside the law have to be justified, this is distinguished based on the type of involved action and the actorwho carries it forward.
P37|Transnational corruption and innovation in transition economies|In this paper, we examine how transnational corruption affects host country firms' innovation behaviour and performance in transition economies of Eastern Europe and Central and Western Asia. Using firm-level data from the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey, we show that the involvement of foreign firms in corruption practices reduces the propensity of firms in host countries to invest in research and development and harms their ability to improve their existing products and services. Using a simultaneousequations recursive model and controlling for various innovation determinants, we also show that the reduction in innovation effort ultimately also hurts the host country's long-term ability to successfully bring new products on the market through indirect effects.
P37|Crime, Deterrence, and Democracy|We provide new evidence on the effect of deterrence on crime using the experience of a transition country (the Czech Republic) as a quasi-natural experiment. The arrival of democracy in 1989 was accompanied by sharp reductions in all measures of deterrence and sharp increases in crime rates. We test whether deterrence, rather than other factors, was responsible for the post-1989 growth in crime on a panel dataset of Czech regions. The results show significant deterrence effects for robberies and thefts that are quantitatively similar to those found in previous literature, but insignificant deterrence effects for murders and rapes.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P37|The Impact of Bribery on Firm Performance: Evidence from Central and Eastern European Countries|I examine the relation between bureaucratic corruption ('to get things done') and firm performance in Central and Eastern European countries. While previous re- search relies on data from the BEEPS survey, which suffers from excessive non- reporting of corporate performance, I combine the information on bribery practices from the BEEPS with reliable firm performance data from the Amadeus database. The estimates, identified from within-firm variation, suggest that bureaucratic cor- ruption negatively affects both the sales and labor productivity growth of firms. However, conditional on a given level of bribery in a narrowly defined local market, a higher dispersion of firms' bribing behavior within such a market appears to facili- tate firm performance. I provide an explanation for this finding and also investigate the effect of bribery with respect to the heterogeneity of firms in terms of their size, inclusion in the manufacturing or service sector, stability, and countries' overall in- stitutional environments.
P37|The Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol Campaign and Russia’s Mortality Crisis|Political and economic transition is often blamed for Russia's 40% surge in deaths between 1990 and 1994. Highlighting that increases in mortality occurred primarily among alcohol-related causes and among working-age men (the heaviest drinkers), this paper investigates an alternative explanation: the demise of the 1985-1988 Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol Campaign. Using archival sources to build a new oblast-year data set spanning 1978-2000, we find a variety of evidence suggesting that the campaign's end explains a large share of the mortality crisis - implying that Russia's transition to capitalism and democracy was not as lethal as commonly suggested.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
P37|Real convergence and integration|The study is based on the critical observations that competitive market forces alone are not able to assure convergence with the developed countries. These observations are grounded on the results of the computation of the marginal rate of return to capital (which contradict the neoclassical model hypotheses), as well as on the real process of polarisation of the economic activities, taking place worldwide and in accordance with the law of competition. Unlike those who trust the perfect competitive market virtues, the EU’s economic policy is realistic as it is based on the harmonisation of the market forces with an economic policy based on the principle of cohesion, which supports, by means of economic levers, the less developed regions and member countries. This paper deals with the evolution of the EU cohesion funds, as well as with the results of convergence.

P37|Food markets in Russia: dynamics of their integration|In the context of an integrated market, a price of any product in regions depends on its demand in a national market rather than in a regional one. Applying the econometric model based on this theoretical statement, the paper assesses to what degree the markets of some food products are integrated. The fact that since nearly 1994 the growth of segmentation in such markets changes to the tendency of their integration has been observed. The authors conclude that there is an integrated food market in Russia, and its integration has been just the same as that one in the counties of developed market economy.

P37|Institutional Development and Good Governance Assessments in Croatia: An Extended Focus on Corruption|This paper examines good governance assessments in Croatia and in selected CEE countries. It aims to confirm that the quality of governance should be evaluated by considering phenomena- or country-specific institutional environment. Based on the analysis of good governance indicators slight improvements in all dimensions of good governance for all of the selected countries were observed in a period from 1996 to 2002. Using constructed aggregate Good Governance Index (GGI) and Human Development Index (HDI) tested the general assumption that good governance is connected to economic and social development. Spearman rank order correlation analysis confirmed that for all selected countries in 2000 there was a high positive correlation between their GGI rank and HDI rank. The correlation matrix for CEE countries in 2000 confirmed our hypothesis that government effectiveness; regulatory quality and rule of law positively correlate with control of corruption. The paper concludes that research on interdependencies among good governance and development indicators as well as on determinants and effects of good governance dimensions remains to be done for Croatia.
