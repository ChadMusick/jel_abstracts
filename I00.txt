I00|Human Development in the Age of Globalisation|This paper provides a long run view of human development as a capabilities measure of well-being for the last one-and-a-half centuries on the basis of an augmented historical human development index [AHHDI] that combines achievements in health, education, living standard, plus liberal democracy, and provides an alternative to the UN Human Development Index, HDI. The AHHDI shows substantial gains in world human development since 1870, especially during 1913-1970, but much room for improvement exists. Life expectancy has been the leading force behind its progress, especially until 1970. Human development spread unevenly. The absolute gap between western Europe and its offshoots plus Japan -the OECD- and the Rest of the world deepened over time, though fell in relative terms, with catching-up driven by longevity during the epidemiological transition and by democratisation thereafter. This result compares favourably with the growing income gap. Economic growth and human development do not always go hand-in-hand.

I00|Living Standards, Inequality, and Human Development since 1870 : a Review of Evidence|During the last one‐and‐a‐half centuries, average world income grew 10‐fold, the composition of output and relative factor returns shifted, and globalization occurred. How have the fruits of growth been distributed among different income groups and countries? How did the West compare to the Rest of the world in terms of improving well‐being? In this survey, we conclude that consumption per person has grown over time, but more slowly than GDP per capita, as the share of private consumption declined, although was partly offset by the rising share of public consumption. Income inequality within countries fell from the early to late twentieth century and has risen in the recent decades. Living standards improved across the world, but the gap between the West and the Rest increased, and between‐country inequality widened over time until the 1990s, when the trend reversed. Among world inhabitants, income distribution has followed a similar trend, with inequality increasing up to 1990 and declining in the 21st century. Impressive long‐run gains in human development have taken place in the world without being interrupted by the economic slowdown and globalization backlash during 1914‐50.
I00|A multi-sensory tutoring program for students at-risk of reading difficultiesa. Evidence from a randomized field experiment|Although reading is a fundamental skill, many students leave school without being proficient readers. We examine a literacy program targeting students most at-risk of reading difficulties in kindergarten and first grade. The program includes multi-sensory learning methods, which focus on phonological awareness and phonics and are delivered in a one-to-one or one-to-two tutoring setting. Using a randomized field experiment with 161 students in 12 Swedish schools, we find large positive effects on our two primary outcomes measures: a standardized test of decoding and a standardized test of letter knowledge. We also find positive effects on measures of phonological awareness and self-efficacy and small and statistically insignificant effects on measures of enjoyment and motivation. The program compares favorably to similar programs in terms of cost-effectiveness.
I00|Rural women's empowerment in nutrition: a proposal for diagnostics linking food, health and institutions|This paper explores the concept of women's nutritional empowerment and develops a framework for operationalizing it. The paper specifically focuses on the nutritional outcomes of women themselves, rather than on their children. The emphasis on nutritional empowerment addresses an important gap in both literature and policy practice relating to gender equality, agriculture and food security. Interventions to enhance agricultural productivity and food production do not always translate into improved nutritional outcomes. Further, agricultural interventions claiming to promote the economic empowerment of women but focusing exclusively on income-generating opportunities may inadvertently increase their work burden (both paid and unpaid) and undermine their health and nutrition. The proposed framework includes the domains of food, health, and institutions and articulates their multiple linkages. Both paid and unpaid work are important mediating factors in these interactions. We aim to identify specific individual constraints as well as broader structural factors that may prevent rural women from achieving adequate nutritional outcomes and to develop tools to assess the relative weight of these factors in different contexts. The analysis draws on quantitative and qualitative data from Bangladesh and India but, with further validation, could have wider applicability. We hope this exercise could provide the basis for a first-cut of a gender and nutrition diagnostic tool to support efforts to promote well-targeted policies for nutritional security, specifically of rural women.
I00|Women's nutritional empowerment and their well-being Identifying key drivers in India and Bangladesh|This paper uses six nationally representative household surveys from India and Bangladesh to examine the link between women's empowerment and their own nutritional status. Using a recently developed concept of nutritional empowerment, we first assess the degree to which these surveys capture its constituent elements. After identifying the relevant variables in these surveys that best represent the various aspects of nutritional empowerment, we use these surveys to estimate the relative contribution of different factors of nutritional empowerment to women's nutritional outcomes, specifically BMI (in India and Bangladesh) and anemia (in India). While there are a number of approaches to decomposing the contribution of various factors driving nutrition, we present a novel application of the Shapley-Owen decomposition method, hitherto not applied in the context of determinants of nutritional status. This decomposition method reflects not just the independent, standalone contribution of a specific factor, but a factor's contribution including possible interaction with other factors of nutritional empowerment. Consistent across the surveys, we find that resources, particularly those of health and food drive BMI, while resources relating to health and fertility overwhelmingly determine haemoglobin levels (anemia) in India. We also find that the contribution of knowledge and agency correlate positively with resources, suggesting that these dimensions are complementary. Our findings suggest that policies aimed at empowering women must therefore not focus merely on providing knowledge or seek to strengthen women's decision-making roles in the family. Rather, they should prioritize providing health resources to women in constrained settings.
I00|Last and least: Findings on intrahousehold undernutrition from participatory research in South Asia|We analyze intrahousehold mechanisms that rural South Asian women themselves identify as contributing to their inabilities to achieve adequate nutrition. The majority of our female respondents explain that, within their families, they are most likely to eat least and last and to seek lower quality healthcare later, both of which can lead to undernutrition. We analyze the explanations that women provide for why they do so. In addition to norm abidance, we highlight two social factors: a partner's heavy alcohol use and intimate partner violence. Women report that these factors adversely impact their own health and food security status and potentially contribute to differential nutritional outcomes within the same household. The emic perspectives presented here show us: (1) many rural South Asian women report shouldering a relatively greater share of food and nutrition insecurity within their households, and (2) taking their perspectives seriously assists in identifying the underlying contributors to intrahousehold differences. These findings indicate the value a gendered perspective on both the drivers of and measurement of undernutrition. Attending to these intrahousehold factors in future research may yield important insights for understanding drivers of nutritional outcomes.
I00|The Women's empowerment in nutrition index|Rural women face many obstacles that thwart their well-being. Policies that seek to empower them, for example, by improving livelihood opportunities, often do not translate into improvements in other areas, notably in their nutritional status. Indeed, many existing measures of women's empowerment have ambiguous associations with indicators of nutritional status. This is likely because existing operationalizations of empowerment often focus on aspects that are somewhat distal from factors that influence nutrition. In this paper, we present an index that aims to measure women's empowerment in the realm of nutrition. We define nutritional empowerment as the process by which individuals acquire the capacity to be well fed and healthy, in a context where this capacity was previously denied to them Our index draws on theory and multi-site formative research from South Asia and captures multiple dimensions of empowerment spanning domains that influence nutritional outcomes. We construct this index using data from two sites in India and validate it by estimating two nutritional outcomes, body mass index (BMI) and anaemia, as a function of the index. We find that our index is significantly associated with these outcomes, indicating that in rural South Asia, the women's empowerment in nutrition index can assist researchers to understand the nutritional status of women and their families.
I00|What stunts economic growth and causes the poverty trap?|In spite of an identical initial condition, why are some parts of the world so rich and others so poor? To address this question, this paper constructs a simple theoretical model that incorporates human infrastructure and child labor The first part of the paper shows that the condition of bifurcation from an identical initial condition depends on the technology level. We also show that current dynamic trends highly depend on initial endowments and productivity. The second part of the paper examines the effect of development assistance in recipient countries. By analyzing two types of programs; the elimination of child labor and support to strengthen human infrastructure, we show that the former (latter) program is effective for middle- (low-) income countries.
I00|Taste Missions ? A new and innovative approach to improve pupil?s health through food literacy|What makes food, health and children so interesting? Food is one of the primary sources to human life that through a healthy lifestyle can be influencing the future of every individual. Especially children with their future ahead are an important target group that needs focus, since habits are often established at an early age (Piaget, 1969), which also is the case in regards to food and health. To secure the public health and wellbeing of future generations, and to ensure a more sustainable environment and world, we find that teaching children about food, nutrition and health is essential in order to develop a healthy relationship to food and eating habits (Bas?kale, et al., 2009). Learn4Health, an EU Erasmus+ project, was created in 2016 to develop new and innovative methods to food literacy in European schools, to promote a broader knowledge of the origin of food and food systems, and to foster better health practices through new knowledge and self-efficiency. In the project, we seek to develop several innovative and new approaches that aim to increase food knowledge through interdisciplinary hands-on activities. It is our belief, that such methods can foster motivation and a better understanding of when, what and how food is grown, and thereby improve pupils action competencies in relation to food and health now and in the long-term. This paper focuses on one of the Learn4Health activities, Taste Missions, developed, implemented and evaluated by Wageningen University & Research and aims to illustrate how hands-on food activities can benefit pupils in European public schools. Further, it will describe, analyze and conclude upon the activity, and finally, summarize by discussing Taste Missions in the larger Learn4Health context and in the broader perspective of the public by presenting the HOFA Handbook.
I00|An Approach to Fujimmon?s Growth Curve from Scammon ?New proposal for human growth curve model|Why do the proportions of the human body change with age? The essential meaning of that question cannot be understood without unraveling the process of human evolution. Moreover, even if the mechanisms of evolution were to be elucidated, the reasons why proportions must be changed or why we must evolve in that way and how far humans will continue evolving are likely to remain mysteries. However, the mechanisms for the changes in human body proportions can be explained. The present study explains not only the mechanisms for changes in body proportion but also, to construct a standard growth system for humans, confirms the reverification process of the growth curves proposed by Scammon almost 90 years ago and seeks to solve problems by offering the Fujimmon growth curves proposed by the author. In addition, the Fujimmon and Scammon growth curves are described on the same scale and the two are compared. The results indicate the basic ambiguity of curves described freehand and the clarity from the exactness provided by the mathematical functions described by the wavelet interpolation model. The validity and efficacy of the Fujimmon growth curves are then shown.
I00|Search for Obesity Cutoff Value Based on Health Information: Analysis from BMI fluctuation|Obesity refers to a state in which excessive fat is accumulated in the body. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), people with a body mass index (BMI) of ?25 are taken to be obese. This is the standard indicating increased risk of diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke attributable to obesity. That is, it is considered to be an indicator below which risk is inhibited and people can live in health. However, the critical point for risk affecting health is not clear. If the risks associated with health information could be analyzed by degree of obesity, it may be possible to identify a cut-off value for obesity. In this study we assessed the level of health risk based on BMI fluctuations, calculated the mean health information values for each unit of BMI from 14 to 34, and analyzed fluctuations in each health information item based on BMI fluctuation. The results showed that the risk from blood pressure and maximum oxygen uptake increased together with fluctuations in BMI. With this it is thought that a new cutoff point for obesity risk can be established.
I00|Annual Trend of Physical Growth in Infant and Japanese High Economic Growth|The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has published measurement records on height, weight, chest circumference, and head circumference in 0 to 6 year-old children from 1960 to 2010 as indicators of physical development in early childhood in Japan. Physical development evaluation charts have been developed from these records using percentile methods, but reports on the trends in physical development over time are limited. This is because no method has been established to scientifically analyze physical growth. Even more difficult is investigating secular trends in physical growth and linking those trends to economic growth. In this study, we identified the first largest peak velocity (FLPV) during the year after birth in infant physical growth records (height, weight, chest circumference, head circumference), and applied the wavelet interpolation model to the variations over time in the identified FLPV. Next, we applied the wavelet interpolation model to the secular variations in GDP for the same years. We then applied a cross correlation function to the relationship between the curves of FLPV and GDP variations over time, and investigated how high economic growth acts as a controlling factor variations in physical development of young children over time. The speed of variation in the physical development of children over time was the greatest around 1980. By synchronizing GDP to that time, the results suggest that high economic growth is a controlling factor in the physical development of young children.
I00|Tracking Phenomenon of Physical Development during elementary School|The method generally used to assess motor ability in elementary school is the 10-step assessment in the new physical fitness test advocated by the by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan. However, no method of assessing physical fitness and motor ability has been established that considers changes with age in schoolchildren, who are in the growth stage. Specifically, no method to evaluate physical longitudinal data for individual children has been created. In this study, we constructed an aging span evaluation chart of motor ability using the wavelet interpolation method and applied it to longitudinal development data for motor ability in the physical ability of first to sixth grade elementary school students. Motor ability tracking was then examined with the application of this evaluation method. The results confirmed that motor ability tracked closely in first to sixth grade elementary school students. Therefore, this suggests that there is a trend for individuals with high motor ability in childhood to follow the same high level course afterward. Also, children with poor motor ability in particular may need early educational attention.
I00|Construction of Standardization System in Judgment for Young Children Obesity and Leanness|Body composition in children can be measured until about the age of 6 years using the impedance method, but in children below that age the findings are often treated as reference values. However, information on body composition is needed to verify body fatness in early childhood. In this study, we investigated the validity of obesity and leanness Judgment using a simple impedance analysis in young children, by comparing body fat percentage derived with the impedance method and body fatness judged from standard height and weight curves, with the aim of constructing a standardized system for judging obesity and leanness in young children. we constructed a 5-step mean evaluation together with body fat percentage statistics and judged levels of obesity and leanness. For judgments of obesity with regression evaluation of weight against height, we constructed a 5-step regression evaluation chart after deriving valid order regression polynomials, and determined levels of obesity and leanness based on them. The results of comparisons of the distributions of obesity and leanness judgments obtained with the two evaluations using the ?2 test showed no significant differences in all subjects from 3 to 5 years old.
I00|Issues in physical fitness of contemporary Japanese boys judged with evaluation criteria for the past|In this study, evaluation criteria for physique and physical fitness in early childhood were constructed with consideration of age-related changes. The wavelet interpolation model was used for data from young children in 1979, when physical fitness was at a high level in postwar Japan. This evaluation chart was then used to investigate the kinds of problems that could be indicated in the physical development of young children today, by evaluating their physique and physical fitness. Physical fitness was evaluated in 2,014 boys in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. Height, weight, 20 m dash, standing long jump, and tennis ball throw were measured from April to June, 2009. In constructing evaluation criteria for the past, data collected in 1979 for the same items as above were used. The subjects were 2,397 boys in Aichi Prefecture. An age-related change curve with a 5-step evaluation by age was drawn for the collected measurement data using the wavelet interpolation model, and an evaluation chart was constructed. The results showed that height was shorter at 3 years of age in 2009 than in 1979, but that later there was a tendency for height to catch up with that in 1979 with age. It is conjectured that this shows a faster maturation speed in boys compared with 30 years ago. There was more scattering in the lower level of the running and jumping ability aspects of physical fitness, while in throwing ability the level was obviously low at all ages. The results of this study indicate that issues related to the growth and development of young children today are underdevelopment in relation to the continuous display of leg muscle strength and innervation for alternating right and left movement of the arms and legs, immaturity in coordinated movement between the arms, trunk and legs, and low instantaneous muscle strength of the arms.
I00|Recent Trends in Physical Fitness and Motor Ability of Preschool Children -Trends in Japan since 2000-|In recent years, there has been concern in Japan of declining physical strength in early childhood. Consideration of lifestyle in modern society may provide suggestions on the appropriate level of physical strength and motor ability for modern children. Therefore, it may be necessary to show the physique and motor ability suitable for the generational background. The purpose of this study was to clarify the trends since 2000 in body shape, physical strength, and motor ability in early childhood in Japan. The data used were physique and motor ability data from 1969 to 2009 for young boys and girls in kindergartens and nursery schools in Aichi Prefecture surveyed by the Children?s Growth and Development Society. The study subjects were kindergarten and nursery school girls (age 3?5 years old) in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. Physique (height and weight), quantitative motor ability (20 m dash, standing long jump, tennis ball throw, side step, one-leg hop, jump rope, hanging from a horizontal bar, one-leg standing, and ball bouncing), and general motor ability (jump over and under) were compared in the 1999 and 2009 school years. The results revealed that, compared with ten years earlier, height was approximately 0.9 cm shorter in 4-year-old girls and weight was approximately 0.3 kg lighter in 3- and 4-year-old girls in 2009. In physical strength and motor ability, the time for jump over and under was shorter in 3-year-olds, the number of times a rope jumped was higher and the time hanging from a horizontal bar was longer, and the time for jump over and under was shorter in 4-year-olds. In 5-year-olds, only an increase in the number of times a rope jumped increased. The tennis ball throw and side steps were not significantly different from 10 years earlier in any of the ages. Although physique, strength, and exercise improved with growth, it was found that many items decreased or remained the same in all age groups compared to those 10 years ago.
I00|Love as a key element to wellbeing|This presentation is based on the new scientific book Love Around Us - The Role of Love in Education, Parenting and Romantic Relationships (Kaarina Määttä & Satu Uusiautti, eds.) published by Peter Lang in 2018, and also the previous book Many Faces of Love (Kaarina Määttä & Satu Uusiautti, authors), published by Sense Publishers. In the presentation it will be discussed research on love as a key element of health, wellbeing and positive human development. People live in a network of relationships and their ability to build and maintain realationships is an important strength. Love has many definitions and also many forms and faces. The presentation provides a comprehensive analysis on love in various areas of human beings? life ? the emergence and manifestation of romantic love in various phases of life, love in education, love for work, for fellow humans ? and in relation to other phenomena, such as friendship, play, and creativity. When dissecting love along the course of life, parental love and also grandparental love secures children's well-being and teachers´ pedagogical love trusts in pupils' learning. The first taste of falling in love can manifest itself in the form of the sweet poison of love and still is quite far from actual love. The ability to love is an important, yet difficult, skill. There are numerous theories that explain the phases of long-lasting marriages and divorces, too. Nevertheless, love does not retire and the fascination of love does not fade, not even in senior age. Other topical phenomena of love are, for example, love for work and the successful combination of work and family.Love in its whole gamut is connected to human wellbeing and development in different areas and phases of human life. Love, as its best, is manifested by the endeavor to make things develop, grow, and come forward, whether love falls on other people, art, science, ideas, or nature. A world where it is safe to love is a world where it is safe to live. The presentation concentrates on the best sides of love and I conclude that love, in its various forms, makes the best health insurance.
I00|Measuring the statistical capacity of nations|The international development community has used the World Bank’s Statistical Capacity Index since its inception in 2004. The Sustainable Development Goals create new challenges for national statistical systems to produce high-quality and internationally comparable data. This paper reviews measurement methodologies, posits desired attributes, and presents theoretical and empirical frameworks for the new, improved index to monitor progress in the statistical capacity of nations. The paper illustrates the properties of the updated index with global data from 2016.
I00|The Effects of Maternal Depression on Nine-Year-Old Childrenâ€™s Behavior, Physical Health, and Cognition|This paper investigates the effects of maternal depression, including its occurrence and chronicity, on nine-year-old childrenâ€™s behavior, physical health, and cognition, as well as the extent to which five mechanisms explain the association between maternal depressionâ€™s chronicity and these outcomes. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), we conduct this analysis with ordinary least squares (OLS), instrumental variable (IV), and Lewbel IV regression models. We find that maternal depression significantly negatively impacts childrenâ€™s behavior and physical health at age nine, while its relationship to their cognition remains ambiguous. These demonstrated effects increase in magnitude and significance with depressionâ€™s chronicity. Estimates indicate that economic hardship explains a significant portion of the association between maternal depression and all three categories of child outcomes, while mothering behaviors, co-parenting, and maternal health also play an important role for some outcomes. These findings provide support for potential policies for identifying depression early in its course, making appropriate treatment more financially viable for all individuals, and assisting children at-risk for or already suffering from behavioral and physical health problems.
I00|Price–quality competition in a mixed duopoly|We examine competition between a private and a public provider in markets for merit goods, such as education, healthcare, housing, recreation, or culture. The private firm provides a high‐price/high‐quality variety of the good and serves richer individuals, whereas the public firm provides a low‐price/low‐quality variety and serves poorer individuals. We first characterize the private competitor’s best response to changes in the public firm’s price and quality. This enables us to examine the distributional effects of policies that affect the price or quality of the public firm’s product. We then numerically characterize the public firm’s optimal provision policy, taking the private response into consideration. Our results have implications for the financing of publicly provided goods, and for whether additional resources, if available, should be spent on reducing the price or enhancing the quality of these goods.
I00|Coping Mechanisms Of Philippine Students? Left Behind By Ofw Parents|Students nowadays are experiencing school life without the presence of their parents. While many children have experienced a decline in classroom performance while parents are away, many were also found to have performed excellently through various mechanisms. This study investigates the influence of coping mechanisms towards the academic performance of students with OFW parents. A survey was conducted to students who were academically high performing for the school year 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. A total of 142 students from Catholic schools in Davao del Sur were given questionnaires and ten underwent the Key Informant Interview. Using Multiple Regression Analysis, it was determined that of the eight coping mechanisms tested only three were found to be significant, namely: active coping, planning and the use of instrumental support. Based on the findings, it is recommended that schools must define policies that would support the creation of a separate program for students with OFW parents with the emphasis on the significant predictors.
I00|Obstacles For Academic Entrepreneurship in Turkey|Today, as a result of the knowledge economy, universities are focusing more on creating commercial knowledge along with their primary tasks ? education and research. Increasing demand for university-industry collaboration, universities? new roles in the economic development through technology transfer, and commercialization of knowledge are among the major factors that lead to concepts such as ?entrepreneurial university? and ?academic entrepreneur?. Academic entrepreneurship is actually a wider concept that covers all the efforts and activities toward the commercialization of the scientific research outputs of the universities and their industrial partners.In Turkey, Supreme Council for Science and Technology supports academic entrepreneurship activities and encourages potential academic entrepreneurs through various support mechanisms. However, there are many problems that academic entrepreneurs encounter and this study aims to discuss possible solutions for these problems and obstacles.
I00|Teachers' impact on Facilitating Intercultural Relationships among Primary School Students|Migration floods have dramatically increased in frequency and numbers over the past two decades. The phenomenon is continually changing in characteristics and populations affected by it. The challenges they are posing are evolving, as well, and they demand a difficult shift in the host communities. The focus of this paper is on the key role teachers play in facilitating or impeding integration. We collected data in Italy among 5th-grade students (10-11 y.o.) observing how teachers' instructions and arised empathy can modulate the likeability, ingroup/outgroup identification and acculturation expectations toward a fictional immigrant peer. Results are still under processing, but at this preliminary stage the impact of both teachers and empathy seems to be confirmed, even though at different extents. Implications, limitations and future directions will be discussed.
I00|The Mobile Sprout Wagon - an innovative new approach to improving pupil?s health through interdisciplinary hands-on food activities|In today?s society there is a tendency that children are increasingly more and more detached and disconnected from the food they are eating; the origins of its components, and the process ?farm to fork?. This is an issue with wide-reaching consequences to health. In this paper we will seek to answer the questions: How is it possible to create new innovative and interdisciplinary teaching approaches, that enhances the pupils? understanding of food and a healthier lifestyle? And how can we develop interdisciplinary methods and learning tools that can be implemented as hands-on activities in multiple school subjects? To answer these questions we will introduce Learn4Health, an EU Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership with the aim of creating, strengthening and sustaining health, nutrition and food literacy among pupils in primary and secondary schools in Europe. We will discuss three of the projects created within Learn4Health, and their content, structure and use, and further, analyse their innovative and interdisciplinary approaches to the issues at hand. Next, we will highlight one of these projects, the mobile Sprout Wagon as a prime example. The Sprout Wagon, with its unique mobile construction provides pupils with hands-on learning contexts in multiple school subjects, placing food, nutrition and health on the schedule, and we will discuss how this new, innovative and interdisciplinary approach, can be used as an effective tool inside the classroom to support and facilitate learning in multiple school subjects. Finally, on this background we will present the detailed instructional guides and teaching material which will be developed during the process of the Sprout Wagon and the other Learn4Health projects and which will all be included in the HOFA Handbook - an instructional handbook which will be freely available on the Learn4Health website at the end of the project period. This dissemination strategy will ensure that the insights, innovative approaches, knowledge and experiences will be shared across the borders, thereby securing sustainability of the project and creating wide-reaching impact ? and, ultimately, happier, more food literate children.
I00|Formulation And Evaluation Of Chronotherapeutic Pulsatle Drug Delivery System|The aim of present investigation was to develop press coated tablet for pulsatile drug delivery of Salbutamol sulphate using hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymers. The drug delivery system was designed to deliver the drug at such a time when it could be most needful to patient of rheumatoid arthritis. The press coated tablets containing Salbutamol sulphate in the inner core was formulated with an outer shell by different weight ratio of hydrophobic polymer (micronized ethyl cellulose powder) and hydrophilic polymers (Glycinemax Husk or sodium alginate). The release profile of press coated tablet exhibited a lag time followed by burst release, in which outer shell ruptured into two halves. Authors also investigated factors influencing on lag time such as particle size and viscosity of ethyl cellulose, outer coating weight and paddle rpm. The surface morphology of the tablet was examined by a scanning electron microscopy. Differential scanning calorimeter and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy study showed compatibility between Salbutamol sulphate and coating material.
I00|Parental Behaviour As Correlates Of Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders Among Normal Children: Implications For Positive Mental Health|In the family set up, parents continue to be the caregivers and playmates during the childhood and pre-adolescent stages. During these stages, parents also become more concerned with teaching children how to behave (or how not to behave) in various situations. At these stages, the need for parents to manage the children?s budding autonomy in the hope of instilling a sense of social propriety and self-control while taking care not to undermine his curiosity, initiative and feeling of personal competence becomes very critical. Achieving emotional competence is very crucial to children?s social competence, their ability to achieve personal goals in social interaction while continuing to maintain positive relationship with others. This study employed a descriptive research design to investigate parental child rearing behaviours as correlates of anxiety related emotional disorder among normal children. The sample consists of 780 school children with the age range of 7 ? 10 years who were randomly selected from twenty primary schools in Ondo State, Nigeria. The instrument for data collection was a questionnaire consisting of three sections A, B and C. Section A contained items on the children?s bio-data (Age, School, Sex and caregiver). However, only children living with their biological parents were used for the study. Section B dealt with the parental child rearing behaviours with a 40 item likert type scale. The response formats range from Never=1. Rarely=2, Sometimes=3, Often=4, and Almost always=5. This section was designed to provide profile of parent?s behaviours toward their children with important domains of their involvement, being positive, monitoring, consistency in discipline and corporal punishment. Section C contain 20 items bothering on the perceived anxiety by the children based on the domain of: separation anxiety, social and specific phobia, panic anxiety and generalized anxiety. Scoring ranged from never=1, sometimes=2, often=3, and always=4.The findings revealed among others that there is a significant relationship between parental inconsistent discipline (Fcal=8.488>Ftab=3.86), corporal punishment (Fcal=11.771>Ftab=3.86) and child anxiety. However there was no significant relationship between parental involvement (Fcal=0.126>Ftab=3.86), positive parenting (Fcal=2.050>Ftab=3.86), poor parental monitoring (Fcal=2.101>Ftab=3.86) and children anxiety disorder.Parents were thereafter counselled on appropriate child rearing practices for positive parent-child relationship and positive mental health.
I00|Intergenerational digital activity: A good mixture of education and welfare|"The context of this presentation is the ITAC research project[1], a scientific collaboration between the ICAR and the ELICO research teams and Lyon?s Public Library (BML). Its aim is to study the intergenerational use of digital artifacts at the BML. ITAC focuses on the relational, linguistic, and educational aspects resulting from the interactions. Our study centers on the interactions between a grandmother and her grandson discovering together the games provided on an interactive table. It is also a question of studying the way in which the grandmother transmits to her grandson the manipulative knowledge of communication with the screen. Through a methodological framework inspired by comprehensive ethology (Cosnier, 2001), the analysis will show how both participants benefit from such an activity when it is properly lead by a mediator. In terms of education, the results show that both participants enhanced their digital literacy. In terms of welfare, the senior gets involved in the digital entertainment environment at the same time as she plays with her grandson. It informs us of her degree of appropriation of digital uses. This ease of communication with the screens limits the speeches constantly highlighting the difficulties of seniors to be comfortable with these new technologies. Cosnier.

I00|Mental health and labor relationships: a study with the legal analysts of the Office of the Prosecutor General - Brasil|"Realizing the importance of social welfare and worker health, this article aims to investigate the work relations of the Office of the Prosecutor General (PGR), verifying the possibilities of risk and commitment of the mental health of the professionals and contributing to raise a illness in this field. An exploratory qualitative research was carried out with five judicial analysts, servants of the Office of the Prosecutor General. Data collection was performed through semi-structured interviews and the method of analysis was the Analysis of the Core of Senses (ANS). The method adopted allowed the identification of six categories of analysis, namely: ""what is the centrality of the cabinet""; ""Meeting goals is normal""; ""Suffers from the violations that are very veiled here""; ""I do landscape face"" and ""if it was someone else she'd even say I hate it. But I like"". These categories were listed in explanatory tables, which synthesize their definitions, constituent themes and participants' verbalizations. It was observed a distance between the servers in the context of the general institutional environment, associated with a high degree of cognitive effort of reading and interpretations, that hinders the communication among the workers. The ""subjection"" of the worker was also verified to the productivist and managerial social logic. Concealed in a discourse of pleasure and satisfaction with work, the verbalizations of frustration are mostly directed toward the little acknowledgment given to the efforts made, the workload of the cabinets, and impotence in the face of a work that does not end. As a conclusion, it is verified that the work schedule, associated with the tasks routines and the few spaces for discussion of the conflicts, compromise the health of the professionals and render the environment hostile, requiring a rethinking of activities and social relations that permeate the space of work."
I00|Suicidal Ideation and Burnout among University students|Suicide is major cause of premature death all over the world. The current study was aimed to find out the prevalence rate of suicidal ideation and its relationship with burnout among Pakistani college students. Data was collected through Rudd?s Suicidal ideation Scale (Rudd, 1989) and Indigenous Burnout scale (Ijaz & Khan, 2012). A total of 1500 students from three cities including Lahore, Rawalpindi and Islamabad were included. Data was sampled through a subtype of cluster sampling technique ?Area Probability Sampling Technique?. The study indicated high level of suicidal ideation and burnout among students. The results also revealed that females experience more suicidal ideation and burnout as compared to males. The results also illustrated that students of Islamabad experience more burnout and suicidal ideation i.e 53.60 % , 4.05% respectively as compare to students of Lahore i.e 48.98%, 3.29% and Rawalpindi i.e 47.74% , 3,43 % respectively Regression analyses shows that burnout significantly predicted suicide. Identifying prevalence rate of suicidal ideation and burnout will enable institutions to provide more focused support and interventions for at risk students.
I00|Quality of Education and Systems?Based Educational Evaluation|In the paper we present partial results from the research project no. 014EU-4/2016 ?Preparation of content and structure of subjects focused on the development of basic entrepreneurial knowledge and skills of graduates from selected medical study fields?. We deal with issues of improvement of education evaluation processes. The core of the paper contains the evaluation models based on the systemic approach, characteristic features and instructions for their application and interview methods in three types of businesses differentiated by size. The research was conducted with 267 respondents from three groups of businesses differentiated by size (number of employees) by means of the questionnaire and interview methods. The purpose of empirical research was to establish the applicability of models of education evaluation. Based on the research results, it is concluded that (based on the respondents? opinion) the evaluation of the benefits of systemic based education in businesses is a great challenge for the future, and it is likely to bring benefits to the efficiency and quality of education in businesses. On the other hand, problems occur mainly in quantifying the benefits of education and are related to the lack of knowledge of indicators that would enable businesses to conduct all the steps of the evaluation process. The issues analyzed in the paper require a deeper elaboration from theoretical aspect, which would facilitate its application in practice.
I00|Time‐Use And Academic Peer Effects In College|This paper examines academic peer effects in college. Unique new data from the Berea Panel Study allow us to focus on a mechanism wherein a student's peers affect her achievement by changing her study effort. Although the potential relevance of this mechanism has been recognized, data limitations have made it difficult to provide direct evidence about its importance. We find that a student's freshman grade point average is affected by the amount her peers studied in high school, suggesting the importance of this mechanism. Using time diary information, we confirm that college study time is actually being affected. (JEL I20, F21, J01)
I00|Fiskalische Effekte des Koalitionsvertrags 2018|Der Koalitionsvertrag von CDU, CSU und SPD vom 7. Februar 2018 bleibt hinter dem zurück, was zur langfristigen Wohlstandssicherung nötig wäre und möglich ist. Zwar werden wichtige zukunftsgerichtete Maßnahmen im Bildungs- und Betreuungsbereich beschlossen, die Position insbesondere arbeitender Familien mit Kindern wird durch eine Reihe von Maßnahmen gestärkt, eine flächendeckende digitale Infrastruktur soll bis 2025 verbindlich erreicht werden. Hingegen werden in zentralen Punkten bei Maßnahmen zur langfristigen Sicherung der wirt-schaftlichen Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und der Vorsorge für die strukturellen technischen und demografischen Herausforderungen falsche Weichenstellungen in der Rentenpolitik, Steuerpolitik und im Befristungsrecht vorgenommen, die per saldo Beschäftigung in Deutschland verteuern und erschweren werden. Insgesamt atmet der Vertrag eher einen Geist der Mikrosteue-rung von Gesellschaft und Wirtschaft statt den eines vom Langfristdenken geprägten beherzten Modernisierungskurses. Mit einem Gesamtvolumen von Mehrausgaben und Mindereinnahmen in Höhe von rund 91,5 Mrd. Euro verbleibt für Bund, Länder und Sozialversicherungen unter Berücksichtigung von Mehreinnahmen ein Finanzierungsbedarf von 88,5 Milliarden Euro. Hinzu kommen mögliche Kosten, wenn die Finanzierung des Breitbandausbaus und des Digitalpakts Schulen durch die Versteigerung der 5G-Lizenzen nicht gedeckt werden kann. Allein für diese beiden Posten sind gut 15 Mrd. Euro angesetzt, teilweise erst für die nächste Legislaturperiode. Selbst bei vorsichtigen Annahmen liegen die nicht durch Mehreinnahmen gedeckten Finanzierungswünsche des Koalitionsvertrags allein für den Bund mit 65,9 Mrd. Euro deutlich über dem Tableau der prioritären Maßnahmen in Höhe von 46 Mrd. Euro. Der Koalitionsvertrag bedeutet damit für den Bund bis 2021 eine strukturelle Unterdeckung des Haushalts in Höhe von mindestens 20 Mrd. Euro. Der zeitliche Verlauf der Ausgaben deutet darauf hin, dass die Aus-gaben verstärkt in den Jahren 2020 und 2021 anfallen werden, vor allem für den Abbau des Solidaritätszuschlags, die Erhöhung des Kindergelds, den Kita-Ausbau, die Maßnahmen im Bereich des Wohnungsbaus und der Verkehrsinvestitionen. Damit wird ein Ausgabenüberhang zum Ende der Legislaturperiode aufgebaut, sodass im Jahr 2021 der Haushaltsspielraum aufgebraucht und ein Defizit aufgelaufen sein wird. Die Folgewirkungen der Beschlüsse für die Sozialversicherungen sind dabei noch nicht berücksichtigt. Im Jahr 2021 könnten die Ausgaben al-lein des Bundes aber schon um rund 37 Mrd. Euro über den Einnahmen liegen.
I00|Más de cien años de avances en el nivel de vida: El caso de Colombia|Este trabajo examina las tendencias a largo plazo observadas en el nivel de vida de la población colombiana durante los últimos cien años, con especial atención a la salud. Construimos un índice histórico de desarrollo humano para Colombia (IHDHC) para los siglos XIX y XX por género. Encontramos que no hubo avances importantes en los niveles de vida durante el siglo XIX, debido principalmente al estancamiento del PIB per cápita. Por el contrario, se observaron avances significativos en el siglo XX, especialmente en las mujeres. Durante la primera mitad del siglo, las mejoras se debieron principalmente a un mayor ingreso per cápita, mientras que las posteriores a la década de 1950 fueron el resultado de una mayor inversión pública en educación y salud. Los datos en salud muestran que el porcentaje de muertes por tuberculosis, neumonía y enfermedades gastrointestinales disminuyó significativamente a lo largo del siglo. Por el contrario, las muertes causadas por cáncer y enfermedades del corazón aumentaron considerablemente en las últimas décadas. Los resultados indican que la disminución en la tasa de mortalidad estuvo relacionada en gran medida con la expansión en el suministro de servicios de acueductos y alcantarillado. ******ABSTRACT: This paper examines the long-term trends observed in the standard of living of the Colombian population during the past one hundred years, with special attention on health. We construct a historical index of human development for Colombia (HIHDC) for the 19th and 20th centuries by gender. We find that there were no major advances in living standards during the 19th century due to the stagnation of GDP per capita as a result of the lack of dynamism in exports. On the contrary, significant advances in the HIHDC were seen in the twentieth century, especially for women. During the first half of the 20th century, the improvements were mainly driven by a higher per capita income, while improvements after the 1950s were driven by greater public investment in education and health. The health data show that the percentage of deaths from tuberculosis, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal diseases decreased significantly throughout the century. On the contrary, deaths caused by cancer and heart diseases have increased considerably in recent decades. Results show that the decline in mortality rate was largely related with the expansion in the provision of public goods, namely aqueducts and sewerage services.

I00|Does managed competition constrain hospitalsâ€™ contract prices? Evidence from the Netherlands|In the Dutch health care system health insurers negotiate with hospitals about the pricing of hospital products in a managed competition framework. In this paper, we study these contract prices that became for the first time publicly available in 2016. The data show substantive price variation between hospitals for the same products, and within a hospital for the same product across insurers. About 27% of the contract prices for a hospital product is 20% higher or lower than the average contract price in the market. For about half of the products the highest and lowest contract price across hospitals differ by a factor three or more. Moreover, hospital product prices do not follow a consistent ranking across hospitals, suggesting substantial cross subsidization between hospital products. Potential explanations for the large and seemingly random price variation are: (i) different cost pricing methods used by hospitals, (ii) uncertainty due to frequent changes in the hospital payment system; (iii) price adjustments related to negotiated lumpsum payments, and (iv) differences in hospital and insurer market power. Several policy options are discussed to reduce variation and increase transparency of hospital prices.
I00|Well-being Inequality in the Long Run|This paper provides a long-run view of well-being inequality at world scale based on a new historical dataset. Trends in social dimensions alter the view on inequality derived from per capita GDP. While in terms of income, inequality increased until the third quarter of the twentieth century; in terms of well-being, inequality fell steadily since World War I. The spread of mass primary education and the health transitions were its main drivers. The gap between the West and the Rest explains only partially the evolution of well-being inequality, as the dispersion within the developing regions has increasingly determined its evolution.
I00|Sample selection biases and the historical growth pattern of children|Bodenhorn et al. (2017) have recently sparked considerable controversy by arguing that the fall in adult stature observed in military samples in the United States and Britain during industrialisation was a figment of sample selection bias. While subsequent papers have questioned the extent of the bias (Komlos and A’Hearn 2016; Zimran 2017), there is renewed concern about selection bias in historical anthropometric datasets. This paper extends Bodenhorn et al.’s discussion of selection bias on unobservables to sources of children’s growth, specifically focussing on biases that could distort the age pattern of growth. Understanding how the growth pattern of children has changed is important since these changes underpinned the secular increase in adult stature and are related to child stunting observed in developing countries today. However, there is potential for selection on unobservables in historical datasets containing children’s and adolescents’ height, so scholars must be aware of these biases before analysing these sources. This paper highlights, among others, three common sources of bias: 1) positive selection of children into secondary school in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; 2) distorted height by age profiles created by age thresholds for enlistment in the military; and 3) changing institutional ecology which determines to which institutions children are sent. Accounting for these biases weakens the evidence of a strong pubertal growth spurt in the nineteenth century and raises doubts on some long run analyses of changes in children’s growth, especially for Japan.
I00|Boosting Investment in Social Infrastructure in Europe|The High-Level Task Force (HLTF) on Investing in Social Infrastructure in Europe was initiated by the European Long-Term Investors Association (ELTI). It was chaired by Romano Prodi and Christian Sautter and comprised representatives from the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, the Council of Europe Development Bank, many National Promotional Banks as well as associations and experts from the social sector. The HLTF's mission was to raise political attention to the crucial role of social infrastructure and related services, aiming to enhance public and private investments in this sector. Long-term, flexible and efficient investment in education, health and affordable housing is considered essential for the economic growth of the European Union (EU), the well-being of its people and a successful move towards upward convergence in the EU. This final report contains a comprehensive collection of facts and figures on social infrastructure and social services and the related financing needs. Based on the conclusions and results, the report formulates concrete recommendations aimed at enhancing current financing tools as well as for future schemes and initiatives in the social sector.
I00|What Drives Output Volatility? The Role of Demographics and Government Size Revisited|This paper studies the determinants of output volatility in a panel of 22 OECD countries. In contrast to the existing literature, we avoid ad hoc estimates of volatility based on rolling windows, and we account for possible non‐stationarity. Specifically, output volatility is modelled within an unobserved components model where the volatility series is the outcome of both macroeconomic determinants and a latent integrated process. A Bayesian model selection approach tests for the presence of the non‐stationary component. The results point to demographics and government size as important determinants of macroeconomic (in)stability. A larger share of prime‐age workers is associated with lower output volatility, while higher public expenditure increases volatility.

I00|Universal preschool programs and long-term child outcomes: A systematic review|What are the long-term effects of universal preschool programs on child outcomes? We review 26 studies using natural experiments to estimate the effects of universal preschool programs for children aged 0-6 years on child outcomes measured from third grade to adulthood. Studies comparing preschool with parental, family, or other informal modes of care show mixed effects on test scores, and on measures related to health, well-being, and behavior. However, all estimates for outcomes related to adequate primary and secondary school progression, years of schooling, highest degree completed, employment, and earnings indicate beneficial average effects of universal preschool programs. Three of the included studies calculate benefits-to-costs ratios and find ratios clearly above one. Universal preschool tends to be more beneficial for children with low socioeconomic status, and there are not consistently different effects for boys or girls. Only three studies compare two alternative types of universal preschool programs in terms of long-term outcomes.
I00|Longer, More Optimistic, Lives: Historic Optimism and Life Expectancy in the United States|How was optimism related to mortality before the rise in “deaths of despair” that began in the late 1990s? We show that as early as 1968 more optimistic people lived longer (using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics). The relationship depends on many factors including gender, race, health, and education. We then evaluate these and other variables as determinants of individual optimism over the period 1968-1975. We find women and African Americans were less optimistic at the time than men and whites (although this has changed in recent years). Greater education is associated with greater optimism and so is having wealthy parents. We then predict optimism for the same individuals in subsequent years, thus generating our best guess as to how optimism changed for various demographic groups from 1976-1995. We find people with less than a high school degree show the greatest declines in optimism, which along with their long-run links to premature mortality and deaths of despair, highlights the importance of better understanding optimism’s causes and consequences.
I00|Does Hope Lead to Better Futures? Evidence from a Survey of the Life Choices of Young Adults in Peru|We use a novel survey of poor and near poor urban young adults in Peru to study the role of hope in individuals’ propensity to invest in the future. We explored the past predictors of aspirations and life satisfaction today, based on battery of questions about past experience, education and health status, relationships with parents and friends, as well as about negative shocks. We included questions on current and past life satisfaction, internal and external locus of control, self-esteem, discount rates, optimism, and education aspirations. We found remarkably high levels of resilience and education aspirations among our survey population. Eighty-eight percent of our young adults aspire to completing college or post-college education. In addition, most of the respondents in the high aspirations categories had experienced one or more negative shocks in the past. Respondents in the high aspirations categories are also far less likely to partake in risky behaviors, such as smoking or having unsafe sex. This provides additional evidence suggesting that individuals with high aspirations and/or hope for the future are more likely to invest in those futures as well as to avoid behaviors that are likely to jeopardize their futures. While we do not know how lasting that hope channel is, particularly in the face of future shocks or disappointments, we hope to answer that question in future research.
I00|Making growth more inclusive in Thailand|The People pillar of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development focuses on quality of life in all its dimensions, and emphasises the international community’s commitment to ensuring all human beings can fulfil their potential in dignity, equality and good health. Thailand’s path from a low-income to an upper-middle-income country over recent decades is widely hailed as a development success story. Poverty has fallen impressively and inequality is on a downwards trend, but more efforts are needed to reduce still widespread informality and persistent, substantial regional inequalities, and to further improve living standards, especially for those who currently work informally. To achieve these objectives, the government needs to: (i) consider tax and regulatory measures to encourage formalisation; (ii) boost the participation rates of informal workers in social protection schemes; (iii) expand adequate social safety nets for poor households and the elderly; (iv) prepare the healthcare system for an ageing and modernising society; and (v) improve the education system, particularly in rural areas. Gaps also remain in ensuring women’s political participation and reducing gender-based violence. This Working Paper relates to the 2018 Initial Assessment report of the Multi-dimensional Country Review of Thailand (http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/multi-dimensional-review-thailand.htm)
I00|Macro Economy and Health in India|This paper setting the health in the macroeconomic framework discusses how health is being neglected in the Indian state policy making where it has not been drawn required policy attention and priority in resource allocation. It also focuses on where health institutions failed, where policy went wrong and how adequate care was not taken in setting goals, identifying the solutions and monitoring progress. Inadequate policy attention towards sporadic interventions in pricing, health financing issues and the all important concern over the lack of trained health sector resources are a few of the major issues that define where India went wrong in tackling the health sector.
I00|Four faces of marginalization: Variations in institutional frameworks of welfare state provisions and social trust in Europe|By assuming that marginalization threatens social trust formation, this study introduces a new analytical framework to explain the relationship between a welfare state’s institutional design and trust levels in European societies. A good’s life cycle view consisting of production and consumption is applied to the provision of social benefits to discern four forms of marginalization in an individual’s experience with the welfare state: (a) marginalization through attitude, (b) marginalization through context, (c) marginalization through poverty, and (d) marginalization through opportunity lack. We argue that universalism in benefit provisions minimizes each of the four marginalization forms whereas selectivity is characterized by higher odds of marginalization. We further demonstrate that this especially holds true when universal social programs are generous and the state dedicates substantial resources to their funding. When the state’s resources are scarce, selectivity becomes a good alternative to universalism and may enhance social trust formation among individuals. We tested our hypotheses using data from the European Social Survey (2010).
I00|More than One Hundred Years of Improvements in Living Standards: the Case of Colombia|This paper examines the long-term trends observed in the standard of living of the Colombian population during the past one hundred years, with special attention on health. We construct a historical index of human development for Colombia (HIHDC) for the 19th and 20th centuries by gender. We find that there were no major advances in living standards during the nineteenth century due to the stagnation of Colombia’s GDP per capita as a result of the lack of dynamism in exports. On the contrary, significant advances in all components of the HIHDC were seen in the twentieth century, especially those for women. During the first half of the century, improvements in the quality of life were mainly driven by a higher per capita income, while improvements after the 1950s were driven by greater public investment, for example, in education and health. Next, we analyze health achievements, considering health is one of the components of the HIHDC that has been less studied in the Colombian economic history literature. We construct a new dataset using statistics reported by the Colombian government, which included annual information on the main diseases and causes of mortality during the period of 1916-2014 disaggregated by territorial units. The data show that the percentage of deaths from tuberculosis, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal diseases decreased significantly throughout the century. On the contrary, deaths caused by cancer and heart diseases have increased considerably in recent decades. Results from difference-in-difference models show that the decline in the total mortality rate and in the mortality rate for waterborne diseases was largely related with the expansion in the provision of public goods, namely aqueducts and sewerage services. **** Este trabajo examina las tendencias a largo plazo observadas en el nivel de vida de la población colombiana durante los últimos cien años, con especial atención en la salud. Construimos un índice histórico de desarrollo humano para Colombia (IHDHC) para los siglos XIX y XX por género. Encontramos que no hubo avances importantes en los niveles de vida durante el siglo XIX debido principalmente al estancamiento del PIB per cápita de Colombia. Por el contrario, se observaron avances significativos en todos los componentes del IHDHC en el siglo XX, especialmente los de las mujeres. Durante la primera mitad del siglo, las mejoras en la calidad de vida se debieron principalmente a un mayor ingreso per cápita, mientras que las mejoras posteriores a la década de 1950 se debieron a una mayor inversión pública, por ejemplo, en educación y salud. A continuación, analizamos los logros de salud, considerando que la salud es uno de los componentes del IHDHC que ha sido menos estudiado en la literatura de historia económica colombiana. Construimos un nuevo conjunto de datos utilizando estadísticas reportadas por el gobierno colombiano, que incluyeron información anual sobre las principales enfermedades y causas de mortalidad durante el período de 1916-2014 desagregadas por departamentos. Los datos muestran que el porcentaje de muertes por tuberculosis, neumonía y enfermedades gastrointestinales disminuyó significativamente a lo largo del siglo. Por el contrario, las muertes causadas por cáncer y enfermedades del corazón han aumentado considerablemente en las últimas décadas. Los resultados de los modelos de diferencia en diferencias muestran que la disminución en la tasa de mortalidad total y en la tasa de mortalidad por enfermedades transmitidas por el agua estuvo relacionada en gran medida con la expansión en la provisión de servicios de acueductos y alcantarillado.
I00|Uterus at a Price: Disability Insurance and Hysterectomy|Taiwanese Labor, Government Employee, and Farmer Insurance programs provide 5-6 months of salary to enrollees who undergo hysterectomy or oophorectomy before their 45th birthday. These programs result in more and earlier treatments, referred as, respectively, inducement and timing effects. Difference-in-difference and nonparametric methods are used to estimate these effects on surgery hazards between 1997 and 2011. For Government Employee and Labor Insurance, inducement is 11-12% of all hysterectomies, and timing 20% of inducement. For oophorectomy, both effects are insignificant. Induced hysterectomies increase benefit payments and surgical costs, at about the cost of a mammogram and 5 pap smears per enrollee.
I00|Post-neonatal Mortality Impacts Following Grants from the Gavi Vaccine Alliance: An Econometric Analysis from 2000 to 2014|We completed a retrospective multivariate panel and longitudinal trend study to evaluate the effect of Gavi Vaccine Alliance grants on vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) post-neonatal mortality. Feasible Generalized Least Squares (fGLS) regression analysis was used to examine the association between VPD post-neonatal mortality rates and Gavi funding. We also applied segmented regression analysis to assess the structural trend in VPD post-neonatal mortality rates, the impact of Gavi funding, and trend changes following Gavi support. We separately tested a composite VPD mortality rate and five vaccine-preventable mortality rates: pertussis, meningitis, measles, diarrhea, and pneumonia (lower-respiratory infection) as dependent variables. All 77 countries eligible for Gavi assistance from 2000 to 2014 were included in the study. To isolate the effect of Gavi funding in our primary model, we controlled for known and likely predictors of child mortality. Among other factors, Gavi investment and corruption control/system efficiency are important elements to reduce vaccine-preventable mortality rates. For every $1 per capita invested by the Gavi Vaccine Alliance, there are highly statistically significant effects- decreasing the vaccine-preventable disease post-neonatal mortality rate by 2.535 per 1,000 live births. We also found Gavi investments to be significantly associated with reductions in four vaccine preventable disease-specific rates: pertussis, meningitis, diarrhea, and pneumonia. Furthermore, we found Gavi support to be significantly associated with both immediate impacts and trend changes on vaccine-preventable mortality rates. We conclude that Gavi investments in developing country immunization programs have measurably contributed to reductions in post-neonatal VPD mortality rates. Furthermore, we found evidence of a longer term catalytic effect of Gavi funding with accelerated reductions in the trend for post-neonatal meningitis, diarrhea, and pneumonia mortality rates.
I00|Sibling Spillovers|It is notoriously difficult to identify peer effects within the family, because of the common shocks and reflection problems. We make use of a novel identification strategy and unique data in order to gain some purchase on this problem. We employ data from the universe of children born in Florida between 1994 and 2002 and in Denmark between 1990 and 2001, which we match to school and medical records. To address the identification problem, we examine the effects of having a sibling with a disability. Utilizing three-plus-child families, we employ a differences-in-differences research design which makes use of the fact that birth order influences the amount of time which a child spends in early childhood with their siblings, disabled or not. We observe consistent evidence in both locations that the second child in a family is differentially affected when the third child is disabled. We also provide evidence which suggests that the sibling spillovers are working at least in part through the relative exposure to parental time and financial resources.
I00|The Healthy Immigrant Paradox and Health Convergence|The health status of people is a precious commodity and central to economic, socio-political, and environmental dimensions of any country. Yet it is often the missing statistic in all general statistics, demographics, and presentations about the portrait of immigrants and natives. In this paper we are concerned with international migration and health outcomes in the host countries. Through a general literature review and examination of specific immigration countries, we provide insights into the Healthy Immigrant Paradox and the health assimilation of immigrants as we also elucidate selection and measurement challenges. While health is part of human capital, health assimilation is the mirror image of earnings assimilation. Namely, immigrants arrive with better health compared to natives and their health deteriorates with longer residence in the host country, converging to the health of natives or becoming even worse. A deeper understanding of immigrant health trajectories, and disparities with natives and other immigrants is of great value to societies and policymakers, who can design appropriate policy frameworks that address public health challenges, and prevent the health deterioration of immigrants.
I00|Measuring women’s economic empowerment: Critical lessons from South America|"Women face significant economic, social, and cultural challenges that limit their access to markets, quality jobs, and entrepreneurship and income-generation strategies. The big question among policy makers, development agencies, and researchers in the fi¬eld of women’s economic empowerment is how to effectively improve women’s economic empowerment through income-generation strategies, training, and social programs. Conventional measures of economic empowerment have used employment, income, and education as proxies. More recently, the research community has recognized the relevance of subjective dimensions such as decision-making power over purchases, bargaining power, subjective perceptions of well-being, and freedom of choice. In this context, the objective of this book is to provide empirical evidence from the South American countries of Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay about our experiences as researchers implementing existing methods and questionnaires used to explain and measure women’s economic empowerment in terms of individual outcomes. Our evidence focuses on the results, effects, impacts, and measurement of economic empowerment. To this end, the book explores both quantitative and qualitative methods to measure the usual proxies for empowerment—such as decision making and labor market participation—and the subjective dimensions of these measurements. In this book, we use the theoretical framework proposed by Naila Kabeer in her 1999 article ""Resources, Agency, Achievements: Reflections on the Measurement of Women's Empowerment,"" which frames empowerment as a process rather than an outcome."
I00|Would you choose to be happy? Tradeoffs between happiness and the other dimensions of life in a large population survey|A large literature documents the determinants of happiness. But is happiness all that people want from life; and if so, what type of happiness matters to them? Or are they willing to sacrifice happiness (however it is defined) for other attributes in their lives? We show direct evidence that individuals trade-off levels of happiness with levels of income, physical health, family, career success and education in a large sample of UK and US individuals. On average, all types of happiness are preferred to other attributes except health. People prefer affective happiness (feeling good) over evaluative (life satisfaction) and eudaimonic (worthwhileness) components. This result is robust to methodological innovations, such as the use of vignettes and judgements of the lives described.
I00|Origins of Adulthood Personality: The Role of Adverse Childhood Experiences|We test whether adverse childhood experiences – exposure to parental maltreatment and its indirect effect on health – are associated with age 30 personality traits. We use rich longitudinal data from a large, representative cohort of young US Americans and exploit the differences across siblings to control for the confounding influences of shared environmental and genetic factors. We find that maltreatment experiences are significantly and robustly associated with neuroticism, conscientiousness, and openness to experience, but not with agreeableness and extraversion. High levels of neuroticism are linked to sexual abuse and neglect; low levels of conscientiousness and openness to experience are linked to parental neglect. The estimated associations are significantly reduced in magnitude when controlling for physical or mental health, suggesting that adolescent health could be one important pathway via which maltreatment affects adulthood personality. Maltreatment experiences, in combination with their health effects, explain a significant fraction of the relationship between adulthood conscientiousness and earnings or human capital. Our findings provide a possible explanation for why personality traits are important predictors of adulthood labor market outcomes.
I00|The Welfare Implications of Health Insurance|We analyze the financial value of insurance when individuals have access to credit markets. Loans allow consumers to smooth shocks across time, decreasing the value of the smoothing (across states of the world) provided by insurance. We derive a simple formula for the incremental value of insurance and show how it depends on individual characteristics and the features of available loans. Our central contribution is to derive formulas for aggregate welfare that can be taken to data from typical studies of health insurance. We provide both exact formulas that can be taken to data on the distribution of medical expenditures and income and an approximate formula for aggregate data on medical expenditure. Using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey we illustrate how the incremental value of insurance is decreasing with access to loans. For consumers in the sickest decile, access to a five-year loan decreases the incremental value of insurance by $338 (6%) on average and $3,433 (36%) for the poorest consumers. We also find that our approximate formula is a reasonable proxy for the exact one in our data.
I00|Childcare Quality and Child Development|Development in early childhood predicts schooling and labor market outcomes in adulthood. Many young children are in some form of nonparental childcare, but the quality of this care, in particular the quality of caregiver–child interactions, is often low. In this paper, we use data from Peru to show that infants and toddlers with caregivers who demonstrate higher quality interactions have significantly better communication, problem-solving, and fine motor skills. We also find evidence that the association between the quality of care and child outcomes is significant throughout most of the distribution of child development, and largest at the bottom of it.
I00|Do teacher aides help or hurt student achievement? the role of teacher experience|Employment of teacher aides in U. S. public schools increased roughly six-fold since 1969. Yet randomized studies of aides find predominantly negative effects on student achievement. This study of public elementary schools in Oregon explores the role of teacher experience in the effectiveness of aides and finds a strong complementarity between aides and teacher experience. The complementarity explains two results of prior studies: negative effects for aides and positive effects primarily for early years of teacher experience. Without complementarity, the effect of aides is negative; with it, the effect is positive for schools with experienced teachers and negative only for schools with inexperienced teachers. Similarly, without complementarity, the effect of experience is negative; with it, the effect is positive for schools that use aides intensively and negative only for schools that do not. The study exploits the longitudinal, hierarchical structure of the Oregon data to estimate a hierarchical linear model with controls for both observed and unobserved influences on individual student achievement. A series of alternative specifications, including a nullification test of causality based on prior test scores suggest robustness for the estimates. Results of the study suggest that prior evidence for the effectiveness of aides is too pessimistic in the context of experienced teachers and that prior evidence for the effectiveness of teacher experience is too pessimistic in the context of schools that use aides intensively. The results also suggest that experienced teachers have expertise important to effective supervision of aides, particularly in schools where teachers are relatively inexperienced and aides are prevalent. Hence, attempts to address problems of large class sizes by adding aides are more likely to be effective in schools with experienced teachers.
I00|Globalization and Obesity: Asian Experiences of ‘Globesity’|This paper explores the ‘globesity’ hypothesis that is, it examines, the effect of globalization in its social and economic dimensions on the obesity of the nations. The study utilized a panel set of Asian countries dividing it into two groups based on the income classification. The annual time period of data series runs from 1985 to 2015. For the low and low middle income countries economic and social globalization positively affects obesity, implying the benefits of globalization leads to adverse impact on health. This is due to life style changes, availability of processed food and lack of public awareness. However, for the richer Asian nations globalization, particularly in its social dimension has negative impact on obesity. The study employs the Westerlund cointegrating techniques to investigate upon the long run causal association between obesity and globalization
I00|Public Private Competition|"We examine competition between a private and a public provider in markets for ""merit goods"" such as education, healthcare, housing, recreation, or culture. The private firm provides a high-price/high-quality variety of the good and serves richer individuals, while the public firm provides a low-price/low-quality variety and serves poorer individuals. We derive the private competitor's best response to changes in the public firm's price and quality level. This enables us to examine the distributional effects of government policies aimed at making publicly provided goods more affordable or increase their quality, and of changes to the government budget constraint that make publicly provided goods more expensive or decrease their quality. Our results have implications for the financing of the public supply of such goods, and for whether additional resources, if available, should be spent on reducing the price or enhancing the quality of publicly provided goods."
I00|Community Participation on Health Management: A Case of Dengue Fever Disease Control Program|Community Participation on Health Management: A Case of Dengue Fever Disease Control ProgramAnusorn Kunanusorn1 PhDChanita Chotisatiankul, ProfessorAbstract Dengue Fever disease has been one of public health problems in urban and rural areas of Thailand for many years. The Royal Thai Government has spent large amount of annual budget to controlling and combating the Dengue Fever disease nation-wide for years. Chiang Mai Province is one of areas where Dengue Fever has been a health problem for years. Number of Dengue Fever patients and dead cases in Chiang Mai were high as compared to other provinces. Public health management has been changed from centralization system to decentralization system where involvements from local and community were initiated since April 2001. McKean Hospital, a charitable hospital under The Foundation of Church of Christ in Thailand, had joined the Universal Health Coverage since May 2001. Besides other health programs, the hospital had set up a program on Dengue Fever control program incorporated with local public health center, temples, churches, schools, community leaders, and NGOs in responsible area since June 2001. In 13 villages, there are health-volunteers who were assigned to look after 5 to 10 households in health activities. The hospital which responsible for a certain area on health worked closely with these health volunteers. The health program on Dengue Fever had been operated successfully with community participation. With the policy of The Royal Thai Government on The Universal Health Coverage, McKean hospital had done successfully in eradication of Dengue Fever identified by decreasing number of patients and dead cases down to zero in its responsible area during five - year plan. Four strategies ? organizing, public relations, campaign, and monitoring and evaluation were managed in the program targeting to eradicate the Dengue Fever. With strong supports and participations, from all in community, there had been made the Dengue Fever control program reached its target successfully. McKean hospital was awarded an outstanding performance citation on ?Strong Community Supports for Dengue Fever Prevention? from The National Health Security Office (NHSO) of Thailand. The theoretical framework of this strategic operation was drafted, constructed, and operated by participations of community parties which could be tested statistically and use as a model to other health programs. 1 Rajamangala University of Technology Lanna, Faculty of Business Administration and Liberal Arts, MBA Program, Chiang Mai ThailandE-mail: a_kunanusorn@hotmail.com chanita_choti@hotmail.com
I00|Moving Forward: Near Peer Teaching Experience Of Undergraduate Medical Students|AbstractIntroduction Near Peer Teaching is a relatively novel and interesting experience and spreading across the world. Students who have experience peer teaching get an insight into their own abilities and often find it beneficial. Most studies have been performed in the west and there is paucity of data in our region.Objectives To shed the light on peer teaching experience at our college and the perceptions of the students as well as the role of peer teachers in the process. Methods Modified Clinical teaching preference Questionnaire (CTPQ) and Peer teaching experience questionnaire(PTEQ) were distributed to 1st year(n=34) and 6th year students(n=31) as learner group and to peer teachers(interns, n=6 and 6th yr students, n=7) at King Fahad Medical City, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences. These questionnaires address the teaching/learning peer teaching experience including the role of the peer teacher. Demographic data, age, gender, previous training and previous teaching/learning experience from peers were noted. The responded questionnaires were collected and anonymously analyzed, followed by statistical analysis.Results The majority of near peer teachers and near peer learners who were at different levels and in different groups and rotations responded positively to peer teaching provided that the content was relevant. As for the role of peer teachers, both groups identified information provider and facilitator as more suitable roles than as a role model, planner, assessor and resource developer.Conclusion Peer teaching can be a solution for medical schools that are facing increasing numbers of students and the shortage of efficient faculty members.
I00|The Need of Educating Adolescent Females of Karachi, Pakistan regarding Reproductive Health|Reproductive Health Awareness is not only neglected but also a taboo issue in Pakistan. The growing age women in Pakistan are hardly aware of reproductive health complications because of reasons linked to socio-cultural and religious factors which are the determinants of inadequate reproductive trends. Menstruation and menstrual practices, hygiene, reproductive tract infection, early pregnancies, infant death, mortality rate, women?s health security, child upbringing by inexperienced young mothers are the fundamental issues faced by Pakistani females and it is directly attached with ignorance of reproductive health know how. This study aimed to discover the need of educating adolescent females of city Karachi regarding reproductive health. The objective of this study was to acquire evidence on current awareness and insights on puberty and reproductive health needs. The research followed a quantitative and pragmatic approach enabling empirical analysis along with shedding light on the facts and figures. The data was collected through convenient sampling from four schools in the urban and rural areas of the city, Karachi and analyzed through descriptive statistic, linear regression and Kruskal Wallis Test. The analysis of the data indicated that awareness regarding reproductive health amongst adolescents is very minimal along with guidance and counseling provided to them at home and in school. The study highlighted the fact that education and medical facility available in schools have a significant impact on reproductive health awareness but the schools in Pakistan of both the rural and urban areas lack in mass awareness on reproductive health. The conclusion and observation leads to creating channels for imparting knowledge and awareness regarding reproductive health and its needs to the adolescents. It is recommended to create awareness amongst youth especially females by integrating it into school curriculum from grades 5 onwards or by conducting reproductive health awareness seminars in schools at different intervals.
I00|The effects of adult morbidity on work hours of children in Indonesia|In many developing countries, the burden of morbidity of prime-age adults is greater than in developed countries. Morbidity is distinct from other types of negative demographic shocks such as a loss of family members or dissolution of the family. Since the duration of illness and the possibility of recovery are generally difficult to anticipate, households may be more burdened in adjusting to the crisis caused by adult morbidity than they are to other types of demographic shocks or income shocks. Households with health shocks may use various coping strategies according to the nature of the costs imposed by those shocks. Among others, intra-household labor substitution may be an important coping strategy for households with limited access to other coping strategies. Moreover, the use of labor as insurance may have a negative impact on children?s educational attainment, which has serious implications for the future welfare of the poor in developing countries. Yet, studies on this link between adult morbidity and child labor are rare. Using two waves (2007, 2014) of Indonesian Family Life Survey data, this study investigates the effects of prime-age morbidity on work hours of children under 16 years old. This study is distinguished from few existing studies in the literature in that it controls for duration and severity of morbidity in the estimation of morbidity effects. Employing both self-reported health measures and measures of individuals? physical abilities to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), this study finds that work hours of children increase significantly when spouses of household heads suffer from long and severe illnesses. The effects are found to be greater for households where the spouses are not covered by any health insurance. Moreover, this study sheds light on gender roles within households coping with health shocks. In particular, it shows that work hours of male and female children increase more when household heads and their spouses suffer from health shocks, respectively. Again, the effects are found to be greater for households with no health insurance. This study is of special interests to policy makers trying to identify households and individuals who are more vulnerable to unexpected health shocks. The results imply that benefits of government expenditures on healthcare may be greater when the Indonesian government, with its limited resources, targets subsidies towards households suffering severe and long-term morbidity shocks.
I00|Systematic Review on Handles of Canes for the Elderly?s Daily Ambulation|Among mobility aids for elderly, cane is considered as the basics and the most frequently used by elders to assist in their daily mobility. This research aims to gain further knowledge and secure essential references for designing a cane for elderly through summarizing and analyzing literature written on the effect of using cane (especially cane handles) on elderly users. In the research, three online Databases Science Direct, Pubmed and Medscape were used to search for relevant papers using key terms of Cane, Age gait, Ergonomic Design cane and their synonyms. Articles were then filtered by reviewing the abstracts according to the inclusion criteria: (1) the paper had to be written in English language, (2) the paper had to be published between 2006 and 2016, (3) Studies that had involved participants aged 65 and above, (4) Studies that had involved walking stick/ cane as part of the sample, (5) The paper had to be an original study, (6) The paper is not a conference abstract. The selected articles were then filtered again by reviewing the whole article to define the relevancy of the article to the objective: (1) To study the effects of cane in elders? walking speed, cane height, (2) To study the effects of cane handle in elders, (3) To synthesize findings for application in future cane designs. As a result, a total of 385,081 articles were obtained from databases Pubmed, Medscope and Science Direct by using various search terms and their synonyms. 565 articles remained after confirming the search term and title was related to the objective. Only 25 articles that eligible for the inclusion and exclusion criteria were remained. Multi-functionality, comfort ability and suitability, inter-changeability and material used are important attributes in cane handle design. Considering the health status, preference and living environment of the elders, attributes such as the color, design, material used, size and shape should be studied before designing the cane. This study is conducted as a part of long-term project that ultimately designs a cane for the frail by referring to the results found in this study.
I00|Combined application of CFD and flipped classroom practices in improving knowledge acqusition for an undergraduate water resources engineering related course|Water resources management plays an important role in achieving sustainable development and economic growth. The physical aspect of water management is associated to water resources engineering, which is mainly founded in fluid mechanics. We coupled computer fluid dynamics (CFD) and flipped classroom practices to improve the learning and teaching processes of an undergraduate course focused on the experimental aspect of fluid mechanics in Peru, an upper-middle-income economy. Under the light of our results, we believe that such combined application also results on a viable alternative for universities that may face limitations on implementing a physical fluid mechanics laboratory, and encourages the formation of cooperative clusters of academic institutions around high-performing ones, to create common-pool fluid mechanics sources of educational information.
I00|Learn4Health, a European project creating health and food literacy through innovative interdisciplinary teaching and learning methods|Research documents what educators know: Healthy pupils and students are better prepared to learn (Kristjánsson et al., 2010; KL, 2015). This paper focuses on the thesis that innovative practical methods for learnings related to health and food issues create a rewarding educational experience for pupils and students while meeting academic standards in math, reading, science, social studies, art, music and more. For this reason and many more, we created Learn4Health, a project with interdisciplinary roots.Every day, in Universities across the globe, courses are being created to embrace blended learning approaches. Classes are now being developed with focus on more effective learning and better student outcomes (Jones, 2016). However, the concept of blended learning between higher educational institutions and public schools is relatively new. This paper outlines an exploratory study of blended learning initiated by Learn4Health, an Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership including twelve partners in total, representing 6 European countries (DK, ES, SI, NL, UK and LT). Each country is represented by one higher educational institution and one primary and/or secondary school.With point of departure in the globalized food systems consumers, especially children, being increasingly disconnected from understanding how and where their food is produced, the paper provides an overview of the development and expected implementation process of a new blended learning programme. The practical methods discussed are problem based learning, an experimental approach to learning involving hands on/learning by doing approach, and an ?open school? approach reaching out to local community enterprises and farms.Another Learn4Health key tool to be addressed in this paper is foodscapes, a multi-valenced concept centered around food environments. Finally, Learn4Health is about having fun and developing lifelong food literacy skills to understand the nature of food and our own impact as consumers and citizens on health status, environment, social and economic factors. Literacy is the cornerstone of the project, and we will thus discuss the concept?s relevance and impact on health in relation to Learn4Health.
I00|What happens to drinking when alcohol policy changes? A review of five natural experiments for alcohol taxes, prices, and availability|Abstract Natural experiments are an important alternative to observational and econometric studies. This paper provides a review of results from empirical studies of alcohol policy interventions in five countries: Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong, Sweden, and Switzerland. Major policy changes were removal of quotas on travelers’ tax-free imports and reductions in alcohol taxes. A total of 29 primary articles are reviewed, which contain 35 sets of results for alcohol consumption by various subpopulations and time periods. For each country, the review summarizes and examines: (1) history of tax/quota policy interventions and price changes; (2) graphical trends for alcohol consumption and liver disease mortality; and (3) empirical results for policy effects on alcohol consumption and drinking patterns. We also compare cross-country results for three select outcomes—binge drinking, alcohol consumption by youth and young adults, and heavy consumption by older adults. Overall, we find a lack of consistent results for consumption both within- and across-countries, with a general finding that alcohol tax interventions had selective, rather than broad, impacts on subpopulations and drinking patterns. Policy implications of these findings are discussed.
I00|The healthy immigrant paradox and health convergence|The health status of people is a precious commodity and central to economic, socio-political, and environmental dimensions of any country. Yet it is often the missing statistic in all general statistics, demographics, and presentations about the portrait of immigrants and natives. In this paper we are concerned with international migration and health outcomes in the host countries. Through a general literature review and examination of specific immigration countries, we provide insights into the Healthy Immigrant Paradox and the health assimilation of immigrants as we also elucidate selection and measurement challenges. While health is part of human capital, health assimilation is the mirror image of earnings assimilation. Namely, immigrants arrive with better health compared to natives and their health deteriorates with longer residence in the host country, converging to the health of natives or becoming even worse. A deeper understanding of immigrant health trajectories, and disparities with natives and other immigrants is of great value to societies and policymakers, who can design appropriate policy frameworks that address public health challenges, and prevent the health deterioration of immigrants.
I00|Agricultural Fires and Infant Health|Fire has long served as a tool in agriculture, but this practiceâ€™s human capital consequences have proved difficult to study. Drawing on data from satellites, air monitors, and vital records, we study how smoke from sugarcane harvest fires affects infant health in the Brazilian state that produces one-fifth of the worldâ€™s sugarcane. Because fires track economic activity, we exploit wind for identification, finding that late-pregnancy exposure to upwind fires decreases birth weight, gestational length, and in utero survival, but not early neonatal survival. Other fires positively predict health, highlighting the importance of disentangling pollution from economic activities that drive it.
I00|The Marriage Market, Labor Supply, and Education Choice|We develop an equilibrium life cycle model of education, marriage, labor supply, and consumption in a transferable utility context. Individuals start by choosing their investments in education anticipating returns in the marriage market and the labor market. They then match on the basis of the economic value of marriage and preferences. Equilibrium in the marriage market determines intrahousehold allocation of resources. Following marriage households (married or single) save, supply labor, and consume private and public commodities under uncertainty. Marriage thus has the dual role of providing public goods and offering risk sharing. The model is estimated using the British Household Panel Survey.
I00|Correlation, Consumption, Confusion, or Constraints: Why Do Poor Children Perform so Poorly?|Early developing and persistent gaps in child achievement by family income combined with the importance of adolescent skill levels for schooling and lifetime earnings suggest that a key component of intergenerational mobility is determined before individuals enter school. After documenting important differences in early child investments by family income, we study four leading mechanisms thought to explain these gaps: intergenerational ability correlation, consumption value of investment, information frictions, and credit constraints. We evaluate whether these mechanisms are consistent with other stylized facts related to the marginal returns on investments and the effects of parental income on child investments and skills.
I00|Communication Problems Between Administration and Other Medical Personnel in Health Institutions: Example of Public Heath Management|In 2002, Turkey’s starting health on the transformation process management of the health system and organization, service delivery, on factors such as human resources and finance context reflections, it was tried to be assessed in light of data obtained from secondary sources and analyzed. In this respect, a study carried out to identify communication problems between administrator and other medical personel in Public Health Department of Kahramanmaraş and survey applied on 77 healthcare personnel. Analyses of information obtained by the data acquisition tools carried out using SPSS 15.0 software package. A statistically significant difference weren’t found between communication problems between administrator and healthcare personnel toward perceptions and gender, age, profession, experience, employment period in the institution, level of education and receiving a training on communication. This difference were just found between communication problems between administrator and healthcare personnel toward perceptions and position. As a result, managers doesn’t have problem with other personnel about communication but other personnel found to have problem with managers about communication.
I00|Социальная эксклюзия людей с инвалидностью: успешные стратегии преодоления. Social exclusion of people with disabilities: succesful strategies for overcoming|Цель исследования – выявить общие элементы в успешных стратегиях преодоления социальной эксклюзии людьми с инвалидностью. Критерием успешности считается получение человеком с инвалидностью общественного признания в связи с осуществлением трудовой, общественной или иной деятельности. Было проведено десять биографических интервью с активными людьми с инвалидностью. Результаты исследования включают описание общих элементов успешных стратегий преодоления социальной эксклюзии людьми с инвалидностью для следующих видов деятельности: трудовая, общественная деятельность и получение профессионального образования. Также выявлялось, какие цели перед собой ставят респонденты, как планируют свою деятельность по преодолению социальной эксклюзии, какие ресурсы задействуют. Основной результат состоит в том, что главным в успешном преодолении социальной эксклюзии людьми с инвалидностью является желание и готовность к преодолению. Но за любым успешным преодолением стоит стратегия: адекватная оценка имеющихся ресурсов, взвешенный выбор средств и способов их использования, тактика задействования внешних структур. The purpose of this research is to identify the common elements of successful strategies in overcoming social exclusion. The success criterion is an obtaining of social recognition by people with disabilities due to their social, labor and other activities.For the purpose of the research we performed ten biographical interviews with people with disabilities living an active lifestyle. Results of the research include a description of common elements of successful strategies of social exclusion overcoming for the following activities of respondents: labor and social activities as well as obtaining professional education. In addition to that, we have identifed respondents’ objectives and how they plan their social exclusion overcoming activities and the resources they use.The main outcome of this research is that the key for successful social exclusion overcoming by people with disabilities is their willingness to overcome social exclusion. Each successful case of social exclusion overcoming has a strategy behind it: an adequate estimation of available resources, rational choice of tools and ways to use them and tactics for external structures utilization.
I00|People?s Awareness of Natural Disaster Risks: Differences across Regions and Generations|Abstract: Natural disasters have profound impacts on the sustainability of societies. Japan is a nation surrounded by the sea, and some regions are prone to suffer from natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis due to geographical characteristics. To develop and maintain a sustainable society, appropriate preventive measures should be incorporated into the social system, taking into consideration the people?s awareness of natural disaster risks. For this purpose, the present study investigated people?s sensitivity to risks induced by natural disasters, specifically focusing on a tsunami disaster. The investigation focused on the 2011 East Japan Earthquake off the Pacific Coast, and included five different participant groups: a group of residents (approximately 40 to70 years old) who directly suffered from the tsunami damage, two student groups (university and high school) located at the damaged regions, and two university student groups that were located in unaffected regions in Japan. The investigation was conducted by a questionnaire asking the participants to evaluate the safety or dangerousness of five different tsunami heights by using a five-point rating scale. The obtained data were subjected to a psychometric analysis calculating tsunami height thresholds regarded as safe. As a result, the lowest threshold of tsunami height regarded as safe was 0.94 meters for the group of residents in the damaged region. In contrast, the group of high school students in the damaged region revealed the highest threshold for the safe tsunami height, indicating that they do not feel danger until the tsunami height rises over 2.7 meters. Therefore, the residents in the damaged regions have the highest sensitivity to the risks posed by a tsunami, while the high school students in the damaged region have the lowest cautiousness despite the fact that they experienced the same disaster. Among the groups of university students, those who lived in the unaffected areas located furthest from the damaged region showed the highest threshold value of 2.56 meters, suggesting that they have very low risk sensitivity to tsunamis. These results clearly indicate that younger people and those who have not experienced a tsunami disaster are less conscious of the risks involved.Based on these differences in people?s risk awareness for natural disasters, appropriate preventive measures and educational programs should be incorporated into the social system in order to develop and maintain a sustainable society, and these should consider generational and environmental differences of residents.
I00|Web-Based Education Practices in Education of Nursing Students: Turkey Profile|This systematic review assesses Web Based Education (WBE) applications that will be used in the education of the nursing students in Turkey, and the effects of these applications on nursing education. This study was conducted using scientific search engines such as Ulakbim Medical Data Base, Turkish Medline Data Base, National Thesis Center, Turkish Citation Index, Turkish Psychiatry Index, Academic Index. As determined, keywords were searched in several combinations. A total of two theses that met the inclusion criteria were involved in the evaluation. This systematic review shows that the studies on this issue are very limited in terms of quantitative perspective but the results are positive. In this context, it is suggested that similar studies, in which WBE is planned in a way that it improves different knowledge and skills in nursing education, are conducted.
I00|Understanding the healthy lifestyle behaviors and life satisfaction of students and staff in a university|Being healthy is an important aspect in life satisfaction. The factors that effect the health status of an individual are named as the environmental factors, economical factors, socio-cultural factors, genetic factors, access to health services and life style. Since it can be controlled by the individual, lifestyle is a topic with great importance. Healthy lifestyle is defined as ?the individual?s control over her/his behaviors which can affect her/his health status and while orginising the daily activities, choosing the behaviors that are appropriate to her/his health status?. Healthy lifestyle behaviors are healthy nutrition, stress management, regular exercise, spiritual wellbeing, high quality interpersonal relations and taking the health responsibility. So, understanding the healthy lifestyle level and life satisfaction of individuals is important for health and education institutions, companies and governments to define their strategies accordingly. This quantitative study involves 205 Turkish individuals (students, academic staff and administrative staff) from a university in Istanbul. Data were obtained from self-administered questionnaires with 26 questions. The study examines the characteristics of the respondents regarding demographics, healthy lifestyle behaviors and life satisfaction. Some differences in sample?s healthy lifestyle dimensions were determined according to demographic variables after factor analysis, T-test, ANOVA and regression analysis. This research presents the opportunity for further qualitative research in healthy lifestyle habits among university students.
I00|Women in Turkey and Comparative Analysis of Women's Condition in Political Party Programs|If the condition of women in Turkey is evaluated in terms of education, violence, employment, and the like variables from the most general point of view, it will be right to start with an evaluation on the literacy condition according to gender above all because the results are striking. For example, as the year 2014, out of 2.663.096 illiterate people 2.208.336 are women (TUIK, 2014). This data is important as it refers to a huge gap between genders in terms of the level of education. Moreover, women's employment in Turkey is another important problematic area. For example, as of 2014 in Turkey the ratio of contribution of women to the labor force is 30.3%, the ratio of women's employment is 26.7%. (TUIK, 2014). Another problematic area shows itself in political representation. Although the ratio of women deputies in Turkey has increased over the years, the share of women deputies in the parliament has increased to 14.7% with the 2015 elections. Another problematic area that has been talked about and discussed most nowadays is violence against women. In the 2014 Domestic Violence Against Women in Turkey Research, across the country, the ratio of women who have experienced physical violence in any period of their lives by their husbands or ex-husbands is 36%. The ratio of women who have experienced emotional violence in any period of their lives is 44%; the ratio of physical or sexual violence experienced together is 38%.As seen, women in Turkey are in a disadvantaged position in terms of social, economic, political, and the like variables compared to men. The purpose of this study is to uncover how political parties deal with this disadvantaged position women are experiencing and the problems it creates and what kind of an approach they have to solve the problems determined. In other words, programs of political parties in the parliament will be content analyzed in terms of violence, education, employment, discrimination, equality, freedom, and the like and the results will be compared in the line with their respective parties. The basic reason why this study is conducted on examining political parties and their party programs is that political parties are the main incentive means that force the government to fulfill the desires and needs of the majority of the society and that party programs are a reference text that covers political party's ideology, priorities, and suggested solutions for the problematic areas.
I00|Quality of Life among Elderly in Elderly Clubs of Three Southern Border Provinces of Thailand|Aim: This study aimed to measure the quality of life (QoL) among elderly in strong elderly club of three southern border provinces and to identify its some determinant factors.Background: The insurgence of violence in three southern border provinces of Thailand that began in January 2004 is directly or indirectly affecting the lives of up to a million elderly living in Narathiwat, Pattani, and Yala. The violence included bomb attacks and daily killings of state officials and local villagers. Currently, the violence has increased in complexity, frequency and severity. Thai Government is concerned with providing for sustained social welfare for the aging population. The government implemented a policy of elderly club in all sub-districts, places where older persons in the local area can gather and enjoy social activities. Thus, it is believed that the elderly club is one strategy to improve well-being among elderly living in three southern border provinces. Methods: This was cross-sectional survey of a random sample of members of strong elderly club in three southern border provinces. The constructively QoL was measured on economic, social, environmental, health, and attitudinal domain. The study participants were interviewed at their elderly clubs. Descriptive statistics were used in this study. The analytical procedure of stepwise multiple regressions were conducted to predict QoL determinant.Findings: The results revealed that elderly who were member of the strong elderly club in three southern border provinces showed high level of QoL (Economic domain = 54.4%, Social domain = 76.8%, Environmental domain = 97.6%, Health domain = 69.6%, Attitudinal domain = 94.4% and Total QoL = 86.8%). The stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that the best fit model included six predictors of frequency of elderly club participation, having money saving, social capital on social network component, life satisfaction and happiness, feeling of safety from violence and age. All six predictors could explain 59.9% of the variance of QoL. Of the six predictor variables, a stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that frequency elderly club participation was most strongly related to QoL. Age was negative associated with QoL.Implications: The result has shown that active members have higher QoL than non-active members. Thus, the community must recognize the value of nurturing the well-being of the elderly in order to maintain an active club that enhances the quality of life of the elderly in the three southern border provinces.
I00|Accessing state funded services for children with disabilities: a strategic communication issue?|The quality of the social and academic integration of children with disabilities depends more and more on their parents' ability to ask for and gain access to various services. Confronted with numerous budget cuts, many social agencies are forced to reexamine their role and the array of services they can afford to offer. In this context, parents are faced with increasing paperwork, numerous go-betweens and complex negotiations when requesting services. Empirical studies dealing with utilization of services for persons with disabilities are scarce and focus mainly on socio-demographic variables associated with high or low rates of utilization. Some sholars have suggested that free and universal access to services that are state funded is a myth. In fact, a large number of complex processes could play the role af an ? expectancy cooling down ? process, through which parents who do not have access to services for their child are led to believe that they are responsible for this situation. A threefold research was conducted to shed light on this question: 1) a content analysis of various documents parents have to read and fill out when requesting services; 2) results of a survey conducted with a sample of 133 parents of children with a confirmed medical diagnostic of disability; 3) qualitative analysis of interviews involving 30 parents who had filled out requests for state funded services for their child. Results indicated that the processes involved in asking for services is complex and convoluted. Informations and forms prepared by governmental agencies require high level reading abilities. Parents who were successful in gaining access to appear to have better communication skills than those who were not. Implications of these results for the delivery of services for children with disabilities are discussed.
I00|Applying comprehensive nursing intervention to improve mother?s confidence and breastfeeding rate in China|Objective: To explore mother?s breastfeeding confidence and infant feeding methods after applying comprehensive nursing intervention among postpartum women in China.Methods: The study was a prospective clinical experimental research. Using cluster sampling method, the control group (n=331) received general care with verbal education. The treatment group (n=329) received ?comprehensive nursing intervention of exclusive breastfeeding?, include a practical handbook on breastfeeding, instruction of breastfeeding skills through face-to-face at bed-side in hospital. They completed questionnaires and Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale (BSES) before discharge. The Chinese version of BSES include 32 items, to evaluate mother?s breastfeeding confidence. The score range from 32 to 160, high score represent high breastfeeding confidence. The scale?s Cronbach?? was 0.93. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 17.0 (SPSS 17.0) was used. Results: Before discharge, the mean scores of BSES in the treatment group were 122.1±17.02, which was higher than that of the control group (113.07±18.99), p
I00|Integration of Precision Medicine into Family and Community Medicine Practice: Problems and Challenges|Introduction: Doctors have long observed that their patients vary in their symptoms, their side effects from medications, and their responses to treatments. Therefore, guidelines for treatment and medication were based on what worked for the average person. Precision Medicine (PM), on the other hand, matches each patient with the treatment that will work best for them. It takes individual variation into account: variation in genes, environment, lifestyle, and even in the microscopic organisms. Beyond treating diseases, PM includes approaches to diagnostics, prevention, and screening. PM includes the concept of individualized or personalized medicine at a more exact level through advances in science and technology, such as genetics and genomics sequencing. The technology to undertake Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) exists today, but many scientific, legal, economic and ethical problems and challenges about its practice remain unanswered. The active role and participation of family and community medicine specialty must be emphasized in regarding to big data management, geographical information systems, quality biomedical information and population based studies.Study Objectives: The study aimed to identify, describe and prioritize major implementation and challenges of PM model integration into family and community medicine practice.Materials and Methods: Internet literature survey has been conducted to identify and define the pertinent study independent (6 main physicians ?characteristics) and dependent variables (28 problems and 15 challenges). A cross-sectional analytical design was adopted in which the multi-stage random sampling technique has recruited 300 physicians from 3 different medical colleges and 6 hospitals and they were requested to complete a self-administrated pre-coded questionnaire. The simple scoring system was used for priority assignment of PM implementation problems and challenges. The quality of the collected data was ensured and sufficient descriptive and analytic statistical analyses were done.Results: Top priority PM problems were pharmaceutical industry (1st), PM costs (2nd) and regulation of diagnostic tests (3rd). Meanwhile, the most important challenges were research issues (1st), knowledge systems (2nd) and ethical practice (3rd).Conclusion: The future of medicine based on PM is promising and a value-based healthcare model. While there is much optimism, there is also a great need for changing the current health system, solving most of the existing problems and meeting the facing challenges. What is needed now is a broad research program to encourage creative approaches to PM, test them rigorously, and ultimately use them to build the evidence base needed to guide clinical practice.
I00|The affective dynamics of hedonic versus healthy food choices: Making salient post-consumption affect promotes healthy food choices|This research provides original evidence for the impact of anticipated affects on hedonic versus healthy food choices. Study 1 and 2 reveal the asymmetric affective dynamics of hedonic and healthy food choices and pave the way for our behavioral prediction: People anticipate more instant than post-consumption satisfaction when choosing hedonic over healthy food, whereas they anticipate more post-consumption than instant satisfaction when choosing healthy over hedonic food. In Study 3, the experiment proper, we further find that orienting people’s attention on immediate post-consumption affects helps them redirecting their choice towards a more healthy food option. These findings suggest that a simple affect-focused manipulation may prove very effective in increasing healthier choices. The role of anticipated affect in inter-temporal choices is discussed.
I00|What matters in type 2 diabetes mellitus oral treatment? A discrete choice experiment to evaluate patient preferences|Aims The aim of this empirical study is to evaluate patient preferences for different characteristics of oral type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment. As T2DM treatment requires strict adherence, patient needs and preferences should be taken into consideration. Methods Based on a qualitative and quantitative analysis, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) was applied to identify patient preferences. Apart from six identical attributes (adjustment of glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], prevention of hypoglycemia, risk of genital infection, risk of gastrointestinal problems, risk of urinary tract infection, and weight change), one continuous variable of either “additional healthy life years” (AHY) or “additional costs” attribute (AC) was included. The DCE was conducted using a fractional factorial design, and the statistical data analysis used random effect logit models. Results In total, N = 626 (N = 318 AHY + N = 308 AC) T2DM patients participated in the survey. The estimation revealed a clear dominance for prevention of hypoglycemia (coefficient 0.937) and adjustment of HbA1c (coefficient 0.541). The attributes, “additional healthy life years” (coefficient 0.458) or “additional costs” (coefficient 0.420), were in the middle rank and both of significant impact. The side effects, risk of genital infection (coefficient 0.301), risk of gastrointestinal problems (coefficient 0.296), and risk of urinary tract infection (coefficient 0.241) followed in this respective order. Possible weight change (coefficient 0.047) was of less importance (last rank) to the patients in this evaluation. Conclusions These survey results demonstrate how much a (hypothetical) T2DM oral treatment characteristic affects the treatment decision. The preference data can be used for risk–benefit assessment, cost-benefit assessment, and the establishment of patient-oriented evidence. Understanding how patients perceive and value different aspects of diabetes oral treatment is vital to the optimal design and evaluation of treatment options. The present results can be an additional source of information for design, assessment, and decision in T2DM treatment regimes. As such, more effective and efficient care of patients can be achieved, thereby increasing adherence.
I00|The costs and consequences of obesity in Germany: a new approach from a prevalence and life-cycle perspective|Abstract With the steadily growing health burden of obesity in Germany, the measuring and quantification of its costs and relevant economic consequences have become increasingly important. The usual quantifications via previous cost-of-illness approaches mostly have several weaknesses, e.g., applying “indirect methods” by using “population-attributable fractions” to identify parts of costs that can be accrued to obesity, second using highly aggregated data and third often only displaying part of the costs. This article presents a new approach and a new estimation of the cost and consequences of obesity in Germany using claims data from a German health insurance company. A sample of 146,000 individuals was analyzed with both a prevalence and a life-cycle focus on the cost and consequences of obesity. With additional data sets, we calculate the deaths per year due to obesity, the excess costs per year and several intangible consequences usually referred to as “pain and suffering”. Our results show that the cost estimations of obesity in Germany so far have been largely underestimated. The annual direct costs of obesity in Germany amount to approximately €29.39 billion and the indirect costs to an additional €33.65 billion. A total of 102,000 subjects die prematurely each year because of obesity, and there is a significant excess of unemployment, long-term nursing care, and pain and suffering due to obesity. From a lifetime perspective, every obese man is equal to an additional burden of €166,911 and each woman of €206,526 for the social security system in Germany. Obesity due to unhealthy eating is thus about to replace tobacco consumption in terms of costs and consequences as the main hazardous lifestyle factor and thus should be more intensively focussed by public health policy.
I00|Job-Related Well-Being Through the Great Recession|We study how job-related well-being (measured by Warr’s ‘Enthusiasm’ and ‘Contentment’ scales) altered through the Great Recession, and how this is related to changing job quality. Using nationally representative data for Britain, we find that job-related well-being was stable between 2001 and 2006, but then declined between 2006 and 2012. We report relevant changes in job quality. In modelling the determinants of job-related well-being, we confirm several previously-studied hypotheses and present some new findings: downsizing, work re-organisation, decreased choice, and linking pay to organisational performance each reduce well-being; indicators of skills challenge in jobs have more of a positive association with Enthusiasm than with Contentment, while effort has a more negative association with Contentment than with Enthusiasm. Our estimates are largely orthogonal to the effects of personality traits and demographic controls on well-being. Using a standard decomposition, we find that the 2006–2012 fall in job-related well-being is partly accounted for by accelerations in the pace of workplace change, rising job insecurity, increased effort and changing participation.

I00|Estimating Capabilities with Structural Equation Models: How Well are We Doing in a ‘Real’ World?|Abstract Measuring capabilities is a major challenge for the operationalization of the capability approach. Structural equation models (SEM) are being increasingly used as one possible methodology for estimating capabilities, but a certain skepticism remains about their appropriateness. In this paper, we perform a unique simulation experiment for testing the validity of such estimators. Using an agent-based modeling tool, we simulate a ‘real’ life scenario with individuals of heterogeneous characteristics and behaviors, having different capability sets, and making different decisions. We then run a SEM (MIMIC) model on the data generated in this simulated world to estimate the individual capabilities. Thus our data generating process is completely disconnected with the econometric model used for estimation. Our results support the idea that SEM can coherently estimate the true capabilities. We find that the linear predictor from the structural part of the SEM provides better results than the ‘classical’ factor scores based on the full model.
I00|Returns to education in Sri Lanka: a pseudo-panel approach| This study employs a pseudo-panel approach to estimate the returns to education among income earners in Sri Lanka. Pseudo-panel data are constructed from nine repeated cross sections of Sri Lanka's Labor Force Survey data from 1997 to 2008, for workers born during 1953--1974. The results show that for males, one extra year of education increases monthly earnings by about 5% using the pseudo-panel estimation rather than 9% as in the ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimation. This indicates that not controlling for unobservables such as ability and motivation biases the OLS estimation of returns upwards by about 4% on average, driven mainly by what happens in urban areas. It also suggests that males with higher ability seem to be acquiring more years of education. This is contrary to what has been observed recently in countries such as Thailand [Warunsiri, S., and R. McNown. 2010. “The Return to Education in Thailand: A Pseudo-Panel Approach.” World Development 38 (1): 1616--1625], where the opportunity cost of education seems to be high, such that high-ability individuals leave education for the labour market.
I00|A Review of the Literature on Well-Being in Italy: A Human Development Perspective| In recent years, a large literature on indicators of well-being and quality of life has emerged. While all these indicators are an important step toward the recognition of well-being as a multidimensional phenomenon, they are often rooted in very different approaches—when we can identify a relevant “theoretical” framework—such as basic needs, happiness, or capability approach, and vary significantly in terms of statistical quality. This paper has a twofold objective: (1) to analyze the state of the art of the literature on well-being in Italy; (2) to examine this literature from a human development perspective. Thus, we investigate the pros and cons of the existing approaches/indicators and assess whether they are rooted in the human development approach. This is deemed necessary for the final goal of constructing a context-based indicator of human development for Italy and its territorial units.
I00|Unhappy Cities|There are persistent differences in self-reported subjective well-being across US metropolitan areas, and residents of declining cities appear less happy than others. Yet some people continue to move to these areas, and newer residents appear to be as unhappy as longer-term residents. While historical data on happiness are limited, the available facts suggest that cities that are now declining were also unhappy in their more prosperous past. These facts support the view that individuals do not maximize happiness alone but include it in the utility function along with other arguments. People may trade off happiness against other competing objectives.
I00|Gender Roles and Medical Progress|Maternal mortality was the second-largest cause of death for women in childbearing years until the mid-1930s in the United States. For each death, 20 times as many mothers suffered pregnancy-related conditions, which made it hard for them to engage in market work. Between 1930 and 1960 there was a remarkable improvement in maternal health. We argue that this development, by enabling women to reconcile work and motherhood, was essential for the joint rise in women’s labor force participation and fertility over this period. We also show that the diffusion of infant formula played an important auxiliary role.
I00|I Feel Good At Home And With Myself: How Does Dyadic Companionship Within The Family Affect Adolescents’ Well-Being?|Research has widely underscored that the quality of the parent-child relationship affects the success with which young people negotiate the major tasks of adolescence, the extent to which they become involved in risk behaviors, and their ability to establish close relationships. Literature has also increasingly shown the effects played by parents’ marital relationship on the development of their adolescent children. Starting from a view of family as a social organization, the purpose of this study was to investigate the kind of relations existing between dyadic family and both adolescents’ individual and family well-being. Participants were 118 family triads (father, mother, son/daughter) with an adolescent child, for a total of 354 people. Findings showed that marital relationship companionship was not significantly related to adolescents’ well-being, whereas parentchild relationship was. Moreover, individual adolescents’ well-being was related to both fatherchild and mother-child companionship whreas adolescents’ family well-being was only related to father-child companionship.
I00|Determinants Of Blood Donation: A Study On Organizational Satisfaction|The present research aims at investigating if motivations and social norms can determine satisfaction with organization – understood as an indicator of organizational well-being – in blood donation. Moreover, this study analyses the relations of organizational satisfaction on integration in the organization and identification with it in order to pursue research on prosocial behaviour volunteer retention. 2464 blood donors were contacted. The present work has important applicative implications as it can give guidance to blood donation organizations regarding factors determining attraction and maintenance of donors.
I00|What Explains The Difference In The Effect Of Retirement On Health? Evidence From Global Aging Data|This paper analyzes the reasons for differences in the estimated effect of retirement on health in previous studies. We investigate these differences by focusing on the analysis methods used by these studies. Using various health indexes, numerous researchers have examined the effects of retirement on health. However, there are no unified views on the impact of retirement on various health indexes. Consequently, we show that the choice of analysis method is one of the key factors in explaining why the estimated results of the effect of retirement on health differ. Moreover, we reâ€ estimate the effect of retirement on health by using a fixed analysis method controlling for individual heterogeneity and endogeneity of the retirement behavior. We analyze the effect of retirement on health parameters, such as cognitive function, selfâ€ report of health, activities of daily living (ADL), depression, and body mass index in eight countries. We find that the effects of retirement on selfâ€ report of health, depression, and ADL are positive in many of these countries.
I00|Abgrenzung und Typisierung ländlicher Räume|In diesem Working Paper wird eine Methodik zur Abgrenzung und Typisierung ländlicher Räume entwickelt, um diese Räume anhand von Daten der amtlichen Statistiken beschreiben und analysieren zu können. Hierzu werden zwei Dimensionen definiert, jeweils mit mehreren Indikatoren operationalisiert und mit Hilfe einer Hauptkomponentenanalyse zu je einem Index aggregiert. Zum einen wird die Dimension Ländlichkeit genutzt, um ländliche von nicht-ländlichen Regionen abzugrenzen und um innerhalb dieser Raumkategorie zwischen eher ländlichen und sehr ländlichen Räumen zu unterscheiden. Die Ländlichkeit ist tendenziell umso ausgeprägter, je geringer die Siedlungsdichte, je höher der Anteil land- und forstwirtschaftlicher Fläche, je höher der Anteil der Ein- und Zweifamilienhäuser, je geringer das Bevölkerungspotenzial und je schlechter die Erreichbarkeit großer Zentren ist. Zum zweiten wird die Dimension sozioökonomische Lage verwendet, um die ländlichen Regionen in solche mit guter und weniger guter sozioökonomischer Lage auszudifferenzieren. Damit wird die Erkenntnis aufgegriffen, dass mit Ländlichkeit keineswegs automatisch sozioökonomische Problemlagen einhergehen. Durch die Kombination beider Dimensionen entstehen so neben dem nicht-ländlichen Raumtyp vier Typen. Im Ergebnis der Abgrenzung leben 57,2 % der Einwohner Deutschlands in ländlichen Räumen auf 91,3 % der Fläche. Die Bevölkerungsanteile der vier ländlichen Raumtypen sind relativ ausgeglichen und liegen zwischen ca. 11 und 16 %.
I00|The Misty Grail: The Search for a Comprehensive Measure of Development and the Reasons for GDP Primacy|" type=""main""> Recent decades have seen a flurry of new indicators to measure economic progress, but none of them has succeeded in replacing GDP. This article seeks to explain this outcome and to contribute to the debate about composite indicators versus a dashboard approach. To this end, it reviews some of the most popular alternatives to GDP (the Human Development Index, the Genuine Progress Indicator, the Happy Planet Index, and an environmentally corrected GDP), focusing on their conceptual foundations rather than on their statistical consistency as most of the literature does. It is shown that most of these measures are theoretically inconsistent; the exception is the environmentally corrected GDP, but since this too has failed to replace GDP, inconsistency must be only one reason behind the limited use of alternative measures. The author argues that the main reason for GDP's primacy is that GDP is better suited to reflect the goals of capitalist market economies. This implies that constructing composite indicators as alternatives to GDP will be pointless as long as the current preference system has not changed to include environmental or social goals. The author also suggests that for this purpose a dashboard approach, which provides different social groups with intelligible quantitative instruments, may be preferable to the use of composite indicators."
I00|Can Iron-Fortified Salt Control Anemia? Evidence from Two Experiments in Rural Bihar|Iron deficiency anemia is frequent among the poor worldwide. While it can be prevented with the appropriate supplement or food fortification, these programs often do not consistently reach the poorest. This paper reports on the impact of a potential strategy to address iron deficiency anemia in rural areas: double fortified salt (DFS) - salt fortified with iron and iodine. We conducted a large-scale experiment in rural Bihar. In 200 villages, randomly selected out of 400, DFS was introduced at a price that was half the regular retail price for DFS. After two years, we find no evidence that either selling DFS in villages or providing it for free directly to households has an economically meaningful or statistically significant impact on hemoglobin, anemia, physical health, cognition or mental health. For the sales experiment, we can reject at the 95% level a reduction of 2.5 percentage points in the fraction anemic in the entire sample, and 3.7 percentage points among those who were previously anemic. Using an IV strategy, we find a statistically significant, though relatively small, increase in hemoglobin and reduction in the fraction anemic for adolescents, a subgroup that has responded well to supplements and fortification in earlier studies. These disappointing results are explained both by relatively low take up and by low impact of DFS even when consumed more regularly for the majority of the population.
I00|Interrelationship of Incivility, Cynicism and Turnover Intention|Workplace incivility being a deviant behavior is acknowledged by its low intensity, moreover its tendency to implicate detrimental conducts; given the broader spectrum of mistreatment. Subjected study was intended to observe the impact of workplace incivility in association to the mediatory role of cynicism over the subsequent turnover intents of nurses in selected healthcare settings of Pakistan. The survey conducted on 395 nurses depicted a positive correlation of workplace incivility towards the progression of cynical attitudes and turnover intents in the subjected profession. The study further signifies the impact of cynicism as a mediator, over the intentions of an individual to quit the employing healthcare setting. The multiple regression tests carry out in hierarchical manner, on the selected variables signified the impact of workplace incivility over the cynicism and turnover intention at respective variances of (R2 = 0.061) and (R2 = 0.050). In comparison to which cynicism exclusively poses a substantial variance of (R2 = 0.156) over the intents to leave. While considering workplace incivility as instigator and cynicism in capacity of a mediator, a cumulative variance of (R2 = 0.182) was observed in relation to an individual quitting the job. Moreover, both of the variables are significant predictors to their resultant variable (P
I00|Features of Vocational Education Management in the Region|The relevance of the article is reasoned by the increasing role of vocational education in the regional economy. In modern conditions, vocational education is considered as a systemic integrity of integrative interaction of education, science and industry, aimed at experts’ forming who is ready for the life - long learning, capable to a certain type of professional activities, self-organization and competitiveness on the labor market. The purpose of the article is to find out management features of vocational education in the region. The leading method is the method of action research, allowing to obtain new knowledge about the management of vocational education in the region and to suggest methods for its optimization to improve the competitiveness of vocational education institutions in the international educational market and to obtain qualitatively new results in the process of vocational training. The article reveals the essence of management of vocational education in the region; clarifies trends in the management of vocational education in the region; identifies problems in the management of vocational education in the region, defines and justifies their solution methods (the implementation of modern financial and economic mechanisms of vocational education institutions’ activities; development of normative-legal support of activities of vocational education institutions; the creation of new adaptive forms and mechanisms of management of vocational education in the region; making, implementation and development of quality management systems of vocational education). Article Submissions can be useful for research and teaching staff of vocational education system, for specialists of education management authorities and regional authorities.
I00|Mediating Role of Organizational Cynicism in Relationship between Role Stressors and Turnover Intention: Evidence from Healthcare Sector of Pakistan|The study determines the consequent implications of role stressors over the turnover intentions of nurses in the subjected healthcare systems, while considering organizational cynicism as a mediator. The extant survey-based study was carried out based on path analysis, considered to validate a hypothetical causal model concluded upon the variables mentioned prior. Validity, of which was substantiated through the information accrued from 395 registered nurses of Rawalpindi and Islamabad; the twin cities of Pakistan. The study advocates of the directly proportionate relationship between the mentioned predicators and the resultant variable, in a signifi cant manner, and too proposes the partially mediatory eff ect of organizational cynicism, when taken into consideration. Moreover, in particular what adds up to the distinctiveness of the present manuscript is the meagre amount of research carried out on uncivil practices and cynicism observed in nursing, which itself is one of the most overlooked professions in the developing country; Pakistan. The study in suggestive manner opts for inducing healthy work practices to ensure safer work environment for nurses to remain employed under, for longer tenures
I00|What happens when a woman wins an election? Evidence from close races in Brazil|We analyze close elections between male and female mayoral candidates in Brazilian municipalities to provide novel evidence on the role of women as policymakers. Using an objective measure of corruption based on random government audits, we find that female mayors are less likely to engage in corruption compared to male mayors. We also find that female mayors hire fewer temporary public employees than male mayors during the electoral year and tend to attract less campaign contributions when running for reelection. Moreover, our results show that female mayors have a lower reelection probability than male mayors. We interpret our findings as suggesting that male incumbents are more likely to engage in strategic behavior and this improves their electoral performance. Other explanations receive less support from the data.
I00|Labor market consequences of childhood onset type 1 diabetes|This paper examines the effect of the onset of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) before 15 years of age on labor market outcomes and contributes to the literature on effects of childhood health on adult socioeconomic status. Using national Swedish socioeconomic register data 1991–2010 for 2485 individuals born 1972–1978 with onset of T1DM in 1977–1993, we find that T1DM in childhood has a negative effect on labor market outcomes later in life. Part of the T1DM effect is channeled through occupational field which may be related to both choice and opportunities. Although the magnitude of the effect is only directly generalizable to illnesses with similar attributes as T1DM, the results suggest that causality in the often observed correlation between health and socioeconomic status, at least partly, is explained by an effect running from health to earnings. This has implications for research and policy on strategies to reduce socioeconomic-related health inequality. Our findings also shed light on productivity losses, measured by employment status and earnings due to childhood onset T1DM, which have implications for both the individual and society.
I00|Born to Lead? The Effect of Birth Order on Noncognitive Abilities|We study the effect of birth order on personality using Swedish population data. Earlier-born men are more emotionally stable, persistent, socially outgoing, willing to assume responsibility, and able to take initiative than later borns. Firstborn children aremore likely to bemanagers and to be in occupations requiring leadership ability, social ability, and Big Five personality traits.We find a significant role for the sex composition within the family. When investigating possible mechanisms, we find that negative effects of birth order are driven by postnatal environmental factors. We also find evidence of lower parental human capital investments in later-born children.
I00|Effect of type 1 diabetes on school performance in a dynamic world: new analysis exploring Swedish register data| This paper investigates if the effect of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) on school performance, documented in prior research, has changed in more recent birth cohorts of children using national Swedish population register data. The issue is of interest because management and treatment of the disease have improved over the last decades and, furthermore, because of changes in the educational grading system. Despite these changes, data indicate a persistent negative effect of T1DM on compulsory and upper secondary school grades with a standardized effect size of −0.109 and −0.070, respectively, and the results appear only marginally smaller compared to earlier findings in cohorts completing school under the previous grading system. Moreover, the results are consistent for alternative model specifications and econometric estimation strategies. Whereas access to new treatment technologies and improved diabetes management strategies has reduced the burden of diabetes in daily life, the results from this study indicate that continued efforts are needed to improve the situation in school for children with T1DM to prevent potential long-term socio-economic consequences.
I00|Waist circumference, body mass index and employment outcomes|Body mass index (BMI) is an imperfect measure of body–fat and recent studies provides evidence in favour of replacing BMI with waist circumference (WC). Hence, I investigate how WC and BMI are associated with employment status in England. I use fifteen rounds of the Health Survey for England (1998-2013), which has measures of employment status in addition to measured height, weight and WC. WC and BMI were entered as continuous variables and obesity as binary variables defined using both WC and BMI. I used multivariate models controlling for a set of covariates. I found significant and negative associations between both WC and BMI with employment in women. In men, the coefficient of WC was significant, but not BMI. In both men and women my findings suggest that the association of WC with employment was of greater magnitude, than the association between BMI and employment. To explore whether any difference in the association was mitigated by conventional instrumental variables methods I reran the analysis using the “workhorse” in analyses of BMI and employment. I.e. instrumenting for WC and BMI based on WC and BMI of a biological family member. Significant endogeneity was detected for both WC and BMI. The finding, that the impact of WC on employment was larger than BMI, did not persist in the IV-models. Although the IV models found significant impacts of obesity on employment, they were not more pronounced when WC was used to measure obesity, compare to BMI.
I00|Partner Choice, Investment in Children, and the Marital College Premium|"We construct a model of household decision-making in which agents consume a private and a public good, interpreted as children's welfare. Children's utility depends on their human capital, which depends on the time their parents spend with them and on the parents' human capital. We first show that as returns to human capital increase, couples at the top of the income distribution should spend more time with their children. This in turn should reinforce assortative matching, in a sense that we precisely define. We then embed the model into a transferable utility matching framework with random preferences, a la Choo and Siow (2006), which we estimate using US marriage data for individuals born between 1943 and 1972. We find that the preference for partners of the same education has significantly increased for white individuals, particularly for the highly educated. We find no evidence of such an increase for black individuals. Moreover, in line with theoretical predictions, we find that the ""marital college-plus premium"" has increased for women but not for men."
I00|Can Cash Transfers Help Households Escape an Intergenerational Poverty Trap?|Many poor households in developing countries are liquidity-constrained. As a result, they may under-invest in the human capital of their children. We provide new evidence on the long-term (10-year) effects of cash transfers using data from Ecuador. Our analysis is based on two separate sources of data and two identification strategies. First, we extend the results from an experiment that randomly assigned children under the age of 6 years to “early” or “late” treatment groups. Although the early treatment group received twice as much in total transfers, we find no difference between children in the two groups on performance on a large number of tests. Second, we use a regression discontinuity design exploiting the fact that a “poverty index” was used to determine eligibility for transfers. We focus on children who were just-eligible and just-ineligible for transfers when they were in late childhood, and compare their school attainment and work status 10 years later. Transfers increased secondary school completion, but the effects are small, between 1 and 2 percentage points from a counterfactual school completion rate of 75 percent. We conclude that any effect of cash transfers on the inter-generational transmission of poverty in Ecuador is likely to be modest.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
I00|Decision Making And Saint Petersburg Paradox: Focusing On Heuristic Parameters, Considering The Non-Ergodic Context And The Gambling Risks|The Saint Petersburg Paradox is still a contemporary issue because of the great impact on the probabilistic theory and decision-making. This article proposes some hints on avoiding the trap of the infinite expected value (EV). The highly stochastic mechanism and its EV have always to be contextualized in the limited period where we take our choices taking into account all possible limitations deriving from the theory (including the non-ergodic features and some inappropriate consequences we may attribute to the EV). This contextualisation is one of the most important factors to consider especially when we deal with infinite quantity coming from models that may misrepresent our field of application and therefore generate paradoxes.

I00|Can human capital variables be technology changing? An empirical test for rural households in Burkina Faso|In this article, we assess the role that human capital indicators play as technology changing variables in smallholder households in Burkina Faso. We use recent nationally representative household level data and regression analysis to empirically assess the role of weight-for-height, formal education and age of adult household members active in agriculture, in smallholder production. Recognizing the endogeneity of weight-for-height and variable inputs, we use instrumental variables regression and model the coefficients in the production function as functions of human capital variables. Our results reveal that human capital indicators can indeed be considered as technology-changing affecting both the slope and the intercept of the production function. Weight-for-height enhances returns to land but negatively affects returns to female labor. Formal education enhances the productivity of male labor but negatively affects returns to land. Differentiating households by landholding quintiles reveals that the technology changing role of human capital variables is much more evident for households with larger landholdings.

Differentiating households by landholding quintiles reveals that the technology changing role of human capital variables is much more evident for households with larger landholdings.
I00|Are pregnant women happier? Racial and ethnic differences in the relationship between pregnancy and life satisfaction in the United States|Abstract This paper examines the relationship between pregnancy and life satisfaction for US women of childbearing age using a large sample from the 2005 to 2009 waves of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The results show strong differences by race and ethnicity. Pregnancy has a significant positive correlation with happiness for Whites and Hispanics, but no relationship for Blacks. This differential in the marginal effect of pregnancy is in addition to a general decrease in satisfaction for Black women, independent of being pregnant. The results cannot be explained by differences in other demographics such age, income, education, or physical health status. Within each racial/ethnic group, the results are consistent across different categories for all these characteristics. Racial and ethnic differences in the effects of pregnancy on support from others can partly explain this result. For Whites and Hispanic women, pregnancy increases their feelings of social and emotional support from others, while pregnant Black women report lower levels of social and emotional support than non-pregnant Black women.
I00|Parental health and child behavior: evidence from parental health shocks|Abstract This study examines the importance of parental health in the development of child behavior during early childhood. Our analysis is based on child psychometric measures from a longitudinal German dataset, which tracks mothers and their newborns up to age six. We identify major changes in parental health (shocks) and control for a variety of initial characteristics of the child including prenatal conditions. The results are robust to placebo regressions of health shocks that occur after the outcomes are measured. Our findings point to negative effects of maternal health shocks on children’s emotional symptoms, conduct problems and hyperactivity. We estimate that maternal health shocks worsen outcomes by as much as 0.9 standard deviations. In contrast, paternal health seems to be less relevant to children’s behavioral skills.
I00|From Oil to Non-Oil: How are Private Higher Education Institutions Confronting with Quality Issues?|Plummeting oil prices have been a cause of concern for Omani economy and the state is strategizing to provide impetus to non-oil sectors. One of the prime sectors which are being given the desired push is that of higher education wherein private sector is being given ample opportunity to further the economy of Oman by contributing towards its human capital. Private higher educational educations in Oman have collaboration with international university partners. However, issues of quality management remain to be addressed. The key contribution of the paper lies in the emphasis on the role and significance of the international university partners in furtherance of quality management in these private higher educational institutions. For the present purpose, four metrics of quality assurance shall be taken into consideration; viz. academic quality, infrastructure, research collaboration and professional development. Document review shall remain the edifice for research evidence.
I00|Interactions Between Family and School Environments: Evidence on Dynamic Complementarities?|This paper explores whether conditions during early childhood affect the productivity of later human capital investments. We use Romanian administrative data to ask if the benefit of access to better schools is larger for children who experienced better family environments because their parents had access to abortion. We combine regression discontinuity and differences-in-differences designs to estimate impacts on a high-stakes school-leaving exam. Although we find that access to abortion and access to better schools each have positive impacts, we do not find evidence of significant interactions between these shocks. While these results suggest the absence of dynamic complementarities in human capital formation, survey data suggest that they may also reflect behavioral responses by students and parents.
I00|Can Iron-Fortified Salt Control Anemia? Evidence from Two Experiments in Rural Bihar|Iron deficiency anemia is frequent among the poor worldwide. While it can be prevented with the appropriate supplement or food fortification, these programs often do not consistently reach the poorest. This paper reports on the impact of a potential strategy to address iron deficiency anemia in rural areas: double fortified salt (DFS) - salt fortified with iron and iodine. We conducted a large-scale experiment in rural Bihar. In 200 villages, randomly selected out of 400, DFS was introduced at a price that was half the regular retail price for DFS. After two years, we find no evidence that either selling DFS in villages or providing it for free directly to households has an economically meaningful or statistically significant impact on hemoglobin, anemia, physical health, cognition or mental health. For the sales experiment, we can reject at the 95% level a reduction of 2.5 percentage points in the fraction anemic in the entire sample, and 3.7 percentage points among those who were previously anemic. Using an IV strategy, we find a statistically significant, though relatively small, increase in hemoglobin and reduction in the fraction anemic for adolescents, a subgroup that has responded well to supplements and fortification in earlier studies. These disappointing results are explained both by relatively low take up and by low impact of DFS even when consumed more regularly for the majority of the population.
I00|Trends in the distribution of income between labor and capital: Factors, consequences and problems of adjustment|Inverse cyclical relations of trends in distribution of GDP between labor and capital components of value added (between compensation of employees, on the one hand, and gross operating surplus plus gross mixed income, on the other hand) to the trends in supply of labor and capital in the economy are elaborated in the article. Long waves and globalization influence on the economic policy of the USA and on personal income distribution in the country as well as economic, social and political consequences of such distribution are subjects of in-depth analysis. Adjustment of income distribution is presented in the article as a key problem to be solved by economics and form a part of the economic strategy adequate to the realities of the 21st century.
I00|Worms at Work: Long-run Impacts of a Child Health Investment|This study estimates long-run impacts of a child health investment, exploitingcommunity-wide experimental variation in school-based deworming. The programincreased labor supply among men and education among women, with accompanyingshifts in labor market specialization. Ten years after deworming treatment, menwho were eligible as boys stay enrolled for more years of primary school, work17% more hours each week, spend more time in nonagricultural self-employment,are more likely to hold manufacturing jobs, and miss one fewer meal per week.Women who were in treatment schools as girls are approximately one quarter morelikely to have attended secondary school, halving the gender gap. Theyreallocate time from traditional agriculture into cash crops and nonagriculturalself-employment. We estimate a conservative annualized financial internal rateof return to deworming of 32%, and show that mass deworming may generate more infuture government revenue than it costs in subsidies.
I00|Child Disability, Children’s Time with Mother and Maternal Employment|Empirical estimates of the effect of child disability on maternal employment vary considerably as the disability definitions are changed. Literature is also constrained by the limited availability of information about presence and severity of health conditions of children. Hence, researchers construct disability index based on the parent-reported health status of the child. In this paper, we construct a Disability definition based on the framework provided by ICF-CY(2007). Disability definition was constructed using the presence of a physician-diagnosed health condition reported by the parents. Powers (2003) who argued that parent’s report of the health limitation of the child may be jointly determined by the labor market outcomes of the parents. However, when parents are asked to report any diagnosis of specific health condition, the report can be assumed to be objective. In the absence of administrative record of the diagnosis of child health, this measure is the closest proxy. We find that child disability variables do not affect the labor force participation of the single mothers or married mothers. However, married mothers’ with lower educational attainment increase their weekly work hours despite the presence of a child with either impairment or activity limitation. Weekly labor supply of the married mothers with a greater level of education is not perturbed by the presence of a disabled child.
I00|A Global Voice for Survival: An Ecosystemic Approach for the Environment and the Quality of Life|In view of the overwhelming pressures on the global environment and the need to disrupt the systems that drive them, an ecosystemic theoretical and practical framework is posited for the evaluation and planning of public policies, research and teaching programmes, encompassing four dimensions of being-in-the-world (intimate, interactive, social and biophysical), as they combine, as donors and recipients, to induce the events (deficits/assets), cope with consequences (desired/undesired) and contribute for change (potential outputs). The focus should not be on the “bubbles” of the surface (consequences, fragmented issues), but on the configurations deep inside the boiling pot where the problems emerge. New paradigms of development, growth, power, wealth, work and freedom, embedded at institutional level, include heterogeneous attributes, behaviours and interactions and the dynamics of the systems (institutions, populations, political, economic, cultural and ecological background). Instead of dealing with the bubbles (segmented, reduced issues) and trying to solve isolated and localized problems without addressing the general phenomenon, the proposal emphasizes the definition of the problems deep inside the “boiling pot”, where the problems emerge, encompassing the current “world-system” with its boundaries, structures, techno-economic paradigms, support groups, rules of legitimation, and coherence. In the socio-cultural learning niches, heuristic-hermeneutic experiences generate awareness, interpretation and understanding beyond established stereotypes, from a thematic (“what”), an epistemic(“how”) and a strategic (policies) point of view. The proposal relates to how taken for granted worldviews, values and perceptions affect environmental problems and quality of life.

I00|Impact of health and recreation on work-life balance: A case study of expatriates|Factors influencing work-life balance are evolving at a very fast pace, thus creating a fecund ground for innovative work-life balance tools and techniques. The increasing significance of expatriates in the global workforce necessitates a targeted set of work-life balance initiatives to help expatriate workers contribute more effectively in the competitive work environment. Health and recreation are the two important life spheres which play a very important role in success or failure of an expatriate assignment. While work-life balance researches are being conducted globally in plenty, yet research on expatriate adjustment and expatriate work-life balance is still in its nascent stage especially in an expatriate dominated work environment in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. This research paper investigates the health and recreation spheres of expatriate academicians working in private higher education institutes in Bahrain, Oman and the UAE. The research paper illustrates and evaluates the health and recreation spheres in relation to the demographic factors of the respondents and suggests ways to improve work-life balance of expatriate employees.
I00|Domestic violence and violence against children in Ghana 2015|This paper investigates how domestic violence relates to violence against children, including severe corporal punishment. The literature suggests a link between intimate partner violence in the household and child abuse and maltreatment. Studies are, however, limited by the use of narrowly defined measures of violence against children, data availability, and a lack of characterization of domestic violence. In this paper we use original data on domestic violence and child disciplining methods from a nationally representative household survey collected in Ghana in 2015. We conduct analyses at the individual (are people exposed to domestic violence more likely to report perpetrating violence against children?) and the household level (are children in households characterized by domestic violence more likely to be violently disciplined?). At the individual level, the data allows us to distinguish between notions of control and economic, psychological, sexual and physical domestic violence. At the household level, we use the four-way classification of intimate partner violence by Johnson (2006). Multivariate regressions show a strong and robust association between domestic violence and violence against children. Children living in households with “intimate terrorism” are 2.4 times more likely to be subject to severe physical punishment. Likewise, women exposed to any form of domestic violence are twice, and men exposed to physical domestic violence seven times as likely to be violent against children as other respondents. The results are discussed based on insights from secondary literature and focus group discussions across Ghana conducted by the research team.
I00|Finance and Inclusive Human Development: Evidence from Africa|This study investigates direct and indirect linkages between financial development and inclusive human development in data panels for African countries using a battery of estimation techniques, notably: Two-Stage Least Squares, Fixed Effects, Generalized Method of Moments and Tobit regressions. The dependent variable is the inequality adjusted human development index. All dimensions of the Financial Development and Structure Database (FDSD) of the World Bank are considered. The main finding is that financial dynamics of depth, activity and size improve inclusive human development, whereas the inability of banks to transform mobilized deposits into credit for financial access negatively affects inclusive human development. Policy implications are discussed in the light of fighting surplus liquidity and providing information sharing offices (like public credit registries and private credit bureaus) that would reduce information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers.
I00|Socioeconomic status and health: A new approach to the measurement of bivariate inequality|We suggest an alternative way to construct a family of indices of socioeconomic inequality of health. Our indices belong to the broad category of linear indices. In contrast to rank-dependent indices, which are designed in terms of the ranks of the socioeconomic variable and the levels of the health variable, our indices are based on the levels of both the socioeconomic and the health variable. We also indicate how the indices can be modified in order to introduce sensitivity to inequality in the socioeconomic distribution and to inequality in the health distribution. As an empirical illustration, we make a comparative study of the relation between income and well-being in 16 European countries using data from SHARE Wave 4.
I00|Explaining the Gender Gap in Financial Literacy: the Role of Non-Cognitive Skills|Economic literature identifies a gender gap in financial literacy. This paper tests to what extent the gender gap is due to a misspecification problem or whether it exists because boys and girls do indeed have differing ways of acquiring financial literacy.
I00|World Human Development: 1870–2007|" type=""main""> How has wellbeing evolved over time and across regions? How does the West compare to the Rest? What explains their differences? These questions are addressed using a historical index of human development. A sustained improvement in world wellbeing has taken place since 1870. The absolute gap between OECD and the Rest widened over time, but an incomplete catching up—largely explained by education—occurred between 1913 and 1970. As the health transition was achieved in the Rest, the contribution of life expectancy to human development improvement declined and the Rest fell behind in terms of longevity. Meanwhile, in the OECD, as longevity increased, healthy years expanded. A large variance in human development is noticeable in the Rest since 1970, with East Asia, Latin America, and North Africa catching up to the OECD, and Central and Eastern Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa falling behind."
I00|Price Effect in the Short and in the Long Run|We study a broad class of dynamic consumer problems and characterize the short and long-run response of the demand for a good to a permanent increase in its market price. Such response can be non-monotonic over time, and the short and long-run price-elasticity of demand may have opposite sign. This is a testable prediction and can arise even in the absence of income effects. Our results are robust to a variety of settings that are commonly used in the economic literature, and have relevant policy implications. We provide illustrative applications to models of human capital and labor supply, addiction, habit and taste formation, health capital, and renewable resources.
I00|Constraints on Matching Markets Based on Moral Concerns|Various markets ban or heavily restrict monetary transfers. This is often motivated by moral concerns. However, it appears to be disputable whether the observed restrictions on transfers are the appropriate market design answer to these concerns. Instead of exogenously restricting transfers on a matching market, we introduce a desideratum based on fairness objectives and study its market design implications. The desideratum we concentrate on is discriminationfreeness, i.e. one’s access to certain resources is independent of one’s wealth endowment. A key assumption in our model is that preferences are not quasilinear but wealth has an impact on the willingness to pay. We show that matchings without transfers based on ordinal object rankings are at the efficient frontier of discrimination-free social choice functions. Implementable social choice functions are discrimination-free if and only if an agent’s object assignment only depends on ordinal object rankings and her money assignment is constant. If money can be used outside the market designer’s control even externality-freeness is needed: an agent’s object assignment has to be independent of other agents’ types. We discuss several applications in the context of discrimination-freeness including compensation for kidney donors.
I00|The Child Offender Under The Age Of Criminal Liability|At European level crime among children represents a contemporary issue and in Romania, the philosophy of the new penal code approved by Law No 286/2009 is shaped around punishment. Prevention policy in Romania and juvenile justice objectives relative to age criteria outlines two different legal manners to address children's liability under the law. One is targeting the category of children between 0 and 14 years of age, which consideres the absolute inability of criminal responsibility and one that provides criminal liability starting from the age of 14. The sensitivity of the issue of children involved in unlawfull acts and the inventory of responses to it brought me to the necessity of research the types of approach and diversity of social services built around this target group.
I00|Religión como modeladora de idearios y comportamientos relacionados con la fecundidad|Se considera que las creencias religiosas, los valores y los modos de concebir la realidad inciden en todo racionamiento del ser humano y, por tanto, en sus decisiones. Así, desde el punto de vista económico, a pesar de que estos aspectos se encuentran por fuera de los mercados, influyen sobre el funcionamiento de la economía. En este documento se propone –bajo la perspectiva de la economía de la cultura y de la economía de la religión– analizar la forma en que la religión y el contexto socioeconómico modelan los idearios y los comportamientos relacionados con las decisiones de tener hijos en las familias de la ciudad de Cartagena (Colombia). Se desarrolló un estudio teórico-explicativo, y se aportó evidencia empírica de la situación en la ciudad en la que se vincularon las variables de interés. ****** It is considered that religious beliefs, moral values and the way in which people conceive reality influence human rationality, and, therefore, people’s decisions. Although these aspects are outside the market, they do still influence the functioning of the economy. This document addresses an analysis, from a perspective based on the economics of culture and religion, about how religion and the socioeconomic context shape people’s ideas and behaviors related to the decisions about having children in families living in Cartagena de Indias - Colombia. Throughout this research we developed a theoretical-explanatory study and provided empirical evidence about the situation of the city associating the variables of interest.
I00|Human Development as Positive Freedom: Latin America in Historical Perspective| How has Latin America's well-being evolved over time? How does Latin America compare to today's developed countries ( OECD , for short)? What explains their differences? These questions are addressed using an historical index of human development. A sustained improvement in well-being can be observed since 1870. The absolute gap between OECD and Latin America widened over time, but an incomplete catching-up--largely explained by education--occurred since 1900, but faded away after 1980, as Latin America fell behind the OECD in terms of longevity. Once the first health transition was exhausted, the contribution of life expectancy to human development declined.
I00|Spillover effects of local human capital stock on adult obesity: Evidence from German neighborhoods|This paper is the first to estimate the causal effect of local human capital stock on individual adiposity and adds to the existing literature on estimating human capital externalities at the neighborhood level. We explore the possible causal pathways that college-educated neighbors exert on individual body weight, with the results revealing small yet significant human capital spillover effects. Among all adults, a percentage point increase in the neighborhood college graduates share results in a decrease of individual body mass index by 0.0026 log points, as well as a decrease of the individual likelihood of being overweight by 0.77 percentage points. Among high school graduates and college graduates, a percentage point increase in the neighborhood college graduates share results in a decrease of individual likelihood of being overweight by approximately 0.83 percentage points.
I00|English as a global language|How far has English already spread? How much further can we expect it to go? In response to the first question, this chapter tries to identify the areas of life where English already serves as a lingua franca in the world (more or less) and those where the language faces sharp competition and does not threaten to marginalize the other major languages. The former areas of life are international safety, the internal business of international organizations, internal communication within the international news industry, international sports and science. The latter areas are the press, television, the internet, publishing and international trade. As to the second question, about the future prospects of English, the chapter argues that the advance of English will depend heavily on the motives to learn the other major languages in the world as well. Based on the empirical evidence, the same model applies to the incentives to learn English and these other languages. On the important topic of welfare, the cultural market is the single one where it is arguable that the progress of English has gone too far. English dominance in the song, the cinema and the best-seller is indeed extraordinary and difficult to reconcile with the evidence of strong popular attachments to home languages, which is otherwise apparent.
I00|Determinants of Expected Returns at Public Defined-Benefit Pension Plans|Estimated expected returns are important for pension plans, as they influence many plan characteristics including required asset levels, annual contributions, and the extent of plan under- or overfunding. Yet, there seems to be little prior literature on the factors influencing these estimated future returns. In an attempt to fill this gap, this paper presents the results of a panel analysis of data on the determinants of such returns used by US public defined-benefit (DB) pension plans for the period 2001–2011. As expected, we find that real return estimates by DB public pension funds are positively related to fund size, fund age, international asset diversification, state income, and corruption levels. However, more interestingly and importantly, we document that real return estimates by public US DB pension funds are positively related to cultural measures of individualism and masculinity, and negatively related to uncertainty avoidance. These results should be of much interest not only to scholars and pension benefi ciaries, but also to fund managers, other capital market participants, and policymakers.
I00|The gender gap in mathematics: evidence from a middle-income country|Using a large administrative data set from Chile, we find that, on average, boys perform better than girls in mathematics. In this paper, we document several features of their relative performance. First, we note that the gender gap appears to increase with age (it doubles between fourth grade and eighth grade). Second, we test whether commonly proposed explanations such as parental background and investment in the child, unobserved ability, and classroom environment (including teacher gender) help explain a substantial portion of the gap. While none of these explanations help in explaining a large portion of the gender gap, we show that boys and girls differ significantly in perceptions about their own ability in math. Conditional on math scores, girls are much more likely to state that they dislike math, or find math difficult, compared to boys. We highlight differences in self-assessed ability as areas for future research that might lead to a better understanding of the gender gap in math.
I00|Worms at work: Long-run impacts of a child health investment|This study estimates long-run impacts of a child health investment, exploiting community-wide experimental variation in school-based deworming. The program increased education among women and labor supply among men, with accompanying shifts in labor market specialization. Ten years after deworming treatment, women who were eligible as girls are 25% more likely to have attended secondary school, halving the gender gap. They reallocate time from traditional agriculture into cash crops and entrepreneurship. Men who were eligible as boys stay enrolled for more years of primary school, work 17% more hours each week, spend more time in entrepreneurship, are more likely to hold manufacturing jobs, and miss one fewer meal per week. We estimate an annualized financial internal rate of return of at least 32.2%.
I00|Une Nouvelle Mesure Du Développement Des Économies Ultramarines Françaises À Travers L’Application De L’Indicateur De Développement Humain « Hybride »|La littérature sur l’évaluation du niveau de développement des Dé-partements et Collectivités d’Outre-Mer montre que ces territoires ont fait preuve sur les dernières décennies d’un dynamisme certain en matière de développement, même si leurs performances restent encore bien en deçà de celles de la France métropolitaine. Toutefois, ces rares études souffrent d’un certain nombre de limites qui viennent réduire la portée de leurs conclusions. L’objet de notre étude est de contribuer à une meilleure évaluation des performances de développement humain des espaces français d’Outremer en mobilisant l’In-dicateur de Développement Humain « Hybride », introduit par le PNUD en 2010, que nous calculons sur la période 1995-2010. Ce dernier a l’avantage de permettre une comparaison à la fois dans le temps et dans l’espace plus exhaustive. Les résultats montrent que ces économies présentent globalement des niveaux de développement satisfaisants (à l’exception de Mayotte) comparés aux autres petits territoires insulaires ou côtiers, mais ils demeurent cependant loin de la performance métropolitaine.
I00|Can Early Intervention Improve Maternal Well-being? Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial|This study estimates the effect of a targeted policy intervention on global and experienced measures of maternal well-being. Participants from a disadvantaged community are randomly assigned during pregnancy to an intensive home visiting parenting program or a control group. The intervention has no impact on global well-being as measured by life satisfaction and parenting stress or experienced negative affect using episodic reports derived from the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM). Treatment effects are observed on measures of experienced positive affect from the DRM and a measure of mood yesterday. This suggests that early intervention may produce some improvements in experienced well-being.

I00|Identification and classification of the factors causing falls from heightat work|Existing in most sectors, the workstations at different heights expose workers to hazards causing serious injury, disability or death in most of the situations. Due to their repercussions, the work injury as a result of falling from height representa significant economic burden both on employees, the employers, and the society as a whole. The present paper aims to identify and classify the main factors that generate work accidents due to the falls from height in order to find the optimal solutions to reduce them.
I00|Mapping of effective technology-based services for independent living for older people at home|" This report identifies and maps technology-based services which have successfully enhance the independent living of older adults at home in and outside Europe. This is the first deliverable of the research project ""Long-term care strategies for independent living of older people (ICT-AGE)"", as a study targeted to produce policy recommendations for DG EMPL to support Member States in their long-term care strategy, according to the EC policy priorities of the Social Investment Package, the European Semester and the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing. We found 14 different, mature and mainstreamed technology-based services for the independent living of older adults at home that effectively address a set of long-term care needs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has managed to obtain a number of practices in technology-based services which have scientifically evidenced to increase the independence of older people living at home, improve the productivity of carers, enable better quality of care, and generate savings, contributing to the financial sustainability of the long-term care systems."
I00|ICT for the Employability and Integration of Immigrants in the European Union: Methodological Final Report of a Survey in three Member States|This is the final methodological report on the project on 'ICT to support the integration into everyday life of immigrants and minorities'. The research objectives were to describe immigrantsâ€™ ICT skills, access, usage, and to explore how they differ with respect to different profiles and broad socio-economic and other personal characteristics such as integration and employability. In order to pursue these objectives, a face-to-face survey was carried out in three countries (Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Spain). A total of 1,653 third country nationals were interviewed. An ad-hoc questionnaire was designed, based on previous studies and official statistics. It was translated into ten different languages so that it covered all the nationalities from the sample. Due to the characteristics of the target group, the dissemination strategy and data collection put special emphasis on the interviewer selection and training process. Face-to-face survey procedures and specific participant recruitment strategies were developed, considering different contact points depending on the characteristics of the target. Descriptive univariate and bivariate statistical analysis as well as multivariate statistical analysis of certain aspects have been carried out. In addition, we have also re-classified the data obtained and constructed two categorical variables: â€˜Profileâ€™ that includes as its values five meaningful and homogenous migrant profiles and â€˜Connectedâ€™ and â€˜Non-connectedâ€™.
I00|ICT for the employability and integration of immigrants in the European Union: Results from a survey in three Member States|This report presents the findings of a survey on the role played by Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in supporting the employability and integration of immigrants in Europe. 1,500 immigrants in 3 Member States (Bulgaria, the Netherlands, and Spain) were interviewed face-to-face from the end of 2012 to mid-2013 to identify their ICT skills, access and usage, with the aim to identify the role of ICT for their employability and integration in the host country and comparing connected and non-connected migrants. The statistical analysis carried out in this survey revealed that migrants differed in ICT usage, employability and integration in the 3 countries surveyed. Moreover, age, education, employment status, and type of occupation were clear sources of digital inequalities. The findings point to the implications for policies that aim to take advantage of the potential offered by immigration in the European Union, such as digital inclusion policies address specific groups of migrants (older and unemployed), supporting public libraries and other forms of public access, promoting digital skills, and migrant integration policies to raise awareness about how the Internet can help migrants to become more actively engaged in society.
I00|ICT for the employability and integration of immigrants in the European Union: A Qualitative Analysis of a Survey in Bulgaria, the Netherlands and Spain|"This report shows the role played by Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in supporting the employability and integration of immigrants in Europe in three European countries, framed in their migration history, migration policies, integration policy and levels of integration of migrants in the country. This study complements the findings obtained in the report entitled ""ICT for the employability and integration of immigrants in the European Union: Results from a survey in three Member States"". The research found that age, education, employment status and type of occupation are drivers of digital inequalities; ICTs constitute an important resource for employability and integration of immigrants in the three countries, and specific groups of immigrants such as older and less educated are isolated from the digital world, and that immigrants they are not making more advanced uses of ICTs. Policy strategies go toward increasing access and the digital literacy of isolated groups and in particular for newly arrived migrants, as to provide on-line access to relevant information and on-line services for migrants through user friendly multi-lingual websites."
I00|Report on case studies of the technology-based services for independent living for older people|This report elaborates five case studies of good practices of technology-enabled services for independent living of older adults at home from the 14 obtained in the deliverable 1 of the ICT-AGE project. The aim is to obtain policy lessons studying a group of variables related with the creation and implementation of these services by public long-term care systems, such as business case and models, training actions, scaling and market creation, evaluation process and organisation change, among others. A case study is provided per each good practice on the basis of the variables analysed.
I00|Technology-enabled services for older people living at home independently: lessons for public long-term care authorities in the EU Member States|This report collects six policy lessons to support public authorities at all levels of the EU Member States for the adequate implementation and use of new technologies in the field of long-term care service provision for older people. These policy lessons have been obtained through the ICT-AGE research project carried out by the JRC-IPTS and funded by DG EMPL, based on the cross-analysis of good practices of technology-enabled services to help older people live independently at home. These lessons are aimed to benefit the public long-term care authorities, to modernise their social protection systems in the field of long-term care, ensuring effectiveness, adequacy and sustainability. They can enable the Member States to carry out the actions and recommendations set out in the 2013 European Commission policy on Social Investment for Growth and Cohesion (SIP) and to implement the country-specific recommendations of the European Semester. The report also provides to the targeted public authorities with different existing instruments with those the European Union could help them to implement these policy lessons.
I00|Urbanisation, natural amenities and subjective well-being: Evidence from US counties|This paper examines the relationships between county-level urbanisation, natural amenities and subjective well-being (SWB) in the US. SWB is measured using individual-level data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) which asks respondents to rate their overall life satisfaction. Using individual-level SWB data allows us to control for several important individual characteristics. The results suggest that urbanisation lowers SWB, with relatively large negative coefficients for residents in dense counties and large metropolitan areas. Natural amenities also affect SWB, with warmer winters having a significant positive relationship with self-reported life-satisfaction. Implications for researchers and policymakers are discussed.
I00|Factors influencing engagement with higher education pathway programs|This study presents data collected from students commencing an enabling program at an Australian university in 2013. Students were asked to identify the three most important reasons for them undertaking the program. The responses identified focussed on four main factors: future educational and career aspirations; a desire to have new experiences; the need for new skills and knowledge; and academic and personal support needs. Results showed that younger students straight from school saw the program as an opportunity to secure entry to their degree of choice. Mature students who had a gap of some years in their education career saw the opportunity offered through the enabling program more in regard to gaining new skills and experiencing university study before embarking on their full degree program.
I00|Determinants of Physicians’ Acceptance of New Medicaid Patients|Medicaid plays a significant role in the healthcare of millions of U.S. families and individuals, and office-based physician practices are an important part of the national health care delivery system. Yet access to these providers has been and continues to be a challenge for Medicaid beneficiaries. Exacerbating the issue is the recent expansion of insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. This study explores this national conundrum from the physicians’ perspective. The impact of practice characteristics, compensation and performance measures are examined on physicians’ propensity to accept new Medicaid patients. This study draws upon data from the 2008 Health Tracking Physician Survey restricted-use file and is the first to provide for a comprehensive look at the determinants of physician acceptance. The approach is rooted in the economic theory of control, agency theory. The most significant factors found to be associated with diminished physician propensity for Medicaid access include: no present participation, having an ownership interest in the practice, operating as a one- or two-physician sized practice, operating as a primary care physician, low relative geographic physician reimbursement, lacking supportive clinical information technology and gender. Knowing what determinants are associated with physicians’ decision may provide opportunities for public policy solutions. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2015
I00|Public State Subsidy of Private Higher Ed Institutions: Does It Pay for Itself in Maryland?|The question addressed in this paper is whether there is an annual net gain to the state economy on a per student basis as a result of state subsidies to private institutions of higher education. In addition, the annual economic impact of adding a student at a private institution is compared to the impact of an additional student at a public institution. Because of Maryland’s 40-year history of direct appropriations to private non-profit institutions, the analysis focuses on the state of Maryland and employs input–output methodology. Due to the high percentage of out-of-state students and high tuition, the typical new student in a private higher education institution adds significant new spending to the state leading to a net positive tax payback on the subsidy.

I00|Income, Health, and the Value of Preserving Options|We model family choice among health plans taking account of family, insurer and health care provider (e.g., doctor) characteristics not addressed by earlier models. We use an additively separable utility function permitting an intuitive treatment of how families trade health against consumption, and how income and health risk influence that trade-off. Health care provider quality affects expected health outcomes and the family’s choice set includes health maintenance organization and preferred provider organization (PPO) plans. We model how families value the PPO’s option to use out-of-network providers taking into account uncertainty about future diagnoses and incomplete information about provider quality. The model’s predictions are consistent with enrollment patterns in the National Health Interview Survey. The approach has implications for cost control and income-related disparities in quality of care. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2015
I00|The Effect of Birth Order on Occupational Choice|Research suggests that birth order has a profound influence on personality development, but there has been little research investigating the effect of birth order on a person’s occupational choice. A number of psychologists, including Frank Sulloway and Reid Claxton, argue that first-borns are more likely to become managers because their order in the family trains them in managerial and leadership skills. In contrast, several economists, such as Gary Becker, argue that first-borns are often economically successful because they receive more resources from their parents than other children. This occurs both because they tend to have fewer siblings and because they receive their parents’ unshared attention before their younger siblings are born. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) of 1979, we investigate which of these models best accords with the data. We find that first-borns are indeed more likely to select managerial positions than later-borns, but that this effect is due to first-borns having, on average, fewer siblings than others, not to being first-born per se. Further, we find the effect of family size is strongest among lower-income families, lending support to Becker’s hypothesis. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2015

I00|College Degree for Everyone?|We employ data from the March CPS for the period between 1964 and 2011 to compute the present discounted values of a college degree and high school diploma for different percentiles of income distributions in both education categories. We find that for a median income individual net value of a college degree is always positive. At the same time, we show that a sizable fraction of the population who acquired higher education would be better off by not getting a college degree. This fraction depends on the type of institution and opportunity costs of going to college. Our findings are consistent with the recent data on delinquency rates on student loans.

I00|Challenges for European welfare states|In the absence of social security reform, current pension entitlements of an aging population exceed future fiscal capacity. However, structural labor market reforms facilitate the transition to sustainable schemes in which a sizeable part of the current generosity of European welfare states can be maintained. In fact, many European states have already taken important steps in this direction. In the end insufficient productive capacities to support the welfare state pose smaller challenges to reform than do time inconsistencies built into the political process of redesigning pension plans.

I00|The Culmination of the MDG’s: A New Arena of the Sustainable Development Goals|Established in 2000;the Millennium Development Goals had played a major role in bringing back the developmental issues to focus. Nearing the end of the stipulated time when they had to be achieved and standing at the edge of establishing the Sustainable development goals, we must comprehend the limitations of the MDGs and formulate SDGs in a way that it overcomes them. This paper is an attempt to observe the trends that the major indicators for health and urbanisation had followed after the MDGs had been established. One of the major issues which is clearly seen in the background of the achievement of targets to reach MDG goals and which must be addressed immediately in the developing countries is: increasing rural-urban and rich-poor gap in these countries. Inclusive growth as a target in the upcoming SDGs does give some hope, however, it must be taken care that the SDGs are not reduced to simply achieving some numbers but they broaden the development narrative beyond the narrow growth perspective.
I00|Government expenditure and economic development: evidence from Italy 1862-2009|Using a new historical dataset over the time period 1862-2009, this paper tests the validity of Wagner’s Law of public spending (WL) in Italy. To this aim, cointegration and Granger causation are used to investigate the long run relationship between GDP and government expenditure. Moreover, DOLS method is applied to estimate consistent long run elasticity between these two variables. In contrast to previous studies, we evaluate WL for both total government expenditure and some specific items of spending. Our main findings are that WL does not hold in the long run for total government expenditure. However, we find strong support for WL in the shorter time span from 1862 to the end of the 19th century. Here WL is confirmed as regards both total government expenditure and all the specific items of spending we have considered. Conversely, in the post-Second World War years, WL holds only for capital expenditure, compensation of employees, justice and national security, welfare and redistribution by the state. Thus, it seems that Italy invested a great deal and for a long period in infrastructures, justice, national security, and welfare, and less in items such as education and culture that play a paramount role in the formation of human capital.
I00|Self-management Support of Diabetes Type 2 Patients in Bulgaria: Analysis of Biographical Intervi|The article presents the main topics related to the lifestyle of patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes based on an analysis of biographical interviews. The paper examines the content of the concept of self-management and provides an analysis of research on the impact of social networks – their mechanisms and practices. A scheme of thematic analysis of the biographical narratives is developed and key categories, topics and subtopics with relevant quotes are offered to illustrate patients’ self-management process. The levels of analysis include individual-perceptual level; social-categorical level associated with social network analysis and macroorganizational level, dealing with system factors. Conclusions are made both for the serious methodological potentials of biographical interviewing in health sociology and the overall description of the process of self-management of patients with type 2 diabetes in Bulgaria.
I00|Providing the right skills to all in China: From “made in China” to “created in China”|China has made impressive strides in education in recent decades, even though the accumulation of human capital has lagged behind that of physical capital. Going forward, access to and quality of education will be key to sustain economic convergence with the most advanced economies and to offset the drag exerted by population ageing. This will require addressing a number of problems. Access to pre-school education is still far from universal. Migrants’ children as well as rural and poor families are still at a major disadvantage at every step of the education ladder. The focus on rote learning and exams remains excessive. More bridges are needed between vocational and general education. Graduating students often struggle to find a job matching their expectations and employers do not always find the requisite skills. Despite a soaring number of Chinese patents, the quality of most patents is still low and innovation output is weak. Reforms are underway to address these problems but further progress is needed in various areas against the backdrop of rapidly evolving market demands and the development of the knowledge economy. Among the priorities are more and better oriented funding of education, giving greater opportunities to children with a socio-economic or physical disadvantage, reducing the role of after-school tutoring, focusing less on memorisation and more on creativity, enhancing the appeal of the teaching profession, improving students’ information on labour market prospects, developing workplace training, making greater use of online education potential, and more effectively nurturing research and innovation. This Working Paper relates to the 2015 OECD Economic Survey of China www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-china.htm Donner à tous des compétences adéquates en Chine : Du “fabriqué en Chine” au “créé en Chine” La Chine a fait ces dernières décennies des progrès impressionnants dans le domaine de l’éducation, même si l’accumulation de capital humain y a été moins rapide que l’accumulation de capital physique. À l’avenir, l’accès à l’éducation et la qualité de celle-ci seront déterminants pour favoriser la convergence économique avec les économies les plus avancées et compenser l’effet du vieillissement de la population. Il faudra pour cela s’atteler à la résolution d’un certain nombre de problèmes. Ainsi, l’accès à l’éducation préscolaire est encore loin d’être universel. À tous les échelons du système éducatif, les enfants de migrants, ainsi que les familles pauvres ou vivant en milieu rural, restent très désavantagés. L'importance donnée à l'apprentissage par coeur et aux examens reste excessive. Il faudrait aussi instaurer des passerelles plus nombreuses entre la formation professionnelle et l'enseignement général. Les étudiants diplômés ont souvent du mal à trouver un emploi correspondant à leurs attentes et les employeurs, pour leur part, ne trouvent pas toujours des candidats ayant les compétences requises. Malgré l'explosion du nombre des brevets chinois, la qualité de la majorité d'entre eux reste faible et les résultats en matière d'innovation sont modestes. Des réformes sont en cours pour s'attaquer à ces problèmes, mais les progrès doivent se poursuivre dans divers domaines, dans un contexte marqué par l'évolution rapide des exigences des marchés et le développement de l'économie de la connaissance. Les mesures à prendre en priorité doivent viser à mieux cibler et à accroître le financement de l'éducation, donner des chances plus importantes aux enfants issus de milieux socio-économiques défavorisés ou handicapés, réduire le rôle du soutien périscolaire, mettre moins l'accent sur la mémorisation et miser davantage sur la créativité, rendre la profession d'enseignant plus attrayante, améliorer l'information des étudiants sur les perspectives offertes par le marché du travail, développer la formation en entreprise, exploiter davantage les possibilités offertes par l'éducation en ligne, et promouvoir de manière plus efficace la recherche et l'innovation.

I00|The dynamics of social expenditures over the cycle: A comparison across OECD countries|This paper studies the cyclical behaviour of public social spending in 20 OECD countries observed over the period between 1982 and 2011. In view of the recent discussion on cutting the budget deficit, the paper pays particular attention to whether social spending is pro-cyclical or countercyclical, whether it changes asymmetrically during expansions and recessions and whether the asymmetric changes in social spending contribute to a drift in social expenditures over time. The links between social spending levels and key economic variables, such as economic growth, provide also a useful context for discussing current social expenditure trends. The estimates, based on a system-GMM estimator, suggest that an upward ratchet effect exists. The effect is robust to a large number of alternative specifications.

I00|Strategies Concerning the Translation of Specialized Texts|The aim of this paper is to investigate several cultural aspects regarding the changes and differences in translation and the specialized terminology used in medical business. The first part of this study accommodates the reader with the general background of the terminology issues faced by a translator. The reader discovers that the practice of translating is an old one, but the studies of translation are new. Furthermore, s/he becomes accustomed with concepts such as “word-for-word” vs. “sense-for-sense”, the influence of Dryden, Dolet and Tytler, the problem of equivalence in Jakobson’s view, Nida’s adaptation and methods, Newmark’s semantic and communicative translation or Vinay’s and Darbelnet changes in translation. The last part of this paper consists in tackling the issues raised by the translation of specialized texts, in order to emphasize the difficulties faced by translators.
I00|Does Sanitation Affect Health Outcomes? Evidence from India|In this paper we have attempted to unravel the disparity in sanitation facilities across rural and urban regions of Indian states and the impact of sanitation on health outcomes. Based on the 69th National Sample Survey data set which covers more than 95 000 households we find a wide disparity in the access to sanitation facilities across rural and urban areas of Indian states and across states. While the north-eastern and southern states perform better in sanitation indicators, the eastern and central part of India performs poorly. So far as the relationship between the sanitation and health outcome is concerned our analysis shows that better sanitation facilities do have a positive impact on the health outcomes. From our analysis of four diseases (stomach problem, malaria, skin diseases and fever) that are more caused due to sanitation facilities we observed that better sanitation facilities in terms of access to toilets and bathroom access to regular safe drinking water, practice of storing drinking water in metal or non-metal container, absence of flies and mosquitoes, having separate kitchen and proper disposal of wastes reduces the incidence of diseases
I00|Catastrophic health payments in Malawi: analysis of determinants using a zero-inflated beta regression|The existing literature on out-of-pocket (OOP) health payments has tended to use binary models to analyse the determinants of catastrophic health spending. In so doing, the literature ignores the fact that shares of out-of-pocket health care payments which are used to define the binary dependent variables are fractional with a mass point at zero. Further to this, the literature makes no distinction between factors which influence the level and the risk of catastrophic health payments. In order to address these shortcomings, this paper departs from this approach, and uses the zero-inflated beta regression instead. The paper also derives elasticity formalae for the zero-inflated beta regression. These elasticities allow one to talk about both the statistical, and economic significance of the different determinants of health nonpayment, catastrophic health spending, and the risk of catastrophe. Data from Malawi's Third Integrated Household survey are used. The empirical results indicate that the same variable can have a different effect on the levels, and risk of catastrophic health spending as well as OOP health nonpayment.
I00|Comparative Analysis of Factors Affecting Child Mortality in Pakistan|This study is investigated determinants of child mortality in the Pakistan. The Pakistan is amongst one of the five countries who have the highest child mortality rates in the world. Literature on the subject has found extensive variation in causes of child death. We used micro-data of Pakistan Demographic Health Survey (PDHS) of 2006-07 collected by National Institute of Population Studies (NIPS). In the descriptive analysis, it is founded that neonatal mortality rate is high for Pakistan. In econometric analysis, binary logit model was estimated using Maximum Likelihood Method (MLM). The study puts particular emphasis on the effect of wealth, mother’ education, exposure to media and ethnicity. Effect of mothers’ education, wealth, and exposure to media found significant determinants of child mortality in Pakistan. Knowledge on condition of a subject at national and local level gives a prerequisite for shaping efficient polices addressing the Problem.
I00|Finance and Inclusive Human Development: Evidence from Africa|This study investigates direct and indirect linkages between financial development and inclusive human development in data panels for African countries using a battery of estimation techniques, notably: Two-Stage Least Squares, Fixed Effects, Generalized Method of Moments and Tobit regressions. The dependent variable is the inequality adjusted human development index. All dimensions of the Financial Development and Structure Database (FDSD) of the World Bank are considered. The main finding is that financial dynamics of depth, activity and size improve inclusive human development, whereas the inability of banks to transform mobilized deposits into credit for financial access negatively affects inclusive human development. Policy implications are discussed in the light of fighting surplus liquidity and providing information sharing offices (like public credit registries and private credit bureaus) that would reduce information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers.
I00|Does the Financial System Promote Sustainable Development? Evidence from Eastern European Countries|This article aims at analyzing the relationship between sustainable development and the financial system, mainly focusing on the role that the financial system plays within the process of sustainable development. Theoretically, the financial system could be a very important factor to promote sustainable development, as it could foster economic growth and development, efficient resource allocation, the protection of the environment and also social responsibility. Using panel data econometrical analysis, we tested for correlations between indicators of the financial system and indicators of sustainable development in five developing Eastern European countries. We found weak or no correlation between financial indicators and sustainable development indicators. This might be explained by several facts. First, the financial systems of these five developing countries are not highly developed, so that they do not have a high capacity to foster economic growth and development. Second, even if this was the case, promoting sustainable development requires a lot more than fostering economic growth and is not a question of whether the financial companies can promote sustainability, but whether they are interested in promoting it. Even though financial companies have embraced the sustainability agenda, they haven`t done much to change their short-term orientation to profit and to shift to long-run strategies in favor of sustainable development.
I00|More than twenty years of New Public Management (NPM) in Germany – Learning Effects and Developments for Social Work and particularly Occupational Social Work (OSW)|Management (NPM) and its concretisation for public administration in Germany in the form of the New S t e e r i n g M o d e l ( N S M ) , c o n n e c t s i t w i t h Occupational Social Work (OSW) as a subsector of Social Work and illustrates learning effects, i.e. developments for Occupational Social Work (OSW). In this respect, elements such as quality, profitability, client orientation, subject specific and occupational work related settings of priorities, as well as development of skills in social work and especially OSW are important factors. To conclude, concrete recommendations for action in regards to OSW are stated.
I00|Barriers to research, research competency and research implementation of public health professionals working in a district located near Walilak University, Thailand|Scientific research plays an important role in efforts to encourage evidence-based practices in healthcare systems. However, research has not been given a priority by healthcare professionals. A strategy commonly used to reduce the gap between research and practice is to identify barriers and then tailor interventions to overcome the identified barriers in the given context.This cross-sectional study was the first phase of a project to promote research-based public health practices. The aims were to examine: 1) educational level, education about research subject, training in research, perceived barriers to research implementation, perceived research competency and research implementation and 2) factors related to research implementation of public health professionals working in the district where Walailak University is located, i.e., Thasala District, Nakhon Si Thammarat Province. Stratified random sampling was used to sample 149 subjects, including registered nurses, public health technical officers, public health officers, medical technologists, medical science technicians, physiotherapists and others. The 5-point scale of perceived barriers to research and perceived research competency, having a Cronbach?s alpha of .94 and .93, respectively, were used to collect data. Data were analyzed using frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation and binary logistic regression.The findings showed that 87.2% of participants graduated at bachelor degree level, 89.3% had ever studied about research, 45% had experienced research training and 10.7% had experienced research implementation as a head of a research project. Participants had low perceived research competency (M=2.9) and high barriers to research (M=3.2). Research training was the only factor significantly associated with research implementation (p-value
I00|Effectiveness of a planned educational program for primigravida Indian women regarding factors influencing LBW|IntroductionA baby?s weight at birth is an indicator of maternal health and nutrition during pregnancy. Being underweight in the womb increases the risk of death in the early months and years of a child?s life and those who survive tend to have impaired immune function, increased risk of disease and reduced muscle strength, cognitive abilities and IQ throughout their lives. Objectives - To determine the knowledge of primigravida women regarding factors influencing LBW as measured by structured interview schedule.- To evaluate the effectiveness of a planned educational program (PEP) for primigravida women on factors influencing LBW in terms of gain in knowledge score.Hypothesis The mean post-test knowledge scores of the primigravida women regarding factors influencing low birth weight will be significantly higher than the mean pre-test knowledge scores.DesignA Quazi-experimental design was adopted to conduct the current study. One group pre-test post-test approach was used.SampleThirty primigravida women in first and second trimester attending antenatal clinic in Mangalore were recruited purposively for the current study.ToolA structured closed ended questionnaire was prepared by the researchers and used to assess: the knowledge level of the primigravida women through a pre-test and the effectiveness of the PEP, after its implementation. Content validity of the questionnaire and the program was assured by a panel of 9 experts in the field of obstetrics and gynecology and pediatrics nursing. Also, reliability was tested by Karl Pearson?s correlation formula (r= 0.90, P=0.001). InterventionImplementation of a PEP regarding factors influencing LBW for the primigravida women. Data analysis and interpretationThe highest percentage of the respondents (53.33%) had poor knowledge and 46.67% had average knowledge regarding factors influencing low birth weight. Thus, primigravida women need to be educated on factors influencing low birth weight. With regard to the pre-test knowledge level, the mean percentage of total knowledge score was 36% with a mean ± SD of 10.80 ± 3.39, which increased to 84.77% with a mean ± SD of 25.43±2.62 in the post-test suggesting that, the planned educational program increased the total percentage of knowledge score of primigravida women on factors influencing LBW by 48.77%. In conclusion, the whole study showed that, the planned educational program may be effective in increasing the knowledge of primigravida women (t= 19.72, P .001) regarding factors influencing low birth weight.
I00|Leveraging the creative potential of fieldwork learning plans|Multidisciplinary fieldwork in the professions can benefit from learning plans that leverage what a student needs to know and what placements can offer. Building on the research of the creative potential of learning plans in fieldwork by Leitmann and Palmer (Journal of Practice Teaching and Learning, 2013) this presentation addresses the enrichment of fieldwork learning through the more effective development and use of student learning plans. Our research focused firstly on analysis of complexity in students? learning plans. Complexity refers to the depth to which students identify and make connections between knowledge, skills and values to be developed on placement. We innovated a framework to gauge the complexity of criteria in student learning plans. In this instance they were of final fourth year Bachelor of Social Work students but can apply to most disciplines.Field education exposes students to a wide range of learning possibilities. It is central to tertiary and vocational education as it is through such supervised professional practice that classroom based learning is brought alive in the triumvirate between university, agency / supervisor and student.Learning plans focus on the professional development of the student and the evidence on which assessment of the students? fieldwork is to be based. As Hodgson et al, (2006/07) assert, learning plans are more than merely an articulation of a list of tasks and activities undertaken on placement and need to address abstract dimensions of students? knowledge, skills and values to be developed. More abstract dimensions require logical and conceptual clarity on the part of the learner and supervisor so as to provide overall direction for the placement (Leitmann and Palmer 2013 p.33). As academic researchers we deepen thinking and develop greater rigour around the concept of ?complexity? in learning plans. To do this we refer to two articles identified in our literature review (Rogers and Langevin, 2000; Hodgson and Walford, 2007) and additionally incorporated Bloom?s (1956) taxonomy of learning with literature located in the critical reflective practice tradition (Fook, 1999; Ghaye and Lillyman, 2000; Taylor and White, 2000; White, Fook and Gardiner, 2006). This paper presents the findings of our research on the creative potential of student learning plans.
I00|The Perception Of Occupational Health And Safety: An Application On The Students Of Technical Vocational School|Occupational accidents are one of the most crucial problems in working life. A good many people lose their lives because of these accidents around the world. Thousands of people from different sectors die because of the accidents, which are one of the leading problems in Turkey. In this context, it is very obvious that legislative regulations are not enough in terms of preventing occupational accidents and making people aware about these kinds of accidents and training them about their sectors are also crucial.Despite the differences between the work risks of craft who are going to work in different sectors, they are expected to have a certain level of perception about hindering occupational accidents. The aim of this study is to determine the level of occupational health and security perceptions of the students at Technical Vocational School. A questionnaire was used in this study in order to identify their perceptions.Security education, security communication, security awareness and fatalism scale were used in order to detect the security perceptions of the students. The results of this study are expected to guide and shed light on the regulations for creating a healthy and safe working environment and to develop the awareness about occupational health and security of the students.
I00|Nursing students? interaction with a computer-controlled human patient simulator|Active learning by caring for patients has been the preferred method of achieving competency. Simulation learning provides the opportunity for the learner to practice and learn in an environment as close to reality as possible. Students interact with the simulator, discovering critical assessment information in the same manner they would with real patients. High-fidelity simulation was conducted at one nursing school in Macao. All scenarios were designed using a computer-controlled human patient simulator (HPS, SimMan Laerdal Sales Office, New York, USA). 113 Chinese baccalaureate nursing students (77 in year 2, 36 in year 3) completed all simulation sessions. Their age ranged between 19 and 26 years (mean = 21.24, S.D. = 1.26). Students received an orientation to the simulation laboratory to familiarize them with technology and learning process one week before simulation. Students worked with five scenarios during a four week block with nine hours per week. They were voluntarily divided into different tutorial groups. Each group consisted of 5 or 6 students with two tutors. The learning process includes case clarification, health assessment, nursing intervention and debriefing. This paper described the simulation design and students? interaction with a computer-controlled human patient. The Simulation Design Evaluation Questionnaire was used to evaluate students? views on simulation design in terms of realism, transferability and arrangement. The content validity Index (CVI) was reported as 0.91. The internal consistency reliability was evaluated to assess the internal consistency of the Simulation Evaluation Scale were shown as 0.832. Students had positive feelings about the simulation design. The scenarios used with the simulator recreate real-life situations. The learning objectives were clear. Students considered that the interaction with the simulator improved their clinical competence. Simulation experience increased their confidence about going into the actual clinical setting. The clinical decision-making skills taught in the simulation are valuable. The knowledge they gained from the simulation could be used in nursing care. Integrating simulation into existing curriculum structures requires faculty commitment to enhance their own teaching skills and redesign existing programs. Organizational commitment is also essential for this innovative teaching method due to the significant resources required for program implementation and ongoing financial support. Additional studies to test the impact of this teaching method on learner performance, patient safety, clinical outcomes, faculty perceptions and cost efficient will provide valuable support for using high-fidelity simulation in nursing education.
I00|Breast Self Examination- A Necessary Preventive Tool: Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice among Nurses in Tabuk Region, Saudi Arabia|Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in females. It accounts for about 22% of all new cancers in women. In Saudi Arabia, the number of new cases of cancer is 2741 in 2014, including about 19.9% of breast cancer in women that is ranked first figures.1 It has been demonstrated that early detection and screening for breast cancer could lead to a reduction in breast cancer mortality. One of the main recognized methods of screening is Breast Self Examination (BSE). Addressing the important role of nurses in that regard is an essential preventive tool.Objectives: To assess the level of Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice (KAP) of nurses regarding the relevant preventive and applied aspects of BSE in hospitals and Primary Health Care (PHC) centers; and to propose a truthful quality BSE improvement training program for the studied nurses. Subjects and Methods: A cross-sectional analytic research design was chosen to investigate the current research problem. The multi-stage random sampling technique has been applied to recruit a sample size of 152 nurses. A self-administered questionnaire has been used and covered 30 significant BSE dependant variables and they were classified into knowledge (10), attitudes (10) and practice (10) components. The questionnaire has been tested for its validity and reliability. Data have been managed using SPSS v.22.Results: The mean age and average years of experience of the studied nurses were 33.62±8.45 and 8.18±5.65 respectively. The majority of nurses have favorable attitudes (69.34%), good degree of knowledge (81.42%) and satisfactory practice (70.26%) regarding BSE. The essential substandard KAP areas have been identified and ranked.Conclusion: Continuous medical education and in-service training of nurses on the practical aspects of early detection of breast cancer are greatly needed and to be well incorporated within the national protocol of the Saudi ministry of health.Reference: 1.

I00|Pattern Approach to Coping with School Failure for Better Learning Outcomes: Reconsidering Relationships between Coping, Personality, Self-Esteem and Test Anxiety|This study investigates personality-coping relationship through pattern approach to coping with school failure. Students using different patterns of coping when confronted with an academic stressor were described with respect to their scores on extraversion, neuroticism, test anxiety and self-esteem scales.The sample consisted of 436 Croatian elementary school students (214 girls and 222 boys, mean age 12.72). Data regarding the students? sex and age were collected in addition to coping scales, and measures of extroversion, neuroticism, test anxiety and self-esteem. Six groups with different pattern of coping were compared. Two of the groups consist of students who have very high or very low score on all coping strategies. The remaining students were classified into four groups: a) students focused strictly on problem-focused coping, b) those focused on both problem solving and social support, c) those focused on avoidant coping, and d) emotionally reactive students.Current results show that these students differ with respect to all variables included in the study: self-esteem, neuroticism, extraversion, and test anxiety. Advantages of the pattern analysis approach in explaining some contradictory findings from previous correlational research are emphasized together with the teacher?s role in facilitating adaptive coping strategies for pupils better learning outcomes.
I00|Developmental fears, frustrations and fantasies in children's fantasy novels providing opportunities for educational life skills training programs|Contemporary education programs for primary and secondary school education need to provide pupils with the opportunity to develop key competences and skills, and to become more relevant and tailored to the needs of children and their development. Life skills training programs represent relatively heterogeneous set of programs addressing variety of issues such as decision making, problem solving, creative and critical thinking, effective communication, intrapersonal relationship skills, self-awareness, empathy and coping with emotions and stress. As defined by the World Health Organization they fall under the category of psycho-social skills that are distinctly different from other types of skills such as perceptual/motor skills, livelihood or money management and entrepreneurial skills, although these skills can be complementary to life skills education.Contrary to the obvious relevance of the life skills based education, methods for life skills development are not fully integrated in education programs, especially in some Central and Eastern ? European countries. In addition to presenting current developments of the life skills program implementation in Croatia, this article will also present relatively novel approach to integration of life skills training in standard primary and secondary school programs. This approach relies on the use of children's fantasy novels in literature classes to target specific developmental fears, frustrations and fantasies. It presents pupils with opportunity to evocate, became aware of and work out different issues specifically related to coping with problems such as normative developmental fears and frustrations and their expressions in fantasies leading to conscious resolutions that can improve adaptive coping patterns, increase self-awareness, improve communication and relationships with others and inspire creativity in literary expressions. With methods relatively similar to bibliotherapy, this specific, methodical approach to using children?s fantasy literature can archive a large portion of life skills training goals right within the framework of existing literature and literacy education programs. Analysis of the selected children fantasy literature texts that use developmental fears, frustrations and their resolution through fantasies will be presented, discussed and evaluated, opening a venue for novel methodical approaches to life skills development in primary and secondary education.

I00|Changes and determinants of teacher?s burnout syndrome|Our research focuses on teachers? burnout to show that the passage of 15 years has been any change in burnout syndrome and analyze what kind of workplace-, personality- and behavioral characteristics explaining the factors of burnout.Our sample, a total of 783 practising teachers (primary and secondary school teachers). A survey tests were conducted at the beginning of the 2000s, in 2011 and 2014. Such as: MBI Test (Maslach, Jackson, 1986) version was made for teachers (Byrne, 1991), a Psychological Immune System (Oláh, 2005), a Preference of Coping Strategy (Oláh, 2005), a Temperament and Character Factors (TCI, Hungarian adaptation by Rózsa et al., 2004), a Big Five Questionare (BFQ, Hungarian adaptation by Rózsa et al., 2000). The job characteristics (eg. in court for years, workload, status), and satisfaction and happiness at work was measured by our questionare. Our results show that: teachers differ in some personality factors compared to other higher education graduates. Among the factors temperament harm avoidance and reward dependence is higher, while the persistence is lower. The dimensions of characters indicates the low level of self-worth and self-acceptance among teachers. The BFQ test results also showed meaningful differences. Significant differences were observed in two dimensions, energy and openness to experience. In both cases, there was lower means. Coping with stress also has found a significant difference compared to other graduates in higher education. On the positive difference that teachers often prefer person-oriented coping strategies. However, unfortunately, it appears the self punishment and the resignation in stressful situations. The three factors of burnout syndrome (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal accomplishment) are relatively constans in different groups being tested three times since 2003 despite changes in the conditions of education. However, the proportion at risk of burnout is increasing. Until in 2003, 17.83% of the teachers were endangered, in the group tested in 2014 this rate is already 36%. The results of the regression analysis, the prevention of burnout workplace factors of happiness at work play one of the most important role. The personality factors are the need to strengthen, the self-directedness, intellectual openness, friendliness and self-regulatory system in prevention.
I00|Social Networking Addiction: Are the youth of India and United States Addicted?|Social Networking is the mainstay that aided the survival of internet during the turbulent times of E-commerce. Internet users stayed glued to social networking websites especially Facebook, which started advertising to them and hence they started buying. The extent of its growth makes it an interesting and unexplored area of research. The advantages it provides are immense and hence it has penetrated into our daily lives, but theres a flip side to it ? excessive usage per day; inferiority complex creeping in, when the happening lives of friends and family are portrayed on Facebook, feeling lonely has been cited as a reason leading to the increased use of SN websites, causing more loneliness as the end product; addiction arising out of pleasure, etc. This paper aims to study the Facebook usage pattern of a sample of students from United States and India, and gauge the pattern and relate the same as symptoms of addiction.
I00|Higher Education System in Georgia: Reforms and Modern Challenges|Georgia is wealthy with higher educated population. Society is best served if higher education system enjoys academic freedom and requisite institutional autonomy. A strong education system designed to ensure genuine opportunity for all to reach their full potential and continue to improve their knowledge and capacities throughout their lives will raise such society. In 2004 the Law on Higher Education was adopted, which regulates conduct of educational and scientific research activities of higher educational institutions in Georgia, the principles and procedures of management and funding of higher education, establishes the rules and procedures of foundation, performance, reorganization and liquidation of a higher education institution, as well as the principles of authorization and accreditation. In 1999 Ministry of Education of Georgia started implementing Georgian Education System Realignment and Strengthening Program, funded by the World Bank. Within the framework of the program, the Ministry set up an assessment component. The staff of the component was sent to CITO, an assessment center in Netherlands, where they did professional training and participated in preparation of the program. In 2002 the National Examinations were carried out in Georgia for the first time. In 2005, based on the decision of the Georgian government, the Soviet system for university admissions was replaced by the modern system what is considered as one of the most successful reforms conducted in Georgia. Georgia is the country of universities. There were 198 higher education institutions in 2004 with 172.5 thousands students. During Soviet Union, in 1990s, there were about 600 higher education institutions. The vast majority of the students, about 75%, are engaged in public universities, the rest 25% - in private ones. In 2014, there were 72 higher education institutions.Strong correlation exists between students? schooling background and their participation in higher education. Financial support is available for the students with highest attainments what can also encourage older workers to retrain or upgrade qualifications. The most important criteria in the decision of choosing university is probably the quality of education and prestige. Other important criteria are the global recognition of programmes on offer, modernity of teaching methods.Overall, students are predominantly looking for a specific and high-quality offer in their area of programmes, at an up-to-date and well-managed institution of high standards which they can afford.
I00|Preliminary Estimates of Good Life Time (GLT) in Canada Using the General Social Survey|There has been a recent resurgence of interest in measures of social progress and well-being that go beyond the conventional System of National Accounts measures, especially GDP and GDP per capita. In this context, Wolfson and Rowe (2010) have proposed Good Life Time (GLT) as an alternative / complement to traditional economic measures. GLT is based on a generalization of life expectancy and a person is said to be in GLT if they have adequate amounts of health, money, and the time to enjoy them. In this study, we develop a simple approach using public microdata from the 1992, 1998, 2005, and 2010 General Social Surveys. We conclude that issues related to high item non-response rates and lack of time series consistency in many of the key questionnaire items, especially in the money and health domains, likely overwhelm any time series trends obtained in this manner. Microsimulation or synthetic matching are therefore the recommended methods to obtain time series trends of GLT.
I00|Health burden and costs of obesity and overweight in Germany: an update|In 2011, Konnopka et al. (Eur J Health Econ 12:345–352, 2011 ) published a top-down cost of illness study on the health burden, and direct and indirect costs of morbidity and mortality attributable to excess weight (BMI ≥25 kg/m 2 ) in Germany in 2002. The objective of the current study was to update the 2002 estimates to the year 2008. To simplify comparisons, we closely followed the methods and assumptions of the original study, using 2008 data for most input parameters (e.g. prevalence, mortality, resource use, costs). Excess weight related deaths increased by 31 % (from 36,653 to 47,964) and associated years of potential life lost (from 428,093 to 588,237) and quality adjusted life years lost (from 367,722 to 505,748) by about 37 %, respectively. Excess weight caused €16,797 million in total costs in 2008 (+70 %), of which €8,647 million were direct costs (corresponding to 3.27 % of total German health care expenditures in 2008). About 73 % (€12,235 million) of total excess weight related costs were attributable to obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 ). The main drivers of direct costs were endocrinological (44 %) and cardiovascular (38 %) diseases. Indirect costs amounted to €8,150 million in 2008 (+62 %), of which about two-thirds were indirect costs from unpaid work. The great majority of indirect costs were due to premature mortality (€5,669 million). The variation of input parameters (univariate sensitivity analyses) resulted in attributable costs between €8,978 million (−47 % compared to base case) and €25,060 million (+49 %). The marked increase in excess weight related costs can largely be explained by increases in the prevalence of overweight and obesity, and to a lesser extent from increases in resource consumption, as well as increases in (unit) costs and wages (comprising 5.5 % inflation).

I00|Financial distress and happiness of employees in times of economic crisis| Using data for 28 European countries for the period 2008 to 2012, we examine whether employed individuals are affected by the economic crisis. We provide robust evidence that unfavourable macroeconomic conditions are negatively associated with the life satisfaction of employees. In addition, we find that higher levels of regional unemployment and inflation are predominantly associated with lower levels of life satisfaction for employees who are in a bad financial situation or who expect that their future financial situation will be worse. By contrast, employed people who do well financially and who have good prospects are not affected by the crisis.
I00|Motivations for Bilateral Aid Allocation in Korea: Humanitarian, Commercial, or Diplomatic?|This study investigates Korea's motivations for foreign aid allocation, analyzing panel data from over 180 countries for the last 20 years. The results show that Korea's aid allocation reflects both recipient needs and Korea's own national interests but does not consistently consider aid effectiveness. Korean aid is also characterized by its use as an instrument of both summit diplomacy and resource security. In addition, its commercial motivations appear to have shifted over time, from export promotion to overseas investment support. Despite internal and external pressures, there is no obvious evidence that Korea's allocation rule converges with international guidelines that recommend greater consideration of recipient needs and aid effectiveness and less consideration of donor interests. © 2015 The Earth Institute at Columbia University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
I00|The Subprime Crisis: Is Government Housing Policy to Blame?|Some have suggested that housing policy, embodied by the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and affordable housing goals of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), caused the subprime crisis. We examine if these programs led to worse mortgage outcomes using two approaches. The first examines whether more activity by CRA-covered lenders, or more loan sales to the GSEs, was associated with worse outcomes. The second uses regression discontinuity to determine if outcomes were worse at the geographic thresholds used by each program. Our results suggest that neither program played a significant role in the subprime crisis. © 2015 The President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
I00|A unified structural equation modeling approach for the decomposition of rank-dependent indicators of socioeconomic inequality of health|In this paper we present a unified framework for the regression-based decomposition of rank-dependent indicators of socioeconomic inequality of health, of which the Concentration Index is the best known example. Such indicators of socioeconomic inequality of health are bivariate in nature because they measure the degree of correlation between health and socioeconomic status. Erreygers and Kessels (2013) have proposed a set of two-dimensional decompositions that investigate both variables simultaneously. The most salient of these decompositions is the simultaneous super-decomposition based on the bivariate multiple regression model explaining health and socioeconomic status simultaneously. This decomposition captures not only the direct contributions of the explanatory variables in the regressions, but also their combined contributions. However, the two-dimensional decomposition analysis suffers from the drawback that socioeconomic status is not included as an explanatory variable in the regression of health, and health as an explanatory variable in the regression of socioeconomic status. This was primarily done to compare the two-dimensional simultaneous super-decomposition to the one-dimensional decompositions that are based on regressions of only one of the two variables under consideration. For these one-dimensional decompositions, including either of the variables as an explanatory variable in the single regressions distorts the explanation of the correlation between health and socioeconomic status. Therefore, for the two-dimensional super-decomposition, the bivariate multiple regression modeling framework was chosen which includes neither health nor socioeconomic status as an explanatory variable. Nevertheless, several empirical studies have shown that one of the most important determinants of health is socioeconomic status. Another limitation of the bivariate multiple regression model is that the same set of variables was used to explain both health and socioeconomic status, which may not be the most appropriate assumption given that the determinants of health and socioeconomic status need not be the same. To bridge the gap between empirical observations and modeling practice, we provide a flexible modeling approach for the decomposition of socioeconomic inequality of health that makes use of a structural or simultaneous equation model (SEM) that incorporates socioeconomic status as an explanatory variable in the regression of health and health as an explanatory variable in the regression of socioeconomic status. Reference note: ERREYGERS, Guido and Roselinde KESSELS (2013), Regression-based decompositions of rank-dependent indicators of socioeconomic inequality of health, In: Rosa Dias, P., O'Donnell, O. (Eds.), Health and Inequality (Research on Economic Inequality, Volume 21), Emerald Group Publishing Limited, Chapter 9: pp. 227-259. We use a structural or simultaneous equation model (SEM) to determine the factors that explain socioeconomic inequality of health, which is bivariate in nature. We consider a set of two equations in which health and socioeconomic status are assumed endogenous or jointly determined by the system of simultaneous equations. The remainder of the variables in the SEM are exogenous and constitute two different sets in the two equations, which is also needed to consistently estimate all parameters of the SEM. We use two-stage least squares (2SLS) to estimate the SEM which is the most common estimation procedure for this purpose. The SEM approach is much more flexible than the bivariate multiple regression model used in Erreygers and Kessels (2013) because of the simultaneous feedback mechanism between health and socioeconomic status and the two different sets of possible determinants of health and socioeconomic status. As a result, the SEM approach provides an improved solution to the regression-based decomposition of socioeconomic inequality of health. We base our results on data from the Ethiopia 2011 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) involving children under the age of five. The health variable we have chosen is actually an ill-health variable: the degree of stunting or malnutrition, which provides information on the depth of malnutrition with children. The 2SLS estimates of the structural equation system confirm that health is largely influenced by socioeconomic status, while the opposite relationship is only marginally true. We reformulated the 2SLS estimates into parameter estimates of the reduced form of the SEM, which we then used in the two-dimensional simultaneous super-decomposition developed by Erreygers and Kessels (2013). In accordance with the decomposition analysis, the results can be divided into two phases. First, we show that the reduced-form parameter estimates are much more accurate than the ordinary least squares estimates from the bivariate multiple regression model used in Erreygers and Kessels (2013). Second, the use of the reduced-form parameter estimates results in a more precise super-decomposition of socioeconomic inequality of health. Because the two-dimensional super-decomposition allows the construction of one-dimensional decompositions, similar improvements are also observed for the one-dimensional decompositions. To conclude, the SEM approach provides a unified framework for obtaining reliable decomposition results for indicators of socioeconomic inequality of health that are bivariate in nature. It is a very flexible approach because it takes into account all possible relationships between variables.
I00|Public and private expenditures on human capital: Accumulation in India|We study a model of human capital driven growth, where the parents human capital serves as a productive input in the childs human capital production only when that of the former exceeds a minimum level required to intellectually contribute to the child's learning. Private and public expenditures on education enter in the childs human capital production function, and are allowed to vary in terms of substitutability and relative productivity. Households receive income from labor and face both labor and consumption taxes. The government receives consumption tax revenues and a proportion of income tax revenues and spends these revenues on public education. We calibrate the model to a state in India and experimentally increase public education spending through various tax instruments. We lnd that raising the consumption tax generates about as much economic growth as realizing an increase in the center-state transfer from the federal level. We also lnd that lnancing this increase in public spending through the labor tax increases economic growth by less than utilizing the consumption tax; however, it reduces inequality by more than utilizing the consumption tax. Hence, there is growth-inequality trade-ok. We extend our results by characterizing their dependence on the degree of substitutability between public and private education spending.
I00|Spillover Effects of Local Human Capital Stock on Adult Obesity: Evidence from German Neighborhoods|This paper is the first to estimate the causal effect of local human capital stock on individual adiposity and adds to the existing literature on estimating human capital externalities at the neighborhood level. We explore the possible causal pathways that college-educated neighbors exert on individual body weight, with the results revealing small yet significant human capital spillover effects. Among all adults, a percentage point increase in the neighborhood college graduates share results in a decrease of individual body mass index by 0.0026 log points, as well as a decrease of the individual likelihood of being overweight by 0.77 percentage points. Among high school graduates and college graduates, a percentage point increase in the neighborhood college graduates share results in a decrease of individual likelihood of being overweight by approximately 0.83 percentage points.
I00|Social Factors Affecting Women's Susceptibility to HIV in India|India is the global epicentre of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Asia. Previous research indicates that the majority of HIV-positive women in India were infected by their husbands, their only sexual partner, which makes them difficult to identify as a high-risk population. This paper assesses social factors associated with the transmission of HIV based on demographic determinants, such as age; sexual risk behavior; and gendered discrimination, such as domestic violence. Bivariate and multivariate analysis of the National Family Health Survey yields the result that women's socioeconomic status could have an association with their serostatus, as HIV-positive women were significantly more likely to have a low level of education than their HIV-negative counterparts. In contrast, female HIV-positive respondents displayed low tendencies toward high-risk sexual behavior, as less than 10% had two or more sexual partners in their lifetime. Finally, they were significantly more likely to have previously experienced domestic violence (45%) and sexual violence (22%) than the general population. Overall, results illustrate that Indian women's vulnerability toward HIV infection may not be the product of their own sexual risk behavior. The most prominent social factors are their socioeconomic status, such as their level of education, and other sociodemographic determinants, including their region of residence.
I00|Overvalued and Underestimated. Veblen’s Contribution to the Analysis of (un-)Sustainable Consumption|Veblen’s concept of conspicuous consumption is often cited to explain why consumption habits in our consumer societies tend to be unsustainable and ever increasing. However, much more than blaming individual consumption habits Veblen sharply analyzed quite some of the societal and economic forces which drive the framework conditions for unsustainable consumption: the vested interests and the absentee ownership. The paper follows the path Veblen’s thoughts have taken trough economic and social literature over the last centuryand highlights how the actual sustainable consumption debate could make better use of Veblen’s insights e.g. in requesting the constitutive institutions for property. Opportunities for Strong Sustainable Consumption obviously presuppose radical changes, social innovations and thinking out of the box.
I00|Tribal Population in India: Regional Dimensions & Imperatives|Scheduled Tribe (ST) population represents a heterogeneous group scattered in different regions of India. The differences are noticed in language, cultural practices, socio-economic status and pattern of livelihood. The STs are confronted with problems like forced migration, exploitation, displacement due to industrialization, debt traps and poverty. Based on the regional classification with diverse socio-cultural issues, the present paper focuses on the profile of tribal population through an analysis of the socio-economic indicators like literacy, work participation, livelihood, occupational pattern, health, poverty and migration. The impact of industrialization and urbanization on ST population residing in different regions has been highlighted. The paper has been concluded with relevant suggestions with implications for policies with a focus on region specific issues.
I00|Development and Disparity in Bihar|This paper addresses issue of inter-district disparity at district-level in Bihar. An attempt has been made to identify the backward regions/districts of the state in terms of four development sectors for instance, agriculture, services, education and health. The study has used 34 indicators which explain the level of economic and social development. For measuring disparity and inter-district variations in the state, Principal Component Analysis has been employed. On the basis of composite score and the ranks of districts in terms of different sectors, an attention has been drawn to see relationship between economic and social development sector. The analysis shows that development is centred only in Patna due to being a capital city of the state and has been able to pulling up resources and all the beneficiaries in the state. There is need of hour to allocate resources at more sub-state level or disaggregated level so that balance regional development can be achieved.
