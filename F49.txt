F49|Granger Causality Between Local Government Expenditure and Economic Growth in Indonesia|Objective - This study examines the causal relationship between government expenditure and economic growth in West Kalimantan between 2009 and 2015. This research resulted in the enactment of Wagner's Law and/or Keynes's Theory in West Kalimantan leading the local government to take the right policies as an effort towards improving economic development. Methodology/Technique - By using panel data that combines time series data and cross-site data, it will be estimated by the Granger causality test which begins with a stationary test and co-integration test. Based on the co-integration tests, the results suggest that there is a long-term relationship between government expenditure and economic growth. Meanwhile, based on the Granger causality test, there is no reciprocal relationship between government expenditure and economic growth. Findings - A direct relationship in the form of the influence of government expenditure on economic growth in West Kalimantan. Novelty - These results are in line with the Keynes's Theory through its national income function.
F49|Greece and the Troika – Lessons from International Best Practice Cases of Successful Price (and Wage) Adjustment|This paper reviews cases of successful price and wage adjustment, which are often regarded as constituting best practice, Australia, Latvia and the newly-formed German states and contrasts them with the Greek experience under the Troika Program. Latvia stands out as having had the quickest adjustment in wages. By contrast, before the crisis, Greek wages appeared to have been largely insensitive to labour market conditions but this changed with the program. We find that the reaction of wages to unemployment in Greece under the program was increasingly similar to that observed in Germany and Portugal (a case which has attracted less attention). A priori it is likely that the change in wage behaviour in Greece was due to the labour market reforms imposed under the program. But this cannot be proven beyond doubt.
F49|Impact of hard and soft infrastructure: Evidence from the EU partners, North Africa and CEECs|In this paper, we analyze how a set of slow moving determinants affect trade between the EU on one hand, and CEECs (Central and Eastern European countries) and African countries on the other hand, over the period 2005-2012. We focus on two sets of slow moving determinants, doing business institutions and logistical infrastructure, as well as embassies and ambassadors, by controlling for many other possible time-invariant trade cost determinants. Trade is disentangled for three types of goods: primary goods, parts and components and capital goods. Methodologically, we first derive dyadic country-pair fixed effects and in a second stage we correlate fixed effects with a set of influential factors. In our analysis, (i) we identify the beneficial effects of soft and hard infrastructure; (ii) we compare the latter with the benefit of opening an embassy and also compute the extra trade that would follow a move towards a better score of the trade facilitation and doing business indicators; and (iii) we show that a huge part of the missing bilateral trade fixed effect of North African countries is accounted for by soft and hard infrastructure, and that diplomatic activity is also a powerful driver of regional integration.

F49|International Trade Of Romania In The Context Of Its Low Economic Potential|"The study provides a view on Romanian economy in terms of its competitiveness and potential for sustaining an efficient foreign trade. After reviewing literature and the reports of prestigious institutions and bodies in the area, the author presents several elements providing an accurate image on current quantitative and qualitative parameters of Romanian foreign trade, the internal and foreign processes influencing it and its main trends. The theoretical, legislative and institutional background of the paper was developed earlier by the author in his monograph - ""The legal and financial regime applicable to international foreign trade"" published in 2008 by ArtPress Publishing House after Romania joined the European Union. In this study, however, the focus is placed on major changes that have occurred in Romania’s foreign trade after it joined the European structures."

It analyses the Brazilian economy during the period 2001-2010 and concludes that: i) the reduction of the stock-vulnerability of the Brazilian economy, as demonstrated during the global crisis beginning in 2008, was due to a new composition of the International Investment Position, and an increase in international reserves and external liabilities denominated in the domestic currency, and these tend to suffer a double devaluation (price and exchange rates) in times of crisis; ii) net income sent abroad in this period amounted to US$ 273 billion, crystallizing the flow-vulnerability through dependence on external financing for the current account deficit; iii) variations in prices of external stocks is the most important variable in the changes of balances of the International Investment Position.
F49|Currency Wars: Who Gains from the Battle?|We study the growth effects of currency undervaluation when countries employ active exchange rate management policies or impose capital controls, using a panel dataset of 185 countries. Applying two-stage regressions, we find that changes in undervaluation driven by exchange rate management and capital control policies have no significant impact on economic growth. Undervaluation that leads to higher growth mainly stems from policies that lower government consumption, reduce inflation and increase domestic savings. However, these policies are good for growth by themselves, with only limited additional growth effects through increased currency undervaluation. In sum, we find no evidence that battling in the currency depreciation war significantly increases a country's growth rate.
F49|Trade openness, export diversification, and political regimes|Recent studies have challenged the view that trade openness leads to more specialization in countries’ trade. Using a panel of 116 countries over 35 years, we show that openness can be positively associated with both specialization and diversification, depending on the measure used. Moreover, for developing countries in our sample, the effect of openness on trade structure depends on the type of political regime: in autocracies openness is linked with specialization, whilst in democracies it is related to diversification via export sophistication.
F49|Dynamic steam coal market integration: Evidence from rolling cointegration analysis|The aim of the paper is twofold: first, to assess the dynamics of the integration process of the international steam coal prices and, second, to investigate the changes in the roles of particular coal prices in this market in the light of changes in the structure of supply and demand. The analysis is based on steam coal prices set by the largest world exporters and importers on both the Atlantic and the Pacific markets. We use weekly data spanning from October 5, 2001 to March 28, 2014. The aim is achieved in two stages. During the first one, we use the rolling trace test to identify the integration of the steam coal market, and during the second one, we apply the rolling weak exogeneity test to determine the roles of the participants of the international steam coal market, namely price setters and price takers. Our main findings can be summarized in two observations. Firstly, the main world steam coal prices are integrated and during the period when freight costs are higher, the coal market integration is weaker, and when the costs are lower, the integration is stronger. Secondly, the role of particular coal prices is not stable in time. Generally, price setters appear in the market which covers greater shares in the physical coal trade. Although Indonesia and Russia have a great share in the global export, their prices remain price takers during the whole period. As a consequence, although Russia remains the largest coal exporter of the steam coal to the European market, it cannot dictate its prices in this market.
F49|Trade Liberalization and Economic Growth in Nigeria: Do Concern Matters?|Purpose: The present study investigates the relationship between trade and economic growth. Methodology: This paper uses the Johansen co-integration approach, Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square (FMOLS) approach to analyse the relationship among trade liberalization, export, import, population growth and economic growth. Findings: Results show there is long run equilibrium among trade liberalization, export, import, population growth and economic growth. A negative and significant relationship exists between trade liberalization and economic growth. Both export and import show positive and significant results. Population shows an insignificant effect on economic growth of Nigeria. It is therefore concluded that concern about trade liberalization in Nigeria should not be a priority. Recommendations: However, the paper recommends among others that priorities should be given on how to fight corruption which is the major problem of the country.
F49|Has Quantitative Easing Affected the U.S. Treasury Auction Market?|A dataset of every U.S. Treasury auction from 2003 to 2012 investigates how Federal Reserve policy of quantitative easing (QE) affects the high-yield at Treasury auctions. Market structural factors known in advance (Federal funds rate, Standard and Poor’s, Chicago Board Option Exchange Market Volatility Index) are significant for the auction high-yield, but the relationships change with QE. The Federal-funds rate is less correlated to bills high-yield during QE. Before QE, equity market and risk channels have the same relationship to bond and bill high-yields. During QE, correlations tighten for bond high-yields, but drop dramatically for bills. Auction-specific bid-cover is more strongly negatively associated with bills high-yield during QE. indirect bidders (a proxy for foreign central banks) may put relatively more downward pressure on bond high-yields. The changes in these correlations could affect borrowing costs and Fed balance sheet exposure going forward. Copyright International Atlantic Economic Society 2015

F49|The China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone: Background, Developments and Preliminary Assessment of Initial Impacts|The China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone (SPFTZ) founded one year ago is a trial for China’s new round of reform and opening out, which has promised liberalization on capital account and trade facilitation as its main objectives. Here we discuss the differences between the SPFTZ and other free trade areas, and the developments of the SPFTZ in the past year. We also make a preliminary assessment of the SPFTZ’s initial impacts, especially of its impact on China’s capital account opening and financial liberalization. It is possible that the successful practice of the SPFTZ and more pilot policies replicated in China will give rise to a more balanced Chinese economy in the following decade.
F49|Phenomenology Of Punishable Behaviors In The Economy And Their Impact On The Success Of The Organizations|In the economic sphere success is measured by the economic parameters. Business profitability is utilitarian assumption of economic success. The success of organizations depends on the management. Therefore, the economic responsibility of management and business organizations is imperative. In addition to economic, there are other types of responsibilities in business: social, ethical and legal. Each of them carries their own relevance. Legal responsibility is an obligation to respect the legal regulations of a given country in conducting business. Punishable behaviors are defined as behaviors contrary to the legal norms for which sanctions are prescribed. The main motivation for committing punishable behaviors in the field of economy lies in achieving illegal gain for oneself and/or causing damage to the others. In market competition, freedom of participants is granted, but it cannot be absolute. Their competitiveness is essential; however, it must be regulated. The economic success of the organizations must be in correlation with the legal perfection of their business. Economic behaviors in accordance with the rules should be accepted and promoted while opposite behaviors should be detected and sanctioned. Punishable behaviors are diverse. They can be categorized according to several criteria, e.g. the object of protection, modus operandi, the segment of the economy, characteristics of the perpetrator, and types of injured parties. However, the basic criteria in categorizing punishable behaviors are their substance and intensity of the consequences (danger, harmfulness) they cause. Punishable behaviors, in accordance with the above criteria,
F49|The Development of External Macroeconomic Imbalances in European Countries in Connection with Running Integration Processes|In the course of the last decade, significant and persisting macroeconomic imbalances accumulated which there were one of the main causes of the economic crisis. The aim of the article is to evaluate the development of external macroeconomic imbalances in European countries in the course of the years 2004 - 2013, and to find out how this development in the member countries of the Eurozone differed from the European countries outside the Eurozone. External macroeconomic imbalances were defined on the basis of Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedures (MIP) Scoreboard. Based on the evaluation of the development of individual indicators, it is possible to state that till 2009 macroeconomic imbalances were more often seen in the countries outside the Eurozone and the Eurozone countries were characterised by bigger external stability. This trend changed for all the indicators after 2009 when the proportion of Eurozone countries in the number of the countries with an imbalance was higher than the proportion of the countries outside the Eurozone. From this point of view therefore the countries outside the Eurozone managed the crisis and post-crisis period better than the Eurozone countries, which could be a result of the possibility to use tools of autonomous monetary policy and the possibility to modify an exchange rate in the non-EMU countries and at the same time of the non-existence of adequate mechanisms which would compensate the loss of these tools in the EMU countries. The conclusions arrived at also do not support the Hypothesis of Integration Process Endogeneity which assumes growing mutual interconnection and economic alignment of the economies in time and in connection with the achievement of a qualitatively higher level of integration.
F49|Modelling International Trade In Art - Modified Gravity Approach|The issue of modelling international trade in works of art has been taken up in the paper. It presents the gravity approach to the international trade in art in European Community countries. The analysis is based on Eurostat international trade data (Harmonised System for export and import chapter 97 ? works of art, collectors? pieces and antiques, including respective kinds of works of art: paintings, drawings and pastels; collages, graphic arts, sculptures and antiques). The gravity model is based on nonlinear (power function) regression made in Statistica 9.0 software. It should be underlined that instead of GDP, traditionally used in gravity models of international trade, author proposes to use art markets? turnovers on internal markets as independent variables. Using the mentioned model the author explains the influence of art markets of considered countries and distances between them on total export and import of work of art.
F49|Which precious metals spill over on which, when and why? Some evidence| Much academic and investor analysis and commentary see the four main precious metals as a single market, integrated and to some degree with each metal a substitute for the other. This proposition, which can be explicit or implicit, can be challenged on economic and statistical grounds. Using the Diebold and Yilmaz (2009) methodology, we show that the market is only weakly integrated, that this degree of integration is time varying and that it differs as between returns and volatility.
F49|Trade Law, Domestic Regulation and Development|"Trade Law, Domestic Regulation and Development is about the relationship between trade, regulation and development. By combining law and economics perspectives on the international trading system, Trachtman takes an interdisciplinary approach in analyzing the topic of globalization and economic development. In a developing economy, as globalization proceeds, a critical factor is the relationship between liberalization of movement of goods, services, and people, on the one hand, and the right to regulate, including the right to regulate for development, on the other hand. In the context of market access, all countries need the right to restrict imports of goods or services that may hurt consumers or the broader society, and developing countries sometimes need the ability to subsidize their own goods and services, or sometimes to restrict imports of goods or services, in order to promote development. Nonetheless, both developed and developing countries often fall into the trap of regulating for protectionist or corrupt reasons. Finding the right balance between market access and regulation is the subject of analysis in this collected volume of 16 papers by Trachtman, and presented in a manner that is accessible and interesting to both law and economics readers. In Trachtman's own words, ""The purpose of [international] trade law in this context [globalization] seems to be to allow states to agree to avoid creating these inefficient policy externalities, not to force all states to dance to the same tune."""
F49|Philippines – Taxes on Distilled Spirits: Like Products and Market Definition|This paper provides a legal–economic analysis of the Appellate Body decision in Philippines – Taxes on Distilled Spirits (Philippines–Spirits). In Philippines–Spirits, the Panel and the Appellate Body had an opportunity to consider again the scope of ‘like products’ and of ‘directly competitive or substitutable products’ under Article III:2 of GATT. The Panel and Appellate Body followed the Border Tax Adjustments factors in order to determine whether the products were sufficiently similar. The Appellate Body explicitly extended its jurisprudence from other areas of Article III to a like-products determination under the first sentence of Article III:2: this analysis is to be focused on the degree of competition between the imported and domestic products. We observe that the effect of different taxation on domestic products is affected by the degree of substitution between products as well as competitive conditions, whereas the Appellate Body seems to focus on the former and ignore the latter. We also question some of the Panel and Appellate Body interpretations of the evidence regarding the degree of substitution between products. Overall, we find that even if there may be a segment in which foreign and domestic products compete, the reported evidence in this case would seem to be consistent with the view that for the bulk of the market, foreign and domestic items are distant substitutes.Putting aside the jurisprudence, a methodologically sound finding regarding substitution (and competition) seems necessary, but not sufficient, for a finding of inefficient discrimination. In order to find inefficient discrimination, there must also be a finding that the nonprotectionist benefits that may arise from the national regulation are not sufficient to justify the discriminatory action, otherwise, rational regulation that is globally efficient might be invalidated, inappropriately restricting the national right to regulate. In the present case, the Philippines articulated no nonprotectionist rationale for its distinctions. Existing WTO jurisprudence in this area prior to the Appellate Body decision in US-Clove Cigarettes (in the context of Article 2.1 of the technical barriers to trade agreement) has only hinted at the additional focus on the justificatory role of nonprotectionist regulatory benefits, yet an explicit and appropriately contextualized reference to the nonprotectionist rationale, if any, of regulation seems to be a necessary part of decision-making.

F49|Brazil – Measures Affecting Imports of Retreaded Tyres: A Balancing Act|This paper provides a legal-economic analysis of the Appellate Body decision in Brazil–Retreaded Tyres. We develop a simple economic model that we use to analyze the market structure and environmental externalities that were most relevant to this case. We start by analyzing Brazil's policies in a model in which tyre retreading generates a positive production externality through the delay it provides society before a used tyre becomes a waste product with the potential to harm society through its adverse impact on human health and the environment. We examine the different welfare implications of (i) a production subsidy for retreading of once-used Brazilian tyres, (ii) a tariff on imports of retreaded tyres, and (iii) a ban on imports of retreaded tyres. While a production subsidy is the first-best instrument to address this type of externality, there are reasons to believe that it might be infeasible. The welfare implications of the other measures depend importantly on the magnitude of the positive production externality. From the lens provided by this economic analysis, we draw three primary insights. First, we identify the critical piece of empirical information that the Panel and Appellate Body require to make a rational judgment of the utility of the Brazilian policies contested in the dispute – i.e., the size of the underlying externality associated with retreading. Second, if the justification for the original import ban on retreaded tyres was based on the argument that it was a second-best Brazilian policy designed to combat a large externality, then Brazil's failure to enforce a ban on used-tyre imports has the troubling result of eroding those potential welfare gains through a reduction in equilibrium production (and consumption) of Brazilian retreaded tyres. Third, the Brazilian policy that exempted from the ban retreaded imports from MERCOSUR partners also has the same troubling feature. The second and third points are congruent with the reasons for the Appellate Body's determination that the Brazilian policy did not qualify under the chapeau of Article XX. We examine the WTO jurisprudence of Article XX(b), in order to compare the methodology developed under this jurisprudence to the type of examination of changes to total welfare from implementing one policy relative to a postulated alternative policy that most economists would follow. We find that the WTO jurisprudence in this area is internally incoherent, and also fails to evaluate the types of concerns that an economic-welfare analysis would evaluate.

F49|Continued Suspense: Ec–Hormones And Wto Disciplines On Discrimination And Domestic Regulation|Based on the reasoning of the Appellate Body in Canada/United States — Continued Suspension of Obligations in the EC–Hormones Dispute (‘Continued Suspension’), this paper analyzes the distinction between the national-treatment obligation under Article III of GATT and the requirement under the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures that such measures be based on a risk assessment that takes into account available scientific evidence. The Appellate Body's reasoning makes clear that the primary purpose of the SPS Agreement is to discipline discriminatory regulation, and not the level of protection. We argue that the case clarifies that de facto protection (market segmentation) created by an SPS measure must be motivated by demonstrating that the measure is addressing a market failure, as reflected in the existence of some scientific basis for a health or safety concern. The scientific-basis requirement is a means for determining the intent of an SPS measure. While this is a factor that is ostensibly not relevant in GATT national-treatment cases, the need for scientific justification is not a move away from a concern with preventing illegitimate discrimination against imported products.
F49|Embedding mutual recognition at the WTO|Mutual recognition is a useful tool for international liberalization in particular contexts. However, it poses two important types of risk. First, it could jeopardize a satisfactory level of prudential regulation. In order to address these risks, mutual recognition should be limited to initiatives that can be supported by satisfactory essential harmonization that can protect a satisfactory level of prudential regulation. Second, mutual recognition could disadvantage poor states, either de jure through closed recognition among developed states or de facto through harmonization or equivalence conditions that are excessive, or excessively costly, for poor states. In order to address these risks, mutual recognition initiatives should be designed to be accessible to poor states.

F49|Regulatory Jurisdiction And The Wto|The WTO is not explicitly concerned with the problem of regulatory jurisdiction in connection with prudential regulation (as opposed to industrial policy regulation). However, as the WTO has addressed increasingly complex regulatory barriers to trade, it has developed several devices that have the implicit effect of allocating regulatory jurisdiction among states. This article reviews a few illustrative cases in WTO law, including Helms–Burton, Shrimp, and Gambling. This review suggests how these cases may be understood as dealing with allocation of regulatory jurisdiction. Negative integration rules such as national treatment or proportionality may serve as devices applied by tribunals for allocation of regulatory authority. The WTO has very limited rules of positive integration—whereby states either harmonize regulation or agree on more specific allocations of regulatory authority, such as mutual recognition. However, it has developed a modest degree of capacity to engage in positive regulation, or to refer to positive integration rules developed in other contexts, such as Codex Alimentarius. Finally, this article examines theoretical bases for allocating and reallocating regulatory jurisdiction in order to establish a framework by which to analyse the role of the WTO in this context.
F49|The World Trading System, the International Legal System and Multilevel Choice|This article develops a theory of multilevel choice of regulatory jurisdiction based on normative individualism, and suggests how certain features of the World Trade Organization (WTO) might be understood in terms of this theory. The WTO has some capacity for positive integration, as demonstrated in, for example, the harmonised minimum standards for intellectual property protection contained in the TRIPS agreement. Yet the WTO has generally not been used as a site for re-regulation in areas congruent with its de-regulation. However, in a limited way, and in particular contexts, it provides certain incentives for re-regulation at other sites. For example, both the SPS Agreement and the TBT Agreement encourage the formation of harmonised rules. These agreements require Member States to use international standards as a basis for their measures, with important exceptions.
F49|Incorporating Development Among Diverse Members|Given the current state of multilateral trade negotiations, it appears that preferential trade agreements (PTAs) will serve as the main vehicle for increased liberalization in the short term. The question arises, therefore, whether the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) should and could include provisions for special treatment for developing countries, and what other aspects of the TPP have special effects on the growth of developing countries. An important range of issues relates to the preservation of policy space for developing countries to take measures to promote their development. PTAs do not normally have significant arrangements for so-called “special and differential treatment,” which at the WTO includes expanded market access for developing countries in developed country markets, and abstention by developed countries from demands for reciprocal market opening of developing countries. Since the TPP is hoped to have an expanding membership, and is heralded as a “21st Century” trade agreement, it is worthwhile to consider what types of special provisions would be appropriate to be included relating to developing countries.

F49|Toward Open Recognition? Standardization And Regional Integration Under Article Xxiv Of Gatt|This article provides a legal analysis of the significance of standards, technical regulations, and sanitary or phytosanitary (SPS) provisions (collectively, ‘TBTSPS’ provisions) in regional trade agreements (‘RTAs’) in relation to the multilateral trading system. It first examines the ways in which RTA regulation of national TBTSPS measures may contribute to or detract from liberalization goals. It then describes how GATT Article XXIV and the Understanding on the Interpretation of Article XXIV (the ‘Understanding’), as presently understood, regulate RTA regulation of national TBTSPS measures. Based on its analysis, this article makes the following recommendations: (1) Interpret Article XXIV:5 of GATT to provide an exception from obligations contained in the TBT Agreement and SPS Agreement, principally the MFN obligation, in accordance with the Turkey – Textiles necessity test. This avoids imposing an inappropriate barrier to formation of RTAs. (2) Interpret ‘other restrictive regulations of commerce’ and ‘other regulations of commerce’ in Articles XXIV:5 and 8 to include only discriminatory and unnecessary TBT or SPS measures. This avoids requirements to eliminate or harmonize non-protectionist TBT or SPS measures. It avoids imposing an inappropriate barrier to formation of RTAs. (3) Interpret Article I:1 of GATT and the MFN provisions of the TBT Agreement and SPS Agreement to clarify authorization for only ‘open’ mutual recognition agreements, similar to the permission contained in Article VII of GATS. This ensures that recognition arrangements will not provide an avenue of discrimination or other defection from WTO multilateral free trade principles. Today, it is not clear that any mutual recognition agreements are authorized.
F49|Does foreign direct investment synchronise business cycles? Results from a panel approach|This study readdresses the determinants of business cycle synchronisation. We test, on the one hand, whether FDI promoting policies may have consequences for the business cycle comovement between countries, and on the other hand, whether more plausible identification strategies change previous results. Our results suggest that linkages through foreign direct investment contribute in most cases positively to the synchronisation between country pairs. In contrast, the beneficial effects of trade integration for the similarity of business cycles are less robust and thus less important for the transmission of idiosyncratic shocks between countries than previously thought. Finally, we find that larger differences in the sector structure between two economies result in a bigger gap between their business cycles.
F49|Sacrifice Ratios for Euro Area Countries: New Evidence on the Costs of Price Stability|" type=""main"" xml:lang=""en""> The purpose of this article is to deliver new estimates of the sacrifice ratio of Euro area countries. A high sacrifice ratio means a large loss of gross domestic product (GDP) or employment for a given reduction in inflation. In order to estimate the cost of adjustments in inflation rates by the sacrifice ratio, we apply, firstly, a structural vector autoregressive technique following Cecchetti and Rich and, secondly, one by Ball based on historical disinflationary episodes. Our findings indicate that most countries have sacrifice ratios of between −1 and 2 per cent of real GDP for a reduction in inflation of one percentage point. In some cases, these estimates deliver negative sacrifice ratios."
F49|Institution-Induced Productivity Differences And Patterns Of International Capital Flows| This paper studies theoretically how the cross-country differences in the institutional quality (IQ) of domestic credit markets shape the patterns of international capital flows when such IQ differences also cause productivity differences across countries. IQ affects productivity by changing productivity–agency-cost trade-offs across heterogeneous investment projects. Such institution-induced productivity differences are shown to have effects on the investment and capital flows that are opposite of exogenous productivity differences. This implies that the overall effect of IQ could generate U-shaped responses of the investment and capital flows. Among other things, this means that capital could flow from middle-income countries to both low-income and high-income countries, and that, starting from a very low IQ, a country could experience both a growth and a current account surplus after a successful institutional reform. More generally, the results here provide some cautions when interpreting the empirical evidence on the role of productivity differences and institutional differences on capital flows. It also calls into question the validity of treating the degree of financial frictions as a proxy for the quality of financial institutions, as commonly done in the literature.
F49|U.S. Treasury Auction Yields Before and During Quantitative Easing: Market Factors vs.Auction Specific Factors|We construct a dataset for every U.S. Treasury auction from 2003 to 2012. We find that market factors known before the auction -- FedFunds rate, S&P, VIX -- are all significant for the auction high-yield, but the relationships differ before vs. during QE and between Bond and Bills auctions. Auction-specific innovations matter for the auction high-yield. Bills auctions have a forecastable component based on information from the previous auction of that maturity. Bidder types may differ systematically. Indirect bidders in the Bond auctions may bid relatively ‘low’ compared to the average bid and Primary Dealers may bid ‘high’. These relationships differ before vs. during QE. These results suggest that quantitative easing implemented in the secondary market has affected the auction market for U.S. Treasury securities.
F49|Los países del tercer mundo frente a la crisis europea|Resumen El objetivo de este documento es determinar los canales de transmisión de la crisis europea hacia los países del Tercer Mundo. El trabajo examina la forma en que la crisis de la deuda soberana se propagó por el sector financiero, a través de la mayor volatilidad de la rentabilidad de los activos. Lo cual se debió a una mayor variación de sus precios, lo que tuvo efectos sobre el patrimonio neto de los agentes económicos, los ingresos, la demanda agregada y la asignación del crédito, así como también sobre la producción y el empleo. Para este documento se hizo búsqueda y selección de literatura especializada y se extrajeron estadísticas especializadas de la UNCTAD, CEPAL y OECD. Se concluye que la transmisión de la crisis europea al Tercer Mundo se dio por canales específicos conocidos, como el comercio internacional, la inversión extranjera directa, las remesas y la ayuda oficial para el desarrollo.
F49|Factors of trade in Europe|We analyze how a set of determinants affect trade among European countries over the period 1992–2008. The factors encompass variables from the areas of geography, culture, institutions, infrastructure, and trade direction. Trade is analyzed for four types of goods: primary goods, parts and components, capital goods, and consumer goods. For each type of good we also distinguish its definition in terms of flows, intensive margin, and extensive margin. Methodologically, we first derive country-pair fixed effects over all possible pairs of export–import partners, and in the second stage we relate fixed effects with a set of influential factors. We show (i) the intuitive and varying effects of geographical, cultural, and institutional factors; (ii) the beneficial effects of soft and hard infrastructure; and (iii) the key importance of trade between old and new EU members.
F49|Resisting Foreign Competition – A Case Study of France and Germany|This article incorporates both the new trade and the endogenous growth theories to study the determinants of import volumes of France and Germany so as to explain their individual industrial competitiveness strategies – price or quality competition. This article is different because it studies competitiveness of a country’s products by considering its resistance to foreign competition rather than considering exports of these countries. Using disaggregated bilateral data for 16 European countries including Japan and the United States across 15 distinctly classified industries over a period of 20 years (between 1991 and 2010), we use an import demand equation to compare the relative product performances of France and Germany vis-à-vis their exporting competitors. To eliminate the price endogeneity problem, we implement a Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) estimation technique using the cost of production (which includes the unit labor cost and costs of capital and intermediates), mark-up and distance as instrumental variables for import prices. We also proxy innovation and hence product quality using research and development (R&D) intensity, reported in Product Field. We find that French products are highly substitutable vis-à-vis their foreign competitors in contrast to German products. Germany adopts better quality competitive strategies, thus rendering their products less substitutable and highly differentiated vis-à-vis their foreign counterparts.
F49|Return and Volatility Spillovers in Industrial Metals|Despite their importance there is a relative dearth on spillovers within the industrial metal class. This is particularly acute in regard to volatility spillovers. Using the Diebold and Yilmaz (2009) methodology we analyze these metals over a 20 year period, showing the evolution of volatility spillovers and identifying the source of same.

F49|Investigation on the relationship between Romanian foreign trade and industrial production|This paper investigates the interactions among the Romanian industrial production, exports and imports after the adhesion to European Union. We employ monthly values testing for the Granger Causality between the variables in a Vector Autoregression framework. Our results indicate significant causalities among the variables, especially the one from the returns of exports to the returns of the industrial production index. We could consider these findings as an argument in favor of the Exports-Led Growth Hypothesis.
F49|Deutsche Leistungsbilanzüberschüsse in der Kritik|Germany runs large current account surpluses. Recently the surplus has been higher than seven per cent of GDP. This has provoked many different criticisms. First, some argue that the euro is the main problem. Second, German wages and prices have been criticised for being too low. Third, according to some critics, German domestic demand should be higher. Fourth, current account surpluses have been assumed to be unsustainable. The article discusses all those arguments and analyses their validity. Copyright ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014
F49|Do bubbles occur in the gold price? An investigation of gold lease rates and Markov Switching models|We assess whether two classes of bubbles occur in the spot price of gold, rational speculative and periodically bursting bubbles, using gold’s lease rates for the first time in the literature as a measure of its fundamental value. This question is of particular significance as these are the only observable market measures of a yield that can be earned from gold. We use unit root and cointegration tests to look for rational speculative bubbles and Markov Switching Augmented DickeyeFuller tests for periodically bursting bubbles. ADF and cointegration tests point to a rational speculative bubble. The more theoretically valid Markov Switching ADF test gives mixed evidence. No bubble is found to be present if we allow the variance to switch between regimes, the gold and its lease rate relationship is instead characterised by high and low variance periods. Imposing a constant variance gives evidence of a bubble for the 2, 3 and 12 month lease rates, but no bubble when we use the 1 and 6 month rates as determinants.

F49|Exchange rate nonlinearities in EMU exports to the US|This paper investigates the determinants of bilateral exports to the US for twelve EMU countries. Although export demand functions have been studied for at least seventy years of time, the issue of nonlinearity in export demand equations has been benignantly neglected in time series econometrics so far. Accordingly, this paper fills this gap and figures out if exports react to exchange rate changes in a nonlinear fashion. To tackle this issue, we apply the newly developed nonlinear ARDL bounds testing approach of Shin et al. (2011) and find that disregarding nonlinearities might be too restrictive. Our evidence points to the fact that exports react differently to appreciations and depreciations. More precisely, it seems as if exports respond stronger to depreciations than to appreciations. Evidence in favor of hysteresis is less robust.
F49|Causality-in-mean and causality-in-variance within the international steam coal market|The purpose of this paper is to investigate the integration of the steam coal market. The analysis of dependencies between mean rates of return of prices on the steam coal market and volatility spillover was conducted using weekly data from the period 04.01.2002 to 30.12.2011. The prices of the world's largest exporters and importers on the Pacific and Atlantic markets were chosen to analyse the dependencies. The methodology was based on the tests from Cheung and Ng (1996) and Hong (2001), which allow for the analysis of Granger causality both in mean and in variance. The analyses indicate that the dependence between participants is not the same. The strongest links were observed between the pairs of participants from the same market (that is, either the Atlantic market or the Pacific market), and the price of Australian coal turned out to be the most important factor in shaping other prices on the Pacific market. On the Atlantic market, the coal prices in the Amsterdam–Rotterdam–Antwerp (ARA) ports and the Richards Bay port had the greatest influence on coal prices and were the Granger cause of prices in the Pacific region.
F49|A network analysis of global banking: 1978–2010|We analyze the global banking network using data on cross-border banking flows for 184 countries during 1978–2010. We find that the density of the global banking network defined by these flows is pro-cyclical, expanding and contracting with the global cycle of capital flows. We also find that country connectedness in the network tends to rise before banking and debt crises and to fall in their aftermath. Despite a historically unique build-up in aggregate flows prior to the global financial crisis, network density in 2007 was comparable to earlier peaks. This suggests that factors other than connectedness, such as the location of the initial shock to the core of the network, have contributed to the severity of the crisis. The global financial crisis stands out as an unusually large perturbation to the global banking network, with indicators of network density in 2008 reaching all-time lows.
F49|Combined use of foreign debt and currency derivatives under the threat of currency crises: The case of Latin American firms|We investigate the determinants of firms' use of foreign currency derivatives in emerging markets exposed to currency crises. We develop a model where a firm with international orientation chooses its optimal foreign debt and hedging ratio. In the context of highly volatile exchange rate periods in five Latin American countries, we calibrate the model on ADRs. We find theoretical and empirical evidence that country specific factors (i.e. aggregate exposure of a country to a crisis) explain significantly part of our firms' foreign debt and hedging policy, as opposed to literature on firms in developed markets. We claim that derivative markets have been effective tools for firms in these countries, at least in the post-crisis era.
F49|World Economic Perspectives In The Post-Crisis And Economic Growth Periods|L’économie mondiale est au bord d’un nouveau ralentissement majeur Comme annoncé dans le rapport de l’année dernière, l’économie mondiale s’est considérablement affaiblie en 2012. Un nombre croissant de pays développés sont retombés dans une récession à double creux, notamment en Europe, tandis que ceux faisant face à un surendettement non-viable ont sombré encore plus profondément dans la récession. De nombreux pays développés sont pris dans une spirale descendante se renforçant grâce à un chômage élevé, une faiblesse de la demande globale exacerbée par l’austérité budgétaire, un endettement public élevé et un système financier toujours fragile. Les difficultés économiques des pays développés affectent également les pays en développement et les économies en transition à travers l’affaiblissement de leurs exportations et la volatilité accrue des flux de capitaux et des prix des matières premières. Les grandes économies en développement sont cependant également confrontées à des problèmes intérieurs, et certains pays dont la Chine font face un déclin des investissements, résultant des contraintes de financement dans certains secteurs de l’économie et d’une capacité de production excédentaire ailleurs. La plupart des pays à faible revenu ont jusqu’ici relativement bien résisté au ralentissement économique des pays développés et à revenu intermédiaire, mais sont à présent aussi affectés par l’intensification des retombées négatives. Les perspectives pour les deux prochaines années sont pleines de défis, d’incertitudes et les risques orientés vers la baisse. La croissance du produit mondial brut (PMB) devrait atteindre 2,2 pour cent en 2012 et rester bien en deçà de son potentiel à 2,4 pour cent en 2013 et 3,2 pour cent en 2014. A ce rythme modéré, de nombreuses économies seront incapables de recouvrer les pertes sévères d’emplois subies durant la «grande récession».

F49|International Transmission of Food Prices and Volatilities: A Panel Analysis|High and volatile food prices pose a significant policy challenge around the world, and an understanding of the dynamics of food price inflation and volatility is essential in designing appropriate policy responses. Using the panel data for 72 countries from 2000 to 2011, the paper assesses the international transmission of food price inflation and volatilities as well as the effects of various internal and external factors on domestic food price inflation and volatility. The paper offers evidence in support of the international transmission of food price inflation and volatility. Specifically, the paper finds that the domestic food price inflation in Asia is strongly associated with the lagged value of global food price inflation (using the FAO food price index), while volatility spillovers from global to domestic food prices are rather contemporaneous. The paper also finds that both national food price inflation rates and volatilities are strongly associated with both intra- and extra- regional food price inflation rates and volatilities, respectively. The findings also suggest that higher economic growth rates, greater shares of food in merchandise imports, and smaller increases in the share of food in merchandise imports lead to lower domestic food price inflation. An appreciation of local currency, greater political stability, and higher income level are also found to lower domestic food price inflation. On the other hand, higher economic growth rates lead to lower volatilities of food prices.
F49|London or New York: where and when does the gold price originate?| We investigate the Information Shares (ISs) of the two main centres of gold trading, over a 25-year period, using nonoverlapping 4-month windows. We find that neither London nor New York is dominant in terms of price IS, that the dominant market switches from time to time and that these switches do not appear to be very clearly linkable to macroeconomic or political events.
F49|Macroeconomic consequences of increased productivity in less developed economies|This paper examines the impact of improvements in productivity on prices, output, the real wage rate and the balance of payments. Within the context of the model used in this paper, an improvement in productivity can take two alternative forms: (1) a cost saving for a given output and (2) an increase in production without a direct decrease in employment. The results presented are based on a simple model of a small open economy that includes some key features of less developed economies. It is shown that, in the presence of monetary and fiscal restraints, an improvement in productivity leads to increases in output, employment and the real wage and the effect on the balance of payments, in the short and the medium runs, is also positive. We find that whether or not improvement in productivity is import saving plays a crucial role in both comparative static and simulation exercises.
F49|The sovereign property of foreign reserve investment in China: A CVaR approach|This paper investigates the role of foreign exchange reserve investment to hedge overall macroeconomic risks. Different from usual micro profit-maximizing purpose, the investment with macro objective is unique in the field of foreign reserve investment. We propose a framework of mean-variance-CVaR (conditional value at risk) model to capture the features of such investment and calculate the optimal allocation of foreign reserves in China. We use Cornish–Fisher method to calculate CVaR and adopt quasi-Newton algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Two scenarios are compared in the paper: the usual micro profit-maximizing portfolio and the sovereign portfolio hedging macro risks. We find that hedging the overall macro risks and lower the overall volatility of the economy through foreign reserve investment is possible under certain risk constraints.
F49|Bilateral exports from euro zone countries to the US — Does exchange rate variability play a role?|The financial crisis and the debt crisis in Europe have led to pronounced swings in the $/€ exchange rate. The influence of this exchange rate uncertainty on exports is neither theoretically nor empirically unambiguous. This investigation will try to determine what effect such exchange rate volatility has on exports from eleven euro zone countries to the US. Our results suggest that if exchange rate volatility does exert a significant influence, it is typically negative. Furthermore, the exports most often negatively affected seem to be those of SITC categories 6 and 7.

Bulgular butun olarak degerlendirildiginde, ithalat ve ihracat arasindaki bagimliligin doviz kuru politikasini yansiz hale getirdigini ima etmektedir.
F49|Examining Friedman Hypothesis On Political,Civil And Economic Freedom For Saarc Countries: A Dynamic Panel Data Analysis|This paper empirically examines the Friedman hypothesis on political, civil and economic freedom that, a country can have a high degree of civil freedom, and a high degree of economic freedom without any political freedom, but can not have any political freedom if it does not have some degree of civil and economic freedom. Using panel data of five SAARC countries over the period 1995-2011, the dynamic panel data econometric techniques and Granger-causality tests validated the Friedman hypothesis regarding economic and political freedom, but regarding civil and political freedom the reverse is found true. The estimates of the empirical model using UECM show that economic freedom has significant short-run and long-run effects in improving the political freedom in the SAARC region.
F49|Exchange Rate Regimes in the Modern Era|The exchange rate is sometimes called the most important price in a highly globalized world. A country's choice of its exchange rate regime, between government-managed fixed rates and market-determined floating rates has significant implications for monetary policy, trade, and macroeconomic outcomes, and is the subject of both academic and policy debate. In this book, two leading economists examine the operation and consequences of exchange rate regimes in an era of increasing international interdependence. Michael Klein and Jay Shambaugh focus on the evolution of exchange rate regimes in the modern era, the period since 1973, which followed the Bretton Woods era of 1945-72 and the pre-World War I gold standard era. The modern era is marked by a wide variety of experiences with exchange rate regimes, both across countries and, for many countries, across time. This provides a rich body of data for studying the economic effects of these exchange rate regimes. Klein and Shambaugh offer a comprehensive, integrated treatment of the characteristics of exchange rate regimes and their effects. The book draws on and synthesizes data from the recent wave of empirical research on this topic, and includes new findings that challenge preconceived notions.

F49|Terms of Trade and Economic Growth in Poland in the period 1980-2009|The article aims to analyze the impact of changes in terms of trade and terms of trade volatility on economic growth in Poland in the period 1980-2009. The results of test using the vector autoregressive model (VAR) revealed that improved terms of trade in Poland led to increased growth of GDP per capita, while the increase in terms of trade volatility reduced the growth rate of GDP per capita in Poland. In addition, there was confirmed the greater impact of changes in terms of trade, than the terms of trade volatility on the dynamics of economic growth in Poland. It was also demonstrated that the changes in terms of trade and terms of trade volatility explained in a similar degree the variation of GDP per capita in Poland in the period 1980-2009.
F49|Statistical analysis of trade relations of Romania with the EU member states|This study was done to analyse the structure in teritorial profile of the commercial relations of Romania compared to the European Union member states for year 2011. Based on the value of export and import trade flows for each EU member state with Romania and using statistical methods of analysis, there were subjected to processing existing information to determine the spatial distribution of foreign trade in the perspective of key trade partners Community market. As indicators such as trade balance and coverage of imports by exports is a proof to the effectiveness of trade relations between Romania and the EU Member States, there were also calculated the mentioned indicators for each Member State.
F49|A regional perspective on the spatial concentration in Romania’s international trade in 2011|In this study, I aimed at analyzing the territorial structure of the international trade in Romania in 2011 on the level of each development region. Starting from the values of the export and import trade flows pertaining to each region of Romania and using statistical methods of analysis, we processed the existing data in order to determine the distribution of foreign trade and to emphasize the regional poles of competitiveness from this point of view. Since other indexes, such as the trade balance or the import/export coverage ratio, are also marks of competitiveness and of the increase or decrease in the performance of a certain economy, we also calculated these indexes for each region of the country. In order to statistically substantiate the existence of a certain degree of spatial concentration of the Romanian international trade in different regions of the country, we resorted to the boxplot graphical representation and to the Gini square and the Gini index respectively.
F49|The EU’s External Relations: the Case of BRIC Countries with Special Emphasis on China|The BRIC countries, and especially China, have significantly increased their share in the world economy. The Chinese model, with its special approach to development, can be seen as an accelerated version of the Japanese one, which has brought enormous success in Japan, and in the Tiger economies. In the past two decades China has become the EU’s most important trading partner, and their relationship is getting more and more symmetric. Although there are areas where they have different approaches, there are much more issues with common interests, and room for cooperation. For Hungary China has been a special partner for decades. After the fall of communism the ties became weaker, and Hungary practically lost almost all of its previous advantage. The EU accession, however, opened up new possibilities, and new channels for the country, to pursue its interests, and regain at least some of its privileged status.
F49|U.S. Treasury Auction Yields During Boom, Bust, and Quantitative Easing: Role for Fed and Foreign Purchasers|Since 2007, three actors have been particularly important in U.S. Treasury auctions: The U.S. government, issuing $8.4 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities in 2010 alone; foreign official entities, purchasing $398 billion in U.S. Treasury securities in 2010 alone; and finally the Federal Reserve, which intervened in the U.S. Treasury market by purchasing $900 billion U.S. Treasury securities during 2009 and 2010. Using our unique data set of every U.S. Treasury auction from May 2003 to year-end 2011, we find first, that the yield at auction compared to the previous-day’s matched-maturity instrument varies significantly across the maturity of the instrument, as well as the time period of boom and bust. Similarly, the bid-cover ratios are importantly related to the auction yield and to macroeconomic environment. Third, we find that indirect bidders, a proxy for foreign official entities, although not allocated the largest shares at the auctions, were the relatively more important group in determining the auction yield on long-term U.S. Treasury securities. Finally, we find that all of these relationships change significantly when the Federal Reserve entered the Treasury market.
F49|Manufactured Exports And Economic Growth In Egypt: Cointegration And Causality Analysis|Although it is widely acknowledged that exports, particularly through manufactured components, play an important role as a potential source of economic growth, the relationship between exports and economic growth is still ongoing. This paper contributes to this controversy using cointegration analysis and Error Correction Model (ECM) test to determine the short and long run causality between manufactured exports and economic growth in Egypt during the period 1980-2008 with particular interest to decompose Egypt's manufactured exports into a number of key industries. The empirical results show that bi-direction long-run causality exists not only between exports of manufactured goods as a whole and economic growth but also in case of few Egyptian export industries like textile products, chemical products, fabricated metal products and food-processing. Furthermore, the short run unidirectional causality from exports of some industries to economic growth is explored. The direction of causality from growth to exports was inferred only in the case of chemical products. The main conclusion is that there is a long run circular causality between manufactured exports and economic growth in Egypt. Therefore, adopting vigorous growth policy is expected to stimulate the manufactured exports. However, the export-led policy seems to be a basic tool toward sustained growth in Egypt. Furthermore, emphasis on the composition of manufactured exports should be considered as a main instrument in the export driving growth policy.

The paper concludes with a discussion on the key institutional changes needed in Pakistan.
F49|From Economic Growth to Sustainable Development in a Globalized World|Nowadays it is important that developing countries tap themselves fully to a new philosophy of development that is specific to the European Union and widely shared worldwide – namely the philosophy of transition from economic growth to sustainable development. Thus, concrete targets are now pursued, designed to enable transition within a reasonable and realistic time to the development model generating high added value, driven by interest for knowledge and innovation, oriented on continuous improvement of human life quality and of human relationships, in harmony with the natural environment.
F49|GATT/WTO membership does promote international trade after all – Some new empirical evidence|The declared objective of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) is to promote free trade between member states. Nonetheless, an exhaustive study of bilateral merchandise trade based on a large panel data set led Rose (2004) to conclude that there is no compelling empirical evidence to show that GATT/WTO membership does actually encourage international trade. This unanticipated finding generated a great deal of attention in the literature and several scholars put forward various explanations for it. In this paper we set up a new international trade data set which, unlike Rose’s, allows us to model exports and imports separately and to study the extensive margin of trade, i.e., the number of bilateral trade relationships. Using this data set and a gravity framework, first we demonstrate how to obtain puzzling negative results and so explain the previous unintuitive findings. Then we show that GATT/WTO membership does indeed encourage international trade, so the most obvious reason for Rose’s negative outcome is the lack of zero bilateral trade observations in his data set.
F49|Do oil prices respond to real interest rates?|We show that the robustness of an inverse relationship between the real interest rate and real oil price depends crucially on how the real interest rate is calculated, and the time-frame of the sample. Consistent with earlier studies, we find that the oil price falls with an unexpected rise in either U.S. or international ex-ante real interest rates. When the ex-post real interest rate is used, the oil price only falls with rises to short-term rates (3months or less). Additionally, the response of the oil price to long-term ex-ante real interest rates must include the period through the mid-2000s for the inverse relationship to appear. In contrast, the oil price consistently falls with unexpected rises in short-term real interest rates throughout the entire sample. We draw two conclusions from the results. The first is that the oil price is consistently responsive to short-term U.S. and international real interest rates, underlying the importance of storage. Second, oil prices have become more responsive to long-term real interest rates over time.
F49|Securitization As a Factor Of Economic Integration|This paper is aimed to show that securitization, a concept of the State security theory, provides some elements to obtain a more complete vision linked to other sciences about the economic integration processes. Until now, economic integration is studied by diverse strands of economic thought, exhausting the conceptual frameworks in reinterpretations impeding progress in the explanation of motivations of Nations to be economically linked. Here it has been linked to the categories of economic integration and the State security theory, to give an answer to the question of whether economic integration is a process that is explained by it or if it is determined by the search for security of States. As a conclusion of the study, it proposes a conceptual model of economic integration and economic regionalization, as resulting from the process of securitization.
F49|Intra-national Purchasing Power Parity and Balassa--Samuelson Effects in Italy| Considering a sample of 71 Italian metropolitan areas, this paper goes beyond the assumption that a unique core inflationary process exists in a macroeconomy. It shows that local long-run inflation rates can display remarkable variability. On the one hand they are negatively correlated with productivity growth; on the other, the less competitive the local retail sector, the higher is long-run inflation. ParitÃ© de pouvoir d'achat intranational et effets Balassa--Samuelson en Italie R Ã©sumÃ© La prÃ©sente communication, qui examine un Ã©chantillon de 71 zones mÃ©tropolitaines en Italie, va au-delà de l'hypothèse de l'existence, dans une macroÃ©conomie, d'un processus unique d'inflation de base. Elle dÃ©montre que les taux d'inflation locaux de longue durÃ©e font preuve parfois d'une variabilitÃ© remarquable: d'un côtÃ©, ils sont en corrÃ©lation nÃ©gative avec l'expansion de la productivitÃ©, de l'autre moins le secteur local du commerce au dÃ©tail est compÃ©titif, plus l'inflation à long terme est Ã©levÃ©e. Paridad de poder adquisitivo intranacional y efectos Balassa--Samuelson en Italia E xtracto Este trabajo, que considera una muestra de 71 áreas metropolitanas italianas, va más allá de suponer que dentro de una macroeconomÃ­a existe un único proceso inflacionario básico. Muestra que los Ã­ndices locales de inflación a largo plazo pueden exhibir una variabilidad significativa. Por una parte, se correlacionan negativamente con el crecimiento de la productividad; por otra parte, cuanto menos competitivo es el sector minorista local, más alta es la inflación a largo plazo.
F49|Bilateral exports from Euro Zone countries to the US: Does exchange rate variability play a role?|The financial crisis and the debt crisis in Europe lead to pronounced swings of the $/€-exchange rate. The influence of this exchange rate uncertainty on exports is neither theoretically nor empirically unambiguous. Therefore, this investigation tries to find out what effect exchange rate volatility has got on exports from eleven euro zone countries to the US. Our results suggest that if exchange rate volatility exerts a significant influence on exports, it is typically negative. Furthermore, exports of SITC categories 6 and 7 seem to be affected negatively most often.
F49|Romania’s foreign trade with the European Union in 2008|In this study, I proposed to analyze the spatial concentration of international trade flows between Romania and the European Union both overall and by the sections of the Combined Nomenclature. Using statistical analysis methods such as square and Gini’s index or Onicescu informational energy, I concluded that Romania’s main trade partners are Italy, Germany and France and trade relations with these 3 countries are characterized by exchanges of good to cover, generally a wide range of products.
F49|Romania's foreign trade in 2008 - a territorial statistical analysis|In this study, I proposed to analyze the territorial structure at county level, of the Romanian international trade both overall and by the sections of the Combined Nomenclature. Starting with the values of export and imports trade flows related to each county in Romania and using statistical methods of analysis, I determineted the spatial distribution of foreign trade reveal that county poles of competitiveness in this regard. Whereas the trade balance or indicators such as coverage of imports by exports is proof that the increase or decrease the competitiveness of an economy's performance, I calculated also for each county these indicators.

F49|Asleep at the wheel: the real interest rate experience in Australia|A re-thinking and clear understanding of the factors underlying a country's balance of trade position is needed as the global trade regime becomes more liberalized. The relationship between the overall trade balance and its determinants as propounded in the standard models may not necessarily be the same with the bilateral trade balances. This study has developed a model of bilateral trade balance that captures the effects of all factors influencing trade balance as suggested by elasticity, absorption, and monetary approaches and the popular Gravity Model with some extensions. Specifically, the present paper postulates that the relative factors determine the trading pattern, and hence the trade balance of a country in bilateral trade with partners while in the earlier models absolute factors determine the trade balance,. Using standard panel data techniques the model is empirically tested and the results show significant effects of all the relative factors on the bilateral trade balance of Bangladesh in trading with her partners. The robustness check of the model ensures the validity of the specification.
F49|Optimal Stabilization Policy Under Governmental Risk Aversion|Governmental stabilization policies take account of the underlying risk aversion of its voters. A utility function for the government is defined, one which includes variances of national income changes with respect to its policy instruments—here the budget variable, the bond rate of interest, and the currency-exchange rate. The consequence of this for the optimal set of policies is a target level of national income less than what a risk-neutral government aims at. This applies to an open economy when this is a key-currency country, as it need attend to balance-of-payments effects only insofar as they affect national income. The non-key-currency country, by contrast, must take account directly of balance-of-payments effects and their variance, so it reaches a lower level of utility than the key-currency country.

F49|The Market Price of Aggregate Risk and the Wealth Distribution| We introduce limited liability in a model with a continuum of ex ante identical agents who face aggregate and idiosyncratic income risk. These agents can trade a complete menu of contingent claims, but they cannot commit to honor their promises, and their shares in a Lucas tree serve as collateral to back up their state-contingent promises. The limited-liability option gives rise to a second risk factor, in addition to aggregate consumption growth risk. This liquidity risk is created by binding solvency constraints, and it is measured by the growth rate of one moment of the wealth distribution. The economy is said to experience a negative liquidity shock when this growth rate is high and a large fraction of agents faces severely binding solvency constraints. The adjustment to the Breeden-Lucas stochastic discount factor induces substantial time variation in equity risk-premims that is consistent with the data at business cycle frequencies.

F49|Globalization and trade flows: What you see is not what you get!|The trade collapse that followed the recent financial crisis has led to a renewed interest on the measurement issues affecting international merchandise trade statistics in the new globalized economy. The international fragmentation of industrial production blurs the concept of country of origin and calls for the production of new statistics on the domestic content of exports, with a view of estimating trade in value added. Alongside, the international statistical community has revised in 2010 the concepts and definitions on both, international merchandise trade and trade in services statistics. This paper discusses the various issues related to the concepts of goods for processing and intra firm trade in trade statistics, and provides an overview of the method of analysing the impact of the fragmentation of production in international value chains.
F49|Dollarization Of Debt Contracts: Evidence From Chilean Firms|This paper uses a new data set to estimate the causes and consequences of foreign currency debt in firms' balance sheets. The evidence from this sample of Chilean firms indicates that dollar‐denominated debt increases with firms' size and degree of exposure to foreign competition. We find evidence that dollar‐denominated debt combines with exchange rate movements to produce a negative balance‐sheet effect that reduces firms' investment in periods of strong exchange rate depreciation. This negative balance‐sheet effect is associated with long‐term debt and appears to be nonlinear in the amount of real exchange rate depreciation.
F49|El fenómeno de los ‘global imbalances’ y la crisis financiera actual|The phenomenon of the global imbalances is one of the causes of the current financial and economic crisis. The financial flows associated to these imbalances are in the origin of the generalized crisis in the international financial markets, which are incapable to absorb efficiently these huge capital inflows. The current experience shows that export-led strategies of growth are unsustainable if they are implemented by big economies whose external disequilibria can generate big systemic risks.
F49|Managing Success in Viet Nam: Macroeconomic Consequences of Large Capital Inflows with Limited Policy Tools|Viet Nam has experienced spectacular economic growth over the past decade, in part the result of massive foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. Although much has been written on the impacts of FDI in developing countries, previous studies have generally ignored macroeconomic consequences in cost-benefit assessments. These macroeconomic aspects can be particularly important in transitional economies like Viet Nam, where some of the tools for macroeconomic stabilization may be blunt or unavailable. First, capital inflow growth needs to be accommodated by real exchange rate appreciation. In dollarized economies like Viet Nam, the nominal exchange rate cannot be relied upon to deliver it, so inflation usually results. In these economies, it is also difficult for the central bank to conduct open market operations to sterilize large capital inflows or mop up excess liquidity. Again, this could feed inflation. The combination of a young and inexperienced banking system and an investment-hungry state-owned enterprises (SOE) sector only exacerbates the situation, and increases the risk of imbalances that could result in crisis.
F49|Revisited Export-Led Growth Hypothesis|Over the years, there has been extensive research on the relationship between a countryâ€™s export and economic growth with ambiguous and mixed results. The mixed results are due to bi-variate approach used in the analysis and periodisation (combining both import substitution and export promotion periods).This article corrects these two problems and uses co-integration and error-correction models to analyze the causal relationship between export growth and economic growth in India for post-liberalization period (1992[Q1]â€“2007[Q4]). The results indicate that there exists a long-term relationship between output and exports, and it is unidirectional, running from exports to output growth. Hence, in the case of India, further liberalization of trade policies are recommended in promoting and sustaining economic growth.
F49|Alternative Exchange Rate Regimes for MENA countries: Gravity Model Estimates of the Trade Effects|Middle East and North African (MENA) countries have traditionally anchored their currencies largely on the US dollar, but the creation of the euro means that there is now for the first time a real alternative numéraire and anchor available. This paper estimates the effect of a menu of exchange rate regimes on trade within a gravity model, using the Baier & Bergstrand (2006) Taylor expansion technique to allow for multilateral trade resistance. This approach allows simulations of the effects of changes in the exchange rate regime for a particular country or region which explicitly take into account the associated changes in multilateral and world trade resistance. Results are presented for eight different scenarios: pegging to the dollar, dollarising, pegging to the euro and euroising, each of these on an individual country basis and when the MENA countries all implement the change together. We find that in terms of the trade effects for most MENA countries it would be better to anchor on the euro than on the dollar, but for some others (typically small oil exporters with large exports to Asian countries) it would be better to continue to anchor on the dollar.
F49|Long-Run Pass-Through From The Exchange Rate To Import Prices In African Countries|This paper investigates the extent of pass-through from the nominal exchange rate to import prices for a sample of nineteen African countries. The methodology is based on panel data cointegration testing. Using annual data extending back to 1971, long-run pass-through can be best described as a fairly balanced combination of local-currency and producer-currency pricing. However, this paper offers additional insight from a moving window approach that indicates declining long-run pass-through, accompanied by decreasing inflation, occurring since the mid-1990s.
F49|Export-Led Growth Hypothesis in Pakistan: A Reinvestigation Using the Bounds Test|Trade is presumed to act as a catalyst to economic growth. This paper reinvestigates the export-led growth hypothesis in Pakistan by using annual time series data on exports, imports, terms of trade, and the labor force participation rate as explanatory variables and gross domestic product (GDP) as the dependent variable for the period 1971-2005. The study uses the more comprehensive and recent bounds test or autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) proposed by Pesaran et al (2001) to examine the existence of short-run and long-runrelationships between exports and economic growth, which is crucial indesigning policy to enhance trade-related potential in Pakistan. The results indicate that exports, labor force, and imports have a positive effect on growth, while the terms of trade has a negative effect. The proxy for trade liberalization has a positive impact on economic growth. Finally, the chief finding of this study is that the hypothesis of export-led growth in the Pakistan economy is supported in both the short and long run. Economicgrowth in Pakistan is accompanied by fluctuations in exports and imports both in the short and long run, but the labor force participation rate has a negative effect only in the short run. The terms of trade has the same effect in the short and long run.
F49|Estimating the permanent growth effects of financial liberalization: The case of Malaysia|We argue that the specifications used to estimate the permanent growth effects of reforms in the financial sector are unsatisfactory. Using a modified specification and data for the period 1970 to 2004, we show developments in the financial sector in Malaysia have a small but significant permanent effect on the growth of output. Our results are different from the conclusions in a recent work on this topic.
F49|Financial Development and Textile Sector Competitiveness: A Case Study of Pakistan|Kletzer and Bardhan (1987) argue that countries with a relatively well-developed financial sector have a comparative advantage in industries that rely on external finance. Beck (2002), and Fanelli and Medhora (2002) find that well-developed financial sector translates into a comparative advantage in the production of manufactured goods. There has been no attempt so far to explore the relationship between the financial development and international trade competitiveness in the case of Pakistan. We construct Balassa’s Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) index for textile sector of Pakistan. Using ratio of credit extended to the textile sector to the total non-government credit of the banking system (TCS) as proxy for external finance we estimate long run relationship, and ECM, between RCA index and TCS while controlling for other determinants of the international trade competitiveness of textile sector of Pakistan. In line with the findings of Beck (2002), and Fanelli and Medhora (2002), our results suggest that recourse to external finance has a strong positive impact on the country’s textile sector competitiveness both in the short and the long run even when we control for traditional determinants of competitiveness.
F49|Exchange Rate Regimes And Trade|A ‘new version’ of the gravity model is used to estimate the effect of a full range of de facto exchange rate regimes on bilateral trade. The results indicate that, while participation in a common currency union is typically strongly ‘pro‐trade’, other exchange rate regimes which lower the exchange rate uncertainty and transactions costs associated with international trade are significantly more pro‐trade than the default regime of a ‘double float’. They suggest that the direct and indirect trade‐creating effects of these regimes on uncertainty and transactions costs tend to outweigh the trade‐diverting substitution effects. Tariff‐equivalent monetary barriers associated with each exchange rate regime are also calculated.

F49|Reálná konvergence Česka a Polska k eurozóně<BR>[The Real Convergence of the Czech Republic and Poland to the Euro-zone]|The new member countries of the European Union professed on the day of their entry to adopt the single European currency Euro without undue delays. There arise two quite fundamental questions within this context, which are: “When will they make this step?” and “Will they be able, in this period, to achieve such a level of the real convergence, which enables them to enjoy all the advantages and to face up all the risks which are associated with the entry into the monetary union?” We have tried to find a partial answer to the second question within our paper, which is devoted to the questions of the real convergence of the Czech Republic and Poland the Euro-zone. Within the analysis carried out by ourselves we came to the conclusion that both the Polish and Czech economy will have to, in five following years, pass through a rather decisive process of the real convergence as the present state of their economies brings along a number of risks, which could after the adopting of Euro destabilize the economic situation in these countries.
F49|Trade liberalisation and intra-household poverty in Vietnam: a q2 social impact analysis|Following extensive economic and market reforms and more than a decade of negotiations, Vietnam became the latest country to accede to the World Trade Organization in November 2006. While it is expected that greater liberalisation will boost Vietnam’s economic growth and contribute to the country’s ongoing transition towards a market economy, there are concerns about potentially negative impacts on vulnerable sectors of the population, including remote rural populations, women and children. In order to explore the possible impacts of Vietnam’s trade liberalisation on children in poor communities, this paper examines key mediating factors that impact child welfare and the ways that trade liberalisation could affect these variables. It focuses on three key aspects of child well-being – child work (domestic and extra-household), educational attainment and health status. It applies a mixed methods approach: econometrics analysis using data from the first wave of the Young Lives Vietnam longitudinal survey on childhood poverty combined within in-depth qualitative analysis of two key agricultural commodity sectors, aquaculture and sugarcane, that are expected to be significantly impacted by Vietnam’s integration into the world economy. Our main quantitative findings point to significant differences in child well-being outcomes based on ethnicity, household poverty status and vulnerability to declining living standards, parental (especially maternal) education levels, children’s involvement in work activities, and access to public services. Our qualitative findings highlight the implications of caregivers’ shifting time inputs to productive and care economy work on child well-being, familial coping strategies in the context of economic shocks, the importance of social capital in mediating economic opportunities as well as differences in livelihood patterns among majority and minority ethnic groups. The paper concludes by discussing why mixed methods research can play an important role in focusing greater policy attention on the linkages between economic globalisation and children’s experiences of poverty.
F49| Modelling multilateral trade resistance in a gravity model with exchange rate regimes| In estimating a gravity model it is essential to analyse not just bilateral trade resistance, the barriers to trade between a pair of countries, but also multilateral trade resistance (MTR), the barriers to trade that each country faces with all its trading partners. Without correctly modelling MTR, it is impossible either to obtain accurate estimates of the effects on trade of exchange rate regimes and other variables or to perform accurate counterfactual simulations of trade patterns under other assumptions about exchange rate regimes or other variables. In this paper we implement a number of different ways of modelling MTR ?both for a standard gravity model and for an extended model which includes a full range of bilateral exchange rate regimes ?notably several variants of the technique developed by Baier and Bergstrand (2006), which turn out to produce broadly similar results. We then illustrate our preferred approach by carrying out simulations of the effects of the creation of an East African currency union and the effects of a withdrawal from EMU by Italy.
F49|Globalization, markups and the natural rate of interest|"In this paper, we investigate how, in a stylised theoretical framework, an increase in the degree of globalization - modelled as a deline in trade costs - affects the real natural rate of interest by impacting firms markups. Outlining a two- country dynamic general equilibrium model with endogenous elasticity of substitution between goods, we suggest two main propositions: 1) Globalization - via the impplied variation in markups - has a potentially significant impact on the natural rate of interest. 2) Simple, plausible markup dynamics may have contributed to explain the recent ""conundrum"" of world interest rates."

F49|Is a Low-inflation Environment Associated with Reduced Exchange Rate Pass Through?|This paper investigates the extent of pass through from the US dollar exchange rate to consumer prices in the European Union. A relatively new line of empirical research is pursued that considers whether or not the extent of exchange rate pass through is related to the inflationary environment. In contrast to previous empirical studies, recently developed panel data cointegrating techniques to measure long run pass through are employed. While there is evidence that long-run pass through has declined since the 1970s, it actually increased during the early ERM years despite the presence of lower inflation.
F49|Persistent misalignments of the European exchange rates: some evidence from non-linear cointegration| The asymmetric and persistent adjustment of the European real exchange rates is investigated using the framework of non-linear cointegration. The episodes of slow mean-reversion dynamics over the period from 1979 to 1999 are explained. A test of unit root against STAR cointegration is proposed and some complete estimations and stochastic simulations of ESTAR models are presented. The presence of effective non-linear adjustment during the moving of the currencies to their long-run fundamental equilibrium exchange rate value is discussed.

F49|The short and long-run determinants of the real exchange rate in Mexico|This paper explores the real exchange rate behavior in Mexico from 1960 until 2005. Since the empirical analysis reveals that the real exchange rate is not mean reverting, we propose that economic fundamental variables affect its evolution in the long-run. Therefore, based on equilibrium exchange rate paradigms, we propose a simple model of real exchange rate determination which includes the relative labor productivity, the real interest rates and the net foreign assets over a long period of time. Our analysis also considers the dynamic adjustment in response to shocks through impulse response functions derived from the multivariate VAR model.

F49|Corporate Governance and Economic Value Alignment|As a result of recent problems with corporate reporting and management, renewed interest in Corporate Governance has arisen. We analyze economic value alignment as a form of Corporate Governance, a concept similar to but more encompassing than economic value added and value-based management. We look at some specific ways that various companies and industries have applied economic value added analysis. The results show that the companies that use economic value alignment increase their value significantly over those that do not. The results show that discriminating investors and management should demand that their associated companies use EVA to improve overall financial reporting and to better manage assets. In turn, the SEC and Accounting Standard Setting Bodies should consider the long-term benefits of requiring certain sized companies to report relevant EVA data to key stakeholders.

F49|Did Output Recover from the Asian Crisis?|This paper investigates the extent to which output has recovered from the Asian crisis. A regime-switching approach that introduces two state variables is used to decompose recessions in a set of six Asian countries into permanent and transitory components. While growth recovered fairly quickly after the crisis, there is evidence of permanent losses in the levels of output in all the countries studied.
F49|General Equilibrium Model of Arbitrage Trade and Real Exchange Rate Persistence|Modelling of the physical characteristics of goods and geography can explain both the puzzling persistence and volatility in the deviations of the international relative prices and the real exchange rate (the PPP persistence puzzle). In a two-country, three-good general equilibrium model, arbitrage firms trade goods across borders using a linear transportation technology. Distance and product weights (their physical mass) determine the costs to arbitrage trade, while the differences in the endowments between countries create profitable trading opportunities. Tradability of goods is endogenous, in that only goods with a deviation from the law of one price in excess of their trade cost are traded. The adjustment of prices across borders is non-linear, with heterogeneous thresholds that depend positively on the weight of a product and distance { an empirical regularity. Aggregation of the law of one price deviations implies a smooth threshold non-linearity in the real exchange rate, justifying a reoccurring finding in the recent empirical literature. When stochastic endowments follow an AR(1) process calibrated to match the quarterly HP-filtered US and EU GDPs, and the aggregate trade costs consume 1.7% of the GDP, the half-life of deviation in the real exchange rate matches the persistence found in the data. A model with quadratic adjustment costs in the volume of trade is also capable of creating real exchange rate volatility, and so can explain the PPP puzzle entirely as a trade phenomenon.
F49|A SAM Based Global CGE Model using GTAP Data January 2005|This paper provides a technical description of a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that is calibrated from a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) representation of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database.

F49|Unit Labour Costs in the New EU Member States|Unit labour costs (ULCs) are one of the key economic variables considered in the context of globalization, competitiveness and production-location decisions. With the EU accession of eight Central and East European countries and their (almost) full inclusion in the European Single Market, the issues related to the labour cost competitiveness of these countries has become even more important. The present paper outlines the key methodological and practical problems associated with the evaluation of ULCs with a particular focus on the new EU member states (NMS). It provides also new and up-to-date internationally comparable ULC estimates for NMS at both the aggregate level (for the whole GDP) and in the manufacturing industry, as well as for its individual branches. A detailed statistical appendix contains indicators of macro-competitiveness for each NMS as well as data on productivity, labour costs and ULC estimates in the manufacturing industry.

F49|Commodity-Linked Bonds: A Potential Means for Less-Developed Countries to Raise Foreign Capital|The author suggests that commodity-linked bonds could provide a potential means for less-developed countries (LDCs) to raise money on the international capital markets, rather than through standard forms of financing. The issue of this type of bond could provide an opportunity for commodity-producing LDCs to hedge against fluctuations in their export earnings. The author's results show that the value of a commodity-linked bond increases as the price of the commodity indexed to the bond rises; this suggests that, if LDCs had issued debt contracts that were tied to their main export commodities, then their debt load would decline along with plummeting export prices (or export revenues). A simple portfolio rule derived by the author suggests that LDCs should issue more commodity-linked bonds than conventional debt if the variance of the portfolio is greater than twice the spread between the expected total return of the conventional debt and the commodity-linked bond. This rule supports the view that, if more of the LDCs' debt were issued in the form of commodity-linked bonds, then the debt-service payment of the LDCs would decline along with export prices (or export revenues), thus lightening their debt load.
F49|Export-Led Growth, Growth-Driven Export, Both or None? Granger Causality Analysis on OECD Countries|This paper investigates the possibility of export-led growth and growth-driven export by testing for Granger causality between the logarithms of real exports and real GDP in twenty-five OECD countries. Two complementary testing strategies are applied. First, depending on the time series properties of the data, causality is tested with Wald tests within finite-order vector autoregressive (VAR) models in levels and/or in first-differences. Then, with no need for pre-testing, a modified Wald procedure is used in augmented level VAR systems. In both cases we experiment with alternative deterministic trend degrees. The results indicate that there is no causality between exports and growth (NC) in Luxembourg and in the Netherlands, exports cause growth (ECG) in Iceland, growth causes exports (GCE) in Canada, Japan and Korea, and there is two-way causality between exports and growth (TWC) in Sweden and in the UK. Although with less certainty, we also conclude that there is NC in Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary and Norway, ECG in Australia, Austria and Ireland, and GCE in Finland, Portugal and the USA. However, in the case of Belgium, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain and Switzerland the results are too controversial to make a simple choice.
F49|Export Instability, Investment and Economic Growth in Asian Countries: A Time Series Analysis|In this study, we look at the relationship between export stability, investment and economic growth in nine Asian countries using time series data. The few previous time series studies in this area have not paid any attention to stationarity and cointegration issues. We find that in most cases, the variables are non-stationary in their levels and not cointegrated. These results raise serious doubts about the results of these studies. The results are not uniform across countries casting doubts about the validity of the numerous cross-section studies. For Japan, Malaysia, Philippines and Sri Lanka, we find a negative relationship between export instability and economic growth. For (South) Korea, Myanmar, Pakistan and Thailand, we find a positive relationship between the two variables. For India, we get mixed results. In most cases, economic growth is found to be positively associated with domestic investment.

F49|Modeling lunar calendar effects in taiwan|The three most important Chinese holidays, Chinese New Year, the Dragon- boat Festival, and Mid-Autumn Holiday have dates determined by a lunar calendar and move between two solar months. Consumption, production, and other economic behavior in countries with large Chinese population including Taiwan are strongly affected by these holidays. For example, production accelerates before lunar new year, almost completely stops during the holidays and gradually rises to an average level after the holidays. This moving holiday often creates difficulty for empirical modeling using monthly data and this paper employs an approach that uses regressors for each holiday to distinguish effects before, during and after holiday. Assuming that the holiday effect is the same for each day of the interval over which the regressor is nonzero in a given year, the value of the regressor in a given month is the proportion of this interval that falls in the month. Bell and Hillmer (1983) proposed such a regressor for Easter which is now extensively used in the U.S. and Europe. We apply the Bell and Hillmer's method to analyze ten important series in Taiwan, which might be affected by moving holidays. AICC and out-of-sample forecast performance were used for selecting number of holiday regressors and their interval lengths. The results are further checked by various diagnostic checking statistics including outlier detection and sliding spans analysis. The empirical results support this approach. Adding holiday regressors can effectively control the impact of moving holidays and improves the seasonal decomposition. AICC and accumulated forecast error are useful in regressor selection. We find that unemployment rates in Taiwan have holiday effects and seasonal factors cannot be consistently estimated unless the holiday factor is included. Furthermore, as the unemployment is rising, the magnitude of holiday and seasonal factor are decreasing. Finally, we find that holiday factors are generally smaller than seasonal factors but should not be ignored.
F49|Identifying the Predictors for Financial Crisis Using Gibbs Sampler|The Asian financial crisis broke out in Thailand in July 1997, and rapidly spread throughout the neighboring countries. An important question then arises? Is it possible to predict next financial crisis? If yes, then what are the predictors? The answer lies in combined usage of economic theory and econometric methods. By using the economic theory, one can locate possible potential crisis predictors whereas appropriate econometric models can pinpoint effective ones. In this paper we suggest using the Stochastic Search Variable Selection (SSVS) developed by George and McCulloch (1993) to identify the crisis predictors. As is suggested by the name, SSVS stochastically searches for practically significant variables. Each variable coefficient is assumed to come from a mixture of two normal variates with respectively large and small variances. For the former case, this variable is considered as insignificant and should be excluded from the model whereas for the latter, this variable is significant and should be included in the model. SSVS is not affected by the ordering of the candidate variables and is particularly effective when the sample size is much smaller than the number of all possible models. By employing SSVS method, we conclude that annual growth rate of money supply, $M_2$, and the ratio of government debt to GDP are promising predictors for financial crisis. It is worth mentioning that the frequently mentioned factors, such as ratio of total foreign reserve to GDP and the ratio of current deficit to GDP are not selected by our analysis. Our empirical analysis implies that monetary and fiscal policy play a crucial role in exploring the Asian financial crisis.
F49|Testing for Unit Roots: Mexico's GDP|The study presents an analysis of the stochastic nature of the gross domestic product of Mexico for the period 1900-2001. Several specifications to test for the existence of unit roots are presented. The conventional tests, Dickey Fuller, Augmented Dickey Fuller and Phillips Perron, indicate that the series is nonstationary and integrated of order 1. The result is robust to the inclusion of exogenously and endogenously determined structural breaks. Interestingly, when structural breaks are determined endogenously, a structural break in 1907 is identified. We interpret this results as suggesting that setting the date of a structural break ex-ante might not be the most efficient procedure when testing for unit roots.
F49|Financial Market Regulation-Security Scams In India with historical evidence and the role of corporate governance|The financial system consists of specialized and non-specialized financial institutions, of organized and unorganized financial markets, of financial instruments and services, which facilitate transfer of funds. Procedures and practices adopted in the markets, and financial interrelationships are also parts of this system. In product or other service markets, purchasers part with their money in exchange for something now. In finance, money “now” is exchanged for a “promise to pay in the future”. However, in product or service markets, if the object sold – from a car to a haircut – is defective, the buyers often find out relatively soon. On the other hand, loan quality is not readily observable for quite some time and can be hidden for extensive periods. Moreover, banks and non-bank financial intermediaries can also alter the risk composition of their assets more quickly than most non-financial industries, and banks can readily hide problems by extending loans to clients that cannot service previous debt obligations. Theoretically, the financial market facilitates allocation of resources efficiently, which involves quick dissemination of information and reaction to it. The financial markets are susceptible to manipulation as some participants have information that others do not that is information asymmetry is ubiquitous in financial markets. To overcome this problem corporate governance is required to ensure that suppliers of finance to corporations are assured that they get their return on their investment . Despite the existence of institutional and legal framework numerous financial scams continue to be perpetuated both in developed and developing countries. 1.2 The objectives of this study are : a) To examine some of the major misdemeanors which perpetuated in the financial system in 1991 and 2001 in India . b) Understand the financial regulatory measures which have been adopted after the 1991 share scam in India and why despite such measures adopted a security scam has recurred in 2001. c) Examine the theoretical structure of corporate governance for analyzing security scams that have occurred in the 1990s and the new millennium. The second section contains a summary of the events that occurred leading to the share scams and financial frauds in India and abroad during the recent decade that shook the financial markets. The third section surveys the rationale for regulation of securities markets and the functional procedures adopted in India in the aftermath of the scams. The fourth section looks at the theoretical underpinnings of corporate governance which, is followed by a discussion of the shortcomings of the regulatory set up in India which fails to prevent the recurrence of financial misdemeanors. Financial Liberalization is a phenomenon that is almost all pervasive in the world today. While liberalization has led to substantial benefits in terms of increased transparency, it has ushered in opportunities of corporate misgovernance. This implies that the mechanism by which legal institutions ensure that suppliers of funds receive the return on investment is not sufficient or appropriate. Recent trends through the 1990s in India and abroad reveal how corporate governance has not been effective permitting unscrupulous and opportunistic individuals to manipulate the market in their favor. The process of financial market regulation ensures that important guidelines are issued regarding how primary dealers (brokers) should operate with regards to mode of operation, conduct, litigation, amount of business to be handled, management of risk, internal control etc. These security scams and financial scandals discussed here involved the manipulation of huge amounts of money. The perpetrators of these gross transgression had such a comprehensive knowledge of how the system worked that they manipulated it to their advantage operating in an opportunistic manner . The essence of the argument in is that the occurrence and reoccurrence of such security scams and financial scandals can be attributed to a failure of corporate governance in finance despite the existence of an functioning regulatory authority empowered with the legal sanctions.
F49|Equilibrium structures in vertical oligopoly|The central purpose of this paper is to examine vertical integration as an equilibrium phenomenon. We model it as integration between Cournot oligopolists in both the upstream and the downstream stages. We consider the issue of private profitability versus collective profitability and show that under several situations the equilibrium outcomes may result in a Prisoner's dilemma. The analysis is extended to consider equilibrium outcomes in a dynamic setting, where we find no integration to be a relatively common outcome.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F49|A non-linear Macroeconometric Impact Model of External Debt Cancellation in Severely Indebted Low Income Country (SILIC) Economies|"On the basis of models I developed to simulate mathematical relationships between external debt and fiscal and balance of payments variables my thesis evaluates whether debt cancellation will overcome the debt overhang and crowding out effects of external debt and allow Severely Indebted Low Income Country (SILIC) economies to meet their current and future debt service in full, without further debt relief, without further rescheduling or accumulation of arrears and without unduly compromising economic growth. I find that recipients of debt cancellation have not lowered their total indebtedness [as a condition for solving their debt overhang problem] nor have they leveraged exchange market stability, increased fiscal spending or higher import capacity [as a condition for solving their ‘debt crowding out’ problem]. Recipients of debt cancellation have also failed to improve debt service capacity, resulting in failure to meet current debt service obligations and continued accumulation of arrears. The principal explanation for this result is that debt cancellation is ""pseudo"" or ""accounting"" money and it has a crowding-out effect on new lending from bilateral sources. Since losses in new external disbursements undermine the capacity of countries to meet demands of their development programs and their current and future debt service in full [without further debt relief] debt cancellation forces countries to borrow more from non bilateral sources and therefore accumulate further debts. In the context of an endogenous growth style model where capital accumulation is the sole force driving growth these results underscore the desirability of implementing optimal rescheduling policy because implied guarantees of new external resources minimise the risk of debt repudiation, lowers uncertainty, and also allows the cycle of international borrowing to ensure that debts do not crowd out new investment. By reducing uncertainty, optimal rescheduling policy also contributes to lowering debt overhang and remains an essential part the gradual exit strategy from external indebtedness."
F49|EMU, EURO and EU-Membership: An Evaluation from the Turkish Macroeconomic Perspective|As a result of the macroeconomic convergence process in the light of the 1991 Maastricht Treaty, the monetary union between most of the EU countries started on January 1, 1999. Meanwhile, ten formerly eastern block countries and the Southern Section of Cyprus are preparing their economy for a full-membership to the EU while Turkey, as an associate- member of the Union since 1963 and as a part of customs union between Turkey and the EU since 1996, seems to be excluded from the next EU enlargement process. Therefore, this paper mainly intends to discuss the following two interrelated questions: (1) How far is Turkey different than the 11 membership candidate countries and the EU countries in terms of the ten selected macroeconomic indicators (1973-1997)? (2) To what extent will the introduction of the euro affect the balance-of-payments accounts and foreign exchange rates in Turkey? (Version: May 2000)

F49|Challenges of China;s Economic System for Economic Theory|The challenges in the market economy in China for economic theory touch on four topics: private versus public ownership of assets, Western legal systems versus Eastern European semiformal legal systems, individualism versus the collective good, and multiparty versus one party political systems. I came in contact with these issues while advising the government of Taiwan in the 1960's and 1970's, and the government of mainland China in the 1980's and 1990's.y
F49|Liberalisation And It’S Effect On Inequality In Developing Countries-A Case Study On India|There are both positive and negative aspects to liberalisation policies.Liberalisation policies are no less important than any other kind of economic policies, and so it can only be healthy that what was formerly an obscure and technocratic process has moved to centre-stage politically. What’s more, economic development and the alleviation of poverty are now key political priorities in further liberalisation. Hence inorder to check for the effectiveness of liberalisation policies in developing countries it is important to measure it from the point of view of how it has reduced levels of inequality. If liberalisation has so far had no impact on inequality within countries, for good or bad, it has become received wisdom that inequality between countries has increased. Yet the overall pattern is less easy to sum up. Within different country groups there have been varying patterns of either increasing or decreasing inequality.Hence a case study is taken on India and with the help of convergence hypothesis using log linear and linear regression techniques divergence is proved.Liberalisation since 1991 has had no major impact on reducing the level of inequality between Indian states.
F49|External Sources Of Financing for Urban Development In India|Financing urban development in India has primarily been a domestic affair. However we have looked to external sources for financing and it has financed 10-12% of domestic investment. The assistance we have been receiving From foreign bodies has been steadily increasing over the years. In the past most of the external programs were not directed at the urban area but now with concentration on areas such as environment,health,micro credit and small scale industries they are more urban oriented. Urban India like other urban parts of the world is characterized by a high concentration of population and also concentration of development in a few areas. Urban development has become a major priority in the agenda of international agencies. Several bilateral and multi- lateral agencies still do not have an urban department. This is due to the low priority given to urban affairs. However these international agencies mainly differ in terms of three areas (a) setting priorities (b)identifying projects and partners, (c) Launching projects and monitoring. Most of the above activities mentioned (a) to (c) Tend to take place in the beneficiary countries. The international agencies continue to be diverse in their urban development strategies. The contribution of developed countries to Development Aid seems to be declining in real terms. After the Second World War most of the member countries of OECD(Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) made a resolution at the United Nations to set aside 0.7 % of the GDP every year as development aid. However it is only the Scandinavian countries that meet this target and none of the other countries. In India’s domestic Economy also inspite of an increasing level of urbanisation most attention is paid to rural perspective has forced the planners to formulate development objectives insuch a way that allocation for the urban sector has remained low.
F49|The Impacts of Environmental Regulations on Industrial Activity: Evidence from the 1970 and 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments and the Census of Manufactures|This paper estimates the impacts of the Clean Air Act's division of counties into pollutant-specific nonattainment and attainment categories on measures of industrial activity obtained from 1.75 million plant observations from the Census of Manufactures. Emitters of the controlled pollutants in nonattainment counties were subject to greater regulatory oversight than emitters in attainment counties. The preferred statistical model for plant-level growth includes plant fixed effects, industry by period fixed effects, and county by period fixed effects. The estimates from this model suggest that in the first 15 years in which the Clean Air Act was in force (197287), nonattainment counties (relative to attainment ones) lost approximately 590,000 jobs, $37 billion in capital stock, and $75 billion (1987 dollars) of output in pollution-intensive industries. These findings are robust across many specifications, and the effects are apparent in many polluting industries.
F49|How Active Are Managers in SA|This paper seeks to provide a balanced perspective on the role that benchmarks play in the setting of investment policy, the degree to which asset managers deviate from these benchmarks in pursuit of adding value and the degree to which value is added. The findings of this occasional paper are also helpful in understanding the role that a quantitative manager fulfils and the degree to which quantitative and active judgemental asset managers should be viewed as having complimentary skills in the establishment of optimal fund structures and prudent investment policy
F49|Some economic applications of Scott domains|The present paper is structured around two main constructions, fixed points of functors and fibrations and sections of functors. Fixed points of functors are utilized to resolve problems of infinite regress that have recently appeared in economics. Fibrations and sections are utilized to model solution concepts abstractly, so that we can solve equations whose arguments are solution concepts. Most of the objects (games, solution concepts) that we consider can be obtained as some kind of limit of their finite subobjects. Some of the constructions preserve computability. The paper relies heavily on recent work on the semantics of program- ming languages.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F49|Financial contagion, interest rates and the role of the exchange rate as shock absorber in Central and Eastern Europe|This paper studies the impact of external factors on daily exchange rates and short-term interest rates in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland during the period August 1997 – May 2001. I find that neither exchange rates nor interest rates are influenced by short-term German interest rates. Nevertheless, I show that shocks to emerging-market risk premia had a significant impact on exchange rates in all three Central and Eastern European count-ries and on interest rates in the Czech Republic. In addition, studying the second moment of the variables, I demonstrate that Czech and Polish exchange rates were affected by ‘vo- latility contagion’ coming from emerging markets. I find also some partial support for the ‘volatility contagion’ hypothesis on Czech interest rates. These findings shed some doubts on the alleged theoretical ability of a floating exchange rate – such as in the Czech Repub-lic – to absorb external shocks and insulate a country's domestic monetary policy comple-tely. However, the spill-over effect on Czech interest rates might be explained by the ‘ma-naged’ nature of the exchange rate regime, thereby re-establishing some credibility of the theory.
F49|Causes and consequences of the 1982 Third World Debt Crisis|This paper investigates underlying causes of the debt crisis that only surfaced with Mexico’s unilateral moratorium on her foreign obligations in 1982. The paper investigates the evolutionary trend of LDC debt and the consequences for lenders, borrowers and the international financial system. The motivation of the research is to develop sound analytical understanding of the mechanics of debt accumulation as groundwork for further study of macroeconomics of debt and debt relief. The paper observes that the third world’s debt crisis resulted from an exponential increase in external indebtedness disproportionate to the debt service capacities of developing countries. The collapse of commodity prices, high interest rates and appreciation of the US $ further tightened their internal fiscal positions and balance of payments, forcing them to re-finance maturing debt from fresh loans. The paper also observes that western bankers ignored signals of an imminent debt crisis and worsened the debt portfolio of third world countries by refinancing maturing loans with shorter maturities. These countries remained on the brink of default until convergence of multiple maturities and inadequate availability of new finance caused a capital reversal. The paper argues that although developing countries had used some of the loans to finance unproductive investments [including militarization] the lenders also brought the crisis upon themselves as a result of ‘obsession’ lending aimed at offloading surplus petro-dollars deposited in western banks by oil exporting countries. Although lending was justified by apprehension to fearful consequences for world trade and political stability [if the purchasing power of the third world evaporated as a result of discontinuation of lending] the paper emphasizes the role of ‘uncritical herd instincts’ of lenders in the debt crisis. The paper concludes that the failure of the loans represent miscalculations on both sides of a transaction and distortions in the lending process itself, hence the debt crisis deserved mutual cooperation of the lenders and the borrowers. However, the closure of all financial markets to defaulting economies prevaricated cooperative resolution and, in fact, precipitated the crisis. The paper emphasizes that developing country economies are fatally dysfunctional with long standing ills that are only concealed by capital inflows; hence unilateral action of lenders in halting the supply of finance while demanding repayments opens a liquidity gap resulting in consistent economic contraction.

F49|Evaluating the compatibility of economic reform with political liberalisation in poor african countries -the case of malawi|This paper investigates claims that fundamental policy changes aiming to disengage the state from the economy do not provide appropriate discourse for a new government in a newly democratised state. This view has a lot of support among Stalinist-Marxist scholars who believe that unmaking a welfare state simultaneously as the process of reassigning power to the people is a contradictory and politically suicidal undertaking. Based on the analysis of change in Malawi, this paper offers philosophical counter-arguments supporting the view that economic reform is a necessary condition for democratic development. The main argument is that, given that the role of political liberalisation is to enable people [previously trapped in an econo-political hegemony] to make decisions about their own lives, then economic reform is the only instrument capable of delivering the desired transformation. This is on the premise that personal freedom is a derivative of economic freedom, and that by opening up the market and unleashing popular participation in the economy, economic reform facilitates convergence of a free society and a market economy. The paper also argues that political rhetoric signalling the reversal of economic reforms as a socialist alternative has the potential to sustain a sitting reformist government in power as in the case of the reformist National Action Party (PAN) which rules in Mexico while the PRI founded in 1929 remains outside government. The paper also observes that a platform critical of economic reform is bound to ignite apprehension for potential loss of personal and economic freedoms that arose from a process of reform. However, owing to evidence that change from one party to multipartyism in Malawi was brought on largely by economic policy failure, the paper supports the argument that resource scarcity, degradation and poverty (measured by household food scarcity, social indicators, and the incidence of malnutrition) pose a major threat to democracy. Although the question of returning to autocracy in the hope that there will be economic prosperity may be outside present options, economic instability or uncertainty in the free market economy is certainly not a satisfactory recompense for emergence of new and wider freedoms.
F49|Mobile source pollution control in the United States and China|This paper reviews policies for the control of mobile source pollution and their potential application in China. The first section of the paper reviews the U.S. experience with mobile source pollution control since regulations were first established in the Clean Air Act of 1970. Highlights in the policy and trends in vehicle emissions over the 1970 to 2000 time period are discussed. The second section of the paper discusses the range of policy instruments that could be used to control vehicle pollution, ranging from traditional direct regulations to market-based instruments. Experiences with the use of economic incentives in the United States and elsewhere are also discussed. The third section of the paper discusses possible implications of the U.S. experience for controlling vehicle pollution in China. While market- based instruments might be particularly appropriate for use in several aspects of China’s pollution control policies, important differences between the institutional structures in China and the United States suggest that they should be phased in gradually. The paper closes with concluding remarks.
F49|El deterioro de los precios de los productos básicos de exportación de Bolivia durante el shock externo de 1998 y 1999|El shock adverso en los precios de los productos básicos registrado entre 1998 y 1999, ha recibido escasa atención en comparación con la crisis financiera reciente. En el caso de una economía pequeña, abierta y dependiente de la exportación de productos básicos, como la boliviana, el shock ha significado una fuerte caída en los ingresos reales de exportación. La década de los noventa, si bien es un período temporal relativamente corto, permite analizar el shock adverso reciente, en el cual los precios han tenido un comportamiento cíclico con tendencia decreciente, donde la duración de la fase de auge fue similar a la de la declinación pero la magnitud de la caída de los precios fue mayor que la del alza. La caída reciente de los precios internacionales parece confirmar, -para el caso de canasta exportadora de Bolivia- que la mayoría de los precios de los productos básicos tiende a moverse de manera conjunta en las fases expansivas y contractivas del ciclo. Los shocks permanentes juegan un papel importante al explicar la varianza de los precios de exportación de Bolivia, especialmente en el caso de los metales. A diferencia de otros países en desarrollo se encontró que la diversificación sectorial de las exportaciones de productos básicos no ha permitido atenuar los efectos del ciclo de los precios, es decir no se trató de una diversificación anticíclica. Sin embargo, a nivel de productos se ha encontrado que un tercio de las exportaciones comprende a productos contracíclicos. El índice general de precios de productos de exportación no muestra una alta volatilidad. Empero, considerando los distintos sectores destaca la volatilidad de los precios de combustibles. Entre los productos agrícolas, resalta la volatilidad exhibida por los precios del café, azúcar y algodón. Con la crisis de 1997, la variabilidad aumentó en la mayoría de los productos, sean éstos metales, combustibles o productos agrícolas. Se encontró que en la década de los noventa la incorporación de un nuevo sector exportador de productos básicos, el soyero, no significó una disminución del riesgo total inherente al portafolio de exportaciones. Sin embargo, a nivel de los productos, se identificó un porcentaje relevante de compensaciones intra e intersectoriales. La evidencia empírica sugiere que la política exportadora implícita aplicada por Bolivia en los años noventa, centrada en la diversificación de productos básicos, no permitió -en la reciente crisis- minimizar el riesgo, atenuar los ciclos, disminuir la volatilidad de los precios ni aumentar los ingresos reales de exportación. Ello ratifica la necesidad de diversificar las exportaciones bolivianas mediante una estrategia de exportaciones de manufacturas intensivas en trabajo, que contribuya a disminuir la vulnerabilidad ante shocks externos adversos.
F49|The evolution and convergence of the government expenditure composition in the OECD countries: an analysis of the functional distribution|The composition of the public expenditure affects the long-run growth rate (Barro, 1990, Devarajan, Swaroop and Zou, 1996). This paper has explored the existence of convergence in the structure of government expenditure by functions in the OECD countries for the period 1970-1998 and the perspectives of this process to persist in the future. The results obtained first through the similarity index and afterwards using the usual convergence indicators (ƒÒ, ƒã and ƒ×), adapted to the analysis of the breakdown of public expenditure, point out to the existence of a distribution approximation. Nevertheless, we have found that the majority of expenditures were near to the steady-state, which differs across countries. This reveals that there are some individual factors that impede the convergence to a single structure in the long run. This could be one of the explanations of the difference observed among economic growth rates in developed countries.
F49|Migration, FDI, and the Margins of Trade|The present study develops a simple analytically solvable heterogeneous firm model of trade, investment and migration; where foreign direct investment, international trade and labour migration are determined simultaneously. We estimate the theoretical model based on micro data for 4.5 million companies from the OECD countries. Our estimates confirm that entry costs and firm heterogeneity largely determine the flows of foreign direct investment, international trade and labour migration.

Во трудот е користен методот на анализа на статистичките податоци како и методот на дедукција. The main objective of this paper is to show the importance of oil in world’s economy, oil production and use, its impact on world trade, international oil market between 1950’s and 2000’s alongside with its future prospects. The greatest part of this paper is dedicated to OPEC cartel as world’s major petroleum producer and trader as well as its forms of control in production and trade. Stong emphasis is given on the prediction of greatest authorities in this area about future price trends and production of oil. Finally, the paper stresses the importance of oil in Macedonian economy, a country deeply dependent on petroleum-import. The methods of statistical data analysis and deduction are widely used in this survey.
F49|Economic Models for Management of Resources in Peer-to-Peer and Grid Computing|The accelerated development in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Grid computing has positioned them as promising next generation computing platforms. They enable the creation of Virtual Enterprises (VE) for sharing resources distributed across the world. However, resource management, application development and usage models in these environments is a complex undertaking. This is due to the geographic distribution of resources that are owned by different organizations or peers. The resource owners of each of these resources have different usage or access policies and cost models, and varying loads and availability. In order to address complex resource management issues, we have proposed a computational economy framework for resource allocation and for regulating supply and demand in Grid computing environments. The framework provides mechanisms for optimizing resource provider and consumer objective functions through trading and brokering services. In a real world market, there exist various economic models for setting the price for goods based on supply-and-demand and their value to the user. They include commodity market, posted price, tenders and auctions. In this paper, we discuss the use of these models for interaction between Grid components in deciding resource value and the necessary infrastructure to realize them. In addition to normal services offered by Grid computing systems, we need an infrastructure to support interaction protocols, allocation mechanisms, currency, secure banking, and enforcement services. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usage of some of these economic models in resource brokering through Nimrod/G deadline and cost-based scheduling for two different optimization strategies on the World Wide Grid (WWG) testbed that contains peer-to-peer resources located on five continents: Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America
F49|Monetary neutrality in one specific class of DGE model with staggered prices|In this paper I show that monetary neutrality proposition holds for one specific parameterization of a dynamic general equilibrium model of monopolistic competition even if nominal rigidity in a form of staggered price setting or partial adjustment price-setting mechanism is present in a model. This parameterization is a result of a zero profit condition for intermediate goods producers and it requires that degree of increasing returns in intermediate goods production is equal to price- marginal costs markup.
F49|Health System Watch Spring/1999: Cross-Section Analysis Of Health Spending With Special Regard To Trends In Austria|The richer a country, the higher its expenditure on health care. The increase in health spending which compared to the overall growth had taken place at a rather rapid pace experienced a worldwide slow-down during the 90s. In relation to overall economic growth and the expansion of other countries’ health care systems, Austria’s system grew below average- a fact which holds particularly true for the years between 1990 and 1997. This development may largely be due to a constant consolidation of budget, relatively high prices for private households, which, however, are possibly overestimated and still unascertained but highly probable improvements in productivity in the main fields of health care. Within our observation period of 16 years, the privat households’ expenditure reached a peak with private health spending experiencing the quickest increase. Although overestimated, these relatively high prices together with a sharply rising consumption expenditure on health care constitute an increased burden on private households. While social insurance companies in their function as bulk purchasers have had the power to reject excessive prices, private customers were charged above average during the last few years. This development has to be closely scrutinized in order to ensure public welfare and the maintenance of a social health care system in future.

F49|A supply side approach for estimating a Neo-classical fixed investment model for the South African economy|Investment behaviour is influenced by a number of variables. A change in macro-econometric parameters can affect investment behaviour in a number of ways. The purpose of this study is to report the theory and estimation of an investment model for the South African economy. The model estimated in this study is mainly based on the neo-classical investment theory as part of the estimation of a consistent supply side, macro-econometric model for the South African economy. Equations for capital, fixed investment and company savings were constructed and estimated.
F49|Export Instability, Investment and Economic Growth in Asian Countries: A Time Series Analysis|In this study, we look at the relationship between export stability, investment and economic growth in nine Asian countries using time series data. The few previous time series studies in this area have not paid any attention to stationarity and cointegration issues. We find that in most cases, the variables are non-stationary in their levels and not cointegrated. These results raise serious doubts about the results of these studies. The results are not uniform across countries casting doubts about the validity of the numerous cross-section studies. For Japan, Malaysia, Philippines and Sri Lanka, we find a negative relationship between export instability and economic growth. For (South) Korea, Myanmar, Pakistan and Thailand, we find a positive relationship between the two variables. For India, we get mixed results. In most cases, economic growth is found to be positively associated with domestic investment.
F49|Does International Trade Synchronize Business Cycles?|This paper studies the relationship between international trade and output fluctuations. The authors find evidence that the business cycles of countries that are more open to international trade are more likely to by synchronized with the business cycles of their major trading partners. A detailed study of the South Korean case shows that while business cycles are related to openness, the diversification of export destinations seems to weaken these links. The authors find no relationship between openness and output volatility.
F49|research notes and comments: A note on Australia's inward and outward direct foreign investment|This research note investigates the determinants of Australia's inward and outward direct foreign investment (DFI) using annual and quarterly data. It is found from pooled annual data for Australia and seven developed countries that DFI has been influenced by labor disputes, current account balances, Australia's real GDP and real exchange rates. The application of an econometric model using quarterly data shows that the long run elasticities of DFI with respect to real exchange rates and labor disputes are significant for selected cases.

The severe socioeconomic crisis in Ukraine, including a huge decline of production, hyperinflation, and the informalization of the economy, caused both a substantial reduction of social security contributions and an increase in the number of people who need assistance. The creation of a sustainable economic system in the country requires the development of a new model of social security suited to the realities of a market economy. The objective of this paper is to investigate the current situation, trends, and possible ways of reforms in the Ukrainian social security system, taking into account specific features of the national economy, in particular the informal sector. The analysis focuses on the key component of social security - the pension system - and combines both qualitative and model-based approaches.
F49|Comparative trade advantages in Europe: the empirical distribution of the Balassa index|For the classification of industries within a certain country on the basis of their comparative trade advantage or trade disadvantage it is common practise to use the Balassa index. If the value of this index exceeds 1, the concomitant industry is thought to have a comparative trade advantage. However, since the distribution of the Balassa index is not known, a particular value of the index indicates little as to the extent of the comparative trade advantage. This report describes the results of an investigation as to the empirical distribution of the Balassa index. It appears that this distribution is skewed, that it is not affected by aggregation of observations over time, and that it is stable through time. A regional division does appear to have influence on the distribution though.
F49|Common Priors and Separation of Convex Sets|We observe that the set of all priors of an agent is the convex hull of his types. A prior common to all agents exists, if the sets of the agents' priors have a point in common. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the non-emptiness of the intersection of several closed convex subsets of the simplex, which is an extension of the separation theorem. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of common prior is a special case of this.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
F49|Telecommunications Reform in the United States: Promises and Pitfalls|"The United States Congress recently enacted sweeping legislation to overhaul the rules governing competition in telecommunications services. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (see Congressional Record, 1996) is the first major rewrite of the Communications Act of 1934. It also supersedes the 1982 antitrust consent decree that broke up AT&T and barred the seven new regional Bell operating companies (""Bells"") from manufacturing equipment and offering long-distance service. The stakes are high, as telecommunications (""telecom"") are a critical element of a modern economy's backbone. The U.S. telecom sector's revenue in 1994 exceeded $200 billion: $150 billion in telephone service, $42 billion in broadcasting, and $28 billion in cable television (Economic Report of the President, 1996, chapter 6). The importance of the regulatory reforms in the 1996 Act as perceived by those in the best position to know--market participants--is reflected in the frenetic lobbying leading up to the Act (especially on its telephone provisions), and in the recent wave of corporate restructuring and shifting alliances reportedly driven by expectations of a new competitive environment. Regulatory reform enjoys broad support, but there is less agreement about its appropriate pace and nature. The road to reform holds both promises and pitfalls. This paper discusses the underlying economic issues, the progress made by the Act, and the challenges lying ahead as we move from regulated monopoly to competition. Although the U.S. is starting with regulated private monopolies, some of the discussion will be pertinent also for a transition to competition when starting with state monopolies.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>"
F49|Deficit Financing, Foreign Debt, and the Mundell-Fleming Model: A Dynamic Analysis|The works with basic Mundell-Fleming model by adding two dynamic equations, one for the balance of payments (or accumulation of foreign debt) and another for the budget deficit which includes all possible modes of financing.
F49|Equivalence of the APV, WACC and flows to equity approaches to firm valuation|This paper shows that the three valuation methods (if used correctly) always yield the same result. The most striking result of this paper is that the Net Present Value of the tax shield due to interest payments (in the APV approach) should be calculated as follows in order to derive an accurate result: NPV OF INTEREST TAX SHIELDS = ƒ Dt-1 Kut T Â ------ t=1 t ' (1+Kut) t=1 T = Corporate tax rate / Kut = Cost of unlevered equity in period t / Dt­1 = Value of debt in period t­1 At first, it would appear that this formula implies that debt has a cost of Ku, and that the interest tax shields are discounted at Ku, but this is not the case. The Net Present Value of interest tax shields is not (and this is the main error in previous papers about this topic) the NPV of a single flow, but the difference of two NPVs of two flows with different risks: the NPV of the taxes paid in the unlevered firm and the NPV of taxes paid in the levered firm. Our formula is the difference of these two NPVs. Obviously, the flow of taxes paid in the levered firm is smaller but riskier than the flow of taxes paid in the unlevered firm. We show that, if used correctly, these three approaches to firm valuation will yield the same result. We apply these valuation procedures to perpetuities, to growing companies (at a constant rate g) and, finally, to any company. The main objective of this paper is to show that the three valuation methods always yield the same result. The paper also helps to think more about the meaning of the formulas and their relationships.
F49|La place du contrôle des mouvements de capitaux dans la politique économique française et les perspectives liées à son allégement<BR>[The role of capital controls in France's economic policy and prospects related to its phasing out]|This paper reviews the central features of France’s capital controls in the 70's and 80's and strives to assess their ability, in the context of various exchange rate mechanisms, to regulate capital flows and to stabilize the exchange rate while allowing France to preserve a measure of economic and monetary independence, in particular within the European Monetary System
F49|Bilateral and multilateral exchange rate and purchasing power parity indexes: the aggregation problem|Following the high variability of floating exchange rates after the collapse of the Bretton-Wood System, policymakers have increasingly relied on weighted exchange rate indexes (nominal effective exchange rate index) or indexes of competitiveness (real effective exchange rate or purchasing-power-parity index)in order to assess the need for and the magnitude of exchange rate adjustments.However, these indexes are plagued by many methodological problems that impinge on their reliability. This paper is concerned only with one of the main limitations of these indexes, namely, the ad-hoc character of the determination of the weighting system used in their construction. To solve this problem, a new kind of index is proposed, which is derived from a complete system of export demand functions endowed with aggregative properties. This new index is compared with the effective exchange rate index (MERM) of the International Monetary Fund.
F49|A macroeconomic view of Eurodollar market expansion after 1973|"This paper analyzes the Eurodollar market, investigating the reasons for its expansion after 1973, and the consequences for monetary policy. In the first part of the paper, the issue of credit and money creation by offshore banks is considered. The nature of the liquidity creation process is shown to be dependent on the specific definitions of money and balance of payments position that are adopted by the national authorities. The concepts of money (in domestic and foreign currencies)held by residents and of basic balance are specified, and it is demonstrated that the domestic economy of a given country is not directly affected by the external use of its currency between non-residents. The development of these external transactions, however, proves to be directly dependent on the domestic policies followed by the monetary authorities of that country. The second part of the paper is devoted to an empirical analysis of the development of the Eurodollar market during the period from 1974 to 1980. Estimates of a partial adjustment model show that credit expansion in the Eurodollar market during this period was largely ""demand determined,"" owing to the monetary policy implemented by the Federal Reserve. The econometric results stress the key role of international trade in the development of the Eurodollar activities during these years. Implications of these results for the regulation of Euromarkets are briefly considered in the conclusion."
