I18|Discontinuity in Care: Practice Closures among Primary Care Providers and Patient Health|This paper investigates consequences of practice closures among primary care providers on subsequent patient health care utilization and health. Critically, the analysis relies on population-level administrative Danish data that facilitate a unique link between all Danes and their family doctor. We start by characterizing the nature of a practice closure, including the change in provider characteristics that occurs when patients change provider. Practice closure leads patients to choose a systematically younger and less experienced primary care provider. Using a difference-in-differences strategy that compares individuals who experience a practice closing with similar individuals enrolled in similar practices that do not close until later, we next investigate consequences for patient health care utilization and health outcomes. We find that a change in provider due to practice closure increases detection of chronic illness but does not lead to concurrent changes in primary care utilization. We do detect a considerable increase in the use of emergency care, however. A decomposition exercise shows that both physician practice style and the disruption itself plays a role for the total effects but that the direction of their relative influence varies across outcome domains. Importantly, disruption is not always negative from the perspective of the patient.
I18|Working Paper 312 - Quality Homes for Sustainable Malaria Prevention in Africa|Using the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from 8 African countries, among the top 10 countries with the highest malaria cases, accounting for 87% of malaria incidence cases in Africa, we analyze the impact of housing quality and the usual malaria prevention measures on malaria incidence among children under 5 years old. First, we investigate the potential correlation between malaria incidence and the quality of housing materials. Secondly, using OLS, two-stage least squares and Poisson regression, we estimate the marginal effects of housing quality on the incidence of malaria. The results can be summarized in four points. (i) The statistical analysis results show a substantial correlation between housing quality and the incidence of malaria. We found 8 percentage points lower rate of incidence among children living in houses constructed with improved materials than those in houses with poor quality materials. (ii) We also found that it is not only the physical characteristic of homes that matters, having good sanitation is associate with lower malaria incidence, with a total difference of 10 and 4 percentage points compared to those with less improved toilet facility and poor-quality drinking water respectively. (iii) An improvement in the overall housing quality leads to a significant reduction in the incidence of malaria among children under 5 years old. Explicitly, an improvement from the first percentile measure of housing quality to the 50th percentile leads to a 32% reduction in the number of malaria cases among children under age-five. In other words, if one improves the housing quality of poorer households to the national average, and keeping other factors constant, the number of malaria cases will drop by 50%. (iv) For both groups of households, those that use mosquito bed nets and those who use insecticide as means of preventing malaria, the results show that improved housing quality complements bed nets and insecticides. As housing quality improves, the role of the two preventives become smaller and smaller. Keywords: Malaria, Housing quality, indoor intervention, IV regression, marginal plot.

I18|French GPs’ Willingness to Delegate Tasks: May Financial Incentives Balance Risk Aversion?|Delegating tasks to paramedics is a fairly recent development in France. So far it has essentially been developed in hospitals and is incipient in general practice. This paper focuses on the willingness of general practitioner to do so. A 2012 survey of 2,000 GPs might help anticipate GPs' willingness to delegate. This paper tests whether a more favourable funding system might help increase GP willingness. We implement a quasi-experimental design wherein GPs are randomly selected to form three groups of equal size, each of them being exposed to a different funding scheme when declaring their willingness to delegate tasks to nurses: Fully Funded (FF) by the social security administration, self-funded by GPs' revenues (Self-Funded, SF) and half-funded by both the social security administration and GPs (Half-Funded, HF). GPs' likelihood to favour task delegation is estimated with a probit model that especially considers a GP's attitude towards risk (aversion or tolerance) among a set of covariates, such as age, gender, rural/urban area, GP density and funding scheme. This article shows that, first, GPs are more likely to favour delegation, when they share a lower proportion of the cost. Second, the effect of risk aversion on the likelihood of favouring delegation is not altered by the funding scheme.
I18|How Do Agro-Pastoral Policies Affect the Dietary Intake of Agro-Pastoralists? Evidence from Niger|We investigate the mechanisms underlying the effect of agricultural policies directed toward pastoralist households on their dietary intake. To do so, we pursue a mediation analysis while referring to theoretical agricultural household models. We decompose the total effect of selected policies on pastoralist dietary intake into an indirect effect, i.e., the effect that operates through pastoral profits, and a residual direct effect. Using an agro-pastoral survey conducted in Niger in 2016, the effects of extension services associated with better access to markets are found to be channeled through households’ annual profits from cattle and sheep raising, while this is not the case for private veterinary services and low-cost livestock feed programs. Extension services may foster specialization in cattle and sheep raising, which may incentivize households to move toward a nomadic lifestyle and change their food habits and thereby have detrimental consequences on their calorie intake. Besides, other life choices could be spurred or hampered by policies, such as migrations and radicalization.
I18|Community matters: heterogenous impacts of a sanitation intervention| We study the effectiveness of a community-level information and mobilization intervention to reduce open defecation (OD) and increase sanitation investments in Nigeria. The results of a cluster-randomized control trial in 246 communities, conducted between 2014 and 2018, suggest that average impacts are exiguous. However, these results hide important community heterogeneity, as the intervention has strong and lasting effects on OD habits in poorer communities. This result is robust across several measures of community socio-economic characteristics, and is not driven by baseline differences in toilet coverage. In poor communities, OD rates decreased by 9pp from a baseline level of 75%, while we find no effect in richer communities. The reduction in OD is achieved mainly through increased toilet ownership (+8pp from a baseline level of 24%). In terms of channels, the intervention appears to have raised the social status attached to toilet ownership among the poorer treated communities, and not in rich communities. Finally, we use data from our study and five other trials of similar interventions and show that estimated impacts on OD are stronger in poorer contexts, rationalizing the wide range of estimates in the literature and providing plausible external validity.
I18|Battling Antibiotic Resistance: Can Machine Learning Improve Prescribing?|Antibiotic resistance constitutes a major health threat. Predicting bacterial causes of infections is key to reducing antibiotic misuse, a leading cause of antibiotic resistance. We combine administrative and microbiological laboratory data from Denmark to train a machine learning algorithm predicting bacterial causes of urinary tract infections. Based on predictions, we develop policies to improve prescribing in primary care, highlighting the relevance of physician expertise and time-variant patient distributions for policy implementation. The proposed policies delay prescriptions for some patients until test results are known and give them instantly to others. We find that machine learning can reduce antibiotic use by 7.42 percent without reducing the number of treated bacterial infections. As Denmark is one of the most conservative countries in terms of antibiotic use, targeting a 30 percent reduction in prescribing by 2020, this result is likely to be a lower bound of what can be achieved elsewhere.
I18|Vaccination recommendations and timeliness - The German measles case|High vaccination rates have a social protection function in addition to individual prevention of infections and diseases. To reach herd immunity thresholds and to protect risk groups, the timeliness of immunization is an important goal for vaccination policy. There is currently no causal evidence of age-appropriate immunization for childhood vaccinations. This research investigates how changing the recommended timeliness of vaccination in childhood affects vaccination status, leaving the number of doses during the primary vaccination unchanged. I analyze an adaption in 2001 that shifts the timeliness two and a half years earlier within the second year of life. Using representative German survey data based on vaccination cards, I investigate a timeliness adaption of the measles primary vaccination in 2001, which changed the scheduled age of the second dose among young children aged 2 to 7 years, and use variation of the implementation across states. For adjusted timeliness of the second measles vaccination, the data imply a significant shift into earlier ages after the policy for the treatment group. In the short run, a difference-in-difference strategy implies causal evidence of the up-to-date vaccination probability at the end of the 7th year of life. Additionally, the adaption induced a significant timeliness effect on the up-to-date level of the first measles dose at the end of the second year of life. This effect can be seen as evidence that individuals, in this case parents, respond to nonbinding vaccination recommendation policies and that timing of vaccination is an important factor for reaching vaccination policy aims.
I18|Factor-Analysis-Based Directional Distance Function: The case of New Zealand hospitals|This paper develops a new factor-analysis-based (FAB) approach for choosing the optimal direction in a directional distance function (DDF) analysis. It has the combined merits of factor analysis and slacks-based measure (SBM) and incorporates the relative ease with which various input-output could be adjusted. This development relieves the dependency of price information that is normally unavailable in the provision of public goods. This new FAB-DDF model has been applied on a dataset containing all public hospitals in New Zealand (NZ) observed during 2011-2017. The empirical results indicate that the average reduction across different labor is in the range of 3-10 percent, and the corresponding figure for capital input is 25.7 percent. The case-adjusted inpatient-discharge and price-adjusted outpatient-visit are used as measures of desirable output, the average efficiencies are 92.7 percent and 99 percent respectively. Hospital readmission within 28 days of discharge is used as a measure for undesirable output, and the average efficiency score is 90 percent. These evidence support the suspicion that perverse incentives might exist under the National Health Targets abolished in 2018, which was a set of six indicators used in the last decade to evaluate the performance of local District Health Boards.
I18|Disease management in diabetes care: when involving GPs improves patient compliance and health outcomes|Although the study of the association between interventions in primary care and health outcomes continues to produce mixed findings, programs designed to promote the greater compliance of General Practitioners and their diabetic patients with treatment guidelines have been increasingly introduced worldwide, in an attempt to achieve better quality diabetes care through the enhanced standardisation of patient supervision. In this study we use clinical data taken from the Diabetes Register of one Local Health Authority (LHAs) in Italy’s Emilia-Romagna Region for the period 2014-2015. Firstly, we test to see whether the monitoring activities prescribed for diabetics by regional diabetes guidelines, actually have a positive impact on patients’ health outcomes and increase appropriateness in health care utilization. Secondly, we investigate whether GPs’ participation in the local Diabetes Management Program (DMP) leads to improved patient compliance with regional guidelines. Our results show that such a program, which aims to increase GPs’ involvement and cooperation in following regional guidelines for best practices, achieves its goal of improved patient compliance with the prescribed actions. In turn, through the implementation of the DMP and the greater involvement of physicians, regional policies have succeeded in promoting better health outcomes and the improved appropriateness of health care utilization.
I18|How CBO and JCT Analyzed Coverage Effects of New Rules for Association Health Plans and Short-Term Plans|In 2018, the Administration issued final rules governing association health plans and short-term, limited-duration insurance. This report describes how CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation analyzed those rules and presents their findings, which are similar to those previously reported for the rules as they were proposed.
I18|Prices for and Spending on Specialty Drugs in Medicare Part D and Medicaid|In recent years, the prices charged for specialty drugs have become a source of concern for many policymakers. Such drugs typically treat chronic, complex, or rare conditions, frequently have high prices, and may require special handling or patient monitoring. They accounted for a growing share of total net drug spending from 2010 to 2015 in both Medicareâ€™s prescription drug benefit (Part D) and Medicaid. The net prices paid for specialty drugs are much higher in Medicare Part D than in Medicaid, and net spending on such drugs grew much faster in Medicare Part D than in Medicaid.
I18|Federal Subsidies for Health Insurance Coverage for People Under Age 65: 2019 to 2029|The federal government subsidizes health insurance for most Americans through a variety of programs and tax provisions. CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation project that the federal subsidies, taxes, and penalties associated with health insurance coverage for people under age 65 will result in a net subsidy from the federal government of $737 billion in 2019. Under current law, that annual sum is projected to reach $1.3 trillion in 2029, mostly for Medicaid and the Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program, and tax benefits for work-related insurance.
I18|Key Design Components and Considerations for Establishing a Single-Payer Health Care System|Some Members of Congress have proposed establishing a single-payer health care system in the United States to ensure that virtually everyone has health insurance. In a typical single-payer system, people enroll in a health plan operated by the government, and the receipts and expenditures associated with the plan appear in the governmentâ€™s budget. This report describes the primary features of single-payer systems, and it discusses some of the design considerations and choices that policymakers will face in developing proposals for establishing such a system.
I18|Prices for and Spending on Specialty Drugs in Medicare Part D and Medicaid: An In-Depth Analysis: Working Paper 2019-02|In this working paper, the Congressional Budget Office examines the prices paid for specialty drugs and spending on those drugs in Medicare Part D and Medicaid from 2010 to 2015. Specialty drugs treat chronic, complex, or rare conditions, frequently have high prices, and may require special handling or monitoring of patients. The retail prices paid to pharmacies for brand-name specialty drugs are similar in Medicare Part D and Medicaid, but net prices are much higher in Medicare Part D because rebates from manufacturers are substantially lower than in Medicaid. In 2015, the
I18|Sources and Preparation of Data Used in HISIM2â€”CBOâ€™s Health Insurance Simulation Model: Working Paper 2019-04|CBOâ€™s new health insurance simulation model, HISIM2, is a microsimulation model, meaning that it uses individual-level input data to simulate population behavior. Beginning with the spring 2019 baseline budget projections, CBO completely revamped the way it models consumer and employer behavior; the agency also updated to new sources of individual-level input data. This paper describes the input data and the procedures for adjusting and adding to those data to form the sample used by HISIM2. The new model has been designed to use the Current Population Survey as its main
I18|How Do Changes in Medical Malpractice Liability Laws Affect Health Care Spending and the Federal Budget? Working Paper 2019-03|Changes to malpractice liability laws intended to decrease the liability of physicians and other medical providers have an ambiguous potential effect on overall health care spending (and the federal budget). Some providers may respond by performing fewer procedures that were undertaken mainly to avoid liability, whereas other providers may pursue more risky procedures and patients. This paper reviews the recent literature on the effect of changes in traditional liability laws on health care spending and presents new analyses of how such changes affect Medicare, Medicaid,
I18|CBOâ€™s Medicare Beneficiary Cost-Sharing Model: A Technical Description: Working Paper 2019-08|CBO uses a model to estimate the federal budgetary effects of proposed changes to the cost-sharing structure of the Medicare fee-for-service program. This paper describes that model, the analyses it can support, and an illustrative option for changing Medicareâ€™s cost-sharing structure.
I18|Behavioural Change and Alcohol-Fuelled Violence: A Field Experiment|We conduct a field experiment to assess whether alcohol-induced behavioural changes explain participants' recent history of violence. We find that being in a drinking environment, rather than intoxication, reduces participants' cognitive ability but increases their overconfidence. Those who experience small reductions in ability or become much more overconfident tended to have been involved in more violent incidents. Since these behavioural changes were largely unanticipated, our results suggest that individuals underestimate their true likelihood of becoming involved in violence when making alcohol consumption decisions. This presents additional challenges when formulating policy designed to deter alcohol-fuelled violence.

I18|Improving Regulatory Effectiveness through Better Targeting: Evidence from OSHA|We study how a regulator can best allocate its limited inspection resources. We direct our analysis to a US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) inspection program that targeted dangerous establishments and allocated some inspections via random assignment. We find that inspections reduced serious injuries by an average of 9% over the following five years. We use new machine learning methods to estimate the effects of counterfactual targeting rules OSHA could have deployed. OSHA could have averted over twice as many injuries if its inspections had targeted the establishments where we predict inspections would avert the most injuries. The agency could have averted nearly as many additional injuries by targeting the establishments predicted to have the most injuries. Both of these targeting regimes would have generated over $1 billion in social value over the decade we examine. Our results demonstrate the promise, and limitations, of using machine learning to improve resource allocation. JEL Classifications: I18; L51; J38; J8
I18|Widening the high school curriculum to include soft skill training: impacts on health, behaviour, emotional wellbeing and occupational aspirations|"From 2020 Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education will be compulsory in UK schools for adolescents, however less is known about how it can be taught in a an effective manner. We examine, through a randomised trial, the impact of an evidenced based health related quality of life (HRQoL) curriculum called Healthy Minds that ran in 34 high schools in England over a four-year period. We find robust evidence that Healthy Minds positively augments many physical health domains of treated adolescents. We also find some evidence that Healthy Minds positively affects behaviour, but has no impact on emotional wellbeing. We find notable gender effects, strongly favouring boys. We also present evidence that Healthy Minds changes career aspirations, with those exposed to treatment being less likely to choose competitive work and more likely to choose work that involves ""people-skills"". Overall our work illustrates the potential for later childhood interventions to promote HRQoL and develop the career aspirations of adolescents."
I18|Gender-Based Favoritism in Blood Donations: Evidence from a Field Experiment|This paper provides the first evidence of the existence of gender-based favoritism in life saving decisions to donate blood. We conduct a field experiment among blood donors from Bosnia and Herzegovina where we exogenously manipulate the signal of a blood recipient’s gender by adding his/her name, and photograph, to a letter soliciting blood donation. Motivated by the literature on identity, we test the influence on donation behavior of two dimensions of shared identity between donor and recipient – gender and age. 74% more blood donors donate if the potential blood recipient is of the same gender. This result is mostly driven by male donors donating to a male recipient. In contrast to gender identity being an important determinant in fostering donors’ participation rates, being of similar age to the blood recipient has relatively little effect. By identifying an important factor that influences willingness to give blood, our results have implications for better targeting of campaigns to increase blood donations.
I18|Birth in times of war - An investigation of health, mortality and social class using historical clinical records|While World War II (WWII) is often employed as natural experiment to identify long-term effects of adverse early-life and prenatal conditions, little is known about the short-term effects. We estimate the short-term impact of the onset of WWII on newborn health using a unique data set of historical birth records ranging from December 1937 to September 1941. Furthermore we investigate the heterogeneity of this effect with respect to health at birth and for different social groups. To evaluate potential channels for our results, we explore how birth procedures changed. While we do not find any effects on birth weight and asphyxia, perinatal mortality increases immediately after the onset of WWII. The mortality effect is driven by live births and strongest for very low birth weight infants. A decline in quality of medical care due to the sudden conscription of trained physicians to military service is the most likely mechanism for our findings.
I18|The Urban-Rural Gap in Health Care Infrastructure – Does Government Ideology Matter?|Spatial inequalities in publicly provided goods such as health care facilities have substantial socioeconomic effects. Little is known, however, as to why publicly provided goods diverge among urban and rural regions. We exploit narrow parliamentary majorities in German states between 1950 and 2014 in an RD framework to show that government ideology influences the urban-rural gap in public infrastructure. Leftwing governments relocate hospital beds from rural regions. We propose that leftwing governments do so to gratify their more urban constituencies. In turn, spatial inequalities in hospital infrastructure increase, which seems to influence general and infant mortality.
I18|Increased Instruction Time and Stress-Related Health Problems among School Children|While several studies suggest that stress-related mental health problems among school children are related to specific elements of schooling, empirical evidence on this causal relationship is scarce. We examine a German schooling reform that increased weekly instruction time and study its effects on stress-related outpatient diagnoses from the universe of health claims data of the German Social Health Insurance. Exploiting the differential timing in the reform implementation across states, we show that the reform slightly increased stress-related health problems among school children. While increasing instruction time might increase student performance, it might have adverse effects in terms of additional stress.
I18|Dynamic Hospital Competition Under Rationing by Waiting Times|We develop a dynamic model of hospital competition where (i) waiting times increase if demand exceeds supply; (ii) patients differ in their evaluation of health benefits and choose a hospital based on waiting times; and (iii) there are penalties for providers with long waits. We show that, if penalties are linear in waiting times, a more competitive dynamic environment does not affect waiting times. If penalties are instead non-linear, we find that waiting times are longer under the more competitive environment. The latter result is derived by calibrating the model with waiting times and elasticities observed in the English NHS for a common treatment (cataract surgery), which also shows that the difference between waiting times under the two solution concepts is quantitatively small. Policies that facilitate patient choice, an alternative measure of competition, also lead to higher steady-state waiting times, and tougher penalties exacerbate the negative effect of choice policies.
I18|Do Health Insurance Mandates Spillover to Education? Evidence from Michigan's Autism Insurance Mandate|Social programs and mandates are usually studied in isolation, but interaction effects could create spillovers to other public goods. We examine how health insurance coverage affects the education of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the context of state-mandated private therapy coverage. Since Medicaid benefits under the mandate were far weaker than under private insurance, we proxy for Medicaid ineligibility and estimate effects via triple-differences. While we find little change in ASD identification, the mandate crowds-out special education supports for students with ASD by shifting students to less restrictive environments and reducing the use of ASD specialized teacher consultants. A lack of short-run impact on achievement supports our interpretation of the service reductions as crowd-out and indicates that the shift does not academically harm students with ASD.

I18|Physician’s altruism in incentive contracts: Medicare’s quality race|The paper analyzes the impact of physicians' altruism and motivation on the outcomes of pay-for-performance schemes in healthcare, where a fixed price contract on quantity is supplemented with a relative performance contract on quality. Our theoretical model forecasts crowding out of most altruistic types. In an empirical application to the Medicare's nationwide natural experiment with a relative performance contract on quality for acute inpatient care since 2013, we observe the proof of this prediction. Namely, the quality dimensions, which are linked to patient's benefit, demonstrate higher deterioration among top-performing hospitals than other incentivized dimensions.
I18|Multi-criteria decision analysis for health technology assessment: addressing methodological challenges to improve the state of the art|Abstract Background Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) concepts, models and tools have been used increasingly in health technology assessment (HTA), with several studies pointing out practical and theoretical issues related to its use. This study provides a critical review of published studies on MCDA in the context of HTA by assessing their methodological quality and summarising methodological challenges. Methods A systematic review was conducted to identify studies discussing, developing or reviewing the use of MCDA in HTA using aggregation approaches. Studies were classified according to publication time and type, country of study, technology type and study type. The PROACTIVE-S approach was constructed and used to analyse methodological quality. Challenges and limitations reported in eligible studies were collected and summarised; this was followed by a critical discussion on research requirements to address the identified challenges. Results 129 journal articles were eligible for review, 56% of which were published in 2015–2017; 42% focused on pharmaceuticals; 36, 26 and 18% reported model applications, issues regarding MCDA implementation analyses, and proposing frameworks, respectively. Poor compliance with good methodological practice (

I18|Infant Health, Cognitive Performance and Earnings: Evidence from Inception of the Welfare State in Sweden|We estimate impacts of exposure to an infant health intervention trialled in Sweden in the early 1930s using purposively digitised birth registers linked to school catalogues, census files and tax records to generate longitudinal microdata that track individuals through five stages of the life-course, from birth to age 71. This allows us to measure impacts on childhood health and cognitive skills at ages 7 and 10, educational and occupational choice at age 16-20, employment, earnings and occupation at age 36-40, and pension income at age 71. Leveraging quasi-random variation in eligibility by birth date and birth parish, we estimate that an additional year of exposure was associated with improved reading and writing skills in primary school, and increased enrolment in university and apprenticeship in late adolescence. These changes are larger and more robust for men, but we find increases in secondary school completion which are unique to women. In the longer run, we find very substantial increases in employment (especially in the public sector) and income among women, alongside absolutely no impacts among men. We suggest that this may be, at least in part, because these cohorts were exposed to a massive expansion of the Swedish welfare state, which created more jobs for women than for men.
I18|Digital Waste? Unintended Consequences of Health Information Technology|We exploit a large-scale natural experiment – the rollout of a nationwide electronic prescribing system in Finland – to study how digitization of prescriptions affects pharmaceutical use and health outcomes. We use comprehensive administrative data from patients treated with benzodiazepines, which are globally popular, effective but addictive psychotropic medications. We find no impact on benzodiazepine use on average, but among younger patients e-prescribing increases repeat prescription use. Younger patients' health outcomes do not improve but adverse outcomes, such as prescription drug abuse disorders and suicide attempts, increase dramatically. Improving access to medication through easier ordering may thus increase medication overuse.
I18|Indian Residential Schools, Height, and Body Mass Post-1930|We study the effects of Canadian Indian residential schooling on two anthropometric measures of health during childhood: adult height and body weight. We use repeated cross sectional data from the 1991 and 2001 Aboriginal Peoples Survey and leverage detailed historical data on school closures and location to make causal inferences. We ﬁnd evidence that, on average, residential schooling increases adult height and the likelihood of a healthy adult body weight for those who attended. These effects are concentrated after the 1950s when the schools were subject to tighter health regulations and students were selected to attend residential school based partly on their need for medical care that was otherwise unavailable. Residential schooling is only one policy in Canada that impacted status First Nations peoples’ health, so our results must be understood in the broader social context. Taken in context, our results suggest that health interventions in later childhood can have signiﬁcant impacts on adult health. We also document signiﬁcant increases in height and body weight for status people born after the 1960s, suggesting substantial changes in diet and living conditions during this time period.
I18|Competition and Health-Care Spending: Theory and Application to Certificate of Need Laws|Hospitals and other health-care providers in 34 states must obtain a Certificate of Need (CON) from a state board before opening or expanding, leading to reduced competition. We develop a theoretical model of how market concentration affects health-care spending. Our theoretical model shows that increases in concentration, such as those brought about by CON, can either increase or decrease spending. Our model predicts that CON is more likely to increase spending in markets in which costs are low and patients are sicker. We test our model using spending data from the Household Component of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).
I18|Geography of public service delivery in rural Ethiopia|Remote areas are often characterized by lower welfare outcomes due to economic disadvantages and higher transaction costs for trade. But their worse situation may also be linked to worse public service delivery. Relying on large household surveys in rural Ethiopia, we explore this by assessing the association of two measures of remoteness – (1) the distance of villages and primary service centers to district capitals and (2) the distance of households to service centers (the last mile) – with public service delivery in agriculture and health sectors. In the agriculture sector, we document statistically significant and economically meaningful associations between exposure to agriculture extension and the two measures of remoteness. For health extension, only the last mile matters. These differences between the two sectors could be due to the fact that more remote villages tend to have fewer agriculture extension workers who also put in fewer hours than their peers in more connected areas. This does not apply in the health sector. These findings provide valuable inputs for policymakers aiming to improve inclusiveness in poor rural areas.

I18|How Do Travellers Respond to Health and Environmental Policies to Reduce Air Pollution?|Despite the various measures taken to reduce air pollution in France, the French continue to use high-emission vehicles. We propose to evaluate the Willingness To Pay (WTP) for four means of transport: two high-emission vehicles (diesel taxi and diesel personal vehicle) and two low-emission vehicles (rented electric vehicle and public transport). Successive messages revealing the effects of air pollution on health and the environment are provided to individuals in a different order. The information conveyed changes both of the WTP of individuals and of their choices. However, the use of high-emission vehicles has not diminished, personal vehicles remain the most popular. Using data collected from our survey, a multinomial logit model is used to determine individual choices. We find that improving individuals' confidence in air pollution recommendations would be a good way to lead them to choose low-emission rather than high-emission means of transport. Moreover, these estimates also indicate that individuals who attach great importance to comfort are less likely to choose low-emission vehicles than those who value price above other factors. Individual interest can therefore prevail over collective interest, thus verifying the theory of the tragedy of the commons. Different policies (taxes, subsidies, or standard) to encourage people to adopt low-emission vehicles are then tested.
I18|Effects of Market Structure and Patient Choice on Hospital Quality for Planned Patients|We investigate the change in the effect of market structure on planned hospital quality for three high-volume treatments, using a quasi difference-in-differences approach based on the relaxation of patient constraints on hospital choice in England. We employ control functions to allow for time-varying endogeneity from unobserved patient characteristics. We find that the choice reforms reduced quality for hip and knee replacement but not for coronary bypass, This is likely due to hospitals making a larger loss on hip and knee replacements, since robustness checks rule out changes in length of stay, new competitors’ entry and hospital-level mortality as possible confounders.
I18|The effect of government contracting with faith-based health care providers in Malawi|We study the impact of contracting-out of maternal health care by the government of Malawi to providers from the Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM) in the form of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Under a SLA, a CHAM facility provides agreed maternal and newborn services free-of-charge to patients, and is reimbursed on a fixed price per service. We merge data on health facilities in Malawi with pregnancy histories from the 2010 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey, and exploit the staggered implementation of SLAs across facilities. Using difference-in-differences, we estimate the differential effects on pregnancy- related health care utilisation to mothers residing near and far from facilities with a SLA over time. Our findings show that SLAs reduced home births and increased skilled deliveries at CHAM hospitals. We observe greater provision of prenatal care services at CHAM health centres but no overall increase in the number of prenatal care visits. We find evidence of a reduction in certain components of prenatal care.
I18|The causal effect of hospital volume on health gains from hip replacement surgery|This study investigates the causal effect of hospital volume on health gains from hip replacement surgery in the English National Health Service. We exploit a unique dataset, which links routine hospital records and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for all public hospitals in England. PROMs assess patientsâ€™ health along key dimensions of pain and mobility shortly before and six months after the surgery. We investigate whether higher hospital volume increases patient health six months post-surgery, conditioning on pre-surgery health and other patient medical and socioeconomic indicators. We address possible reverse-causality bias due to hospital demand being responsive to quality by constructing a measure of predicted hospital volumes based on a patient choice model. The results suggest that the observed volume-outcome effect in hip replacement surgery is clinically small and no longer statistically significant once we account for the endogeneity of volume.
I18|Centros de Atención Móvil a Drogodependientes (CAMAD)|Los consumidores problemáticos de sustancias psicoactivas enfrentan riesgos de salud excepcionalmente altos. Sin embargo, por razones diversas, estos individuos no acuden a servicios de salud con la frecuencia que se requiere dadas sus condiciones de salud. La estrategia CAMAD fue un programa de reducción de daños cuyo objetivo central fue la prestación de servicios de salud a la población de habitantes de calle. Con base en la información disponible, en este documento presentamos una descripción del programa y de algunos de sus resultados. Entre los hallazgos de la investigación se destacan los siguientes: (i) El programa llegó a cerca de 53 mil personas entre septiembre de 2012 y mayo de 2016. (ii) El 70% de los usuarios no tenía seguro de salud y el 26,5% estaba en el régimen subsidiado. (iii) El 22% de los usuarios se identificó como habitante de calle. (iv) Entre quienes reportaron su ocupación, 54,8% era estudiante y 40% estudiantes de bachillerato. (v) En la población no estudiante, las mujeres representan el 26,5% de los usuarios, en el caso de los estudiantes, esta proporción fue 44%.
I18|Does Obamacare Care? A Fuzzy Difference-in-discontinuities Approach|This paper explores the use of fuzzy regression-discontinuity design in the context where multiple treatments are applied at the threshold. The identification result shows that, under a very strong assumption of equality of treatment probability changes at the cutoff point, a difference in fuzzy discontinuity identify a treatment effect of interest. Using the data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), we apply this identification strategy to evaluate the causal effect of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on health care access and utilization of old Americans. We find results suggesting that the implementation of the Affordable Care Act has led to an increase in the hospitalization rate of elderly American--5% more hospitalization. It has caused a minor increase of cost-related direct barrier to access to care--3.6% increase in the probability of delaying care for cost reasons. The ACA has also exacerbated cost-related barriers to follow-up and continuity care -- 7% more elderly couldn't afford prescriptions, 7% more couldn't see a specialist and, 5.5% more couldn't afford a follow-up visit -- as result of ACA
I18|Does Universalization of Healthwork? Evidence from Health Systems Restructuring and Expansion in Brazil|We investigate universalization of access to health in Brazil. We find large reductions in maternal, foetal, neonatal and post-neonatal mortality, a reduction in fertility and, possibly on account of selection, no change in the quality of births. Using rich administrative data, we investigate changes in organization, access and outcomes, thereby illuminating the driving mechanisms. We find sharp increases in coverage of primary health facilities with GPs and outreach workers and, in line with this, increases in outpatient procedures, prenatal care visits, health-education activities and home visits by medical professionals. Consistent with an attempt to rationalize use of hospital resources, we find a decline in specialists and hospital beds per capita. Despite this, we see increases in hospital births, C-sections, and maternal hospitalization for complications, with no change in rates of infant hospitalization.
I18|Glyphosate Use in Agriculture and Birth Outcomes of Surrounding Populations|This paper assesses the impact of glyphosate use in agriculture on birth outcomes of human populations in surrounding areas. Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the world. Still, despite ongoing controversy, little is known about its effects on human populations at large. Our empirical strategy relies on the fact that glyphosate is strongly complementary to the use of genetically modified seeds in soybean production. We use an instrument based on the gains in productivity from adoption of genetically modified soybeans and look at externalities across municipalities sharing the same water resources. We detect negative and statistically significant effects of glyphosate use on birth outcomes. Our results indicate externality effects of glyphosate use on populations distant from the original locations of use, but receiving water from these locations.
I18|More Hospital Choices, More C-Sections: Evidence from Chile|In this paper, we study the effect on cesarean rates of a policy change in Chile that decreased the cost of delivery at private hospitals for women with public health insurance. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach based on the eligibility conditions for this benefit, we find that in the first three years after the policy took effect, deliveries in private hospitals increased by 8.7 percentage points, while the probability of a C-section being performed increased by 4.6 percentage points, with negative impacts on average newborn weight and size at birth. We show that the probability of an early term birth in hospitals participating in the program is an increasing function of expected hospital demand at the time of the full-term due date. This suggests that in the absence of price incentives, hospitals use C-sections to smooth out demand over time to optimize the use of their resources.
I18|Does Access to Health Care Mitigate Environmental Damages?|Differential access to health care is commonly cited as a source of heterogeneity in environmental health damages, yet little causal evidence exists to support such claims. We address this deficit in two settings by testing whether the negative impacts of ambient temperature exposure on mortality were mitigated by (1) access to primary care through the Community Health Center program, and (2) access to hospital care through the desegregation of Southern hospitals. The results demonstrate that increased access to health care can drive heterogeneity in environmental damages when the mode of care is sufficiently relevant to the damages suffered.
I18|Information shocks and provider responsiveness: evidence from interventional cardiology|"We examine physician responses to global information shocks and the impact on patient outcomes. We exploit an international ""firestorm"" over the safety of an innovation in healthcare, drug-eluting stents. We use rich micro-data on interventional cardiologists' use of stents to de- fine and measure responsiveness to news shocks. We find substantial heterogeneity in responsiveness to both good and bad news and an association between speed of response to news and patient outcomes. Patients treated by cardiologists who respond slowly to news shocks have fewer adverse outcomes. These results cannot be attributed to financial incentives, patient-physician sorting or heterogeneity in skill."
I18|Blood donations and incentives : evidence from a field experiment|There is a longstanding concern that material incentives might undermine prosocial motivation, leading to a decrease in blood donations rather than an increase. This paper provides an empirical test of how material incentives affect blood donations in a large-scale field experiment spanning three months and involving more than 10,000 previous donors. We examine two types of incentive: a lottery ticket and a free cholesterol test. Lottery tickets significantly increase donations, in particular among less motivated donors. The cholesterol test leads to no discernable impact on usable blood donations. If anything, it creates a small negative selection effect in terms of donations that must be discarded.
I18|The Economic Consequences of Hospitalizations for Older Workers across Countries|This paper estimates the effect of hospital admissions among older workers on economic outcomes across countries. We use harmonized longitudinal survey data from the United States, China, and 13 countries in Europe, and follow the event study design of Dobkin, Finkelstein, Kluender and Notowidigdo (2018) to estimate dynamic effects of a hospitalization on out-of-pocket health expenditures, labor market outcomes, social insurance payments, and household income. We find distinctly different patterns across countries. In contrast to the United States, where hospitalizations lead to large health expenditures and decreases in earnings, individuals in Northern and Southern Europe are largely protected from negative economic outcomes. Hospitalizations in China lead to even larger out-of-pocket expenditures as a percent of prior income, but do not negatively affect labor market outcomes. Our results largely align with the differences in generosity across countries in social protection institutions that include health systems, social security programs and labor market regulations.
I18|When Dad Can Stay Home: Fathers' Workplace Flexibility and Maternal Health|While workplace flexibility is perceived to be a key determinant of maternal labor supply, less is known about fathers' demand for flexibility or about intra-household spillover effects of flexibility initiatives. This paper examines these issues in the context of a critical period in family life-the months immediately following childbirth-and identifies the impacts of paternal access to workplace flexibility on maternal postpartum health. We model household demand for paternal presence at home as a function of domestic stochastic shocks, and use variation from a Swedish reform that granted new fathers more flexibility to take intermittent parental leave during the postpartum period in a regression discontinuity difference-in-differences (RD-DD) design. We find that increasing the father's temporal flexibility reduces the risk of the mother experiencing physical postpartum health complications and improves her mental health. Our results suggest that mothers bear the burden from a lack of workplace flexibility-not only directly through greater career costs of family formation, as previously documented-but also indirectly, as fathers' inability to respond to domestic shocks exacerbates the maternal health costs of childbearing.
I18|The Impact of Abortion on Crime and Crime-Related Behavior|The 1966 abolition and 1989 legalization of abortion in Romania immediately doubled and decreased by about a third the number of births per month, respectively. To isolate the link between abortion access and crime while abstracting from cohort and general equilibrium effects, we compare birth month cohorts on either side of the abortion regime. For both the abolition and legalization of abortion, we find large and significant effects on the level of crime and risky-behavior related hospitalization, but an insignificant effect on crime and hospitalization rates (i.e. when normalizing by the size of the birth month cohort). In other words, the Romanian abortion reforms did affect crime, but all of the effect appears to be driven by cohort size effects rather than selection or unwantedness effects.
I18|Defeating Crime? An Economic Analysis of Cannabis Legalization Policies|Can legalization of cannabis eliminate related organized crime? We model consumer choices for cannabis in a risky environment and determine the provision of cannabis, under prohibition and legalization. Although a legalization policy may crumble the profits from illegal providers driving them out of business, it also increases cannabis use. In contrast, repression decreases cannabis consumption but strengthens the cartelization of criminal networks. Combining legalization with repression can strangle the black market while controlling the demand for cannabis. Based on evidence from the US, policy simulations are used to compute the price of legal cannabis that would achieve this dual objective and highlight the complementarities between repression and legalization. For example, with a 1% probability of arrest and a USD 2000 fine for illegal purchase, a legal price around USD 439 per ounce would evict illegal suppliers and increase the consumption by less that 25%. If the probability of arrest reaches 2%, the eviction price can go up to USD 622 and overall consumption increases by no more than 5:5%.
I18|Who Goes on Disability When Times Are Tough? The Role of Social Costs of Take-Up Among Immigrants|Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) take-up tends to increase during recessions. We exploit variation across immigrant groups in the non-pecuniary costs of participating in SSDI to examine the role that costs play in applicant decisions across the business cycle. We show that immigrants from country-of-origin groups that have lower participation costs are more sensitive to economic conditions than immigrants from high cost groups. These results do not seem to be driven by variation across groups in sensitivity to business cycles or eligibility for SSDI. Instead, they appear to be primarily driven by differences in work norms across origin countries.
I18|Networks of relations in Migori County (Kenya). Some findings on health and nutrition topics|Are Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques useful to identify and map relations among key actors in development areas? In particular, is this technique able to disentangle the complexity of formal and informal actors involved in health and nutrition issues? Using this methodology we map relations among formal and informal actors living in Kenya, in Migori County. The analysis aims at detecting how different actors (i.e. institutions, community health workers and income generating activities groups) interact in order to share knowledge and information on health and nutrition projects. In this way we identify the main characteristics of the relations and understand how to enforce strengths and to reduce weaknesses, in order to enforce the projects implemented.
I18|Vaccination take-up and health: evidence from a flu vaccination program for the elderly|We analyze the effects of a vaccination program providing free flu vaccine to individuals aged 65 or more on take-up and hospitalization. By using linked patient-general practitioner (GP) data, we implement a regression discontinuity design around the threshold at age 65. We find that the program increases vaccination take-up by 6 percentage points, which corresponds to 75% of the take-up for non-eligible individuals, and reduces the probability of hospitalization by about 44%. We show that the effect on take-up is not entirely due to an income channel, and that the effect on health is mainly driven by patients with higher-quality GPs and emergency hospitalizations.
I18|Does fiscal decentralization affect regional disparities in health? Quasi-experimental evidence from Italy|Recent theories on fiscal decentralization support the view that sub-national governments who finance a larger share of their spending with taxes raised locally by themselves are more accountable towards their citizens. Whilst evidence on improvements in spending efficiency is relatively common, little is known about the effects on inequalities amongst the population. In this paper we exploit a reform aimed at increasing regional tax autonomy in Italy to provide quasi-experimental evidence on the impact of fiscal decentralization on health disparities between- and within-regions. Our findings, robust to a number of robustness checks, support the view that fiscal decentralization does not impact on between-regional inequalities but can help to reduce inequalities within regions. However, this last effect depends on the degree of economic development: richer regions are better than poorer ones in containing inequalities.
I18|Estimated Costs of Injuries in College and High School Female Sports|Injury rates in thirteen U.S. women’s college sports and four U.S. girls’ high school sports are examined in this paper. The sports are categorized as high injury (H) or low injury (L) and differences in injury rates between the two are examined. Estimates are presented of the injury savings that would result if the H sports were changed to have injury rates similar to those in the L sports. The estimated college savings are 13,610 fewer injuries per year and 2,020 fewer healthy years lost-to-injury per year. The estimated high school savings are 143,900 fewer injuries per year and 24,300 fewer healthy years lost-to-injury per year. For concussions the savings are 2,750 per year for college and 49,390 per year for high school. The estimated dollar value (in 2015 dollars) of the total injury savings is between $122 million and $505 million per year for college and between $1.3 billion and $4.9 billion per year for high school.
I18|Long-run consequences of informal elderly care and implications of public long-term care insurance|In this paper, I estimate a dynamic structural model of labor supply, retirement, and informal care supply, incorporating labor market frictions and the German tax and benefit system. I find that informal elderly care has adverse and persistent effects on labor market outcomes and therefore negatively affects lifetime earnings, future pension benefits, and individuals' well-being. These consequences of caregiving are heterogeneous and depend on age, previous earnings, and institutional regulations. Policy simulations suggest that, even though fiscally costly, public long-term care insurance can offset the personal costs of caregiving to a large extent - in particular for low-income individuals.
I18|French GPs’ willingness to delegate tasks: may financial incentives balance risk aversion?|Delegating tasks to paramedics is a fairly recent development in France. So far it has essentially been developed in hospitals and is incipient in general practice. This paper focuses on the willingness of general practitioner to do so. A 2012 survey of 2,000 GPs might help anticipate GPs' willingness to delegate. This paper tests whether a more favourable funding system might help increase GP willingness. We implement a quasi-experimental design wherein GPs are randomly selected to form three groups of equal size, each of them being exposed to a different funding scheme when declaring their willingness to delegate tasks to nurses: Fully Funded (FF) by the social security administration, self-funded by GPs' revenues (Self-Funded, SF) and half-funded by both the social security administration and GPs (Half-Funded, HF). GPs' likelihood to favour task delegation is estimated with a probit model that especially considers a GP's attitude towards risk (aversion or tolerance) among a set of covariates, such as age, gender, rural/urban area, GP density and funding scheme. This article shows that, first, GPs are more likely to favour delegation, when they share a lower proportion of the cost. Second, the effect of risk aversion on the likelihood of favouring delegation is not altered by the funding scheme.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
I18|Healthcare Spending Inequality: Evidence from Hungarian Administrative Data|Using administrative data on incomes and healthcare spending, we develop new evidence on the distribution of healthcare spending in Hungary. We document substantial geographic heterogeneity and a positive association between income and public healthcare spending.
I18|When Dad Can Stay Home: Fathers’ Workplace Flexibility and Maternal Health|While workplace ﬂexibility is perceived to be a key determinant of maternal labor supply, less is known about fathers’demand for ﬂexibility or about intra-household spillover eﬀects of ﬂexibility initiatives. This paper examines these issues in the context of a critical period in family life—the months immediately following childbirth—and identiﬁes the impacts of paternal access to workplace ﬂexibility on maternal postpartum health. We model household demand for paternal presence at home as a function of domestic stochastic shocks, and use variation from a Swedish reform that granted new fathers more ﬂexibility to take intermittent parental leave during the postpartum period in a regression discontinuity diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences (RD-DD) design. We ﬁnd that increasing the father’s temporal ﬂexibility reduces the risk of the mother experiencing physical postpartum health complications and improves her mental health. Our results suggest that mothers bear the burden from a lack of workplace ﬂexibility—not only directly through greater career costs of family formation, as previously documented—but also indirectly, as fathers’ inability to respond to domestic shocks exacerbates the maternal health costs of childbearing.
I18|Performance management and audit & feedback to support learning and innovation – Theoretical review and implications for Swedish primary care|Health care professionals frequently describe performance management and monitoring of efficiency and quality measures for external accountability as an administrative burden with limited benefits. Professionals argue that they are subject to too tight control that signals distrust, limits professional autonomy and ultimately decreases their motivation to perform. At worst, poorly incentivized indicators influence the behavior of providers in directions that undermine patient benefits. Against this background, policy interest has recently turned towards new governance and managerial approaches in Swedish health care services, allowing for a higher degree of professional autonomy, participatory processes and use of non-financial incentives. This change will undoubtedly have implications for performance management. Inspired by current changes in Swedish primary care, this article explores the design of audit & feedback elements through a review of the empirical evidence and theories about motivation and incentives. Audit & feedback interventions have so far taken a “diffusion of innovation” perspective focusing on implementation of evidence and targets into practice. More complex changes in the delivery of services is likely to require experience-based DUI (Doing, Using, Interacting) modes of innovation, which in turn calls for a more formative and enabling approach to performance management and audit & feedback. A key question is how an appeal to social determinants of professional identity and reputation mechanisms can motivate professionals to change their behavior. Practical implications and research opportunities that follow from the theoretical propositions are discussed using Swedish primary care as an illustrative case.
I18|It’s a long walk: Lasting effects of maternity ward openings on labour market performance|Studies showing that large-scale public health interventions in early life have lasting economic consequences are still scarce and rarely disclose the mechanisms. Being born in a hospital versus having a traditional birth attendant at home represents the most common early life policy change worldwide. Knowing the consequences of this policy is also important given the ongoing enlargement of maternity hospitals. In 1931–1946, the Swedish state subsidized the opening of new maternity wards, which led to the gradual decline of home deliveries assisted by midwives. Maternity wards offered improved conditions for mothers and newborns, including hygiene, surgical proficiency and medications, and health monitoring. By applying a difference-in-differences approach and geocoding techniques to register-based individuallevel data on the total population, observed from birth until the age of 65, this paper explores the long-term economic effects of access to better health services at birth using the opening of maternity wards throughout the country as an early life quasi-experiment. The paper first finds that the reform substantially reduced neonatal mortality in the short term by 19.0–26.5 deaths per 1000. Capturing survivors of the affected cohorts at the ages of 47–64, it then shows sizable long-term effects of the introduction of maternity wards on labour income (2.4–4.7 per cent) and disability pensions (4.4–11.9 per cent). The effects run directly through better health and indirectly through higher levels of schooling. Small-scale local maternity wards yield a larger social rate of return than large-scale hospitals, stemming from the treatment of normal births.
I18|Employment Effects of Healthcare Policy: Evidence from the 2007 FDA Black Box Warning on Antidepressants|Public policies aimed at improving health may have indirect effects on outcomes such as education and employment. We study the labor market effects of a 2007 regulatory action by the US Food and Drug Administration, in which they expanded the black box warning on antidepressants. Using nationally representative data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health and a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that employment among women aged 35-49 with a history of depression decreased by 6.1 percent (4.4 percentage points) in response to the warning. We explore potential mechanisms generating these employment effects and find that both antidepressant and psychotherapy use among women aged 35-49 decreased after the warning. Our estimates suggest these same women did not substitute towards non-medical alternatives such as marijuana or alcohol. We find no employment or mental health treatment response among men or among women younger than 35. Overall, our analysis suggests that the 2007 expanded black box warning reduced US labor force participation by 0.23 percentage points and led to roughly $13 billion in lost wages.
I18|Is Prevention of Suicide Worth Less? -A Comparison of the Value per Statistical Life|This paper compares the value per statistical life (VSL) in the context of suicide prevention to that of prevention of traffic fatalities. We conducted a contingent valuation survey with questions on willingness to pay (WTP) in both contexts by administering a web questionnaire to 1038 individuals aged 18 to 80. We conjectured that WTP for a given impact on the number of fatalities would be lower for suicide prevention because suicide, at least to some degree, is the result of individuals’ own decisions. However, this hypothesis was not supported by the within- or between-sample estimates of VSL or by responses to direct questions. Hence, no support is provided for the use of a lower valuation of the impact of suicide prevention than for risk-reducing programs in other fields, such as traffic safety.
I18|Unemployed or Disabled? Disability Screening and Labor Market Outcomes of Youths|This paper examines the effect of being granted temporary disability insurance (TDI), as opposed to a non-health related benefit, on later labor market outcomes of youths who are seeking temporary income support from the state. In Norway, there has been a development over time towards a more lenient screening to TDI, and this development has been more pronounced in some municipalities than in others. Using local screening leniency as an instrument for TDI receipt, I find that being granted TDI benefits significantly reduces later labor market attachment of youths whose benefit receipt would differ according to their municipality of residence, and the year of entry to the benefit system.
I18|Free for Children? Patient Cost-sharing and Healthcare Utilization|"We examine how children's healthcare utilization responds to prices by exploiting over 10,000 variations in the levels and forms of patient cost-sharing across Japanese municipalities over time. Free care significantly increases outpatient spending, with price elasticities considerably smaller for children than adults. Small copayments alongside free care reduce utilization of healthier—rather than sicker—children, suggesting that moral hazard can be reduced without increasing financial and health risks. We find that cost-sharing is a ""blunt tool,"" affecting utilization regardless of service type. Increased outpatient spending from free care neither improves short- and medium-term health outcomes nor reduces future healthcare spending"
I18|Paid Family Leave and Breastfeeding: Evidence from California|This paper evaluates the effect of Paid Family Leave (PFL) on breastfeeding, which we identify using California’s enactment of a 2004 PFL policy that ensured mothers up to six weeks of leave at a 55 percent wage replacement rate. We employ synthetic control models for a large, representative sample of over 270,000 children born between 2000 and 2012 drawn from the restricted-use versions of the 2003 – 2014 National Immunization Surveys. Our estimates indicate that PFL increases the overall duration of breastfeeding by nearly 18 days, and the likelihood of breastfeeding for at least six months by 5 percentage points. We find substantially larger effects of PFL on breastfeeding duration for some disadvantaged mothers.
I18|In-Kind Incentives and Health Worker Performance: Experimental Evidence from El Salvador|Maintaining high standards of care from doctors, nurses and other health professionals is of critical importance for an effective and efficient health system. Yet deficient levels of health worker performance, including low effort, absenteeism, and lack of compliance with clinical guidelines, have been documented across numerous countries and contexts. In response, various pay-for-performance interventions that reward providers based on measures of quality of care and health outcomes have been tested, with mixed results. This study experimentally evaluates the effects of team in-kind incentives on health worker performance in El Salvador. Thirty-eight out of 75 community health teams were randomly assigned to receive in-kind incentives linked to performance over a 12-month period. All 75 teams received monitoring, performance feedback and recognition for their achievements, allowing us to isolate the impacts of the incentive. While both treatment and control groups exhibit improvements in performance measures over time, the in-kind incentives generated significant improvements in community outreach, quality of care, timeliness of care, and utilization of services after 12 months. Contrary to conventional knowledge, gains are largest for health teams at the bottom and top of the baseline performance distribution. These results suggest that even small in-kind incentives can be a powerful tool to improve health worker performance and may be a viable alternative to monetary incentives in certain contexts.
I18|Tobacco smuggling in the Western Balkan region: Exploring habits, attitudes, and predictors of illegal tobacco demand|In this paper, the relationship between unemployment and crime is analysed. A panel of 20 Croatian counties over the years 1998-2013 is used to estimate the effect of unemployment on the rates of various groups of property and violent crimes. According to the theory of economics of crime, increase in unemployment leads to higher crime rates. A fixed-effects model, including time- and county-specific effects and several covariates, is estimated. The results show there is no impact of unemployment on aggregate property crimes. For all violent crimes bar rapes, the results oppose the theory and intuition. The unexpected results are discussed in the context of the Croatian-specific macro-environment.
I18|Accessibilité aux soins et attractivité territoriale : proposition d’une typologie des territoires de vie français|Cet article présente la méthodologie et les résultats d’une typologie socio-sanitaire des espaces français à l’échelle des territoires de vie. Cette typologie ambitionne d’offrir un cadre d’étude à l’analyse des soins de premiers recours en France et à l’évaluation d’un certain nombre de dispositifs pour améliorer la répartition de l’offre de soins. A partir de la littérature, nous identifions les dimensions et indicateurs pertinents pour répondre à ces enjeux. Nous réalisons ensuite une Analyse en composante principale (ACP) des 32 variables retenues puis une Classification ascendante hiérarchique (CAH). Nous obtenons de la sorte six groupes de territoires de vie dont la répartition spatiale est parfois fortement contiguë (littoraux, « diagonale du vide », départements homogènes), plus hétérogène avec des départements ayant tous les types de territoires de vie ou encore une répartition illustrant des oppositions entre centres et périphéries.
I18|L'accessibilité aux médecins généralistes en Île-de-France : méthodologie de mesures des inégalités infra-communales|L’un des enjeux majeurs des politiques de santé des pays développés consiste à garantir à la population une égale accessibilité aux soins sur leur territoire. La France, comme de nombreux pays de l’Organisation de coopération et de développement économiques (OCDE), est confrontée à des problèmes de raréfaction et de répartition inégale de la ressource humaine en santé. Les pouvoirs publics français tentent d’inciter les professionnels de santé à exercer dans des zones qualifiées comme?insuffisamment dotées en offre de soin. L’identification de ces zones devient un enjeu majeur et une gageure car, comme le soulignent Handy et Niemeier (1997), «?le plus grand obstacle à l’utilisation du concept d’accessibilité réside dans la difficulté de le traduire sous forme d’indicateurs opérationnels?». Pour mesurer la dimension spatiale de l’accessibilité, la méthode du «?Two-step floating catchment area?» (2SFCA) fait l’objet d’une convergence d’intérêt dans la littérature géographique internationale et s’est imposée dans le paysage institutionnel français puisque son adaptation (Accessibilité potentielle localisée (APL)) au contexte français sert de socle à la définition des zonages déficitaires en médecins généralistes institués en 2017-2018 dans l’ensemble des régions françaises. Nous faisons ici évoluer l’indicateur en réduisant l’échelle géographique d’observation, en prenant en compte de la dimension sociale des besoins, en intégrant au modèle les pratiques multimodales de déplacements et en considérant l’effet systémique des interactions entre l’offre et la demande à l’échelle régionale. Les résultats sont présentés sous forme de scénarios pour analyser les impacts de chacune des hypothèses retenues. Il en ressort que le changement de l’échelle d’observation tend à diminuer globalement les niveaux médians d’accessibilité tout en mettant en évidence des disparités infra-communales notables. D’autre part, les hypothèses de quantification de l’offre et de besoins de soins, de même que les pratiques de mobilité, impactent très sensiblement les résultats et ce, de manière différenciée selon les départements et selon les territoires. L’innovation méthodologique consistant à tenir compte du fonctionnement régional systémique (la probabilité de recours aux médecins dépend à la fois de sa proximité et de sa disponibilité, cette dernière étant dépendante – par effet de chaîne – du nombre de patients qui potentiellement pourraient y avoir recours, etc.) est celle qui modifie le plus les résultats. La mise au point de ce type d’indicateur révèle l’importance de mobiliser - dans un mouvement d’aller et retour – aussi bien des phases de calcul statistique et de représentation géographique des résultats à différentes échelles que des phases d’échanges, avec les partenaires institutionnels et/ou locaux (Agences régionales de santé (ARS), élus locaux, professionnels de santé, usagers). Cela afin d’affiner et de valider les hypothèses retenues en les confrontant aux ressentis des usagers du territoire, mais aussi, éventuellement, de prendre en compte les spécificités de certains territoires.
I18|Améliorer la prise en charge sanitaire et sociale des personnes âgées : impact des plans personnalisés de santé sur les parcours de soins|Assurer une prise en charge sanitaire et sociale adaptée aux besoins des personnes âgées est un enjeu majeur des politiques publiques. Dans le cadre des expérimentations Parcours santé des aînés (Paerpa), lancées en 2014 pour améliorer la prise en charge des personnes âgées en « risque de perte d’autonomie », un outil de coordination, le Plan personnalisé de santé (PPS), a été proposé. Le PPS est un outil innovant qui a pour objectif d’améliorer la coordination et la continuité des prises en charge sanitaires et sociales, et ainsi de prévenir la perte d’autonomie, d'éviter le recours inapproprié à l’hospitalisation et la polymédication. Notre étude vise à évaluer l’impact de la réalisation d’un PPS sur les parcours de soins en observant l’évolution de la consommation de soins et de la qualité de prise en charge des personnes âgées qui en bénéficient. L’évaluation est réalisée à partir des données de consommation inter-régime de l’Assurance maladie appariées aux bases de données hospitalières de 2014 à 2017. Nous développons une analyse en doubles différences après appariement afin de mesurer la différence d’évolution entre les traités et les témoins, avant et après la réalisation du PPS. Afin de s’affranchir du biais de sélection pouvant persister à cause du manque de données sociales et d’état de santé dans les bases de données dont nous disposons, nous introduisons dans l’analyse un instrument qui exploite les différences de diffusion du PPS auprès des médecins généralistes entre les communes des territoires Paerpa. Nos résultats montrent que les personnes âgées qui ont bénéficié du PPS ont des besoins complexes, nécessitant une prise en charge sanitaire et médico-sociale. On observe un impact direct du PPS sur les dépenses d’infirmières à domicile qui augmentent significativement dans la première année suivant le PPS, sans se traduire par une augmentation des dépenses globales en ville, puisqu'il s'accompagne d'une réduction des dépenses de soins de généralistes et de médicaments. En revanche, on ne constate aucun effet significatif du PPS sur les hospitalisations évitables, la polymédication et le recours aux urgences. Au regard de nos résultats et des remontées des informations des territoires pilotes, le PPS semble être un outil mobilisé par les professionnels de santé de premier recours pour enclencher une prise en charge médico-sociale et sociale au domicile de la personne. Mais pour assurer la qualité et la continuité de la prise en charge globale, il serait important de créer des passerelles plus formalisées avec les médecins spécialistes et les acteurs hospitaliers.
I18|To Pill or not to Pill? Access to Emergency Contraception and Contraceptive Behaviour|We examine the effects of free-of-charge availability of emergency contraception on contraceptive behaviour in Chile. Using a survey of individuals 15 to 29, we exploit variation in availability at the municipality level as a consequence of legal and judicial decisions in the late 2000s. We find an increase in the use of emergency contraception in municipalities in which it was available through the public health system, but also an increase in the use of other methods of hormonal, pre-coital contraception, and a decrease of more traditional contraceptive methods. This effect is concentrated among groups with a low starting use of contraceptives, who may benefit from the contact with the health services. Unlike previous results for developed countries, our results indicate that there is scope for an effect of emergency contraception in settings with low starting levels of contraceptive use, and a significant potential for policies to increase adoption of regular contraception.
I18|Public Health Efforts and the Decline in Urban Mortality: Reply to Cutler and Miller|"This is a rejoinder to a comment written by Cutler and Miller on our recent paper, ""Public Health Efforts and the Decline in Urban Mortality"" (IZA DP No. 11773), which reanalyzes data used by Cutler and Miller to investigate the determinants of the urban mortality decline from 1900 to 1936. Two main results emerge from our reanalysis of their data: (1) correcting infant mortality counts reduces the estimated effect of filtration on infant mortality by two-thirds, from -43 log points to -13 log points; and (2) using a consistent method of the calculating the total mortality rate shrinks the estimated effect of filtration on total mortality by half, from -16 log points to -8 log points. In this rejoinder, we argue that the much-reduced estimate of the effect of water filtration on infant mortality is a dramatic and surprising departure from the consensus view in the literature. In addition, we show that the estimated effect of water filtration on total mortality is extremely fragile. Evidence of this fragility may also be found in recent work by Catillon, Cutler and Getzen (2018)."
I18|Who Goes on Disability when Times are Tough? The Role of Social Costs of Take-Up among Immigrants|Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) take-up tends to increase during recessions despite the fact that the program is intended to insure against the possibility of a work-preventing disability, not job loss. We examine the role that social costsâ€”such as taboos against receiving government benefits or the difficulty of obtaining information about the program within oneâ€™s social circleâ€”play in the decision to apply for SSDI in response to changes in economic conditions. We show that immigrants from country-of-origin groups that have lower social costs to participation, as measured by past SSDI participation rates for their origin group, are more sensitive to economic downturns than immigrants from high cost groups. We present evidence that this is mainly driven by differences across origin countries in norms regarding the importance of work, rather than by information sharing or taboos against cheating the government.
I18|Does Universalization of Health Work? Evidence from Health Systems Restructuring and Expansion in Brazil|We investigate universalization of access to health in Brazil. We find large reductions in maternal, foetal, neonatal and post-neonatal mortality, a reduction in fertility and, possibly on account of selection, no change in the quality of births. Using rich administrative data, we investigate changes in organization, access and outcomes, thereby illuminating the driving mechanisms. We find sharp increases in coverage of primary health facilities with GPs and outreach workers and, in line with this, increases in outpatient procedures, prenatal care visits, health-education activities and home visits by medical professionals. Consistent with an attempt to rationalize use of hospital resources, we find a decline in specialists and hospital beds per capita. Despite this, we see increases in hospital births, C-sections, and maternal hospitalization for complications, with no change in rates of infant hospitalization.
I18|The Long-Term Economic Effects of Polio: Evidence from the Introduction of the Polio Vaccine to Sweden in 1957|This study explores the impact an exogenous improvement in childhood health has on later-life outcomes. Using extensive and detailed register data from the Swedish Interdisciplinary Panel, we follow individuals exposed to the introduction of the first vaccine against polio in Sweden (birth cohorts 1937-1966) until adulthood in order to quantify the causal effect of polio vaccination on long-term economic outcomes. The results show that, contrary to what has been found in the literature for other health-related interventions, including other vaccines, exposure to the vaccine against polio did not seem to have any long-term effects on the studied adult economic outcomes. Upon closer inspection of how the disease affects children, this might be explained by the fact that no scarring effects from exposure to high incidence of polio were found on adult income, educational achievement, or hospitalizations, which seems to suggest that those who contracted the illness but suffered only the milder symptoms of the disease made a full recovery and had no lifelong sequels as a consequence of the condition. The absence of scarring effects is hypothesized to be related to the pathology and epidemiology of the disease itself, which infects many, but scars only those who suffer the most recognizable paralytic symptoms.
I18|Works Councils and Workplace Health Promotion in Germany|From a theoretical viewpoint, there can be market failures resulting in an underprovision of occupational health and safety. Works councils may help mitigate these failures. Using establishment data from Germany, our empirical analysis confirms that the incidence of a works council is significantly associated with an increased likelihood that the establishment provides more workplace health promotion than required by law. This result also holds in a recursive bivariate probit regression accounting for the possible endogeneity of works council incidence. Furthermore, analyzing potentially moderating factors such as collective bargaining coverage, industry, type of ownership, multiestablishment status and product market competition, we find a positive association between works councils and workplace health promotion for the various types of establishments examined. Finally, we go beyond the mere incidence of workplace health promotion and show that works councils are positively associated with a series of different measures of workplace health promotion.
I18|De Facto or De Jure? Ethnic Differences in Quit Responses to Legal Protections of Medical Marijuana Dispensaries|This paper studies the impact of legal medical marijuana markets on the decision to quit marijuana use, distinguishing between de jure legalization, in which dispensaries are legally protected, and de facto legalization, where dispensaries operate in the absence of laws protecting them. Geographic and temporal variation in the presence of de facto and de jure legalized markets serve to identify their impact on quitting. Although we find little robust evidence that quitting by females is impacted by either the presence or protection of retail medical marijuana dispensaries, our results reveal significant, and ethnically differentiated responses by males. Minority males are found to delay quitting in response to legal protection of dispensaries, while white males delay quitting in response to operating dispensaries. This behavior is consistent with racial and ethnic differences in the risks of arrest for simple marijuana offences, particularly for black males.
I18|Something in the Pipe: Flint Water Crisis and Health at Birth|Flint changed its public water source in 2014, causing severe water contamination. We estimate the effect of in utero exposure to polluted water on health at birth using the recent Flint water crisis as a natural experiment. Matching vital statistics birth records with various sources of data, we employ a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach as well as a Synthetic Control Method (SCM) to identify its causal impact on key birth outcomes. Our results suggest that the crisis modestly increased the rate of low birth weight (LBW) by 1.1-1.8 percentage points but had little effect on length of gestation or prematurity. The effects are larger for black or less educated mothers. Children born to disadvantaged mothers demonstrated 1.2-2.0 percentage points (or 10.4-17.4 percent) and 0.2- 0.6 percentage points (or 9.5-28.6 percent) rise in LBW and VLBW, respectively. We find little evidence that the Crisis increased fetal death, suggesting that the scarring effect in utero may dominate the channel of mortality selection. These results survive a rich set of placebo and falsification tests. Finally, our results lend support to three mechanisms at work linking water contamination and birth outcomes, i.e. biological effect, maternal stress, and avoidance actions.
I18|Glyphosate Use in Agriculture and Birth Outcomes of Surrounding Populations|This paper assesses the impact of glyphosate use in agriculture on birth outcomes of human populations in surrounding areas. Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the world. Still, despite ongoing controversy, little is known about its effects on human populations at large. Our empirical strategy relies on the fact that glyphosate is strongly complementary to the use of genetically modified seeds in soybean production. We use an instrument based on the gains in productivity from adoption of genetically modified soybeans and look at externalities across municipalities sharing the same water resources. We detect negative and statistically significant effects of glyphosate use on birth outcomes. Our results indicate externality effects of glyphosate use on populations distant from the original locations of use, but receiving water from these locations.
I18|The legacy lead deposition in soils and its impact on cognitive function in preschool-aged children in the United States|Surface soil contamination has been long recognized as an important pathway of human lead exposure, and is now a worldwide health concern. This study estimates the causal effects of exposure to lead in topsoil on cognitive ability among 5-year-old children. We draw on individual level data from the 2000 U.S. Census, and USGS data on lead in topsoil covering a broad set of counties across the United States. Using an instrumental variable approach relying on the 1944 Interstate Highway System Plan, we find that higher lead in topsoil increases considerably the probability of 5-year-old boys experiencing cognitive difficulties such as learning, remembering, concentrating, or making decisions. Living in counties with topsoil lead concentration above the national median roughly doubles the probability of 5-year-old boys having cognitive difficulties. Nevertheless, it does not seem to affect 5-year-old girls, consistent with previous studies. Importantly, the adverse effects of lead exposure on boys are found even in counties with levels of topsoil lead concentration considered low by the guidelines from the U.S. EPA and state agencies. These findings are concerning because they suggest that legacy lead may continue to impair cognition today, both in the United States and in other countries that have considerable lead deposition in topsoil.
I18|Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Take-Ups with Zero Cost: Evidence from an Experiment on Formatting Invitation Letters in Italy|We ran a randomized field experiment to ascertain whether a costless manipulation of the informational content (restricted or enhanced information) and the framing (gain or loss framing) of the invitation letter to the breast cancer screening program in Messina, Italy, affects the take-up rate. We show that giving enhanced loss-framed information about the risks of not having a mammography increases the take-up. This manipulation is especially effective among subjects with lower baseline take-ups – those living farther away from the screening site, residing in municipalities with low education, or with no recent screening experience – contributing to reduce socio-economic inequalities in screening. When we investigate the mechanisms behind our findings, we show that subjects exposed to our proposed manipulation are also less likely to postpone the appointment, signaling enhanced awareness about the risks related with delayed participation.
I18|Tobacco Sales Prohibition and Teen Smoking|We evaluate one of the most prevalent prohibitory policies: banning the sales of tobacco to teens. We exploit the staggered introduction of sales bans across Switzerland and the European Union from 1990 to 2016. The estimates indicate a less than 1 percentage point reduction in teen smoking because of the bans. The reduction is substantially lower than the 5 percentage point reduction expected by health officials. We examine additional outcomes relevant to assessing any prohibitory policy. We find that teens circumvent the bans through peers. Moreover, they consider smokers less cool but do not think smoking is more dangerous.
I18|The Phenomenon of Summer Diarrhea and Its Waning, 1910-1930|During the first two decades of the 20th century, diarrheal deaths among American infants and children surged every summer. Although we still do not know what pathogen (or pathogens) caused this phenomenon, the consensus view is that it was eventually controlled through public health efforts at the municipal level. Using data from 26 major American cities for the period 1910-1930, we document the phenomenon of summer diarrhea and explore its dissipation. We find that water filtration is associated with a 15-17 percent reduction in diarrheal mortality among children under the age of two during the non-summer months, but does not seem to have had an effect on diarrheal mortality during the summer. In general, we find little evidence to suggest that public health interventions undertaken at the municipal level contributed to the dissipation of summer diarrhea. Our results are relevant for many parts of the developing world today, where climate change is expected to affect the length and intensity of seasons as well as the incidence of diarrheal diseases.
I18|Motivating Bureaucrats through Social Recognition: External Validity — A Tale of Two States|Bureaucratic performance is a crucial determinant of economic growth, but little real-world evidence exists on how to improve it, especially in resource-constrained settings. We conducted a field experiment of a social recognition intervention to improve record keeping in health facilities in two Nigerian states, replicating the intervention - implemented by a single organization - on bureaucrats performing identical tasks. Social recognition improved performance in one state but had no effect in the other, highlighting both the potential benefits and also the sometimes-limited generalizability of behavioral interventions. Furthermore, differences in facility-level observables did not explain cross-state differences in impacts, suggesting that it may often be difficult to predict external validity.
I18|Digital Waste? Unintended Consequences of Health Information Technology| We exploit a large-scale natural experiment - the rollout of a nationwide electronic prescribing system in Finland - to study how digitization of prescriptions affects pharmaceutical use and health outcomes. We use comprehensive administrative data from patients treated with benzodiazepines, which are globally popular, effective but addictive psychotropic medications. We find no impact on benzodiazepine use on average, but among younger patients e-prescribing increases repeat prescription use. Younger patients' health outcomes do not improve but adverse outcomes, such as prescription drug abuse disorders and suicide attempts, increase dramatically. Improving access to medication through easier ordering may thus increase medication overuse.
I18|More hospital choices, more C-sections: Evidence from Chile|In this paper, we study the effect on cesarean rates of a policy change in Chile that decreased the cost of delivery at private hospitals for women with public health insurance. Using a difference-indifferences (DID) approach based on the eligibility conditions for this benefit, we find that in the first three years after the policy took effect, deliveries in private hospitals increased by 8.7 percentage points, while the probability of a C-section being performed increased by 4.6 percentage points, with negative impacts on average newborn weight and size at birth. We show that the probability of an early term birth in hospitals participating in the program is an increasing function of expected hospital demand at the time of the full-term due date. This suggests that in the absence of price incentives, hospitals use C-sections to smooth out demand over time to optimize the use of their resources.
I18|An Analysis of Beverage Size Restrictions|"Due to high levels of obesity, various government interventions have been proposed to curb the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). The New York City ""soda-ban,"" which proposed to limit the size of SSBs is among the most well-known and controversial. While public debates about beverage-size-restrictions tend to focus on how consumers are impacted, we use a nonlinear pricing model to show that, for all but extremely tight restrictions, consumer welfare would be unaffected by an enforceable restriction. However, sellers' profit would decline. While consumption is predicted to decline overall, the magnitude of the decline will vary by consumer segment."
I18|When Dad Can Stay Home: Fathers' Workplace Flexibility and Maternal Health|While workplace flexibility is perceived to be a key determinant of maternal labor supply, less is known about fathers' demand for flexibility or about intra-household spillover effects of flexibility initiatives. This paper examines these issues in the context of a critical period in family life — the months immediately following childbirth — and identifies the impacts of paternal access to workplace flexibility on maternal postpartum health. We model household demand for paternal presence at home as a function of domestic stochastic shocks, and use variation from a Swedish reform that granted new fathers more flexibility to take intermittent parental leave during the postpartum period in a regression discontinuity difference-in-differences (RD-DD) design. We find that increasing the father's temporal flexibility reduces the risk of the mother experiencing physical postpartum health complications and improves her mental health. Our results suggest that mothers bear the burden from a lack of workplace flexibility — not only directly through greater career costs of family formation, as previously documented — but also indirectly, as fathers' inability to respond to domestic shocks exacerbates the maternal health costs of childbearing.
I18|The Measurement of Health Inequalities: Does Status Matter?|The measurement of health inequalities usually involves either estimating the concentration of health outcomes using an income-based measure of status or applying conventional inequality-measurement tools to a health variable that is non-continuous or, in many cases, categorical. However, these approaches are problematic as they ignore less restrictive approaches to status. The approach in this paper is based on measuring inequality conditional on an individual’s position in the distribution of health outcomes: this enables us to deal consistently with categorical data. We examine several status concepts to examine self-assessed health inequality using the sample of world countries contained in the World Health Survey. We also perform correlation and regression analysis on the determinants of inequality estimates assuming an arbitrary cardinalisation. Our findings indicate major heterogeneity in health inequality estimates depending on the status approach, distributional-sensitivity parameter and measure adopted. We find evidence that pure health inequalities vary with median health status alongside measures of government quality.
I18|How Effective Are Pictorial Warnings on Tobacco Products? New Evidence on Smoking Behaviour Using Australian Panel Data|Studies examining the introduction of pictorial warnings on cigarette packages provide inconclusive evidence due to small samples and methodological issues. We use individual-level panel data from Australia to examine the association between pictorial warnings and smoking behaviour - prevalence, quitting, initiating and relapsing. The pictorial warnings were accompanied by a reference to a smoking cessation helpline and supportive television commercials. Applying an event study framework, we show that the reform reduced smoking rates by around 4% within the first year of the policy. The effect decreases with age, is similar for men and women, and is slightly larger for low-educated compared to high-educated individuals. The reform permanently lowered smoking rates primarily due to increased quitting in the year of the reform. Thus, pictorial warnings combined with a reference to a smoking cessation helpline and supportive media campaigns are an important tobacco control measure to reduce the social costs of smoking.
I18|The Effects of Stepwise Minimum Legal Drinking Age Legislation on Mortality: Evidence from Germany|"This study investigates the short-term mortality effects of two age-based restrictions on legal access to alcohol in Germany. We exploit sharp differences in legal access to alcohol at 16 and 18 years by implementing a regression discontinuity design. We find discontinuous increases in deaths at both age cutoffs, which are mainly driven by a ""novice driver effect"", whereas legal access to alcohol plays a marginal role at most. Overall, our results indicate that a stepwise introduction to alcohol has, at most, a minor impact on drunk driving and mortality at age 16 and 18 years. This study thus provides fresh impetus to the ongoing debate on the ""optimal"" MLDA legislation."
I18|Understanding Access Barriers to Public Services: Lessons from a Randomized Domestic Violence Intervention|We study the effect of reducing barriers to accessing non-police services on the demand for police services in cases of police-reported domestic violence. Variation comes from a large randomized controlled trial designed to assist victims in accessing non-police services and we link information from local and national police administrative records and a survey of victims to form a unique dataset for the evaluation. The intervention led to a 18% decrease in the demand for police services, as measured by the provision of a statement by victims. Despite a strong correlation between statements and criminal sanctions against perpetrators, we do not find a corresponding effect of the intervention on perpetrator arrest, charges, or sentencing. This suggests that treated victims who do not provide a statement do so because their potential statement was relatively less effective for pursuing criminal sanctions. Consistent with this result, we find treatment group statements are significantly less likely to be withdrawn than are control group statements.
I18|Losing Insurance and Behavioral Health Hospitalizations: Evidence from a Large-scale Medicaid Disenrollment|We study the effects of losing insurance on behavioral health – mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) – community hospitalizations. We leverage variation in public insurance eligibility offered by a large-scale Medicaid disenrollment. Losing insurance decreased SUD-related hospitalizations but mental illness hospitalizations were unchanged. Use of Medicaid to pay for behavioral health hospitalizations declined post-disenrollment. Mental illness hospitalization financing shifted to private insurance, Medicare, and patients, while SUD treatment financing shifted entirely to patients. We investigate implications of reliance on data that is not representative at the level of the treatment variable and propose a possible solution.
I18|Air Pollution During Pregnancy and Birth Outcomes in Italy|We investigate the impact of fetal exposure to air pollution on health outcomes at birth in Italy in the 2000s combining information on mother’s residential location from birth certificates with information on PM10 concentrations from air quality monitors. The potential endogeneity deriving from differential pollution exposure is addressed by exploiting as-good-as-random variation in rainfall shocks as an instrumental variable for air pollution concentrations. Our results show that both average levels of PM10 and days above the hazard limit have detrimental effects on birth weight, duration of gestation as well as overall health status at birth. These effects are mainly driven by pollution exposure during the third trimester of pregnancy and further differ in size with respect to the maternal socio-economic status, suggesting that babies born to socially disadvantaged mothers are more vulnerable. Given the non negligible effects of pollution on birth outcomes, further policy efforts are needed to fully protect fetuses from the adverse effects of air pollution and to mitigate the environmental inequality of health at birth.
I18|The Impact of Paid Family Leave on the Timing of Infant Vaccinations|Raising a new-born child involves not only financial resources, but also time investment from the parents. A time constraint can affect important decisions made by parents at the early stages of an infant's life. One form of investment that is particularly important is vaccinating an infant. We analyze the impact of time constraints on immunization of infants on time. To establish a causal relationship, we exploit California's implementation of Paid Parental Leave Program as a natural experiment. Using a nationally representative dataset from the National Immunization Survey, we find evidence that the policy reduced late vaccinations for children born to parents in California after the policy was implemented. We test for heterogeneous effects of the policy on different subgroups in the population. We find the policy had a stronger impact on families that are below the poverty line. We conduct a series of falsification tests and robustness checks to test the validity of the results. In addition, our results are robust to several placebo tests.
I18|Uninsured by Choice? A Choice Experiment on Long Term Care Insurance|We examine evidence from two unique discrete choice experiments (DCE) on long term care insurance and several of its relevant attributes, and more specifically, choices made by 15,298 individuals in the United States with and without insurance. We study the valuation of the following insurance attributes, namely daily insurance benefit, insurance coverage, the compulsory and voluntary nature of the insurance policy design, alongside the costs (insurance premium) and health requirements. This paper investigates respondents’ preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for these care insurance’s attributes using a random parameter logit model, and assess the heterogeneity of choice responses using demographic, socioeconomic and attitudinal motivations to segment response to insurance choices. We find that an increase in the insurance premium by an additional $100 would reduce insurance uptake by 1pp. Insurance policy uptake is higher when it provides benefits for the lifetime (the monthly marginal WTP being $178.64), and voluntary (the monthly marginal WTP increases by an extra $74.71) as opposed to universal, and when it forgoes health checks (the monthly marginal WTP increases by an extra 28US$).
I18|Measuring the Social and Externality Benefits of Influenza Vaccination|Vaccination represents a canonical example of externalities in economics, yet there are few estimates of their magnitudes. I provide evidence on the social and externality benefits of influenza vaccination in two settings. First, using pre-existing differences in state-level vaccination rates interacted with exogenous annual variation in vaccine quality, I estimate of the impacts of aggregate vaccination rates on mortality and work absences in the United States. Scaled nationally, I find that a one percentage point increase in the vaccination rate results in 1,134 fewer deaths and 8.9 million fewer work hours lost due to illness each year. The mortality reductions are concentrated among individuals 75 and older, but over half of the effect is attributable to the vaccination of people under 75, suggesting a considerable externality effect. Second, I examine a setting in which vaccination is targeted at a group with extremely high externality benefits: vaccination mandates for health care workers. I find that mandates lead to reductions in hospital diagnoses for influenza in affected counties, consistent with substantial externality impacts. For both the general population and the population of health care workers, the estimates suggest that programs increasing vaccine take-up are likely to be cost-effective under reasonable assumptions about the costs.
I18|Low Emission Zones for Better Health: Evidence from German Hospitals|This paper studies health effects from restricting the access of high-emission vehicles to innercities by implementing Low Emission Zones. For identification, we exploit variation in the timing and the spatial distribution of the introduction of new Low Emission Zones across cities in Germany. We use detailed hospitalization data combined with geo-coded information on the coverage of Low Emission Zones. We find that Low Emission Zones significantly reduce levels of air pollution in urban areas and that these improvements in air quality translate into population health benefits. The number of diagnoses related to air pollution is significantly reduced for hospitals located within or in close proximity to a Low Emission Zone after it becomes effective. The results are mainly driven by reductions in chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
I18|Did the ACA Medicaid Expansion Save Lives?|We estimate the effect of the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion on county-level mortality in the first four years following expansion. We find a reduction in all-cause mortality in ages 20 to 64 equaling 11.36 deaths per 100,000 individuals, a 3.6 percent decrease. This estimate is largely driven by reductions in causes of death likely to be influenced by access to health care, and equates to one life saved per 310 newly covered individuals. A cost-benefit analysis shows that the improvement in welfare due to mortality responses may offset the entire net-of-transfers expenditure associated with the expansion.
I18|Temperature and Mental Health: Evidence from the Spectrum of Mental Health Outcomes|This paper characterizes the link between ambient temperatures and a broad set of mental health outcomes. We find that higher temperatures increase emergency department visits for mental illness, suicides, and self-reported days of poor mental health. Specifically, cold temperatures reduce negative mental health outcomes while hot temperatures increase them. Our estimates reveal no evidence of adaptation, instead the temperature relationship is stable across time, baseline climate, air conditioning penetration rates, accessibility of mental health services, and other factors. The character of the results suggests that temperature affects mental health very differently than physical health, and more similarly to other psychological and behavioral outcomes. We provide suggestive evidence for sleep disruption as an active mechanism behind our results and discuss the implications of our findings for the allocation of mental health services and in light of climate change.
I18|Residential Noise Exposure and Health: Evidence from Aviation Noise and Birth Outcomes|Exploiting recent concentration of flight patterns under a new Federal Aviation Administration policy (called NextGen), we examine the impact of exposure to excessive noise levels on birth outcomes. Using birth records that include mothers’ home addresses to measure airport proximity, we find the risk of low birth weight babies increases by 17 percent among mothers living near the airport in the direction of the runway. We utilize exogenous variation in noise exposure triggered by NextGen, which unintentionally increased noise in communities affected by the new flight patterns. Our finding informs policy-makers regarding the trade-off between flight optimization and human health.
I18|The Effects of the Affordable Care Act on Workplace Absenteeism of Overweight and Obese Workers|In this paper, we examine whether the expansion of health insurance coverage brought on by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), led to a decline in absenteeism among overweight and obese individuals. We use data from the National Health Insurance Survey (NHIS) to compare absenteeism among overweight and obese workers to absenteeism among normal-weight workers before and after the ACA. Our results suggest that in the post-ACA period, the probability of being absent declined by about 1.3 (1.5) percentage points among obese (overweight) individuals. Disaggregated regressions suggest that the effect is significant among women, but not among men. Furthermore, our estimates (using a Tobit model) indicate that the obese (overweight) workers missed 0.33 (0.46) fewer days after the ACA. Again, the effect is concentrated among women. Our results show that improved health outcomes led to reduced absenteeism. Our results also show that there are no decline in absenteeism among elderly (age>=65) adults (who did not experience any increase in health insurance coverage as a result of the ACA), suggesting that the decline in absenteeism is indeed due to the expansion of health insurance coverage due to the ACA. Our estimates imply that the ACA reduced the cost associated with absenteeism by about $350 million per year.
I18|A novel supply-side measure to combat abuse of addictive prescription drugs|In the United States, 115 people die each day due to overdose, and a third of overdoses involve the concurrent use of opioids and a class of sedatives called benzodiazepines. Facing a similar problem in 2012, Austria responded by installing public health officers (PHOs) as third-party institutions overseeing prescriptions of the most potent and commonly abused benzodiazepine, flunitrazepam. Since December 15, 2012, every single flunitrazepam prescription must be authorized and countersigned by a PHO, prescriptions were restricted to a month’s supply of the drug, and doses must be dispensed daily, under supervision, in a pharmacy. I identify a sample of opioids addicts in administrative social security data and study their response to this reform. Event studies suggest a persistent decline in flunitrazepam prescriptions but substitution to less potent benzodiazepines following the reform. To examine subsequent health, labor market, and drug abuse-related outcomes, I additionally exploit regional variation in PHO strictness affecting the likelihood that addicts opt to quit the drug due to the reform. I find that addicts who quit after encountering a strict PHO have better health and labor market outcomes, have fewer opioid overdoses, and are less likely to take antidepressants or weak opioids. I discuss how these findings translate to the US setting, and whether a similar policy can help curb its opioid epidemic.
I18|Enrolment of Informal Sector Workers on the National Health Insurance System in Indonesia: A Qualitative Analysis|One of the main challenges to Universal Health Coverage in developing countries like Indonesia is a high prevalence of those working in the informal sector that by the system they have to voluntarily register in the National Health Insurance System (NHIS) as Self Enroled Member. Therefore, challenges are administrative dif?culties in recruiting, registering and collecting regular contribution in the most of cost-effective way. This condition hinders some individuals for being covered NHIS. This research aims to analyze qualitatively some aspects that in?uence the decisions of individuals or households to join NHIS in Indonesia. By conducting in-depth interviews with some of the informants who were surveyed in 2014, and some new additional informants in the three selected regions of Deli Serdang, Pandeglang, and Kupang, the study found that regional socio-economic characteristics, demographics, culture and belief systems have varying degrees of in?uence on individual decisions to join the NHIS. The general pattern across all the regions reveals three main factors that in?uence the decisions of those working in the informal sector to join the NHIS: health conditions; family and peers; and existing knowledge and experience. High-risk individuals tend to join the NHIS through interactions with health workers, family members, and friends, concerning their illnesses or health risks. These groups tend to advocate NHIS as a means of reducing overall health expenses, particularly for expensive procedures. This creates an adverse selection problem and a pressing challenge for Social Security Agency for Health (SSAH) to attract healthy, young and low-risk groups in the informal sector to join the NHIS. The stories provided by the informants regarding their decision-making processes in joining NHIS also reveal the necessary and suf?cient conditions that enable informal sector workers to join the program. The necessary conditions are individual-speci?c and may differ between people, depending on individual characteristics, regional socio-economic and demographic characteristics, as well as belief systems. All the factors, apart from knowledge and experience, are necessary conditions for joining the NHIS, while knowledge and experience are suf?cient conditions that encourage informal sector (PBPU) to join NHIS. Without reliable information and knowledge about the NHIS, PBPU will not join NHIS, although they may like to join because of various individual factors.
I18|The effect of local growth in antidepressant consumption on mental health outcomes|Despite growing skepticism regarding the efficacy of antidepressants, global consumption is increasing at an unprecedented path with unknown implications for society. We estimate the causal effect of this increase on mental health outcomes using an IV strategy that exploits detailed drug sales data from Switzerland between 2002 and 2014. Our instrument, a modified version of the popular shift-share instrument, relies on the national growth in antidepressant sales for pharmaceutical companies (the shift) - mainly due to product innovation - and assigns it locally using regional non-antidepressant market shares. Our estimates show that an increase in antidepressants sales does not significantly affect suicide rates but cause an increase of hospital admissions for mental disorder and for depression. The causal effects prove to be resistant to several robustness checks.
I18|MaÃ®triser les dÃ©penses de santÃ© face au changement dÃ©mographique : Une analyse de lâ€™Ã©volution des coÃ»ts Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital au QuÃ©bec|Ã€ partir de donnÃ©es mÃ©dico-administratives longitudinales sur les sÃ©jours Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital et les coÃ»ts au QuÃ©bec pour la pÃ©riode 1995-2012, une dÃ©composition de la variation des coÃ»ts de santÃ© Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital est effectuÃ©e afin dâ€™en analyser les principaux dÃ©terminants. Entre 1995 et 2012, la part des sÃ©jours hospitaliers a reprÃ©sentÃ© 86% de la hausse des coÃ»ts Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital, contre seulement 14% pour les services mÃ©dicaux Ã lâ€™acte. De 2008 Ã 2012, cette rÃ©partition a Ã©tÃ© respectivement de 41% et 59%. Sur la pÃ©riode la plus rÃ©cente observÃ©e, comme on aurait pu sâ€™y attendre du fait de la hausse des rÃ©munÃ©rations des mÃ©decins spÃ©cialistes, câ€™est donc la forte hausse des coÃ»ts des services mÃ©dicaux qui a le plus contribuÃ© Ã la hausse des coÃ»ts Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital. NÃ©anmoins, lâ€™augmentation des volumes dâ€™actes a davantage contribuÃ© Ã la hausse globale des coÃ»ts que la hausse des prix des actes. Il est de plus difficile dâ€™Ã©tablir un changement de comportement chez les mÃ©decins suite aux bonifications rÃ©centes des prix des actes, dans la mesure oÃ¹ la variation des volumes dâ€™actes apparaÃ®t assez dÃ©connectÃ©e de la variation des prix des actes. On montre enfin que lâ€™effet de vieillissement ne prÃ©domine pas tous les autres et semble avoir une relativement faible influence sur lâ€™Ã©volution des coÃ»ts de santÃ© Ã lâ€™hÃ´pital. Câ€™est donc davantage une combinaison des changements dans la prÃ©valence des maladies et des changements de pratiques qui ont eu pour effet dâ€™entraÃ®ner la hausse globale des coÃ»ts.
I18|Holding Hospitals Accountable? Evidence on the Effectiveness of Minimum Charity Care Provision Laws| What can governments do to encourage nonprofit hospitals to provide greater benefits to their communities? Recent efforts by the federal and state governments seek to hold hospitals accountable for community health, in part by incentivizing charity care provision. Laws that set benchmarks for charity care spending are increasingly used, but their efficacy is uncertain. In this study, we examine the extent to which Illinois’ minimum charity care provision (MCCP) law increases nonprofit hospital charity care. Importantly, we differentiate between responses for hospitals required to provide minimal charitable spending (nonprofits) and those that are not (for-profit and public). We use detailed panel (2009-2015) data from Illinois' Annual Hospital Questionnaire and county-level data from the American Community Survey. We exploit a discrete change in charitable care requirements for nonprofit hospitals to identify the effect of the MCCP law on charity care, controlling for hospital characteristics, county demographics, and year and county (or hospital) fixed effects. Employing a differences-in-differences model, we find no evidence that the MCCP law increases charity care on average. Instead, we find some evidence that the law’s effects vary by how much charity care hospitals provided previously – charity care increases for those providing lower levels at baseline, narrowing the gap in charity care provision with those that provide high levels at baseline. The results suggest that setting low benchmarks does not create sufficient incentives for nonprofit hospitals to provide greater charity care on average, but instead may narrow the gap between high and low charity care hospitals.
I18|De Facto or De Jure? Ethnic Differences in Quit Responses to Legal Protections of Medical Marijuana Dispensaries|This paper studies the impact of legal medical marijuana markets on the decision to quit marijuana use. We distinguish between de jure legalization, where dispensaries are legally protected, and de facto legalization, where dispensaries operate in the absence of laws protecting them. Geographic and temporal variation in the presence of de facto and de jure legalized markets serve to identify their impact on quitting. Although we find little robust evidence that quitting by females is impacted by either the presence or protection of retail medical marijuana dispensaries, our results reveal significant and ethnically differentiated responses by males. Minority males are found to delay quitting in response to legal protection of dispensaries, while white males delay quitting in response to operating dispensaries. This behavior is consistent with racial and ethnic differences in the risks of arrest for simple marijuana offences, particularly for black males.
I18|Socialized Healthcare and Women's Fertility Decisions|This paper examines the effect of a nationwide healthcare reform implemented in Turkey on women's fertility decisions. The Family Medicine Program (FMP), introduced in 2005, provided a wide-range of primary healthcare services, free of charge, and achieved universal access by matching each citizen to a specific family physician, who operates at neighborhood clinics, called Family Health Centers, on a walk-in basis. Although reducing fertility was not specified among the goals of the reform, reproductive-health and family-planning services have been covered under the FMP. To establish causality, we exploit the staggered rollout of the FMP implementation across Turkish provinces over time using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy. Our estimates indicate that the FMP significantly reduced childbearing among both teenagers and women ages 20-29. These results can be explained by increased access to and reduced cost of reproductive-health and family-planning services. However, the patterns in which the program effect has evolved over time differs between the two groups of women in a way that provides additional insights about the mechanisms. For teenagers, the FMP had a direct effect on childbearing, reflected by an immediate and rapidly-increasing pattern, which is not surprising given the broad agreement about the negative consequences of teenage childbearing among government and public health officials, including those in Turkey. For women ages 20-29, however, the program had a gradual and slowly-increasing effect, which is consistent with an empowerment channel. This should be interpreted as an unintended consequence of the program because, if anything, Turkey is a country where the government's position is to encourage fertility behavior and discourage birth control practices among women at prime childbearing ages.
I18|School bus emissions, student health and academic performance|Diesel emissions from school buses expose children to high levels of air pollution; retrofitting bus engines can substantially reduce this exposure. Using variation from 2656 retrofits across Georgia, we estimate effects of emissions reductions on district-level health and academic achievement. We demonstrate positive effects on respiratory health, measured by a statewide test of aerobic capacity. Placebo tests on body mass index show no impact. We also find that retrofitting districts experience significant test score gains in English and smaller gains in math. Our results suggest that engine retrofits can have meaningful and cost-effective impacts on health and cognitive functioning.
I18|The Power of the IUD: Effects of Expanding Access to Contraception Through Title X Clinics|We estimate the effect of Colorado's Family Planning Initiative, the largest program to have focused on long-acting-reversible contraceptives in the United States, which provided funds to Title X clinics so that they could make these contraceptives available to low-income women. We find substantial effects on birth rates, concentrated among women in zip codes within 7 miles of clinics: the initiative reduced births by approximately 20 percent for 15-17 year olds and 18-19 year olds living in such zip codes. We also examine how extensive media coverage of the initiative in 2014 and 2015 altered its reach. After information spread about the availability and benefits of LARCs, we find a substantial increase in LARC insertions, extended effects on births among 15-17 year olds living greater than 7 miles from clinics, and significant reductions in births among 20–24 and 25–29 year olds.
I18|The Phenomenon of Summer Diarrhea and its Waning, 1910-1930|During the first two decades of the 20th century, diarrheal deaths among American infants and children surged every summer. Although we still do not know what pathogen (or pathogens) caused this phenomenon, the consensus view is that it was eventually controlled through public health efforts at the municipal level. Using data from 26 major American cities for the period 1910-1930, we document the phenomenon of summer diarrhea and explore its dissipation. We find that water filtration is associated with a 15-17 percent reduction in diarrheal mortality among children under the age of two during the non-summer months, but does not seem to have had an effect on diarrheal mortality during the summer. In general, we find little evidence to suggest that public health interventions undertaken at the municipal level contributed to the dissipation of summer diarrhea. Our results are relevant for many parts of the developing world today, where climate change is expected to affect the length and intensity of seasons as well as the incidence of diarrheal diseases.
I18|Capacity Constraints and the Provision of Public Services: The Case of Workers in Public Health Clinics|Unlike in the production of most goods, changes in capacity for labor-intensive services only affect outcomes of interest insofar as service providers change the way they allocate their time in response to those capacity changes. In this paper, we examine how public sector service providers respond to unexpected capacity constraints in the specific context of public health clinics. We exploit an exogenous reduction in public health clinic capacity to quantify nurses' trade-off between patients treated and time spent with each patient, which we treat as a proxy for a quality v. quantity decision. We provide evidence that these small and generally insignificant effects on nurse time favor public sector employees prioritizing quality of each interaction over clearing the patient queue.
I18|The Returns to Early-life Interventions for Very Low Birth Weight Children|We use comprehensive administrative data from Rhode Island to measure the impact of early-life interventions for low birth weight newborns on later-life outcomes. We use a regression discontinuity design based on the 1,500-gram threshold for Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) status. We show that threshold crossing causes more intense in-hospital care, in line with prior studies. Threshold crossing also causes a 0.34 standard deviation increase in test scores in elementary and middle school, a 17.1 percentage point increase in the probability of college enrollment, and $66,997 decrease in social program expenditures by age 14. We explore potential mechanisms driving these impacts.
I18|The Impact of Parental Involvement Laws on Minor Abortion|In this article, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the effect of parental involvement (PI) laws on the incidence of abortions to minors across a span of nearly three decades. We contribute to the extant literature on this topic in several ways. First, we explore differences in estimates of the effect of PI laws across time that may result from changes in contraception, the composition of pregnant minors, access to confidential abortions in nearby states, or through judicial bypass, and the degree to which these laws are enforced. We find that, on average, PI laws enacted before the mid-1990s are associated with a 15% to 20% reduction in minor abortions. PI laws enacted after this time are not, on average, associated with declines in abortions to minors. Second, we assess the role of out-of-state travel by minors, estimating models that allow the effect of PI laws to differ by the distance to the nearest state without a PI law. We find that out-of-state travel is not a substantive moderating factor of the effect of PI laws. Third, we use a synthetic control approach to explore state-level heterogeneity in the effect of PI laws and find large differences in the impact of PI laws on minor abortions by state. These differences are unrelated to the type of law (consent versus notification) or whether contiguous states have enacted PI laws. Finally, we show that estimates of the effect of PI laws using data from either the Centers for Disease Control or the Alan Guttmacher Institute do not differ qualitatively once differences in coverage by state and year across these data are harmonized.
I18|Paid Family Leave and Breastfeeding: Evidence from California|This paper evaluates the effect of Paid Family Leave (PFL) on breastfeeding, which we identify using California’s enactment of a 2004 PFL policy that ensured mothers up to six weeks of leave at a 55 percent wage replacement rate. We employ synthetic control models for a large, representative sample of over 270,000 children born between 2000 and 2012 drawn from the restricted-use versions of the 2003 – 2014 National Immunization Surveys. Our estimates indicate that PFL increases the overall duration of breastfeeding by nearly 18 days, and the likelihood of breastfeeding for at least six months by 5 percentage points. We find substantially larger effects of PFL on breastfeeding duration for some disadvantaged mothers.
I18|Earnings Dynamics and Firm-Level Shocks|In this paper we use matched employer employee data from Sweden to study the role of the firm in affecting the stochastic properties of the wage process. We consider two ways in which the firm may induce variations in pay across workers and over time: match effects (allowed to vary over time), and the transmission of firm-specific productivity shocks. In both cases we separate temporary from more persistent effects. Our statistical model accounts for endogenous participation and mobility decisions and thus deals with the potential truncation in the impact of productivity on wages that is induced by people quitting into unemployment or changing employer. We document a number of key findings. First, firm-specific permanent productivity shocks transmit to individual wages, but the effect is mostly concentrated among the high-skilled workers; the opposite pattern is found for firm-specific temporary shocks. Moreover, we find only modest updates in match effects over the life of a firm-worker relationship. Finally, we estimate a significant role for permanent individual shocks that stick with the worker. However, a substantial part of the growth in earnings variance over the life cycle for high-skilled workers is driven by firms. By age 55, 44% of the cross-sectional variance is attributable to firm-level shocks.
I18|Predicting High-Risk Opioid Prescriptions Before they are Given|Misuse of prescription opioids is a leading cause of premature death in the United States. We use new state government administrative data and machine learning methods to examine whether the risk of future opioid dependence, abuse, or poisoning can be predicted in advance of an initial opioid prescription. Our models accurately predict these outcomes and identify particular prior non-opioid prescriptions, medical history, incarceration, and demographics as strong predictors. Using our model estimates, we simulate a hypothetical policy which restricts new opioid prescriptions to only those with low predicted risk. The policy’s potential benefits likely outweigh costs across demographic subgroups, even for lenient definitions of “high risk.” Our findings suggest new avenues for prevention using state administrative data, which could aid providers in making better, data-informed decisions when weighing the medical benefits of opioid therapy against the risks.
I18|Do Stricter Immunization Laws Improve Coverage? Evidence from the Repeal of Non-medical Exemptions for School Mandated Vaccines|Nonmedical exemptions are widely shown to be associated with outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease. In response to a recent measles outbreak in 2015, California acted to increase immunization coverage by removing all nonmedical exemptions effective in 2016. Employing a unique dataset of county-level vaccination and exemption rates at Kindergarten entry, we exploit the recent policy change in California to estimate the impact of the repeal of nonmedical exemptions on immunization coverage for school-mandated vaccines. Relative to a diverse group of control states, our findings indicate that vaccination coverage increased for all required vaccines following the repeal, ranging from 2.5% for MMR to 5% for Polio. We also find a significant 3.4 percentage-point decline in nonmedical exemptions, accompanied by a 2.1 percentage-point increase in medical exemptions in counties that previously had high rates of nonmedical waivers. Our findings indicate that the repeal of nonmedical exemptions in California was only partially effective in improving vaccination coverage, and may have led parents to substitute between medical and nonmedical exemptions, leading to a net decline in total exemptions of just 1 percentage-point.
I18|Reclassification to Avoid Consumer Cost-Sharing in Group Health Plans|We examine how consumers respond to being effectively double insured under two systems: group health (GH) and workers’ compensation (WC). Many GH plans have substantial consumer cost-sharing burden, while WC coverage has no cost-sharing for medical services for work-related injuries. As a result, a consumer facing a large deductible under their group health plan will have a strong financial incentive to make a claim under WC instead. We use a unique data set of claims under both GH and WC to study how “case shifting” to WC responds to GH deductibles for the most common set of injuries that are covered under both types of insurance. We identify the impact of case shifting by using interactions of deductible levels and previous spending. We find that a typical claim is about 1.4 percentage points (5.3%) more likely to be filed as a WC claim when facing an average deductible (about $630) compared to a plan with no deductible, and that total WC costs in the U.S. are more than $1.2 billion higher as a result. At the same time, we find that consumers do not appear to be forward looking, focusing on the “spot price” rather than the full “end of year price” in deciding whether to claim under WC.
I18|It's the Phone, Stupid: Mobiles and Murder|US homicide rates fell sharply in the early 1990s, a decade that also saw the mainstreaming of cell phones – a concurrence that may be more than a coincidence, we propose. Cell phones may have undercut turf-based street dealing, thus undermining drug-dealing profits of street gangs, entities known to engage in violent crime. Studying county-level data for the years 1970-2009 we find that the expansion of cellular phone service (as proxied by antenna-structure density) lowered homicide rates in the 1990s. Furthermore, effects were concentrated in urban counties; among Black or Hispanic males; and more gang/drug-associated homicides.
I18|Controlling Tuberculosis? Evidence from the First Community-Wide Health Experiment|This paper studies the immediate and long-run mortality effects of the first community-based health intervention in the world – the Framingham Health and Tuberculosis Demonstration, 1917-1923. The official evaluation committee and the historical narrative suggest that the demonstration was highly successful in controlling tuberculosis and reducing mortality. Using newly digitized annual cause-of-death data for municipalities in Massachusetts, 1901-1934, and different empirical strategies, we find little evidence to support this positive assessment. In fact, we find that the demonstration did not reduce tuberculosis mortality, all-age mortality, nor infant mortality. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate on whether public-health interventions mattered for the decline in (tuberculosis) mortality prior to modern medicine. At a more fundamental level, our study questions this particular type of community-based setup with non-random treatment assignment as a method of evaluating policy interventions.
I18|When Dad Can Stay Home: Fathers' Workplace Flexibility and Maternal Health|While workplace flexibility is perceived to be a key determinant of maternal labor supply, less is known about fathers' demand for flexibility or about intra-household spillover effects of flexibility initiatives. This paper examines these issues in the context of a critical period in family life–the months immediately following childbirth–and identifies the impacts of paternal access to workplace flexibility on maternal postpartum health. We model household demand for paternal presence at home as a function of domestic stochastic shocks, and use variation from a Swedish reform that granted new fathers more flexibility to take intermittent parental leave during the postpartum period in a regression discontinuity difference-in-differences (RD-DD) design. We find that increasing the father's temporal flexibility reduces the risk of the mother experiencing physical postpartum health complications and improves her mental health. Our results suggest that mothers bear the burden from a lack of workplace flexibility–not only directly through greater career costs of family formation, as previously documented–but also indirectly, as fathers' inability to respond to domestic shocks exacerbates the maternal health costs of childbearing.
I18|The Affordable Care Act’s Effects on Patients, Providers and the Economy: What We’ve Learned So Far|As we approach the tenth anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, it is important to reflect on what has been learned about the impacts of this major reform. In this paper we review the literature on the impacts of the ACA on patients, providers and the economy. We find strong evidence that the ACA’s provisions have increased insurance coverage. There is also a clearly positive effect on access to and consumption of health care, with suggestive but more limited evidence on improved health outcomes. There is no evidence of significant reductions in provider access, changes in labor supply, or increased budgetary pressures on state governments, and the law’s total federal cost through 2018 has been less than predicted. We conclude by describing key policy implications and future areas for research.
I18|Losing Insurance and Behavioral Health Hospitalizations: Evidence from a Large-Scale Medicaid Disenrollment|We study the effects of losing insurance on behavioral health – mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) – community hospitalizations. We leverage variation in public insurance eligibility offered by a large-scale Medicaid disenrollment. Losing insurance decreased SUD-related hospitalizations but mental illness hospitalizations were unchanged. Use of Medicaid to pay for behavioral health hospitalizations declined post-disenrollment. Mental illness hospitalization financing shifted to private insurance, Medicare, and patients, while SUD treatment financing shifted entirely to patients. We investigate implications of reliance on data that is not representative at the level of the treatment variable and propose a possible solution.
I18|Dust and Death: Evidence from the West African Harmattan|Using two decades of data from twelve low-income countries in West Africa, we show that dust carried by harmattan trade winds increases infant and child mortality. Health investments respond to dust exposure, consistent with compensating behaviors. Despite these efforts, surviving children still exhibit negative health impacts. Our data allow us to investigate differential impacts over time and across countries. We find declining impacts over time, suggesting adaptation. Using national-level measures of macroeconomic conditions and health resources, we find suggestive evidence that both economic development and public health improvements have contributed to this adaptation, with health improvements playing a larger role.
I18|Do Report Cards Predict Future Quality? The Case of Skilled Nursing Facilities|Report cards on provider performance are intended to improve consumer decision-making and address information gaps in the market for quality. However, inadequate risk adjustment of report-card measures often biases comparisons across providers. We test whether going to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) with a higher star rating affects outcomes for a patient. We exploit variation over time in the distance from a patient’s residential ZIP code to SNFs with different ratings to estimate the causal effect of admission to a higher-rated SNF on health care outcomes, including mortality. We found that patients who go to higher-rated SNFs experience lower mortality, fewer days in the nursing home, and fewer hospital readmissions.
I18|Protecting Infants from Natural Disasters: The Case of Vitamin A Supplementation and a Tornado in Bangladesh|Severe environmental shocks have grown in frequency and intensity due to climate change. Can policy protect against the often devastating human impacts of these shocks, particularly for vulnerable populations? We study this question by leveraging data from a situation in which a tornado tore through an area involved in a double-blind cluster-randomized controlled trial of at-birth vitamin A supplementation in Bangladesh. Tornado exposure in utero and in infancy decreased birth size and physical growth, and increased the incidence of severe fevers. But infants who received vitamin A supplementation, which boosts immune system functioning, were protected from these effects. Tornado impacts and protective effects were both substantially larger for boys. Our results suggest that wide-scale supplementation policies would generate potential health benefits in disaster-prone areas of low-income countries.
I18|Are Quality-Adjusted Medical Prices Declining for Chronic Disease? Evidence from Diabetes Care in Four Health Systems|Improvements in medical treatment have contributed to rising health spending. Yet there is relatively little evidence on whether the spending increase is “worth it” in the sense of producing better health outcomes of commensurate value—a critical question for understanding productivity in the health sector and, as that sector grows, for deriving an accurate quality-adjusted price index for an entire economy. We analyze individual-level panel data on medical spending and health outcomes for 123,548 patients with type 2 diabetes in four health systems. Using a “cost-of-living” method that measures value based on improved survival, we find a positive net value of diabetes care: the value of improved survival outweighs the added costs of care in each of the four health systems. This finding is robust to accounting for selective survival, end-of-life spending, and a range of values for a life-year or, equivalently, to attributing only a fraction of survival improvements to medical care.
I18|Can Policy Affect Initiation of Addictive Substance Use? Evidence from Opioid Prescribing|Drug control policy can have unintended consequences by pushing existing users to alternative, possibly more dangerous substances. Policies that target only new users may therefore be especially promising. Using commercial insurance claims data, we provide the first evidence on a set of new policies intended to reduce opioid initiation in the form of limits on initial prescription length. We also provide the first evidence on the impact of must-access prescription drug monitoring programs (MA-PDMPs), laws that do not target new users, on initial opioid use. Although initial limit policies reduce the average length of initial prescriptions, they do so primarily by raising the frequency of short prescriptions, resulting in increases in opioids dispensed to new users. In contrast, we find that MA-PDMPs reduce opioids dispensed to new users, even though they do not explicitly set out to do so. Neither policy significantly affects extreme use such as doctor shopping among new patients, because such behavior is very rare.
I18|The Health Impacts of Hospital Delivery Practices|Hospital treatment practices vary widely, often with little connection to the medical needs of patients. We assess the impact of these differences in the context of childbirth. We focus on low-risk first births, where c-section rates vary enormously across hospitals, and where policymakers have focused much of their attention in calls for reducing unnecessary c-sections. We find that proximity to hospitals with high c-section rates leads to more cesarean deliveries, fewer vaginal births after prolonged labor, and higher average Apgar scores. Infants born in these hospitals are less likely to be readmitted in the year after birth, but more likely to visit the emergency department for a respiratory-related problem. They also have lower mortality rates, driven by a reduction in the joint probability of prolonged labor and subsequent death. A stylized cost benefit analysis suggests that re-allocating births to high c-section hospitals could lead to net social benefits.
I18|The Effects of Traditional Cigarette and E-Cigarette Taxes on Adult Tobacco Product Use|We study the effects of traditional cigarette tax rate changes and e-cigarette tax adoption on use of these products among U.S. adults. Data are drawn from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and National Health Interview Survey data over the period 2011 to 2017. Using a differences-in-differences model, we find that higher traditional cigarette taxes reduce adult traditional cigarette use and increase adult e-cigarette use, suggesting that the products are economic substitutes. E-cigarette tax adoption reduces e-cigarette use, with some heterogeneity across groups, and dilutes the own-tax responsiveness of traditional cigarettes.
I18|Private vs. Public Provision of Social Insurance: Evidence from Medicaid|Public health insurance benefits in the U.S. are increasingly provided by private firms, despite mixed evidence on welfare effects. We investigate the impact of privatization in Medicaid by exploiting the staggered introduction of county-level mandates in Texas that required disabled beneficiaries to switch from public to private plans. Compared to the public program, which used blunt rationing to control costs, we find privatization led to improvements in healthcare—including increased consumption of high-value drug treatments and fewer avoidable hospitalizations—but also higher Medicaid spending. We conclude that private provision can be beneficial when constraints in the public setting limit efficiency.
I18|Effect of an Abrupt Change in Sexual and Reproductive Health Policy on Adolescent Birth Rates in Ecuador, 2008–2017|In recent years, several countries have implemented restrictive, abstinence-only policies toward reproductive health, as opposed to comprehensive, adolescent-friendly health services. Little is known, however, about the effects of these restrictive policies on adolescent birth rates at the national level or their differential effects by race and ethnicity. The extant literature is even scarcer in low- and middle-income countries. We fill this knowledge gap by exploiting an unexpected policy change in Ecuador that abruptly reversed course for reproductive health services for adolescent women in 2014. In a difference-in-differences analysis of age-specific birth rates in Ecuador’s 221 cantons, we find that the abrupt policy change was associated with an increase in teen birth rates by 9 births per 1000 women. In a difference-in-difference-in-differences analysis, we find that the policy change was associated with an additional increase of 12 births per 1000 women among those cantons where at least 12 percent of the population is self-declared as indigenous. Our results are robust to changes in standard error clustering, population weighting, logarithmic model specification, adjustments for underreporting, and changes in the year when the new policy went into effect.
I18|Evaluation of Medical Technologies with Uncertain Benefits|Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) remains the de-facto method of choice to evaluate and compare medical interventions. Standard approaches to CEA use the average (mean) outcomes from clinical effectiveness studies such as randomized controlled trials. This paper generalizes standard methods to include uncertainty in clinical outcomes and proposes a generalized version of the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), referred to as a quality- and risk-adjusted life-year (QRALY). Our approach requires new information from clinical studies – not only means and variances of health outcomes, but also skewness. With that added parameter, this paper shows how Taylor Series expansions of expected utility can account for two distinct effects of uncertainty: the “insurance value” of reducing overall risks to health, and the “value of hope” produced by the presence of positively skewed outcomes. Simulations demonstrate that stochastic terms are particularly important when baseline disease severity is high, and mean treatment effects are low. They also demonstrate that the variance-based term has the greatest importance among the stochastic terms, although skewness- and kurtosis-based terms can be significant in some situations.
I18|The Impacts of Physician Payments on Patient Access, Use, and Health|We examine how the amount a physician is paid influences who they are willing to see. Exploiting large, exogenous changes in Medicaid reimbursement rates, we find that increasing payments for new patient office visits reduces reports of providers turning away beneficiaries: closing the gap in payments between Medicaid and private insurers would reduce more than two-thirds of disparities in access among adults and would eliminate disparities among children. These improvements in access lead to more office visits, better self-reported health, and reduced school absenteeism. Our results demonstrate that financial incentives for physicians drive access to care and have important implications for patient health.
I18|The Effects of Primary Care Chronic-Disease Management in Rural China|Health systems globally face increasing morbidity and mortality from chronic disease, yet many—especially in low- and middle-income countries—lack strong primary care. We analyze China’s efforts to promote primary care management for insured rural Chinese with chronic disease, analyzing unique panel data for over 70,000 rural Chinese 2011-2015. Our study design uses variation in management intensity generated by administrative and geographic boundaries—regression analyses based on 14 pairs of villages within two kilometers of each other but managed by different townships. Utilizing this plausibly exogenous variation, we find that patients residing in a village within a township with more intensive primary care management, compared to neighbors with less intensive management, had more primary care visits, fewer specialist visits, fewer hospital admissions, and lower inpatient spending. No such effects are evident in a placebo treatment year. Exploring the mechanism, we find that patients with more intensive primary care management exhibited better drug adherence as measured by filled prescriptions. A back-of-the-envelope estimate of welfare suggests that the resource savings from avoided inpatient admissions substantially outweigh the costs of the program.
I18|What is the Rationale for an Insurance Coverage Mandate? Evidence from Workers’ Compensation Insurance|There is ongoing policy debate about whether government insurance coverage mandates are necessary to effectively address market failures in private insurance markets. This paper analyzes the demand for insurance in the absence of a coverage mandate and the potential market failure rationale for coverage mandates in the context of workers' compensation insurance. Workers' compensation is a state-regulated insurance program that provides employees with income and medical benefits in the event of work-related injuries or illnesses. Nearly all states have mandated workers' compensation insurance coverage; the sole exception is Texas. Using administrative data from the unique voluntary Texas workers' compensation insurance system, we estimate the demand for workers' compensation insurance leveraging idiosyncratic regulatory updates to relative premiums across industry-occupation classifications. The difference-in-differences estimates indicate that the demand for workers' compensation coverage is price-sensitive, with a 10% increase in premiums leading to approximately a 3% decline in coverage. Drawing upon these estimates and additional data on claim costs, we analyze the potential rationale for government intervention to increase coverage through subsidies or a mandate. This analysis suggests that classic market failure justifications for government intervention in insurance markets—such as adverse selection, market power, and externalities—may not be compelling justifications for a mandate in this setting.
I18|Are Syringe Exchange Programs Helpful or Harmful? New Evidence in the Wake of the Opioid Epidemic|In light of the recent opioid crisis, many public health entities have called for an expansion in syringe exchange programs (SEPs), which provide access to sterile syringes and facilitate safe needle disposal for injection drug users. This paper investigates the effects of recent SEP openings on HIV diagnoses and drug-related overdoses in the wake of the opioid crisis. I find that SEP openings decrease HIV diagnoses by up to 18.2 percent. However, I present new evidence that SEPs increase rates of opioid-related mortality and hospitalizations, suggesting that needle exchanges alone may be less effective than other interventions at stimulating recovery.
I18|Uninsured by Choice? A Choice Experiment on Long Term Care Insurance|We examine evidence from two unique discrete choice experiments (DCE) on long term care insurance and several of its relevant attributes, and more specifically, choices made by 15,298 individuals in the United States with and without insurance. We study the valuation of the following insurance attributes, namely daily insurance benefit, insurance coverage, the compulsory and voluntary nature of the insurance policy design, alongside the costs (insurance premium) and health requirements This paper investigates respondents' preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for these care insurance's attributes using a random parameter logit model, and assess the heterogeneity of choice responses using demographic, socioeconomic and attitudinal motivations to segment response to insurance choices. We find that an increase in the insurance premium by an additional 100US$ would reduce insurance uptake by 1pp. Insurance policy uptake is higher when it provides benefits for the lifetime (the monthly marginal WTP being $178.64), and voluntary (the monthly marginal WTP increases by an extra $74.71) as opposed to universal, and when it forgoes health checks (the monthly marginal WTP increases by an extra 28US$).
I18|Mortality and Socioeconomic Consequences of Prescription Opioids: Evidence from State Policies|This article presents estimates of the effects of state prescription opioid policies on prescription opioid sales, mortality and socioeconomic outcomes of adults. Our analysis highlights that most prescription opioid use is medically prescribed and that curtailing such use may have adverse effects on wellbeing. We also emphasize that there are significant differences in prescription opioid use and mis-use across demographic groups that may cause state policies to have heterogeneous effects. Results indicate that state policies reduced prescription opioid sales by between 5% and 20% depending on the policy and type of prescription opioid. State “pill mill” laws have been particularly effective at reducing prescription opioid sales. The reductions in prescription opioid sales associated with state policies, however, were not associated with significant changes in mortality or socioeconomic outcomes.
I18|How Well Do Doctors Know Their Patients? Evidence from a Mandatory Access Prescription Drug Monitoring Program|Many opioid control policies target the prescribing behavior of health care providers. In this paper, we study the first comprehensive state-level policy requiring providers to access patients' opioid history before making prescribing decisions. We compare prescribers in Kentucky, which implemented this policy in 2012, to those in a control state, Indiana. Our main difference-in-differences analysis uses the universe of prescriptions filled in the two states to assess how the information provided affected prescribing behavior. As many as forty percent of low-volume opioid prescribers stopped prescribing opioids altogether after the policy was implemented. Among other providers, the major margin of response was to prescribe opioids to approximately sixteen percent fewer patients. While providers disproportionately discontinued treating patients whose opioid histories showed the use of multiple providers, there were also economically-meaningful reductions for patients without multiple providers and single-use acute patients.
I18|Screening and Selection: The Case of Mammograms|Debates over whether and when to recommend screening for a potential disease focus on the causal impact of screening for a typical individual covered by the recommendation, who may differ from the typical individual who responds to the recommendation. We explore this distinction in the context of recommendations that breast cancer screening start at age 40. The raw data suggest that responders to the age 40 recommendation have less cancer than do women who self-select into screening at earlier ages. Combining these patterns with a clinical oncology model allows us to infer that responders to the age 40 recommendation also have less cancer than women who never screen, suggesting that the benefits of recommending early screening are smaller than if responders were representative of covered individuals. For example, we estimate that shifting the recommendation from age 40 to age 45 results in over three times as many deaths if responders were randomly drawn from the population than under the estimated patterns of selection. These results highlight the importance of considering the characteristics of responders when making and designing recommendations.
I18|Impact of Rural and Urban Hospital Closures on Inpatient Mortality|This paper examines the impact of California's hospital closures occurring from 1995-2011 on adjusted inpatient mortality for time-sensitive conditions: sepsis, stroke, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Using a difference- in-difference approach on California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) data, the impact of hospital closures on inpatient mortality is estimated. Outcomes of admissions in hospital service areas (HSAs) with and without closure(s) are compared before and after the closure year. The paper aims to fill gaps in prior work by using a reconciled list of California's hospital closures and by studying differential impacts of rural and urban hospital closures. To our best knowledge, this is also the first paper explicitly studying patient outcomes of California's rural closures. Results suggest that when treatment groups are not differentiated by hospital rurality, closures appear to have no measurable impact. However, estimating differential impacts of rural and urban closures shows that rural closures increase inpatient mortality by 0.46% points (an increase of 5.9%), whereas urban closures have no impact. Results differ across diagnostic conditions; the general effect of closures is to increase mortality for stroke patients by 3.1% and for AMI patients by 4.5%, and decrease mortality for asthma/COPD patients by 8.8%.
I18|External Societal Costs of Antimicrobial Resistance in Humans Attributable to Antimicrobial Use in Livestock|Antimicrobial use in animal agriculture contributes to antimicrobial resistance in humans, which imposes significant health and economic costs on society. These costs are negative externalities. We review the relevant literature and develop a model to quantify the external costs of antimicrobial use in animal agriculture on antimicrobial resistance in humans. Parameters required for this estimate include: 1) the health and economic burden of antimicrobial resistance in humans, 2) the impact of antimicrobial use in animal agriculture on antimicrobial resistance in animals, 3) the fraction of antimicrobial resistance in humans attributable to animal agriculture, and 4) antimicrobial use in animals. We use a well-documented historic case to estimate an externality cost of about $1500 per kilogram of fluoroquinolones administered in US broiler chicken production. Enhanced data collection, particularly on parameters 3) and 4), would be highly useful to quantify more fully the externalities of antimicrobial use in animal agriculture.
I18|New Evidence on the Effects of Mandatory Waiting Periods for Abortion|Beyond a handful of studies examining early-adopting states in the early 1990s, little is known about the causal effects of mandatory waiting periods for abortion. In this study we evaluate the effects of a Tennessee law enacted in 2015 that requires women to make an additional trip to abortion providers for state-directed counseling at least 48 hours before they can obtain an abortion. Based on our difference-in-differences approach, estimates indicate that the introduction of the mandatory waiting period caused a 62-percent increase in the share of abortions obtained during the second trimester, completely closing the pre-existing gap between Tennessee and the comparison states. Our analysis examining overall abortion rates are suggestive of reductions caused by the waiting period but these estimates are imprecise. To put these estimates into context, our back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that Tennessee's MWP increased the monetary costs of obtaining an abortion by as much as $929 for some women.
I18|Oakland’s Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Tax: Impacts on Prices, Purchases and Consumption by Adults and Children|Several cities in the U.S. have implemented taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in an attempt to improve public health and raise revenue. On July 1, 2017, Oakland California introduced a tax of one cent per ounce on SSBs. In this paper, we estimate the impact of the tax on retail prices, product availability, purchases, and child and adult consumption of taxed beverages in Oakland, as well as of potential substitute beverages. We collected data from Oakland stores and their customers and a matched group of stores in surrounding counties and their customers. We collected information in the months prior to the implementation of the tax and again a year later on: (1) prices, (2) purchase information from customers exiting the stores, and (3) a follow-up household survey of adults and child beverage purchases and consumption. We use a difference-in-differences identification strategy to estimate the impact of the tax on prices, purchases, and consumption of taxed beverages. We find that roughly 60 percent of the tax was passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. There was a slight decrease in the volume of SSBs purchased per shopping trip in Oakland and a small increase in purchases at stores outside of the city, and we find some evidence of increased shopping by Oakland residents at stores outside of the city. We do not find evidence of substantial changes in the overall consumption of SSBs or of added sugars consumed through beverages for either adults or children after the tax.
I18|Primary Care Physician Practice Styles and Patient Care: Evidence from Physician Exits in Medicare|"Primary care physicians (PCPs) provide frontline health care to patients in the U.S.; however, it is unclear how their practice styles affect patient care. In this paper, we estimate the long-lasting effects of PCP practice styles on patient health care utilization by focusing on Medicare patients affected by PCP relocations or retirements, which we refer to as ""exits."" Observing where patients receive care after these exits, we estimate event studies to compare patients who switch to PCPs with different practice style intensities. We find that PCPs have large effects on a range of aggregate utilization measures, including physician and outpatient spending and the number of diagnosed conditions. Moreover, we find that PCPs have large effects on the quality of care that patients receive, and that all of these effects persist for several years. Our results suggest that switching to higher-quality PCPs could significantly affect patients' longer-run health outcomes."
I18|Does Medicare Coverage Improve Cancer Detection and Mortality Outcomes?|Medicare is the largest government insurance program in the United States, providing coverage for over 60 million people in 2018. This paper analyzes the effects of Medicare insurance on health for a group of people in urgent need of medical care – people with cancer. We used a regression discontinuity design to assess impacts of near-universal Medicare insurance at age 65 on cancer detection and outcomes, using population-based cancer registries and vital statistics data. Our analysis focused on the three tumor sites with recommended screening before and after age 65: breast, colorectal, and lung cancer. At age 65, cancer detection increased by 72 per 100,000 population among women and 33 per 100,000 population among men; cancer mortality also decreased by 9 per 100,000 population for women but did not significantly change for men. In a placebo check, we found no comparable changes at age 65 in Canada. This study provides the first evidence to our knowledge that near-universal access to Medicare at age 65 is associated with improvements in population-level cancer mortality, and provides new evidence on the differences in the impact of health insurance by gender.
I18|Superfund Cleanups and Children's Lead Exposure|This study evaluates the effect of EPA’s Superfund cleanup program on children’s lead exposure. We linked two decades of blood lead level (BLL) measurements from children in six states with data on Superfund sites and other lead risk factors. We used quasi-experimental methods to identify the causal effect of proximity to Superfund cleanups on rates of elevated BLL. We estimated a difference-in-difference model comparing the change in elevated BLL of children closer to versus farther from lead-contaminated sites before, during, and after cleanup. We also estimated a triple difference model including children near hazardous sites with minimal to no lead contamination as a comparison group. We used spatial fixed effects and matching to minimize potential bias from unobserved differences between the treatment and comparison groups. Results indicate that Superfund cleanups lowered the risk of elevated BLL for children living within 2 kilometers of lead-contaminated sites 8 to 18 percent.
I18|Early Childhood Lead Exposure and the Persistence of Educational Consequences into Adolescence|There is consensus that early childhood lead exposure causes adverse cognitive and behavioral effects, even at blood lead levels (BLL) below 5 µg/dL. What has not been established is to what extent the effects of childhood lead exposure persist across grades. In this paper, we examine data from 538,493 children living in North Carolina between 2000-2012 with a BLL ≤ 10 µg/dL to estimate the effects of early childhood lead exposure on educational performance from grades 3-8, to determine if effects in lower grades persist as a child progresses through adolescence. We estimate fixed-effects models and use socio-economic and demographic information along with coarsened exact matching techniques to control for confounding effects to identify the causal effect of BLL on test performance. We find that the effects of early childhood exposure to low lead levels caused persistent deficits in educational performance across grades. In each grade (3-8), children with higher blood lead levels had, on average, lower percentile scores in both math and reading than children with lower blood lead levels. In our primary model, we find that children with BLL = 5 µg/dL in early childhood ranked 1.50 – 2.07 (1.94 – 2.43) percentiles lower than children with BLL ≤ 1 µg/dL on math (reading) tests during grades 3-8. As children progressed through school, the average percentile deficit in their test scores remained stable.
I18|The impact of decentralisation on the performance of health care systems: A non-linear relationship|This paper examines the relationship between the degree of administrative decentralisation across levels of government in health care decision-making and health care spending, life expectancy as well as hospital costs. This empirical analysis builds on previous analytical research carried out by the OECD (Lorenzoni, Murtin et al., 2018; Lorenzoni and Marino, 2017), both of which established new methodological tools to analyse health sector performance. The present analysis extends this framework to examine the impact of centralisation versus decentralisation of responsibilities across levels of government, making use of newly collected data on governance and expenditure assignment, as well as non-linear empirical specifications.
I18|Decentralisation and performance measurement systems in health care|Based on an OECD survey, this paper presents quantitative and qualitative data on the decentralisation of health systems, focusing on how they vary according to different institutional characteristics and what types of performance measurement systems are used in the health sector. Decision-making in health care tends to rest largely with the central government, which has considerable power across many aspects of the delivery of health services. However, sub-national governments have more control over decisions regarding the inputs, outputs and monitoring of health care services. The majority of OECD countries tends to rely on centralised performance measurement systems, especially to monitor the performance of hospital providers, focusing more on improving performance rather than reducing service costs. Less likely to be monitored under a specific performance framework are providers of ancillary services, retailers and other providers of medical goods, and providers of preventive care.
I18|Meeting fiscal challenges in Japan’s rapidly ageing society|Japan’s gross government debt of 226% of GDP in 2018 is the highest ever recorded in the OECD area, and places the economy at risk. The government now aims to achieve a primary surplus by FY 2025. Additional fiscal consolidation, based on a detailed plan covering specific spending cuts and tax increases, is necessary to put the government debt ratio on a downward trend in the face of rapid population ageing. This is a very difficult task and a stronger fiscal framework would help keep policy on track to achieve fiscal targets. Controlling social spending requires making better use of healthcare resources, in p art by reducing overinvestment in hospitals and increasing the use of generic drugs. Another priority is ensuring the sustainability of local government spending, in part by reducing costs through the joint provision of local public services and infrastructure across jurisdictions and the development of compact cities in the context of depopulation in many parts of Japan. Increased revenue should come primarily from hikes in the consumption tax rate, which is among the lowest in the OECD. In addition, disincentives to employment in the tax and benefit system should be removed, as sustained economic growth is crucial to ensure fiscal sustainability.This Working Paper relates to the 2019 OECD Economic Survey of Japan (http://www.oecd.org/economy/japan-economic-snapshot/)
I18|Exploring the causal relation between obesity and alcohol use, and educational outcomes|Two of the most important health risk factors for children and young adults are obesity and alcohol use. These risk factors are known to affect health and wellbeing, but may also have an impact on educational outcomes. The objective of this study was to assess a potential causal relationship between obesity or alcohol use, and educational outcomes, in Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Longitudinal data from cohort studies was used to establish temporal precedence. To ensure the absence of alternative explanations, regression models were adjusted for known confounders; instrumental variables were used to address endogeneity caused by reverse causality and potential unobserved confounders; and fixed effects analyses were used to correct for unobserved time-invariant confounders. The results suggest that the presence of obesity during childhood, as well as alcohol consumption during childhood, can have a negative impact on educational performance and future educational attainment.
I18|Health Spending Projections to 2030: New results based on a revised OECD methodology|To gain a better understanding of the financial sustainability of health systems, the OECD has produced a new set of health spending projections up to 2030 for all its member countries. Estimates are produced across a range of policy situations. Policy situations analysed include a “base” scenario – estimates of health spending growth in the absence of major policy changes – and a number of alternative scenarios that model the effect on health spending of policies that increase productivity or contribute to better lifestyles; or conversely, ineffective policies that contribute to additional cost pressures on health systems.
I18|Health systems characteristics: A survey of 21 Latin American and Caribbean countries|In 2018, the Inter-American Development Bank and the OECD launched a survey to collect information on key health systems characteristics in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. This paper presents the information provided by 21 of these countries. It describes country-specific arrangements to organise the population coverage against health risks and the financing of health spending. It depicts the organisation of health care delivery, focusing on the public/private mix of health care provision, provider payment schemes, user choice and competition among providers, as well as the regulation of health care supply and prices. Finally, this document provides information on governance and resource allocation in health systems (decentralisation in decision-making, nature of budget constraints and priority setting).
I18|Corruption, mortality rates, and development:Policies for escaping from the poverty trap|We construct a three-period overlapping generations model in which corrup- tion, mortality and fertility rates, and economic development are determined endogenously. We consider a less developed economy suffering from a high degree of corruption and high mortality and fertility rates in a poverty trap. We focus on two policies: raising public sector wages as a means of reducing corruption and increasing public health spending as a means of improving the mortality rate. Our theoretical analysis shows that implementing both policies simultaneously is essential for less developed economies to escape from the poverty trap and achieve economic development.
I18|Air Quality and Asthma Hospitalization: Evidence of PM2.5 Concentrations in Pennsylvania Counties|According to the World Health Organization, 235 million people around the world currently suffer from asthma, which includes approximately 25 million in the United States. There is substantial epidemiological evidence indicating linkages between outdoor air pollution and asthma symptoms, more specifically between concentrations of particulate matter and asthma. Using county level data for 2001-2014, a spatial panel framework is imposed based upon prevailing wind patterns to investigate the direct and indirect impacts of PM2.5 concentration levels on asthma hospitalization in Pennsylvania. This model controls for population density, precipitation, smoking rate, and population demographic variables. Results show that PM2.5 concentrations as measured at the county level have positive direct and indirect effects on asthma hospitalization. A one-unit increase in PM2.5 in one Pennsylvania county will add, on average $1.29M ($754,656 direct and $539,040 indirect) to total annual asthma hospitalization costs with the state of Pennsylvania. This study highlights the need for realistic and accurate impact analyses of ambient air pollution on asthma that reflects the impacts on neighboring regions as well. In order to capture the spillover effects of health-related impacts from PM2.5 pollution, a wind direction algorithm to identify appropriate neighbors is important.
I18|Air Pollution during Pregnancy and Birth Outcomes in Italy|We investigate the impact of fetal exposure to air pollution on health outcomes at birth in Italy in the 2000s combining information on mother’s residential location from birth certificates with information on PM10 concentrations from air quality monitors. The potential endogeneity deriving from differential pollution exposure is addressed by exploiting as-good-as-random variation in rainfall shocks as an instrumental variable for air pollution concentrations. Our results show that both average levels of PM10 and days above the hazard limit have detrimental effects on birth weight, duration of gestation as well as overall health status at birth. These effects are mainly driven by pollution exposure during the third trimester of pregnancy and further differ in size with respect to the maternal socio-economic status, suggesting that babies born to socially disadvantaged mothers are more vulnerable. Given the non negligible effects of pollution on birth outcomes, further policy efforts are needed to fully protect fetuses from the adverse effects of air pollution and to mitigate the environmental inequality of health at birth.
I18|When Particulate Matter Strikes Cities: Social Disparities and Health Costs of Air Pollution|Socio-economic characteristics can determine large differentials in exposure and vulnerability to air pollution, generating environmental inequality. In this paper we investigate unequal effects of daily particulate matter (PM) concentrations on Italian hospitalizations by exploiting daily episodes of public transportation strikes as an instrumental variable for pollution exposure. We show that hospitalizations resulting from higher pollution are not only more likely to occur, but are also more complex to deal with. Moreover, our predictions show that conditional on PM exposure levels, hospitalization costs follow a strong socio-economic gradient, with the health burden being larger for the young, less educated individuals and migrants from low income countries. These inequality mechanisms imply that the effects of air pollution should be addressed not only by environmental and health actors, but should be coordinated with other sectors, such as education and transport, shaping a common policy approach.
I18|Theoretical Analysis of Heterogeneous Hospital Response to a Per Diem Prospective Payment System|Motivated by the Japanese PPS reform, aimed at curbing high length of stay in Japanese hospitals, we develop a theoretical model to study how hospitals¡¯ ?nancial incentives differ between the two reimbursement systems: a pre-reform fee-for-service (F F S); and a post reform length-of-stay-dependent stepwise decreasing per diem rate (SDR). First, we show that hospitals with shorter (longer) average length of stay under F F S have longer (shorter) average length of stay under SDR. Second, we show that hospitals with longer stay under the F F S reimbursement system are more likely to use planned readmission in order to decrease the length of stay associated with a single admission. Finally, we show that profit-wise, it is hospitals with the shortest pre-reform length of stay who gain from a change to the SDR reimbursement rule. The theoretical predictions of our model closely match empirical evidence from the literature.
I18|An investigation into software requirements for systems supporting task-shifted interventions|Background: There is a considerable shortfall in specialized health professionals worldwide to deliver health services and this shortfall is especially pronounced in low-middle income countries. This has led to the implementation of task-shifted interventions, in which specific tasks are moved away from highly qualified health workers to health workers with less training. The World Health Organisation has published recommendations for such interventions, but guidelines for software and systems supporting such interventions are not included. Objective: The objective of this paper is to formulate a number of software requirements for computer systems supporting task-shifted interventions. As the treatment of mental health problems is generally considered to be a task for highly trained health professionls, it poses interesting case studies for task-shifted interventions. Therefore, we will illustrate the use of the identified software requirements in a mobile system created for a task-shifted depression intervention to be provided to older adults in deprived areas of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Methods: Using a set of recommendations based on the World Health Organisationâ€™s guidance documentation for task-shifted interventions, we identified nine software requirements that aim to support health workers in management and supervision, training, good relationship with other health workers, and community embeddedness of the intervention. These nine software requirements were used to implement a system for the provision of a psychosocial depression intervention with mobile Android interfaces to structure interventions and collect data, and web interfaces for supervision and support of the healthcare workers delivering the intervention. The system was tested in a two-arm pilot study with 33 patients and 11 health workers. Eight of these 11 health workers participated in a â€˜usabilityâ€™ study subsequent to the pilot. Results: Qualitative and quantitative feedback obtained with the System Usability Scale suggest the system was deemed to have a usability of between â€˜OKâ€™ and â€˜Goodâ€™. Nevertheless, some participantsâ€™ responses indicate they felt they needed technical assistance to use the system. This was reinforced by answers obtained with â€˜Perceived Usefulnessâ€™ and â€˜Ease of Useâ€™ questionnaires, which indicated some users felt they had issues around correct use of the system and perceived ability to becoming skilful at using the system. Conclusions: Overall, these high-level requirements adequately captured the functionality required to enable the health workers to provide the intervention successfully. Nevertheless, the analysis of results indicated some improvements are required for the system to be useable in a task-shifted intervention. The most important of these are better access to a training environment, access for supervisors to meta-data such as duration of sessions or exercises to identify issues, and a more robust and human-error proof approach to availability of patient data on the mobile devices used during the intervention.
I18|Feasibility of a cluster randomized controlled trial of a psychosocial intervention to improve late life depression in socioeconomically deprived areas of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil (PROACTIVE)|Background: Depression is a common and recurrent condition among older adults and is associated with poor quality of life and increased health care utilization and costs. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of delivering a psychosocial intervention targeting depression, and to develop the procedures to conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) among older adults registered with primary care clinics in poor neighbourhoods of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Methods: We conducted a pilot study of a two-arm cluster RCT using a protocol developed previously (see accompanying paper). Two primary care clinics adhering to the Family Health Strategy were allocated to either the intervention or the control arm. In the control arm, patients received enhanced usual care consisting of staff training for improved recognition and management of depression. In the intervention arm, alongside the enhanced usual care, patients received a 17-week psychosocial intervention delivered by health workers assisted with an application installed in a tablet. Results: We randomly selected 579 of 2020 older adults registered in the intervention clinic to participate in the study. Among these individuals, 353 were assessed for depression and 40 (11.0%) scored at least 10 on the PHQ-9 and were therefore invited to participate. The consent rate was 33/40 (82%) with a resulting yield of 33/579 (5.7%). In the control arm, we randomly selected 320 older adults among 1482 registered in the clinic, 223 were assessed for depression and 28 (12.6%) scored 10 or above on the PHQ-9. The consent rate was 25/28 (89%), with a resulting yield of 25/320 (7.8%). Of the 33 who consented in the intervention arm, 19 (59.4%) completed all sessions. The mean PHQ-9 at follow-up (approximately 30 weeks after inclusion) was 12.3 (SD=3.7) and 3.8 (SD=3.9) in the control and intervention arms respectively. Follow-up rates were 92% and 94% in control and intervention arms, respectively. Conclusions: Identification and engagement of clinics, random selection and recruitment of individuals, baseline and follow-up assessment all proved to be feasible in primary care clinics in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Results support the development of a definitive cluster RCT.
I18|Economic Burden of Diabetes mellitus in Brazil|Background: Global economic burden of Diabetes mellitus will reach US$ 745 billion in 2030. The growing prevalence of the disease, mainly type 2, is related to the population aging, nutritional transition, and economic growth. Brazil is the fourth country in number of patients with diabetes and also follows the global trends, with continuous increase in prevalence. In this sense, a complete assessment of the economic burden of the disease in the country, considering all direct and indirect costs, is needed. Methods: We use a cost-of-illness approach to calculate total economic burden of DM. We use recent and complete data referring to 2016. Findings: We estimate the Brazilian economic burden of US$ 2.15 billion in 2016, of which 70.6% is indirect costs related to premature deaths, absenteeism, and early retirement. Interpretation: Our results are in accordance with the literature, that shows that indirect costs are more relevant to low- and middle-income countries due to weak health services and therefore higher mortality rates from chronic diseases. Funding: This study was supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies through a sub-award agreement 5104695 between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Center for Epidemiological Studies in Nutrition and Health.
I18|Effects of a 20% price increase of sugar-sweetened beverages on consumption and welfare in Brazil|Background: The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) is associated with increased risk of obesity, diabetes and heart disease. In 2016, the World Health Organization recommended fiscal policies aiming at increasing SSB prices by at least 20% to reduce its consumption and the occurrence of these outcomes. Objective: To estimate the effects of a 20% price increase of SSB on consumption and welfare outcomes in Brazil. Design: Data from the 2008-09 National Household Budget Survey (HBS) were used to estimate price and income elasticities of consumption. We propose a two-step procedure. First, we estimate the unconditional price elasticities of food and non-food goods. Second, using a QUAIDS model, we build a system of demand equations for food groups. Welfare effects were estimated based on the change on utility and on the excess burden of the simulated tax policy. Results: We find that a 20% price increase in SSB price would lead to a 16.6% reduction on its consumption. The demand for unhealthy foods (SSB, processed and ultra-processed foods) is expected to decrease by 6.2%. The tax could generate US$ 61.3 million per month in government revenues, and the estimated short-term inefficiencies, or dead-weight losses are US$ 6 million per month. Average households would need to receive US$ 0.29 per week to become welfare neutral after the tax is implemented. Conclusions: Due to the potential high benefits of the policy, the proposed 20% tax might be cost-beneficial in Brazil.
I18|The strange case of appropriate C-sections:DRG-tariff regulation, hospital ownership, and market concentration|The aim of this paper is to discuss how different types of hospitals respond to large financial incentives for vaginal deliveries and to financial disincentives for C-sections. We focus on a public health care system based on the quasiâ€“market model. We theoretically and empirically evaluate a government policy equalizing the tariff for C-section and vaginal deliveries at a level such that hospitals face monetary disincentives for C-section and monetary incentives for vaginal deliveries. We first theoretically show that hospital ownership matters insofar different types of hospitals are characterized by different ethical preferences; but ownership interacts with market concentration. We then consider the case-study of Lombardy in Italy. We exploit spatial variation in the presence of for-profit, not-for-profit and public hospitals and in the market concentration at the local level to evaluate the relationship between ownership and the probability of C-section. Our empirical results strongly suggest that competitive pressures from alternative providers tend to homogenize behaviors. However, in local monopolies, we do observe less C-section from private for-profit hospitals than from public and private non-profit hospitals especially when they are medically appropriate.
I18|Vaccine Hesitancy and Fake News: Quasi-experimental Evidence from Italy|The spread of fake news and misinformation on social media is blamed to be one of the main causes of vaccine hesitancy, one of the ten threats to global health according to World Health Organization. This paper studies the effect of diffusion of fake news on immunization rates in Italy by exploiting a quasi-experiment occurred in 2012, when the Court of Rimini officially recognized a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism and awarded injury compensation. To this end, we exploit virality of fake news following the 2012 Italian Courtâ€™s ruling along with the intensity in the exposure to non-traditional media driven by regional infrastructural differences in Internet broadband coverage. Using a Difference-in-Difference (DiD) regression on regional panel data, we show that the spread of fake news caused a drop in children immunization rates for all types of vaccines.
I18|Do-It-Yourself medicine? The impact of light cannabis liberalization on prescription drugs|This paper provides the first analysis of â€œDo-it-Yourself Medicineâ€ concerning marijuana consumption by studying the effects of the unintended liberalization of light cannabis that took place in Italy in 2016 on prescription drugs sales. Using a unique and high-frequency dataset on monthly sales of drugs and the location of light cannabis retailers and adopting a staggered DiD research design, we find that the local market accessibility of light cannabis led to a reduction in dispensed packets of opioids, anxiolytics, sedatives, anti-migraines, antiepileptics, anti-depressives and anti-psychotics. This calls for an effective regulation of the market and a proper evaluation of the use of light cannabis for medical purposes.
I18|Explaining the causal effect of adherence to medication on cholesterol through the marginal patient|This paper investigates the relation between adherence to prescribed medication and reduction of cholesterol in Italy, by taking into account the possible sorting of patients into treatment and the heterogeneity of the effect. As predicted by a theoretical model, I find that patients who benefit most from medication are more likely to adhere to prescribed regime than those who benefit least. These results are used to study the effects of three hypothetical policies that aim at increasing the share of patients adherent to prescribed medication: one is directed towards patients, one towards physicians, and one is a policy mix. For each policy, the observable characteristics of patients switched into treatment are described. Although the most effective policy is directed towards patients, the policies differ substantially with respect to the population affected. Therefore, a less effective policy that targets best the desired population may be preferred to the most effective policy. Back of the envelope calculations suggest that even the most expensive policy would be cost-effective.
I18|Regression Discontinuity with Integer Running Variable and Non-Integer Cutoff: Dental Care Program Effect on Expenditure|In regression discontinuity (RD), the treatment is determined by a continuous running variable G crossing a known cutoff c or not. However, often G is observed only as a rounded-down integer S (e.g., birth year observed instead of birth date), and c is not an integer. In this case, the â€œcutoff sampleâ€ (the observations with the same S value around c) cannot be used, because it is not clear whether their G actually crossed c or not. This paper shows that if the distribution of the measurement error e â‰¡ G âˆ’ S is specified, then despite non-integer c, the cutoff sample can be used fruitfully in estimating the treatment effect and in testing for the distributional assumption on e. Particularly, there are good reasons to believe that e is uniform on [0,1], not least because e is close to a popular way how pseudo uniform random numbers are generated in simulation studies. Also, whereas two-step estimation has been proposed in the RD literature, we show that the treatment effect can be estimated with single-step OLS/IVE as in typical RD with G observed. A simulation study and an empirical analysis for effects of a dental care support program on dental expenditure are provided.
I18|Were there long-term economic effects of exposure to Polio Vaccination?: An analysis of migrants to Sweden 1946-2003|Recent research showed that exposure to the vaccine against polio in early life had no longterm economic benefits among native Swedes. However, whether this result holds for individuals from other countries remains unexplored. This study explores the relationship between exposure to the vaccine and later-life outcomes, but focuses on individuals who migrated to Sweden (birth cohorts 1946-1971), who constitute a diverse sample in terms of national origin. Using a differences-in-differences approach and register data from the Swedish Longitudinal Immigrant Database, this study explores if being exposed to the vaccine against polio in the year of birth in the country of origin has any impact on adult income, educational achievement, nor days or number of hospitalizations. The results are in line with the previous research in showing that there are no statistically significant effects on adult income, education, or health from exposure to the vaccine against polio, regardless of national origin. Furthermore, no scarring effects of exposure to polio epidemics were found on any of the outcomes, reinforcing the hypothesis that polio did not scar individuals in the same way as other contemporary epidemic diseases did, and that the lack of scarring could explain the absence of long-term impact from vaccine exposure.
I18|Reference pricing and parallel imports: Evidence from Germany|I study the effect of reference pricing on competition by parallel imports, in particular the market share of parallel imports and the number of parallel traders. First, I analyze the effect of reference pricing on competition by parallel imports in a vertical differentiation model with a locally sourced version and a parallel import offered by n identical parallel traders. Second, I explore the effect of reference pricing on competition by parallel imports using a dataset with prescription drugs with competition from parallel imports. Both model and estimation results suggest that the introduction of reference pricing inreases the market share of the parallel import and the number of parallel traders, while a decrease in the reference price decreases the market share of the parallel import and the number of parallel traders.
I18|Parallel imports and manufacturer rebates: Evidence from Germany|In this paper, I study the effect of a change in the mandatory manufacturer rebate on wholesale prices for pharmaceuticals on competition by parallel imports. First, I analyze the effect of a manufacturer rebate on competition by parallel imports in a two-country model. An increase in the manufacturer rebate increases the market share of parallel imports. Second, I exploit a policy reform in Germany in 2010 that increased the manufacturer rebate by 10 percentage points. Using a data set with prescription drugs with competition from parallel imports, I estimate the effect of the change in the manufacturer rebate on competition by parallel imports. Estimation results suggest that an increase in the manufacturer rebate has increased the market share of parallel imports.
I18|Extra costs of integrity: Pharmacy markups and generic substitution in Finland|I evaluate how the probability of substitution of a prescribed drug in a pharmacy depends on the pharmacists' profits and patients' out of pocket costs. I use Finnish population-wide data covering all prescriptions of three popular antidepressants. I find that one euro increase in the total markup difference between the prescribed drug and its cheapest available substitute is associated with 1.7 percentage points decrease in the probability of substitution. This result is driven by brand-name drugs. An increase in the patients' out of pocket cost differential yields a 0.6 percentage points increase in the probability of accepting the substitution. My findings offer novel evidence that pharmacists' incentives are instrumental for prescription drug cost savings and overall cost effectiveness of the health care system.
I18|Employment of Persons with Disabilities as Competitive Advantage: An Analysis of the Competitive Implications|People with disabilities (PWD) represent a largely untapped market and customer segment worldwide, as well as an enormous untapped workforce potential. Although there are indications in the literature that the employment of PWD can bring many advantages for companies, the effects on companies and the resulting competitive advantages have rarely been empirically investigated. This article aims to analyze the competitive implications of the employment of PWD, as part of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy. The research is based on a literature review. The selected literature was evaluated regarding the competitive advantage using the value-rarityimitability-organisation (VRIO) framework. The results show that the employment of PWD is valuable, rare, and costly to imitate. If a company succeeds in using this resource effectively, this leads to a sustainable competitive advantage. An established corporate culture is a mandatory prerequisite to integrate PWD successfully. This prerequisite represents an imitation barrier. The promotion of the employment of PWD gives access to a new pool of applicants and can contribute to mitigating or preventing a future shortage of skilled workers. The employment of PWD does not wear off as a human resource. The concept can be transferred to different technologies, products, and markets. The sensitivity gained about people with disabilities can open new markets and customer segments. Therefore, PWD's employment as part of the value creation strategy can make a long-term contribution to the company's success and represent a sustainable competitive advantage.
I18|Social Inclusion Drives Business Sales: A Literature Review on the Case of the Employment of Persons With Disabilities|So far companies seem to ignore the potential of persons with disabilities (PWD) as customers and as employees. Although there is some empirical evidence that PWD employment can bring many benefits to companies and that social inclusion can attract a lasting customer base. The employment of PWD and social inclusion, generally, are important social commitments of companies and should represent a central element of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy. CSR is also an interesting marketing instrument for differentiation. However, customers are more aware of productrelated CSR activities than philanthropy or sustainable business initiatives. The aim of this article is to analyze how the promotion of social inclusion, through the example of the employment of PWD, could impact directly or indirectly on business sales. The research is based on a literature review. The selected literature was evaluated regarding the impact on business sales using a deductive content analysis. The results show that social inclusion, as a CSR activity, contributes to increased sales. This is particularly important when it comes to providing services and direct customer contact. Through social inclusion, the company reflects the diversity of existing and potential customers. In this way, new customers can be acquired, customer loyalty promoted or strengthened, and, as a result, sales increased. CSR activities that are used as a marketing tool for differentiation and do not pursue the sole goal of strengthening the company's reputation can create a competitive advantage and thus secure market share, open-up new market segments and permanently increase sales.
I18|Works Councils and Workplace Health Promotion in Germany|From a theoretical viewpoint, there can be market failures resulting in an underprovision of occupational health and safety. Works councils may help mitigate these failures. Using establishment data from Germany, our empirical analysis confirms that the incidence of a works council is significantly associated with an increased likelihood that the establishment provides more workplace health promotion than required by law. This result also holds in a recursive bivariate probit regression accounting for the possible endogeneity of works council incidence. Furthermore, analyzing potentially moderating factors such as collective bargaining coverage, industry, type of ownership, multi-establishment status and product market competition, we find a positive association between works councils and workplace health promotion for the various types of establishments examined. Finally, we go beyond the mere incidence of workplace health promotion and show that works councils are positively associated with a series of different measures of workplace health promotion.
I18|Maternal Health, Children Education and Women Empowerment: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from India|The empirical evidence on the inter-generational effects of maternal health interventions is inconclusive, particularly the impact on cognitive ability of children. In this paper, we study one such popular policy from India, viz, the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) which is a agship health and safe motherhood program. We exploit plausible exogenous variation in exposure to the program generated by the institutional features of the implementation, in a cross-sectional difference-in-difference framework to find evidence of reduction in academic test scores of children whose parents remained unexposed to the policy intervention. We also find that such children spend less time on homework during the week, were less likely to attend and enjoy school. We also find negative effects on women empowerment measures for the unexposed women. The results suggest that the JSY led to increase in women empowerment and improved cognitive outcomes for children.
I18|Birth Weight and Cognitive Development during Childhood: Evidence from India|Health at birth is an important indicator of human capital development over the life course. This paper uses longitudinal data from the Young Lives survey and employs instrumental variable regression models to estimate the effect of birth weight on cognitive development during childhood in India. We find that a 10 percent increase in birth weight increases cognitive test score by 8.1 percent or 0.11 standard deviations at ages 5-8 years. Low birth weight infants experienced a lower test score compared with normal birth weight infants. The positive effect of birth weight on a cognitive test score is larger for boys, children from rural or poor households, and those with less-educated mothers. Our findings suggest that health policies designed to improve birth weight could improve human capital in resource-poor settings.
I18|The Urgent Need for an Economics of “Hategoatism”|The word “scapegoat” is defined as “a person made to bear the blame for others,” and similarly, “scapegoatism” refers to “the act or practice of assigning blame or failure to another, as to deflect attention or responsibility away from oneself” (Collins English Dictionary and Dictionary.com, respectively.) While these definitions do not mention economics specifically, in most cases the blame on the scapegoat is economic in nature. Scapegoatism also provides a convenient, though extremely inferior, substitute for valid analyses of economic problems. Scapegoatism, however, has a partner, dehumanization, which is the process of demonizing certain people as less than human and unworthy of humane treatment. Scapegoatism is not only accompanied by dehumanization, but it is often motivated by it. Thus, “scapegoatism” is a euphemism and it is understudied as a result, because there is no single term of art that combines scapegoatism and dehumanization. This paper offers a solution to this semantic dilemma by proposing the new term, “HATEGOATISM,” for the simultaneous existence of scapegoatism and dehumanization. Only one subfield of economics regularly embraces hategoatism, which is Libertarianism (where the “HATEGOAT” is government workers). Economists must lead by example by combating hategoatism, and that requires cleaning their own house first.
I18|‘More Children, More Happiness?’: New Evidence from Elderly Parents in China|In this paper, we test the conventional wisdom in developing countries of ‘more children, more happiness’ by exploiting the cohort and provincial variations of elderly parents exposed to the one-child policy in China. Using nationally representative survey data from the 2015 China Health and Retirement Longitude Survey, the results from both the ordinary least square and two-stage least square methods find that more children can enhance elderly parents’ subjective well-being (SWB) measured with either life satisfaction or depression mood. The effect is channelled by raising their satisfaction with children and receiving in-kind transfers from children. The heterogeneity analysis also shows that the effect of children on parents’ life satisfaction is heterogenous to sex composition, first-birth gender, and parents' age. Our study provides new causal evidence of the impact of fertility on elderly parents’ SWB from a developing economy.
I18|Lösung Bürgerversicherung?|Die Fraktion Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen fordert die Einführung einer Pflege-Bürgerversicherung, um den demografischen Wandel zu bewältigen und Leistungsverbesserungen umzusetzen. Die Fraktion DIE Linke möchte die private Pflegeversicherung ebenfalls in die soziale Pflegeversicherung überführen. Allerdings liefert die vorgeschlagene Bürgerversicherung kein befriedigendes Ergebnis, sollen die Lasten der Bevölkerungsalterung besser verteilt werden. Sie stellt diesbezüglich im Gegenteil einen Schritt in die entgegengesetzte Richtung dar: Zusätzlich begünstigt werden die heutigen Generationen, zusätzlich belastet hingegen die künftig Erwerbstätigen. Hinsichtlich der intragenerativen Umverteilung beschreibt die Bürgerversicherung zwar eine Verbesserung zum Status quo - befriedigend lösen kann sie sie aber auch nicht.
I18|The introduction of social pensions and elderly mortality: Evidence 1870-1939|The strong association between income and mortality raises the question whether more generous social security systems could improve poor people's health outcomes. Thus, in this paper, I analyze whether a major social security innovation, the introduction of social pensions targeted at poor elderly people in the late 19th-early 20th century, has reduced mortality rates of senior citizens. Therefore, I use a cross-country dataset spanning from 1870 to 1939 consisting of 13 countries of which 9 eventually implemented social pensions before World War II. Applying a difference-in-difference-in-difference as well as a regression discontinuity design, I find no evidence for a decline in elderly mortality due to the introduction of social pensions. Based on aggregate census data, I argue that social pensions have reduced elderly labor supply. The reduction is much smaller than social pension recipiency rates, though. These findings suggest that social pensions have raised elderly incomes which, however, did not translate into lower mortality.
I18|Long-run consequences of informal elderly care and implications of public long-term care insurance|In this paper, I estimate a dynamic structural model of labor supply, retirement, and informal care supply, incorporating labor market frictions and the German tax and benefit system. I find that informal elderly care has adverse and persistent effects on labor market outcomes and therefore negatively affects lifetime earnings, future pension benefits, and individuals'well-being. These consequences of caregiving are heterogeneous and depend on age, previous earnings, and institutional regulations. Policy simulations suggest that, even though fiscally costly, public long-term care insurance can offset the personal costs of caregiving to a large extent - in particular for low-income individuals.
I18|Survival of the weakest? Culling evidence from the 1918 flu pandemic|When a negative shock aﬀects a cohort in utero, two things may happen: ﬁrst, the population suffers detrimental consequences in later life; and second, some will die as a consequence of the shock, either in utero or early in life. The latter effect, often referred to as culling, may induce a bias in estimates of later life outcomes. When the health shock disproportionately affects a positively selected subpopulation, the long-term effects are overestimated. The 1918 ﬂu pandemic was plausibly more harmful to mothers of high socioeconomic status, as a suppressed immune system in mothers of low socioeconomic status may have been protective against the most severe consequences of infection. Using historical birth records from the city of Bern, Switzerland, we assess this concern empirically and document that a careful consideration of culling is paramount for the evaluation of the 1918 ﬂu pandemic and other fetal health shocks.
I18|Understanding Access Barriers to Public Services: Lessons from a Randomized Domestic Violence Intervention|We study the effect of reducing barriers to accessing non-police services on the demand for police services in cases of police-reported domestic violence. Variation comes from a large randomized controlled trial designed to assist victims in accessing non-police services and we link information from local and national police administrative records and a survey of victims to form a unique dataset for the evaluation. The intervention led to a 18% decrease in the demand for police services, as measured by the provision of a statement by victims. Despite a strong correlation between statements and criminal sanctions against perpetrators, we do not find a corresponding effect of the intervention on perpetrator arrest, charges, or sentencing. This suggests that treated victims who do not provide a statement do so because their potential statement was relatively less effective for pursuing criminal sanctions. Consistent with this result, we find treatment group statements are significantly less likely to be withdrawn than are control group statements.
I18|Attitudes Towards Public Health Spending: The Case of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom|The funding of the NHS in the UK is in perennial crisis. In times of austerity it is difficult to advocate extra health spending from tax revenue. Our central questions are: how much extra do people think should be spent on the NHS; how much extra tax might they be willing to pay; or to what extent would they like to see public money redistributed away from other public services towards the NHS? We answer these questions using a large survey of the UK general public. On average the answers to these questions are $279, $176 and $33 per person, per year, respectively. We examine people's appetite for other measures to increase spending on patients and find that their spending preferences are somewhat related to their own health but strongly related to their age, gender, religious beliefs, political sentiments, and views on the structure of the NHS.
I18|Cigarette Prices and Driving Fatalities Among Youths|Deaths from motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of unintentional deaths in the United States. This paper investigates the effect of increases in cigarette taxes and prices following the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) on non-alcohol and alcohol-related motor vehicle fatalities among youths. I find that increases in cigarette taxes and prices are associated with a reduction in non-alcohol related accidents between 1998 and 2006 among 16-to-20 year olds.
I18|The Effect of Prenatal Exposure to Radiation on Birth Outcomes: Exploiting a Natural Experiment in Taiwan|We estimate the effect of prenatal exposure to radiation on infant health. By exploiting the 1983 Taiwanese radiation-contaminated buildings (RCBs) accident as a natural experiment, we compare birth outcomes between siblings and cousins exposed to different radiation levels. Given the 1983 accident was unanticipated and exposed cohorts were unaware of the risk until 1992, our design isolates the effect of radiation exposure during pregnancy from other effects. We provide the first evidence that prenatal exposure to a continuous low-level dose of radiation significantly reduces gestational length and increases the probabilities of prematurity and low birth weight.
I18|Valuing mortality risk in China: Comparing stated-preference estimates from 2005 and 2016|Abstract We estimate the marginal rate of substitution of income for reduction in current annual mortality risk (the “value per statistical life” or VSL) using stated-preference surveys administered to independent samples of the general population of Chengdu, China in 2005 and 2016. We evaluate the quality of estimates by the theoretical criteria that willingness to pay (WTP) for risk reduction should be strictly positive and nearly proportional to the magnitude of the risk reduction (evaluated by comparing answers between respondents) and test the effect of excluding respondents whose answers violate these criteria. For subsamples of respondents that satisfy the criteria, point estimates of the sensitivity of WTP to risk reduction are consistent with theory and yield estimates of VSL that are two to three times larger than estimated using the full samples. Between 2005 and 2016, estimated VSL increased sharply, from about 22,000 USD in 2005 to 550,000 USD in 2016. Income also increased substantially over this period. Attributing the change in VSL solely to the change in real income implies an income elasticity of about 3.0. Our results suggest that estimates of VSL from stated-preference studies in which WTP is not close to proportionate to the stated risk reduction may be biased downward by a factor of two or more, and that VSL is likely to grow rapidly in a population with strong economic growth, which implies that environmental-health, safety, and other policies should become increasingly protective.
I18|Welfare Impacts of Genetic Testing in Health Insurance Markets: Will Cross-Subsidies Survive?|Personalized medicine is still in its infancy, with costly genetic tests providing little actionable information in terms of efficient prevention decisions. As a consequence, few people undertake these tests currently, and health insurance contracts pool all agents irrespective of their genetic background. Cheaper and especially more informative tests will induce more people to undertake these tests and will impact not only the pricing but also the type of health insurance contracts. We develop a setting with endogenous prevention decisions and we study which contract type (pooling or separating) emerges at equilibrium as a function of the proportion of agents undertaking the genetic test as well as of the informativeness of this test. Starting from the current low take-up rate generating at equilibrium a pooling contract with no prevention effort, we obtain that an increase in the take-up rate has first an ambiguous impact on welfare, and then unambiguously decreases welfare as one moves from a pooling to a separating equilibrium. It is only once the take-up rate is large enough that the equilibrium is separating that any further increase in take-up rate increases aggregate welfare, by a composition effect. However, a better pooling contract in which policyholders undertake preventive actions (and lower their health risk) can also be attained if the informativeness of the genetic tests increases sufficiently.
