Q12|Production Risk and Farm Technology Adoption in Rain-Fed, Semi-Arid Lands of Kenya|This study provides empirical evidence on the effects of production risk on farm technology adoption among small holder farmers using plot-level data collected from two semi-arid districts in Kenya, Machakos, and Taita Taveta. We employed a two-stage approach to estimate a production function, and computed the mean and the production risk factors (both variance and skewness) from a production function using Antle’s (1983, 1987) moment-based approach. We then used these moment estimates, together with other household and plot-level characteristics in a pseudo-fixed effect probit model to determine the effects of production risk and farm and household-level variables on households’ decisions to adopt different kinds of farm technologies. In our estimations, by means of Mundlak’s approach (1978), we controlled for unobserved heterogeneities that could potentially be correlated to some of the observed explanatory variables and otherwise bias our estimates. We also addressed the potential endogeneity issues in our estimation using a two-stage IV estimation procedure. Our results showed that, among others, yield variability and the risk of crop failures indeed affect technology adoption decisions in low-income, rain-fed agriculture. But, the direction and magnitude of effects depend on the farm technology under consideration. The results explain why poor farm households in rain-fed and risky production environments are reluctant to adopt new farm technologies with potential production gain because, at the same time, they involve enormous down-side risks. This result underscores the fact that productivity gains are necessary, but not sufficient, conditions to attract farmers to adopt new technologies and agricultural innovations. Risk implications matter. Technology- and location-specific production-risk coping strategies need to be designed to successfully upscale profitable farm technologies across poor farm households in low income countries.
Q12|Climate and Weather Impacts on Agriculture: The Case of Brazil|The worldâ€™s population will rise exponentially in the coming decades, increasing the demand for food and challenging the agricultural sector to ensure food security. Due to the importance of climate conditions for agriculture, this article analyzed two different hypotheses regarding climate impacts on agricultural markets in Brazil. First, farmers only observe the average climate conditions of their region when deciding the type and amount of crop or animal to grow or raise. Second, weather diversions from normal climate conditions cause farmers to deviate from optimal profits. Neither hypothesis was rejected by the data. The 2006 estimated loss from rainfall anomalies was 12.8 billion dollars (in 2014 values).
Q12|Drivers of farmers’ willingness to adopt extensive farming practices in a globally important bird area|Agri-environmental schemes have become an integral tool of land use management policies in ecologically valuable river valleys, that are commonly recognized as very important bird habitats. When high adoption of extensive agricultural practices is not only a political goal, but also a necessary condition for conservation of vulnerable ecosystems, understanding of farmers’ preferences is utterly important. Therefore, we use the case of Biebrza Marshes – a wetland complex and one of the largest wildlife refuges in Europe, which is located in northeastern Poland – and employ stated preference methods to investigate farmers’ preferences for adopting several agricultural practices, such as precision fertilization, crop diversification, catch crops, peatland protection, extensive use of meadows, and the reduction of livestock stocking density. Farmers’ willingness to participate in selected practices is explained using farms’ and farmers’ characteristics, subjectively and objectively measured farmers’ environmental knowledge, as well as by experimentally controlled information treatments about environmental benefits of agri-environmental contracts. The results provide new insights into the sources of farmers’ preference heterogeneity and show how different motivations relate to participation in agri-environmental schemes. Based on the results and consultations with local stakeholders, we make recommendations for a more efficient design and targeting of land use management instruments, including future agri-environmental schemes.
Q12|Effects of information and seedling provision on tree planting and survival in smallholder oil palm plantations|Oil palm expansion in Indonesia is associated with a reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem services, as well as livelihood improvements for smallholder farmers. While this dichotomy highlights the importance of sustainable management options, empirical evidence on which policies are effective in stimulating biodiversity-friendly plantation management is relatively scarce. This paper addresses this gap by presenting results from a randomized controlled trial implemented in Jambi province, Sumatra, in 2016. We focus on native tree planting in oil palm plantations as one sustainable management option. To test whether information and input provision affect the number of trees planted by smallholders two treatments were designed: the first provided information about tree planting in oil palm, while the second combined information and seedling delivery. We model adoption in a double-hurdle framework where farmers first decide whether to adopt or not and then how many trees they plant per hectare. Our results suggest that both interventions are effective in stimulating tree planting in oil palm. Seedling provision in combination with information leads to a higher probability of adoption, but farmers plant on average relatively few trees per hectare. In contrast, in the informational treatment, few farmers adopt, but they plant more trees per hectare than farmers who received seedlings. Furthermore, we observe that the survival rate of trees planted is lower for farmers who received seedlings in comparison to farmers who only received information. Since we cannot find evidence for farmer and plot selection effects, it is likely that species choice and seedling quality are the underlying drivers of this difference.
Q12|Limit Pricing Oligopoly Market: Evidence from Tamilnadu Politics|Limit pricing oligopoly market is a hypothetical market explained with various hypotheses in the literature which has limited scope for the real world economic evidence and its application which leads the impact of the operation of such market is mostly unknown among the policymakers and academics. The available literature evidences are mostly neglected to explore the scope of such markets conditions and failed to direct appropriate policies. In India among most of the national level parties and in the states levels there are two only have been surviving over the long periods. This trigger the intuition to inquire into answer the questions a) why the political market is appears to be an oligopolistic market? b) How it maintain the limit pricing policy to deter the entry of new ? c) How the share the market? d) Are they collusive oligopolistic or non collusive? e) Are they price leadership oligopolist or not? f) How could they operate in the long run while some of them closed it even within the short run? Since there are very limited attempts only are available to answers this question. This calls for an enquiry by incorporating the micro economics theory with the political system. This paper is attempted to fill this gap in research.
Q12|Wirtschaftlichkeit der Alternativen zur betäubungslosen Ferkelkastration - Aktualisierung und Erweiterung der betriebswirtschaftlichen Berechnungen|Das Verbot der betäubungslosen Kastration von Ferkeln sollte am 01.01.2019 in Kraft treten. Am 29. November 2019 verlängerte der Deutsche Bundestag diese Frist um zwei Jahre, weil Politik und Wirtschaft nicht in der Lage waren, sich auf eine oder mehrere der verfügbaren Alternativen einzulassen. Die Gesetzesänderung bedeutet für die schweinehaltenden Betriebe in Deutschland eine Umstellung ihrer bisherigen Praxis. Als Strategien werden die Jungebermast, die Impfung gegen Ebergeruch (die sogenannte Immunokastration), die Kastration unter Anwendung verschiedener Vollnarkoseverfahren und die Lokalanästhesie diskutiert. Zielsetzung dieser Studie ist es, aufbauend auf dem Working Paper 64 (Verhaagh & Deblitz, 2016) eine aktualisierte Analyse der betriebswirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen dieser alternativen Verfahren und einen Vergleich der Wirtschaftlichkeit zu erstellen. Im ersten Schritt wird eine Referenzsituation (Baseline) mit der derzeit praxisüblichen betäubungslosen Kastration männlicher Ferkel spezifiziert. Hierfür wurden Daten von 11 typischen Betrieben mit Schweinehaltung in den wichtigsten Regionen in Deutschland sowie mit unterschiedlichen Tierzahlen und Produktionsrichtungen (spezialisierte Ferkelproduktion bzw. Schweinemast, geschlossenes System) verwendet. Anschließend werden die Alternativen der derzeitigen Praxis und ihre Auswirkungen auf die Leistungsdaten sowie die Kosten und ggf. Erlöse definiert. Die Baseline und die Alternativen werden als Vollkostenrechnungen ausgewertet, weil neben den Direktkosten auch Investitionen und Gemeinkosten betroffen sind. Variationsrechnungen zu Preisen, Leistungsdaten und Anwendungsverfahren ergänzen die Analyse. Die Kosten der Ebermast mit Impfung (Immunokastration) werden durch die höhere Leistung der Tiere und eine bessere Futterverwertung kompensiert. Die Ebermast - also ein Verzicht auf Kastrationsmaßnahmen - schneidet aufgrund der geringeren Bezahlung durch die deutsche Schlachtindustrie (Eberpreismaske) etwas schlechter ab. Bei beiden Verfahren bestehen außerdem regionale Unterschiede. Die Auswirkungen der chirurgischen Verfahren sind hinsichtlich ihrer Ergebnisse zwischen den einzelnen Produktionsrichtungen und Regionen in Deutschland homogener: Unter den beiden Verfahren der Vollnarkose ist die Injektionsnarkose das teuerste der untersuchten Verfahren, gefolgt von der Inhalationsnarkose mit Isofluran. Die auch als 'vierter Weg' bekannte Lokalanästhesie (Betäubung der Hoden bei der Kastration) ist hingegen deutlich kostengünstiger. Ein wichtiger Grund für die höheren Kosten der Betäubungsverfahren ist die Tatsache, dass diese beim jetzigen Stand nur durch Tierärzte durchgeführt werden dürfen. Variationsrechnungen zeigen, dass die Kosten für diese Verfahren unter der Annahme sinken, dass die Landwirte diese selbst durchführen dürfen. Eine entsprechende Durchführungsverordnung für die Isoflurannarkose befindet sich in Vorbereitung.
Q12|Farm performance and investment decisions: evidence from the French (Brittany) dairy sector|The objective of this paper is to investigate the role of farm performance in farmers' investment decisions with a theoretical model accounting for adjustment costs and performance. The model is estimated on a balanced sample of specialised dairy farms in Brittany (western France) between 2005 and 2014. Two types of farms are considered: with high and with low capital intensity. The results show that spreading investment over time is, on average, an optimal strategy for maintaining performance in the presence of adjustment costs. In addition, the effect of performance on investment behaviour differs between the two farm types.
Q12|Demand and supply of infrequent payments as a commitment device: evidence from Kenya|Despite extensive evidence that preferences are often time-inconsistent, there is only scarce evidence of willingness to pay for commitment. Infrequent payments for frequently provided goods and services are a common feature of many markets and they may naturally provide commitment to save for lumpy expenses. Multiple experiments in the Kenyan dairy sector show that: (i) farmers are willing to incur sizable costs to receive infrequent payments as a commitment device, (ii) poor contract enforcement, however, limits competition among buyers in the supply of infrequent payments. We then present a model of demand and supply of infrequent payments and test its additional predictions.
Q12|Valuing meteorological services in resource-constrained settings: Application to smallholder farmers in the Peruvian Altiplano|Changing climate and weather patterns have resulted in reduced agricultural productivity in some parts of the world and put pressure on global food security. Availability and improved quality of meteorological information is seen as a potentially propitious means of adaptation to changing climate conditions. Forecasts of extreme weather events are especially valuable in resource-poor settings where climate-related vulnerability is high, such as for smallholder farmers in the developing world. In this paper we provide estimates of frost warnings valuation in the context of small-scale quinoa production in the Peruvian Altiplano. We first present a detailed contextual assessment of quinoa production in the study region based on agrometeorological and socio-economic data that was obtained through a representative farm household survey conducted in December 2016. Building on this assessment, we propose a stochastic life-cycle model, replicating the lifetime cycle of a quinoa-producing household, in order to derive a theoretical valuation of frost warnings. Calibrating the model to our data we provide estimates of potential frost-warning valuation which are in the range of $30-50 per household and year, depending on the forecast accuracy and agents' risk aversion. In a last step, using the observational data from the farm household survey, we show that access to existing meteorological services is empirically associated with avoided losses in agricultural production that amount to $18 per average household and per year. Our findings point to high climate vulnerabilities of smallholders in the Peruvian Altiplano and potentially large welfare gains from incorporating improved meteorological services into their decision-making process.
Q12|Industry Competitiveness Indicators|It can be argued that the competitiveness of an industry consists of two main parts: The production conditions and the utilization of these. The production conditions are largely determined by factors exogenous to the firms comprising the industry, including the economic environment, regulatory framework, etc. The utilization of the production conditions corresponds to the classic economic notion of structural efficiency. We here argue that it is crucial for policy analysis to be able to quantify each of these two aspects separately, since the production conditions are partly in the hands of the policy makers, whereas the utilization is mainly the responsibility of firm management. In this paper we define two new bilateral indicators; the Bilateral Industry Utilization (BIU) indicator, and the Bilateral Production Conditions (BPC) indicator. These are applied to a large data set of dairy farms across 19 European countries provided by the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). With focus on the competitiveness of Danish dairy farms we show that dairy farms in most other countries have significantly better production conditions than those in Denmark while Sweden is the only country with significantly better utilization. Finally, we asses potential causes behind the differences and discuss possible remedies.
Q12|Drug Money and Bank Lending: The Unintended Consequences of Anti-Money Laundering Policies|CWe explore the unintended consequences of anti-money laundering (AML) policies. For identification, we exploit the implementation of the SARLAFT system in Colombia in 2008, aimed at controlling the flow of money from drug trafficking into the financial system. We find that bank deposits in municipalities with high drug trafficking activity decline after the implementation of the new AML policy. More importantly, this negative liquidity shock has consequences for credit in municipalities with little or nil drug trafficking. Banks that source their deposits from areas with high drug trafficking activity cut lending relative to banks that source their deposits from other areas. We show that this credit shortfall negatively impacted the real economy. Using a proprietary database containing data on bank-firm credit relationships, we show that small firms that rely on credit from affected banks experience a negative shock to investment, sales, size, and profitability. Additionally, we observe a reduction in employment in small firms. Our results suggest that the implementation of the AML policy had a negative effect on the real economy.
Q12|A mHealth voice messaging intervention to improve infant and young child feeding practices in Senegal|Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have the potential to improve infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices; however, gaps in the literature remain regarding their design, implementation and effectiveness. The aims of this study were to: design a mHealth voice messaging intervention delivered to mothers and fathers targeting IYCF practices and examine its implementation and impact in households with children 6-23 months in three rural villages in Senegal. We conducted focus groups (n=6) to inform the intervention development. We then conducted a pilot study (n=47 households) to examine the impact of the intervention on IYCF practices of children 6-23 months. Voice messages were sent to the childrenâ€™s mothers and fathers over a period of four weeks (2 messages/week; 8 messages in total), and 24-hour dietary recalls and food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) were conducted before and immediately after the implementation of the mHealth intervention to examine its impact on IYCF practices. Overall, 3 of the 8 behaviors increased and one decreased. There was a significant increase in the number of children that consumed fish (60% vs 94%; p=0.008) as measured by the 24-hour recall after the completion of the intervention. We also found significantly higher frequency of egg (p=0.026), fish (p=0.004) and thick porridge (p=0.002) consumption in the previous 7-days measured by the FFQ. Our findings suggest that voice messaging IYCF interventions in Senegal have the potential to improve IYCF behaviors among young children in the short term. Future research should entail scaling-up the intervention and examining its sustainability over the long-term.
Q12|Farm performance and investment decisions: evidence from the French (Brittany) dairy sector|The objective of this paper is to investigate the role of farm performance in farmers’ investment decisions with a theoretical model accounting for adjustment costs and performance. The model is estimated on a balanced sample of specialised dairy farms in Brittany (western France) between 2005 and 2014. Two types of farms are considered: with high and with low capital intensity. The results show that spreading investment over time is, on average, an optimal strategy for maintaining performance in the presence of adjustment costs. In addition, the effect of performance on investment behaviour differs between the two farm types.
Q12|Shocks, economic policy and technology choice of heterogenous producers|This article introduces a new Melitz-type model of heterogeneous producers with decreasing returns to scale and different productivities. Different to previous models, it describes smallholder producers in rural areas of developing countries in the context of environment and development economics. The model enables a socially sensitive policy analysis considering poverty and distributional effects. In this model, the production input causes a negative environmental externality. External shocks, e.g., caused by climate change, and economic policies affect the producers' endogenous choice between market entry or exit and between simple or advanced technology. In the first step, various shocks and policies are analyzed theoretically. A novel type of the rebound effect (Jevons paradox) is identifed for the production input that occurs when market entry is incentivized by productivity improvements. In the second step, the model is calibrated by applying it to coffee production in rural Vietnam. The simulation results show that secondary effects of the shocks, such as employment effects, can be substantially larger than the original impact. The support of market entry or of the advanced technology creates adverse distributional effects.
Q12|Urban proximity, demand for land and land prices in Malawi|We assess the spatial and intertemporal change patterns of farmland prices using per hectare minimum willingness to accept (WTA) sales and rental prices in Malawi. We use three rounds of nationally representative household farm panel data from the Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), collected in 2010, 2013 and 2016. We study price changes by splitting the sample in quintiles based on distance from the nearest major city, building on the von Thünen theory and urban growth model. Generally, WTA land prices decrease with distance from urban areas. However, WTA land sales prices increased more sharply between 2010 and 2013 in rural areas (+100% vs. +30% in urban proximity). Conversely, by 2016 land sales prices were again, like in 2010, about three times as high in areas near urban centres compared to remote rural areas. Even though sales prices declined in remote rural areas from 2013 to 2016, rental prices remained high. Using farm level population pressure, we show that local population pressure is a driver of WTA land prices, which is an indicator of land scarcity challenges and a growing demand for land. Although a policy focus in the past decade within Africa has been on the new demand for large scale land transfers in rural areas, we see that shadow land prices in smallholder agriculture in Malawi were affected by this sharp increase in demand as well as by increasing population pressure and urbanization. With growing land scarcity, land markets are becoming more important and need to be factored in when formulating development policies that aim to improve access to land and land use efficiency in both peri-urban and rural areas.
Q12|Transaction costs and land rental market participation in Malawi|We assess the extent of access and degree of participation by smallholder tenants in the land rental market in Malawi. Our study is based on three rounds of nationally representative Living Standards Measurement Surveys collected in 2010, 2013 and 2016, from which we construct a balanced panel. We apply the transaction cost theory, which suggests transaction costs to be non-linear and depend on resource as well as socioeconomic characteristics within the customary tenure system that determines who hold, use and transfer land. Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, the dynamic random effects probit and Tobit models show that transaction costs in the rental market (on the tenant side) are non-linear, high and lead to state dependency in the market. This implies that past land rental experience, social capital and networks, trust and reputation significantly reduce transaction costs and facilitate entry and extent of participation in the rental market. The results point towards the need for land tenure reforms that can reduce these high transaction costs. Access to information through social network could be one way that can improve land access for land-poor and potential tenants, thereby enhancing both equity and efficiency effects of land rental markets.
Q12|Agricultural productivity in Burkina Faso: The role of gender andrisk attitudes|This study is an empirical investigation of how individual risk attitudes influence the agricultural productivity of men and women in a sub-Saharan African country, Burkina Faso. By analyzing a large representative panel survey of farmers from 2014 and 2015, the results indicate lower productivity on female-owned plots. Controlling for various socio-economic factors, the results show that as the female farmers’ increase risk taking, the productivity of female-owned plots goes down. These results are robust regarding alternative specifications. However, productivity differences vary by the type of crop cultivated, the agro-ecological zone, the share of female farmers in the region, the soil quality, type of seed used, and between consumption quantiles when comparing the poorest to the richest 20 per cent of the farm households. The results indicate that female farmers do not increase their plot yield by taking more risk. It is argued that agricultural policy interventions in Burkina Faso need to be gender sensitized when addressing issues related to credit constraints, improved inputs, and policies that support increase in productivity.
Q12|The Effects of Access to Credit on Productivity: Separating Technological Changes from Changes in Technical Efficiency|Improving productivity among microenterprises is important, especially in low-income countries where market imperfections are pervasive, and resources are scarce. Relaxing credit constraints can increase the productivity of microenterprises. Using a field experiment involving agricultural microenterprises in Bangladesh, we estimated the impact of access to credit on the overall productivity of rice farmers and disentangled the total effect into technological change (frontier shift) and technical efficiency changes. We found that relative to the baseline rice output per decimal, access to credit resulted in, on average, approximately a 14 percent increase in yield, holding all other inputs constant. After decomposing the total effect into the frontier shift and efficiency improvement, we found that, on average, around 11 percent of the increase in output came from changes in technology, or frontier shift, while the remaining 3 percent was attributed to improvements in technical efficiency. The efficiency gain was higher for modern hybrid rice varieties, and almost zero for traditional rice varieties. Within the treatment group, the effect was greater among pure tenant and mixed-tenant microenterprise households compared with microenterprises that only cultivated their own land.
Q12|Product concentration and usage: Behavioral effects in the glyphosate market|People often ignore or misunderstand information that would help them make better decisions. For products that differ by concentration level, a critical choice concerns the correct dosage rate. We study the effects of changing glyphosate product concentration levels on farmers’ glyphosate usage behavior. Glyphosate is the world's most widely used herbicide. After glyphosate went off patent in 2000, product variants with higher concentration levels entered the market. Using detailed farm-level glyphosate use data in U.S. corn and soybeans over the period 1998–2011, we estimate the impact of product concentration levels on glyphosate application rates. We control for prices and other sources of heterogeneity by means of individual and time fixed effects. Our findings indicate that increasing the baseline concentration level by 10% increases the application rate by nearly 6%, despite the fact that labels on more concentrated products provide instructions on how to correctly adjust dosage rates downwards. We attribute part of the concentration effect to rational behavior and part of it to label confusion and/or habit, with smaller farms and late adopters being more likely to resort to habit. A counterfactual simulation predicts that label confusion and/or habit was responsible for a 4.6% increase in total glyphosate use and an additional $59 million per year (4.7%) in glyphosate sellers’ revenues.
Q12|Can Agricultural Extension and Input Support Be Discontinued? Evidence from a Randomized Phaseout in Uganda|Many development programs that attempt to disseminate improved technologies are limited in duration, either because of external funding constraints or an assumption of impact sustainability; but there is limited evidence on whether and when terminating such programs is efficient. We provide novel experimental evidence on the impacts of a randomized phase-out of an extension and subsidy program that promotes improved inputs and cultivation practices among smallholder women farmers in Uganda. We find that phase-out does not diminish the use of either practices or inputs, as farmers shift purchases from NGO-sponsored village-based supply networks to market sources. These results indicate short-term interventions can suffice to trigger persistent effects, consistent with models of technology adoption that emphasize learning from experience.
Q12|The Effects of Access to Credit on Productivity: Separating Technological Changes from Changes in Technical Efficiency|Improving productivity among microenterprises is important, especially in low-income countries where market imperfections are pervasive, and resources are scarce. Relaxing credit constraints can increase the productivity of microenterprises. Using a field experiment involving agricultural microenterprises in Bangladesh, we estimated the impact of access to credit on the overall productivity of rice farmers and disentangled the total effect into technological change (frontier shift) and technical efficiency changes. We found that relative to the baseline rice output per decimal, access to credit resulted in, on average, approximately a 14 percent increase in yield, holding all other inputs constant. After decomposing the total effect into the frontier shift and efficiency improvement, we found that, on average, around 11 percent of the increase in output came from changes in technology, or frontier shift, while the remaining 3 percent was attributed to improvements in technical efficiency. The efficiency gain was higher for modern hybrid rice varieties, and almost zero for traditional rice varieties. Within the treatment group, the effect was greater among pure tenant and mixed-tenant microenterprise households compared with microenterprises that only cultivated their own land.
Q12|Value Chain Development as Public Policy: Conceptualization and Evidence from the Agri-Food Sector in Bangladesh|Value chain development (VCD) has become a popular policy instrument to help farmers in developing countries access markets. While VCD initiated by the private sector has received much attention in the literature, there is yet little research on public-led VCD. This paper provides a conceptualization of public-led VCD and discusses in what context it can be a relevant policy instrument. As an illustration, the paper then describes the project “SAFAL”, which directly intervenes in the aquaculture, horticulture, and dairy sector of South-West Bangladesh. Using a matched difference-in-difference methodology, it is estimated that SAFAL increased farmers’ output market participation, food production, and smallholder welfare, and reduced the number of days in which participating households were food insecure.
Q12|Off-Farm Participation, Agricultural Production and Farmersâ€™ Welfare in Tanzania and Uganda|Panel data from the Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture for Tanzania and Uganda were analyzed to investigate the impact of off-farm participation on agricultural production and farmersâ€™ welfare. Using strategies ranging from simple least squares to a dynamic panel model, we demonstrated how each of the intermediate models, such as the random effects Tobit model, could tackle censoring bias. Our results reveal that off-farm participation had a negative impact on agricultural production in both countries, though the impact was positive on welfare for Tanzania only. Policy makers should consider the complexities surrounding the formulation of pro-agriculture and pro-welfare policies aimed at producing desirable outcomes from off-farm participation. In that effort, policies that minimize the trade-off between agricultural production and off-farm participation and which enhance positive welfare effects are vital.
Q12|Contract Farming and Rural Transformation: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Benin|In recent decades contract farming has emerged as a popular mechanism to encourage vertical coordination in developing country agriculture. The goal of such coordination is to better integrate smallholder farmers into the modern agricultural food system, fostering rural transformation. We use panel data from a randomized control trial to quantify the impact of different contract attributes on rural transformation and welfare of smallholder rice farmers in Benin. We vary the terms of contract, with some farmers being offered a contract that only guarantees a price, while other contracts add extension training or input loans. While all three types of contracts had positive and significant effects, we find that contracts which only included an agreement on price had nearly as large of an impact as did contracts with additional attributes. This suggests that once price uncertainty is resolved, farmers are able to address other constraints on their own.
Q12|Assessing the Benefits of Long-Run Weather Forecasting for the Rural Poor: Farmer Investments and Worker Migration in a Dynamic Equilibrium Model|The livelihoods of the majority of the world's poor depend on agriculture. They face substantial risk from fluctuations in weather conditions. Better risk, credit and savings markets can improve productivity and welfare in rural areas but entail high administrative costs. We consider a classic public good with benefits that theoretically exceed those of perfect insurance contracts – improving the skill of long-run weather forecasts. We use an equilibrium model of agricultural production and labor migration, and a variety of Indian panel datasets to assess quantitatively the effects of improvements in seasonal forecasts of monsoon weather. We find that in areas where the forecast is accurate (has “skill”) that investment, migration and rural wages respond to forecasts. We calculate that if such skill were pervasive across India, the total value of an accurate forecast for farmers and wage workers is in the tens of billions of rupees.
Q12|Can Smallholder Extension Transform African Agriculture?|"Agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) lags far behind all other regions of the world. A long list of policy experiments has yielded more evidence on what fails than on what works. We analyze a randomized control trial of a rare scaled-up success story: One Acre Fund’s small farmer program. Much like anti-poverty ""graduation"" interventions, the program aims to relax multiple constraints to productivity simultaneously. We show that participation causes statistically and economically significant increases in output, yields, and profits. In our preferred specification, maize production increases by 24% and profits by 16%. We find little evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects on yields, but observe some attenuation of impacts on total output and profits at the top end of the distribution."
Q12|Subsidies and the African Green Revolution: Direct Effects and Social Network Spillovers of Randomized Input Subsidies in Mozambique|The Green Revolution bolstered agricultural yields and rural well-being in Asia and Latin America, but bypassed sub-Saharan Africa. We study the first randomized controlled trial of a government-implemented input subsidy program (ISP) in Africa. A temporary subsidy for Mozambican maize farmers stimulates Green Revolution technology adoption and leads to increased maize yields. Effects of the subsidy persist in later unsubsidized years. In addition, social networks of subsidized farmers benefit from spillovers, experiencing increases in technology adoption, yields, and beliefs about the returns to the technologies. Spillovers account for the vast majority of subsidy-induced gains. ISPs alleviate informational market failures, stimulating learning about new technologies by subsidy recipients and their social networks
Q12|Evaluating the environmental impact of agricultural policies|The relationship between agricultural support policies (adapted from the OECD Producer Support Estimate (PSE) classification) and a selection of environmental impacts are analysed in a range of country settings, using a farm-level and a market-level model. Based on the methods and environmental indicators used, market price support and payments based on unconstrained variable input use were the most environmentally harmful among the various PSE measures. Decoupled support payments based on non-current crop area were the least harmful, even when considering their impacts on the behaviour of risk averse farmers. The impacts of support policies that clearly change the competitiveness of one production activity in relation to another, such as payments based on current crop area or on animal numbers, were more equivocal. Support payments subject to environmental constraints can improve environmental outcomes compared to coupled support without restrictions, however, they can also have unintended environmental impacts.
Q12|Устойчивост На Селското Стопанство В България<BR>[Sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture]|"This paper gives answer to topical and debated research and practical questions at the current stage of development of Bulgarian agriculture - „what is sustainability of agriculture"", „how to assess sustainability of agricultural in the conditions of EU CAP implementation in the country“, and „which are critical factors for improvement of socio-economic and environmental sustainability in the sector“. Evolution of the „concept“ of agrarian sustainability and the major approached for its assessment are discussed More precise definition of sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture is suggested and the requirements for the system of its assessment are characterised. For the first time a new „governance“ pillar of agrarian sustainability is included along with the universally accepted economic, social and environmental pillars (aspects). Practically applicable for the specific conditions of Bulgarian agriculture holistic framework for assessing sustainability level of agrarian systems of different types (sector, sub-sector, region, ecosystem, agricultural farm) is suggested. The later included 25 principles, 66 criteria, and 163 indicators and reference values for assessing integral, governance, economic, social and environmental sustainability as well as approach for their calculation, integration and interpretation. Approbation of the elaborated framework in assessment of agrarian sustainability at various levels (national, sub-sector, region, (agro)ecosystem, and farm) is made on the base of official statistical, etc, information and original farm surveys. Critical factors for improving sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture are identified, and recommendation made for amelioration of research and assessment practices, public policies and farming strategies for sustainable development.

Q12|Multilevel assessment of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria|The goal of this study is to unpack sustainability in terms of understanding and evaluation using as a case Bulgarian agriculture. A hierarchical system for assessing agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria at national, regional, sub-sectoral, ecosystem and farm level is proposed. It includes 3 aspects(pillars), 17 principles, 35 criteria, and 46 indicators and reference values for evaluating sustainability as well as approach for their integration and interpretation. Assessment is made of agrarian sustainability in the country at various level using aggregate macro and farm level micro data. The assessment has found out that there is a considerable differentiation in the level of integral and aspects sustainability of different type of farms, ecosystems, subsectors and regions. Nevertheless, results on the integral agrarian sustainability based on macro aggregate and micro farm data are quite similar. The later indicates that both approaches are reliable and could be simultaneously used according to the level of analysis, needs of decision makers, and available data. Major factors encouraging improving economic sustainability are market demand and price; direct state subsidies; market competition; financial capability; participation in public support programs; possibility of benefitting immediately; possibility of benefitting in the near future; tax preferences; possibility of benefitting in the long term; and integration with buyers of farm products. Main factors encouraging the enhancement of social sustainability are personal convictions and satisfaction; social recognition of individual contribution; immediate benefits for other people and groups; regional community initiatives and pressure; access to advisory services; European Union policy; and existing regional problems and risks. Important factors encouraging environmental sustainability are problems and risks existing at the global scale; official regulations, standards, and norms; existing regional problems and risks; and European Union policies. Public policies and instruments that improve economic sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture include: direct area-based payments; national top-ups for products and livestock; modernization of agricultural holdings; green payments; support for semi-market farms. At the same time the impact of national and European policies on social and environmental sustainability is relatively weak. Having in mind the importance of holistic assessments of this kind for improving agrarian sustainability, farm management and agrarian policies, they are to be expended and their precision and representation increased. The latter requires a closer cooperation between and participation of all interested parties as well as improvement of the precision through enlargement of collected statistical data, number of surveyed farms, and incorporating more “objective” data from field tests and surveys, monitoring, expertise of professionals in the area, etc.
Q12|Sustainability of agro-ecosystems in Bulgaria|Ecosystem approach has been increasingly incorporated in the management and evaluation of sustainability levels. Despite huge progress in the theory and practice of this new area, still there is no consensus on how to assess the sustainability of agro-ecosystems due to diverse understandings, approaches, methods, employed data, etc. In Bulgaria there are practically no deep studies on sustainability level of diverse agro-eco-systems. This paper tries to fill the blank and assesses the sustainability level of agro-ecosystems of different type in Bulgaria. First a holistic hierarchical framework for assessing integral, economic, social and ecological sustainability of agro-ecosystems in Bulgaria is suggested including 17 principles, 35 criteria, and 46 indicators and reference values. After that, an assessment is made on overall and aspects sustainability of large (agro)ecosystems in North-Central, South-Eastern, South-Central and South-Western geographic regions, and particular main and specific types of agro-ecosystems of the country - mountainous, plain-mountainous, plain, riparian (Struma, Maritza, Yantra), southern Black Sea, mountainous area with natural constraints, non-mountainous area with natural constraints, protected areas and reserves, Western Thracian Plain, Middle Danube Plain, Dupnitsa and Sandansko-Petrich Valley, Sredna Gora Mountains and Western Rila Mountains. The assessment is based on first-hand information collected though in-depth interviews with the managers of “typical” farms in the respective ago-ecosystems. The study has found out that there is a considerable differentiation in the level of integral sustainability in agricultural ecosystems of different types. Furthermore, there are substantial variations in the levels of economic, social and ecological sustainability of agro-ecosystems of different type, and the critical indicators enhancing or deterring overall and particular sustainability of individual agro-ecosystems. Results of the integral agrarian sustainability level of this study, based on the micro agro-ecosystem (farm) data, are similar to the previous assessment based on the aggregate sectoral (statistical, etc.) data. There are large differences in the impact of socio-economic, institutional, behavioral, international, natural, etc. factors and individual public policy instruments on the sustainability of farming enterprises of different types and agro-ecosystems. Having in mind the importance of holistic assessments of this kind for improving agrarian sustainability, farm management and agrarian policies, they are to be expended and their precision and representation increased.
Q12|Sustainability of agricultural sub-sectors in Bulgaria|In Bulgaria, like in most countries, the comprehensive assessments on agrarian sustainability are mostly at sectoral or farm levels while there is practically no in-depth study on sustainability at sub-sector (industry) level. This paper tries to fill the gap and assess the sustainability of different sub-sectors in Bulgarian agriculture. First a holistic hierarchical framework for assessing integral, economic, social and ecological sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture is suggested including 17 principles, 35 criteria, and 46 indicators and reference values. After that, an assessment is made on the overall and aspects sustainability of major crop, livestock and mixed subsectors of Bulgarian agriculture. The assessment is based on first-hand information collected though in-depth interviews with the managers of “typical” farms in analysed industries. The study has found out that there is a considerable differentiation in the level of integral and aspects sustainability in individual sub-sectors in Bulgaria, with mixed livestock-breeding, mixed crop-growing, and perennial crops sub-sectors having the highest integral sustainability, while pigs, poultry and rabbits; vegetables, flowers and mushrooms, and mixed livestock-crops subsectors the lowest one. There are also substantial variations in the levels of economic, social and ecological sustainability of different agricultural sub-sectors and individual indicators with the highest and lowest values showing (critical) factors enhancing and deterring particular or overall sustainability of evaluated agro-industries. Results on the integral agrarian sustainability level of this study based on the micro sub-sector (farm) data are similar to the previous assessment based on the aggregate sectoral (statistical, etc.) data.
Q12|Economic Assessment of Climate Adaptation Options in Myanmar Rice-Based Farming System|Agriculture is highly sensitive to climate change and understandings how the adaptation options improve the farming household’s adaptive capacity are critical to the agricultural policies. The study was carried out for the economic assessment of climate adaption options in rice-based farming system of Myanmar. The propensity score matching approach was applied to explore the existing adaptation options and its contribution on the farm income. In addition, the binary probit model was used to analyse the factors influencing those adaptation decisions. The erratic rainfall, especially dry spell period and unexpected rain during the critical crop growth, was the critical challenge of rice-based farming in the study. The timely operation of farm machineries was one of the major adaptation options for the farmers, followed by other options such as use of more agrochemicals and changing rice varieties including early maturity, high yielding and stress tolerant varieties. The combination of those adaptations gave additional 0.86-0.89 ton/ha yield, 152-158 USD/ha total return and 108-124 USD/ha profit to the adapter farmers. The institutional factors such as irrigation access, access to credit, access to weekly weather information and participation to agricultural training were critically important to the adaptation decision. Moreover, the social capital factors like farming experience, farm size and farm income share were also major influencing variables.
Q12|Spatial Spillovers in the Implicit Market Price of Soil Erosion: An Estimation using a Spatio-temporal Hedonic Model|Abstract: We estimate the implicit market price of soil erosion, fitting a spatio-temporal hedonic price model using quarterly data of 3,563 agricultural farms traded in Uruguay between 2000 and 2014. A unique feature of our estimation is that we allow for possible spatial spillovers. We find evidence of a negative and statistically significant association between erosion and land values. A 1% increase in own topsoil loss due to own erosion is associated with a decrease of 0.22% in the per-hectare price of agricultural land (p-value: 0.013, 95% CI: -0.0039, -0.0005). This is equivalent to a decrease of 7.7 USD in the average price per hectare and USD 1,040 in the price of the average farm (134 hectares). This value increases to USD 1,277 when we add the average cross marginal effect of erosion in nearby farms. Our estimates are sensitive to our measure of erosion and our specification of the spatio-temporal weighting matrix. We also find evidence consistent with our hypothesis that farms entering a governmental erosion control plan sent a valuable signal to the market regarding soil management. An indicator of whether the farm has at least one parcel under the government erosion control plans is associated with a 29% increase in the farm´s per-hectare price (p-value: 0.000, 95% CI: 16.26%, 41.53%) higher than those with no parcel under these plans. The average total marginal effect (own plus cross effects) of the erosion control plans is 35.37% (p-value: 0.000, 95% CI: 20.33%, 50.40%).
Q12|Do Farmers Perceive the Trends of Local Climate Variability Accurately? An Analysis of Farmers’ Perceptions and Meteorological Data in Myanmar|With the existing state of issues related to global climate change, the accuracy of farmers’ perceptions of climate is critically important if they plan to implement appropriate adaptation measures in their farming. This article evaluated if farmers perceive the trends of local climate variability accurately, and was verified by the historical meteorological data analysis. Ordered probit perception models were applied in this study to determine the factors influencing the accuracy of farmer perception. It was observed that farmers’ perceptions of the rainfall amount during the early, mid, and late monsoon periods were highly accurate, and they also accurately perceived summer temperature change, but less accuracy of perception was observed of the temperate changes of the winter and monsoon seasons. Access to weekly weather information, participation in agricultural trainings, farming experience, and education level of the farmer were the major factors determining the accuracy of perception in this study. Based on the empirical results, this study suggested policy implications for (a) the locally specified weather information distribution, and (b) integration of weather information into agricultural training programs, which are available to the farming community to enhance the government implantation of the Myanmar Climate Smart Agriculture Strategy and Myanmar Climate Change Master Plan 2018–2030.
Q12|Market awareness and profitability: case study of Mango production in Karnataka, India|This article presents a case study of mango farmers in the Kolar district of Karnataka to understand the determinants of profitability and constraints faced by the horticulture industry in India in general. The mango value chain is analysed in-depth to understand the market choices of farmers and the role of market intermediaries and is based on data collected from a primary survey of 131 farmers. The study uses an instrumental variable approach to model the profitability of farmers as a function of market awareness, distance from markets, farming practices, and control variables. It finds that in addition to age and education, distance to markets and farming practices are significant factors influencing the profitability of mango cultivators.
Q12|Is landholding a potential barrier to adopting profitable livelihoods in the Mekong Delta region in Vietnam ?|Using secondary data on rural households in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam, our study is the first to identify (i) what livelihoods are adopted by rural households, (ii) which ones are profitable and which are not, and (iii) whether access to various types of land is an important factor affecting households’ choice of remunerative livelihoods. Considering various income sources, we apply cluster analysis techniques to offer the first classification of five types of livelihood adopted by local households. We then compare livelihood outcomes across livelihood groups using Bonferroni pairwise tests and quantile functions (Pen’s parades). It was found that households engaged in farm work, formal wage-earning work and non-wage work livelihoods obtained higher levels of income than did those with livelihoods depending on informal wage-earning work or non-labor income sources. Using a multinomial logit model, we also examine factors affecting choices of income-earning activities, and find that several types of land are positively associated with the choice of high-return livelihoods, implying that lack of access to land is a potential obstacle to adopting profitable livelihoods. Fortunately, education is found to play a major role in the pursuit of remunerative livelihoods, which suggests that better education would help households move from low- to high-return activities.
Q12|Insurance and Propagation in Village Networks|We study the dual role of networks in providing insurance and in propagating idiosyncratic shocks by using variation in the timing of severe shocks on health spending experienced by households in Thai villages. We find no impacts on food consumption. Smoothing is largely achieved through local gift and loan networks. However, insurance is partial for some households so they adjust their production decisions-drawing on their working capital, cutting input spending, and reducing labor hiring, hence propagating the shocks to other households. We find that upstream businesses close to the underinsured households in the supply chain network experience reduced local sales and increased inventories. Likewise, workers closer to the underinsured households in the labor network experience declined probability of working locally and reduced earnings. We find evidence of ex-post adjustments of these upstream households through shifting resources towards activities with lower exposure to local shocks. Our results suggest that social (village-level) gains of expanding health insurance might be higher than private (household-level) gains.
Q12|Farm performance and investment decisions: evidence from the French (Brittany) dairy sector| The objective of this paper is to investigate the role of farm performance in farmers’ investment decisions with a theoretical model accounting for adjustment costs and performance. The model is estimated on a balanced sample of specialised dairy farms in Brittany (western France) between 2005 and 2014. Two types of farms are considered: with high and with low capital intensity. The results show that spreading investment over time is, on average, an optimal strategy for maintaining performance in the presence of adjustment costs. In addition, the effect of performance on investment behaviour differs between the two farm types.
Q12|How Do Agro-Pastoral Policies Affect the Dietary Intake of Agro-Pastoralists? Evidence from Niger|We investigate the mechanisms underlying the effect of agricultural policies directed toward pastoralist households on their dietary intake. To do so, we pursue a mediation analysis while referring to theoretical agricultural household models. We decompose the total effect of selected policies on pastoralist dietary intake into an indirect effect, i.e., the effect that operates through pastoral profits, and a residual direct effect. Using an agro-pastoral survey conducted in Niger in 2016, the effects of extension services associated with better access to markets are found to be channeled through households’ annual profits from cattle and sheep raising, while this is not the case for private veterinary services and low-cost livestock feed programs. Extension services may foster specialization in cattle and sheep raising, which may incentivize households to move toward a nomadic lifestyle and change their food habits and thereby have detrimental consequences on their calorie intake. Besides, other life choices could be spurred or hampered by policies, such as migrations and radicalization.
Q12|Choosing between Hail Insurance and Anti-Hail Nets: A Simple Model and a Simulation among Apples Producers in South Tyrol|There is a growing interest in analysing the diffusion of agricultural insurance, seen as an effective tool for managing farm risks. Much atten- tion has been dedicated to understanding the scarce adoption rate despite high levels of subsidization and policy support. In this paper, we analyse an aspect that seems to have been partially overlooked: the potential competing nature between insurance and other risk management tools. We consider hail as a single source weather shock and analyse the potential competing effect of anti-hail nets over insurance as instruments to cope with this shock by presenting a simple theoretical model that is rooted into expected utility theory. After describing the basic model, we perform some comparative static analysis to identify the role of individual elements that are shaping farmers' decisions. From this exercise it results that the worth of anti-hail nets compared to insurance is an increasing function of the overall risk of hail damages, of the farmers' level of risk aversion and of the worth of the agricultural output. Finally, we develop a simulation model using data related to apple production in South Tyrol, a Northern-Italian province with a relatively high risk of hail. The model generally confirms the results of the comparative static analysis and it shows that, in this region, anti-hail nets are often superior than insurance in expected utility terms.
Q12|Modeling the Switch from Hail Insurance to Anti-Hail Nets|In several areas of the world, hail is one of the most detrimental atmospheric phenomenon for agriculture, causing a significant loss of output and, consequently, of farms’ revenues. Despite being a highly stochastic and localized phenomenon, thus allowing for a sustainable insurance market to hedge against its detrimental effects, this last is often subsidised. The present paper tries to figure out if the promotion of an alternative hedging instrument, anti-hail nets, could help to increase the actuarial soundness of the hail insurance market. In the first part of the paper a simple model is presented showing that the relation between the differential profitability of anti-hail nets versus insurance and the plot specific versus the average expected damage has an inverse U-shape. This implies that incentives to anti-hail nets could cause low risk farmers to exit the insurance market more likely than high risk ones. Such finding is confirmed by the empirical investigation, further showing that higher per-hectare output values and being located in an area strongly affected by hail increase the chance of a plot to be hedged through anti-hail nets.
Q12|Firms and Farms: The Local Effects of Farm Income on Firms’ Demand|How do changes in agricultural productivity affect firms? Using the predictions of a simple multi-sector general equilibrium model of the local economy and exploiting weather-induced agricultural volatility across India, I estimate the response of manufacturing firms to changes in agricultural productivity. I show that negative agricultural productivity shocks lower the cost of labor but that this does not cause firms to hire more. Firms’ production and employment in fact decrease because the shocks also reduce local income and hence the demand that firms face. My estimates provide evidence for a significant local demand effect. I then use my framework to show that this has key policy implications. I examine the introduction of a rural workfare program and assess how it affects firms. I show that the program attenuates the impact of negative agricultural shocks on firms because of its counter-cyclical effects on local wage and demand for manufacturing goods. The results highlight how policies that target households and increase their income can affect local market size and therefore the industrial sector through their general equilibrium effects.
Q12|Droughts and farms' financial performance in New Zealand: a micro farm-level study|We quantify the impacts of droughts in New Zealand on the profitability of dairy, and sheep and beef farms. Using a comprehensive administrative database of all businesses in New Zealand, we investigate the impact of droughts on farm revenue, profits, return on capital, business equity, debt to income ratio, and interest coverage ratio. Over the period we examine (2007-2016) about half of the districts experienced severe droughts, and almost 85% of districts were affected by more moderate droughts at least once. For dairy farms, there is a strong negative relationship between the occurrence of droughts two years earlier and farms’ revenue, profit and consequently their return on capital. More surprisingly, we found that current (same fiscal year) drought events have positive impacts on dairy farms’ revenue and profit; this effect is most likely attributable to drought-induced increases in the price of milk solids (New Zealand is the market maker in this global market). In general, dairy farmers ‘benefit’ more from drought events when compared to sheep/beef farms, whereas the latter sector has less impact on global prices. These findings are useful for shaping climate-change adaptation as there is a clear variation in the future climate-change projections of drought intensities and frequencies for different regions in New Zealand.
Q12|Determinants of Crop Diversification in Burkina Faso - What is the Impact of Risk Preference?|The literature considers crop diversification to be a risk management strategy at the farm level. In this article, we combine experimental data on risk aversion with survey data to identify the extent to which risk aversion affects crop diversification decisions. We conduct experiments to measure the risk aversion of smallholder farmers in Burkina Faso and a field survey to gather data on various socio-economic variables. To measure crop diversification, we use three indices of spatial diversity in crop species adapted from the ecological economics literature, i.e., the weighted count index, the weighted Herfindahl index measure of crop concentration and the weighted Shannon index of evenness. An Ordinary Least square (OLS) model is used to estimate the impact of risk aversion on crop diversification when the weighted count index and the weighted Herfindahl index are used as the dependent variable, whereas a Tobit model is used for the weighted Shannon index. Our results show that risk aversion has a negative and significant effect on crop diversification. Risk-averse producers focus more on the production of traditional, less risky and low market value crops. Other variables also affect crop diversification. In particular, education level, distance to market, farm area and land fragmentation are associated with greater crop diversification.
Q12|Factors Explaining the Dynamics of Agricultural Technology Adoption: Evidence from Senegal's Rain Maize Farmers|This paper analyses the adoption dynamics of improved rainfed maize seeds disseminated in Senegal in 2013 by the West African Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP). We group maize producers into five groups (non-adopters, laggards/abandoners, late adopters, followers and pioneers/innovators) and take into account the heterogeneity of unobservable characteristics of the producers. In the pioneers/innovators group, the availability of labour, household size, shocks, and frequency of access to advice positively influence adoption, whereas financial constraints and high numbers of plots reduce the probability of adoption. Producers in the followers’ category tend to be older and more educated than are those in the other categories. However, food insecurity and shocks such as diseases hamper adoption. For the group of late adopters, household size and available storage infrastructures explain adoption. However, the number of plots and shocks reduce their probability of adoption. Laggards tend to face shocks and food insecurity.
Q12|The Effect of Interdiction on Coca Cultivation in Colombia|This paper studies the effect of interdiction on coca cultivation in Colombia. Though directed against intermediate and final stages of cocaine production, this strategy could also have an impact on coca cultivation by affecting monopsonistic activities of ilegal groups. My results suggest that different types of interdiction operations have a negative effect on coca crops. In particular, I find that the presence of dismantling of laboratories causes a reduction of 0.003 to 0.006 hectares per squared kilometer in coca cultivation, coca base seizures cause a reduction of 0.003 to 0.008 hectares per squared km, coca leaves seizures cause a reduction of 0.006 to 0.019 hectares per squared km and cocaine seizures cause a reduction of 0.009 to 0.061 hectares per squared km. I interpret these results as evidence that interdiction is an effective anti-narcotic strategy; however,a cost-benefit analysis is needed to evaluate its convenience over other strategies, like aerial spraying campaigns.
Q12|Información Crediticia para la Formulación de Política Pública: El Caso del Banco Agrario y la Sustitución de Cultivos de Uso Ilícito|La política de sustitución de cultivos de uso ilícito pasa por escoger, para un lugar determinado, unos pocos cultivos como alternativas de sustitución. Esta elección debe hacerse con indicadores de rentabilidad que generalmente no están disponibles por la falta de información. Este artículo propone utilizar información de las bases de datos del Banco Agrario de Colombia para guiar esta decisión. En particular, mostramos cómo se puede usar la información de morosidad de cartera y de colocaciones del banco para construir indicadores de rentabilidad de los cultivos en municipios con cultivos de coca. Estos indicadores se correlacionan positivamente con medidas de ingreso por hectárea a nivel de cultivo-municipio construidas con el Censo Nacional Agropecuario y las Evaluaciones Agropecuarias Municipales. Por último, presentamos para cada municipio los dos cultivos con el mejor desempeño según estos indicadores. Estos cultivos podrían ser alternativas viables de sustitución.
Q12|Heterogeneity, Measurement Error, and Misallocation: Evidence from African Agriculture| Standard measures of productivity display enormous dispersion across farms in Africa. Crop yields and input intensities appear to vary greatly, seemingly in conflict with a model of efficient allocation across farms. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for distinguishing between measurement error, unobserved heterogeneity, and potential misallocation. Using rich panel data from farms in Tanzania and Uganda, we estimate our model using a highly flexible specification in which we allow for several kinds of measurement error and heterogeneity. We find that measurement error and heterogeneity together account for a large fraction perhaps two-thirds to three-quarters -- of the dispersion in measured productivity. We suggest that the potential for efficiency gains through reallocation may be relatively modest.

Q12|Buyer-Driven Upgrading in GVCs: The Sustainable Quality Program in Colombia|This paper studies the Sustainable Quality Program in Colombia - a quality upgrading program implemented on behalf of a multinational coffee buyer. The Program is a bundle of contractual arrangements involving farmers, intermediaries, exporters and the multinational buyer. We tackle three questions. First, we investigate the impact of the Program on the supply of quality coffee. Eligible farmers upgraded their plantations, expanded land under coffee cultivation, increased quality and received higher farm gate prices. Second, we quantify how the Program gains are shared between farmers and intermediaries along the chain. In regions in which the Program was rolled out surplus along the chain increased by 30%. Eligible farmers kept at least half of the gains and their welfare increased by 20%. Finally, we examine how the Program works conducting counterfactual exercises and comparing the Program price premia along the chain against two prominent non-buyer driven certifications. The Program achieved a better transmission of the export gate price premium for quality to the farm gate and curbed market failures that stifled quality upgrading. Contractual arrangements at the export gate significantly contributed to higher farmers welfare in rural areas.
Q12|Sub-Lethal Concentrations of Neonicotinoid Insecticides at the Field Level Affect Negatively Honey Yield: Evidence from a 6-year Survey of Greek Apiaries|We used data from a 6-year survey of 60 apiaries in Greece and economic modelling to assess at the field level the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on honey production. Based on production function estimates, we found that sub-lethal concentrations of two widely used neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) detected in the nectar of flowers resulted in substantial losses in honey production for commercial beekeepers in our sample.
Q12|Investing in agriculture when it is worth it. Evidence from rural Uganda|One of the reasons for the persistent low agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa is the lack of adoption of pro table agricultural technologies. Yet, what is pro table in a controlled experimental setting may not be pro table in a real-world setting. Estimating the returns to a single input is, in fact, challenging as farmers may respond to adoption by re-optimizing the use of other inputs. This paper explores farmers behavioral response to a positive random shock on future productivity by disentangling inputs returns from farmers' response. Using a unique household panel dataset collected in rural Uganda, I proxy a future productivity shock with the birth of a female calf against that of a male calf. Calves have no technical returns, but female calves will become cows producing milk, providing a stable source of income, while bulls and oxen are of little use in this context. The main OLS and di erence-in-di erences results show the existence of a crowd-in e ect. Farmers react to the birth of a female calf by increasing inputs' expenditures. They invest more on their cattle's health, increase hired labor and are more willing to pay for cattle-related investments but not for other activities. This increase in investments leads to an increase in milk production and revenues that lasts over time. Further results show that economies of scale associated with the number of female animals seem to explain this behavioral response.
Q12|Agricultural Productivity in Space - An econometric assessment on Italian farm-level data|This work aims to investigate the spatial dependence of agricultural Total Factor Productivity (TFP) by using farm-level data and aggregating them at a variable geographical scale. At this scale a multilateral TFP index is computed and the spatial and time dependence of this TFP measure is assessed within a spatial dynamic panel specification. Alternative Least Squares (LS), Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation approaches are proposed and respective results compared. The application concerns Italian farm-level data over the period 2008-2015. Results suggests that higher productivity spillovers are found for those NUTS3 regions with similar neighborhoods in terms of production specialization. Higher spill-ins are found in those NUTS3 with a larger number of geographical connections, regardless of their similarity in terms of production specialization.
Q12|Market access, agricultural productivity and selection into trade: evidence from Colombia|We study the impact of the selection of farmers into trade on agricultural productivity using new data on the universe of farms in Colombia. To guide our analysis, we formulate a spatial economy model where better market access induces high skill farmers to switch from subsistence to cash crops that are traded in urban centers. We estimate reduced form effects of market access using distance to historical settlements as an instrument and calibrate our model according to these effects. Structural estimates indicate that the selection of farmers into trade have a large effect on agricultural productivity. **** RESUMEN: En este documento estudiamos la elección que hacen los agricultores entre la producción de cultivos comerciales con altos costos fijos y la producción de cultivos de subsistencia con menores costos de producción. Formulamos un modelo de economía espacial en el que un mejor acceso al mercado induce a agricultores de mayor habilidad a pasar de la producción de cultivos de subsistencia a la producción de cultivos que se comercializan en los centros urbanos. Probamos las predicciones del modelo utilizando datos para Colombia que provienen del Tercer Censo Nacional Agropecuario. Explotamos la variación exógena en la ubicación de los asentamientos indígenas en el siglo XVI para estimar efectos de forma reducida del acceso al mercado sobre la decisión de producir cultivos comerciales. Utilizamos los resultados de estas estimaciones para calcular los efectos sobre la productividad agrícola de la existencia de altos costos fijos en la producción de cultivos comerciales. Los restados sugieren que las barreras a la entrada que imponen estos costos fijos en la producción de cultivos comerciales tienen un efecto importante sobre la productividad del sector agrícola en Colombia.
Q12|Is Western European Agriculture Resilient to High Temperatures?|We estimate a Ricardian model of Western European agricultural land values using farm-level data. We model the effect of temperature on land values using a flexible specification of daily mean temperature to test if there are temperature threshold effects. Results indicate that there are no temperature thresholds beyond which agricultural land values suddenly drop. The results are robust to alternative model specifications. Adaptation explains why a smooth aggregate response function is compatible with sharply non-linear crop yield functions. With adaptation, the effect of warming on Western European agriculture is likely to be smooth.
Q12|What Stayers Do? Capital Endowments and On-Farm Transitions in Rural China|While much research on China has focused on rural to urban migration and transitions of rural households away from agriculture, little is known about the changes within the rural agricultural sector. Yet, the agricultural sector continues to account for a large share of employment. We study the determinants of transitions from subsistence farming into either formal agricultural employment or agricultural self-employment. We pay particular attention to the role of capital endowments. We find that financial capital plays a relatively limited role, compared to natural, human, social and political capital.
Q12|Efectos de las decisiones de inversión en la formalización de tierras de los hogares rurales colombianos|Este trabajo estima la efectividad de las inversiones permanentes en predios sobre la formalización de tierras de hogares rurales, en el contexto de la ley de reforma agraria colombiana. Utilizando un modelo de probabilidad lineal con efectos fijos de hogar, se encuentra que un aumento de 1% en estas inversiones aumenta en 0.22% la probabilidad de formalización, en tres microrregiones colombianas entre el 2010 y el 2016. Además, se propone una posible solución a sesgos por simultaneidad y selección entre la inversión y la formalización, con variables rezagadas e instrumentando con choques de precipitación. La investigación ofrece una explicación sobre la permanencia en la informalidad de los pequeños productores, a pesar de la creación de políticas que promueven la formalización.
Q12|Conectando mercados: vías rurales y producción agrícola en el contexto de una economía dual|Las economías en desarrollo se caracterizan por la coexistencia de sectores tradicionales y modernos, resultado de fallas de mercado, principalmente, costos de transacción. Las vías rurales son uno de los mecanismos para suavizar estas fricciones pues facilitan el acceso a mercados. Estudio el efecto que cambios en la calidad de las vías rurales tienen sobre las decisiones de producción agrícola de los hogares colombianos y encuentro efectos heterogéneos según la distancia a los mercados nacionales y locales. Los hogares centrales reducen su producción mientras los hogares periféricos la expanden, se vuelven más productivos e intensifican el uso de insumos. Este trabajo se une a la literatura que analiza el impacto de vías rurales sobre la productividad agrícola y el cambio estructural.
Q12|Is the College Farm Sustainable? The Case of Davidson College|Farms on college and university campuses are not new, but the current focuses on the farms being “sustainable” and contributing to the “local food movement” are relatively new and serve as motivation (in addition to their pedagogical value) for school administrators to start them. It is important for administrators to evaluate college farms given these new focuses as well the traditional budgetary standards. We contribute to this discussion by focusing on the example of the Davidson College Farm. Davidson College is a 2,000-student, residential liberal arts college located just north of Charlotte, North Carolina. The College established the Farm in 2012 to provide its Dining Services with local and organic food, and currently operates on 2 acres of land. Although we do frame our analysis around the relatively narrow question, is the Davidson College Farm sustainable[?], we believe that our process for answering it generalizes to the many small farms that serve colleges and universities We frame “sustainability” in terms of environmental and financial sustainability, but we also address the roles of supporting the local food community and of educating students. We address these aspects using the Farm’s operating parameters, financial data, and conclusions drawn from semi-structure interviews with key decision makers. We point out that while the Farm Manager operates organically (but not certifiably organic), the Farm’s small size means that it has little environmental impact. The Farm supports the local food movement by not competing (unfairly) against local farmers, which hampers the Farm’s financial viability. However, that financial unsustainability could be addressed readily if the Farm’s contribution to the students’ education was properly valued in its budget. Thus, the support the Farm offers to the local food community comes at relatively large financial costs, but its academic value outweighs those financial losses.
Q12|Effects of Food Prices on Poverty: The Case of Paraguay, a Food Exporter and a Non-Fully Urbanized Country|A vast proportion of households in developing countries like Paraguay are both consumers and producers of food, and thus the effects of food price fluctuations on welfare are not obvious. Historically, the agricultural sector in Paraguay has played a key role in economic development and has contributed significantly, and increasingly, to economic growth. In recent years, sharp movements in commodity prices have been added to the inherent volatility of the sector linked to climate conditions. In this work, we use the 2011/12 expenditure and income survey, as well as monthly price data for 127 food items for the period 2007/15, to simulate the effect of a potential hike in food prices on welfare. Our main results suggest that the expenditure effect is negative and regressive everywhere, but larger in rural than urban areas. The income effect is positive and progressive in rural areas and negligible in urban ones. Therefore, we find that the potential overall impact of an unexpected increase in food prices in Paraguay is a very flat U-shaped curve. We conclude with a simple exercise where we simulate a policy response in order to help those affected by the initial increase in food prices.
Q12|Assessing the Productivity Consequences of Agri-Environmental Practices When Adoption Is Endogenous| We address the general problem of selection bias, endemic to analyzing the effects of any policy where adoption is voluntary, with empirical application to environmental policies for agriculture. Many voluntary practices for mitigating the environmental impacts of agriculture provide external benefits while lowering productivity. Policy analysis of the productivity consequences is complicated by the fact that decision-makers can choose their own policy levers, an action that ruins any notion of random assignment. We introduce an identification strategy to correct this kind of endogeneity, combining classic methods from stochastic frontier analysis and selection models. Applying it to micro-level data from Finnish grain farms, we find that more efficient producers are more likely to enroll in subsidized practices. And, because these practices tend to reduce yield, frontier analysis without the endogeneity correction greatly understates productivity losses. In other words, naively basing the frontier estimator on the subset of less productive farms leads to downward bias in the resulting frontier estimates. In fact, average inefficiency more than doubles after the correction in this case. An outlier investigation also suggests that the lowest decile of farms are responsible for most of the selection bias in the uncorrected model.
Q12|Can contract farming in organic basmati rice be a boon to smallholders? Evidence from India:| Demand for organic basmati rice (OBR), both at home and abroad, coupled with policy reforms in India have given rise to contract farming (CF) production in that nation. OBR production, however, is highly susceptible to weather and pest risks. This study investigates the impact of smallholdersâ€™ perceived production risks on their adoption of CF in OBR farming. We also assess the impact of CF in OBR production on yields, prices received, and the livelihood of OBR producers. We use farm-level data from smallholder basmati rice farms in India and the endogenous switching regression method to account for heterogeneity.
Q12|Contract farming, productivity and fertilizer usage: Empirical evidence from specialty crop production| This study investigates the impact of contract farming (CF) in baby corn production on yield, irrigation costs, fertilizer costs and usage of chemical fertilizer. We find that adoption of CF by baby corn smallholders, after controlling for characteristics of both control and treatment groups, leads to higher yields and lower spending on fertilizers and irrigation. Additionally, CF in baby corn farming leads to a reduction in the use of chemical fertilizers (Urea and DAP). Thus, CF intervention benefits the livelihood of smallholders, reduces environmental degradation and reduces stress on groundwater without compromising yield.
Q12|The farm income problem in the European Union: a research framework and a longitudinal empirical evaluation|In this paper we first discuss the several empirical challenges that researchers had to face when considering the farm income problem. Therefore, we offer a brief but systematic review of the empirical literature on the farm problem since the seminal Gardner's paper of 1992. Taking into consideration the state of the art, we use data for the European countries from EU-SILC (Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) survey for the period 2005 - 2015 to carry out an empirical evaluation of the farm income problem in the European Union using a longitudinal panel approach to estimation and considering alternative definitions of the group of farm households. Similar to previous studies we don't find a strong evidence for the farm income problem in the European Union. The only exception is the group Central Eastern countries, where farm households are poorer that the rest of the population but only when they are defined according to a broad definition. Conversely, families mainly relying on farming as a source of income (narrow definition of agricultural households) show income levels similar to the rest of the population both at the EU level and across different geographic areas.
Q12|Land Measurement Bias: Comparisons from Global Positioning System, Self-Reports, and Satellite Data|Agricultural statistics derived from remote sensing data have been used primarily to compare land use information and changes over time. Nonclassical measurement error from farmer self-reports has been well documented in the survey design literature primarily in comparison to plots measured using Global Positioning System (GPS). In this paper, we investigate the reliability of remotely sensed satellite data on nonrandom measurement error and on agricultural relationships such as the inverse land size–productivity relationship and input demand functions. In our comparison of four Asian countries, we find significant differences between GPS and remotely sensed data only in Viet Nam, where plot sizes are small relative to the other countries. The magnitude of farmers’ self-reporting bias relative to GPS measures is nonlinear and varies across countries, with the largest magnitude of selfreporting bias of 130% of a standard deviation (2.2-hectare bias) in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic relative to Viet Nam, which has 13.3% of a standard deviation (.008-hectare bias). In all countries except Viet Nam, the inverse land size–productivity relationship is upwardly biased for lower land area self-reported measures relative to GPS measures. In Viet Nam, the intensive margin of organic fertilizer use is negatively biased by self-reported measurement error by 30.4 percentage points. As remotely sensed data becomes publicly available, it may become a less expensive alternative to link to survey data than rely on GPS measurement.
Q12|Resilience thresholds to temperature shocks in rural Tanzania: a long-run assessment|The study of household resilience is a key issue in development economics. This paper adds to the literature by exploring the role of resilience in mediating the relationship between food consumption growth and temperature shocks. To make up for the lack of long micro panels, we generate a synthetic panel for rural Tanzania covering the time span 2000 – 2013. Our main contribution is the identification of resilience thresholds below which households are unable to absorb the negative effects of temperature shocks. These thresholds have important implications for adaptation to climate change in developing countries and, more generally, significant consequences for policy-makers and intervention design.
Q12|Determinants of family farm income: Findings from the panel data on the type of production in the EU countries|The aim of this research is to present the family farm income and its determinants according to the type of production of farms in the EU countries in 2004-2016. Research is based on European Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), which includes information about average farms in the EU-28. These data include basic information about economic situation of 2335 production types according to the TF8 grouping, i.e.: fieldcrops, horticulture, wine, other permanent crops, milk, other grazing livestock, granivores and mixed.In this paper an attempt is made to use the panel models to evaluate the determinants of family farm income. The Gretl program is used to evaluate fixed effect models and random effect models allowing to indicate determinants of family farm income depending on the farm?s type of production.
Q12|Climate Change and Agriculture: Farmer Adaptation to Extreme Heat|This paper examines how farmers adapt, in the short-run, to extreme heat. Using a production function approach and micro-data from Peruvian households, we find that high temperatures induce farmers to increase the use of inputs, such as land and domestic labor. This reaction partially attenuates the negative effects of high temperatures on output. We interpret this change in inputs as an adaptive response in a context of subsistence farming, incomplete markets, and lack of other coping mechanisms. We use our estimates to simulate alternative climate change scenarios and show that accounting for adaptive responses is quantitatively important.
Q12|Climate resilience pathways of rural households: evidence from Ethiopia| Climate variability and extreme events continue to impose significant challenges to households, particularly to those that are less resilient. By exploring the resilience capacity of rural Ethiopian households after the drought shock occurred in 2011, using panel data, this paper shows important socio-economic and policy determinants of households' resilience capacity. Three policy indications emerge from the analysis. First, government support programmes, such as the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP), appear to sustain households' resilience by helping them to reach the level of pre-shock total consumption, but have no impact on the food-consumption resilience. Secondly, the 'selling out assets strategy' affects positively households' resilience, but only in terms of food consumption ' not total consumption. Finally, the presence of informal institutions, such as social networks providing financial support, sharply increases households' resilience by helping them to reach preshock levels of both food consumption and total consumption.
Q12|Decoupled but not neutral: The effects of stochastic transfers on investment and incomes in rural Thailand|In 2009, the Thai government implemented a price insurance scheme for rice farmers. The program, which was abandoned after only one year, added to the incomes of registered farmers a non-negative but stochastic amount that was decoupled from farmers' agricultural activities. A rich panel data set spanning from 2008 to 2013 enables us to control for self-selection into the program and to study its impact on small-scale rice farmers in relatively poor Northeastern Thailand. Program participation increases rice production but also leads to shifts in the composition of income generating activities away from agriculture, which may be beneficial for rural development. Decreasing risk-aversion and relieved credit constraints may be possible channels for these effects.
Q12|Is there a rainbow after the rain? How do agricultural shocks affect non-farm enterprises? Evidence from Thailand|Increasing weather volatility poses a significant threat to the livelihood of rural households in developing countries. While how rainfall shocks affect agricultural households has been well documented, there is not much evidence on the indirect effects on non-agricultural households. Combining household panel data with grid-level precipitation data, we analyze how rainfall shocks affect non-farm enterprises in rural Thailand. We examine the effects of rainfall shocks on labor supply for independent, non-farm activities as well as the indirect effects of rainfall shocks on non-farm enterprises through forward linkages, backward linkages and the consumption levels of farm households. We find that farm households increase their labor participation in non-farm self-employment in response to rainfall shocks. We also observe that rainfall shocks lead to increased input costs by non-farm enterprises in the food processing industry, to higher input costs by farms, to higher sales by agriculture-related non-farm enterprises and to lower expenditure by farm households on food and other consumption items. These effects are significant for surplus rainfall shocks (i.e., more rainfall than usual) but less robust for deficit rainfall shocks (i.e., less rainfall than usual), yet both surplus and deficit rainfall shocks lower agricultural production compared to normal rainfall conditions.
Q12|The Inverse Relationship between Farm Size and Productivity: Refocusing the Debate|The relationship between farm size and productivity is a recurrent topic in development economics, almost as old as the discipline itself. This paper emphasizes the importance of choice of productivity measures in the inverse relationship literature. First, we seek to clarify the common measures, their relationships, and their advantages and limitations in empirical work. Second, we argue that much of the existing literature inappropriately uses partial measures such as land productivity. Third, we discuss the dynamic nature of the farm size â€“ productivity relationship and show that the identification of these dynamics will in part depend upon the choice of productivity measure. Lastly, using a pseudo-panel of Brazilian farms that are aggregated at the municipality and farm size levels over the period 1985-2006, we provide new empirical evidence on the inverse relationship between farm size and both land productivity and total factor productivity. The empirical exercise highlights the importance of choice of measure when testing the inverse relationship. The inverse relationship between size and land productivity is alive and well. The relationship between total factor productivity and size, in contrast, has evolved with modernization during this period, becoming increasingly U-shaped or even positive.
Q12|The Effects of Risk and Ambiguity Aversion on Technology Adoption: Evidence from Aquaculture in Ghana| We study how aversion to risk and ambiguity aects the adoption of new tech- nologies by Ghanaian smallholder aquafarmers. We conduct a set of eld experiments designed to elicit farmers' risk and ambiguity preferences and combine it with survey- based information on their technology adoption decisions. We nd that aquafarmers who are more risk-averse were quicker to adopt the new technologies: a fast-growing breed of tilapia sh, extruded feed and oating cages. By contrast, ambiguity aversion has no eect on the adoption of the new tilapia breed and extruded feed. Furthermore, it slows down the adoption of oating cages - a technology which entails higher xed costs than the others - and the eect is diminishing in the number of other adopters in the village. We argue that these dierential eects are due to the fact that the technolo- gies are risk-reducing, with potential ambiguity about their payo distributions at the early stages of adoption. The ndings highlight the importance of distinguishing be- tween risk and ambiguity in investigating technology adoption decisions of small-holder farmers in developing countries.
Q12|Agricultural extension and input subsidies to reduce food insecurity. Evidence from a field experiment in the Congo|Small holder farming in sub-Saharan Africa is plagued by low productivity levels and high malnutrition. Extension services aim to increase knowledge and uptake of new technologies to boost yields. However, despite the potential benefits adoption rates are still low. One explanation may be that providing training and demonstration trials alone is not enough to increase input demand needed to raise productivity. Lifting multiple barriers simultaneously could prove to be more effective. We use a field experiment in eastern DRC to test whether adding input subsidies to an extension programme provides synergistic benefits. Specifically, in a sample of 64 villages that received an agricultural extension programme, a random half was given the opportunity to buy subsidised input packages. We estimate the impact of the subsidy scheme on knowledge, input use, yields and food security indicators. We find robust evidence on input use at the extensive margin: providing subsidies increases fertiliser uptake by 5 percentage points, while uptake of inoculant increases by 3 percentage points, one year after the subsidy scheme was introduced. These effects are substantial given the extremely low baseline use (3% in both cases) of fertiliser and inoculant even after the extension intervention. In addition, villages further away from these markets have lower adoption rates as cost of access increase. Our results caution against overoptimistic views on the downstream effects of productivity enhancing technologies and that investments in structural changes in markets are likely needed to stimulate growth in the agricultural sector.
Q12|Financial realities for farms in the European Union: Relationships between farming and governmental interactions within the Triple Helix concept|The objective of this study is to analyse the financial realities for the farming sector in European Union countries and their relationships with agricultural investment and public structural subsidies, from a perspective of farming- and governmental relationships as part of the Triple Helix approach. Firstly, the statistical information available within the Farm Accountancy Data Network for the former twenty seven European Union countries, related with the main items of the accounting balance sheet was investigated. Secondly, various financial indicators were calculated to analyse the principal financial constraints in these farms and finally, these findings with the levels of investment and structural support were reported. As a main conclusion, more adjusted structural policies in the European Union will be needed, taking these microeconomic contexts into account.
Q12|Large-Scale Farms and Smallholders: Evidence from Zambia|In light of the surge in large-scale farms in developing countries, concerns have been raised that smallholders may be negatively affected. There is, however, very little evidence beyond case studies to support these claims. Drawing on nationally representative household data sets and an inventory of large-scale farms in Zambia, this study investigates the relationship between large-scale farms and smallholders. First, we analyse the geographical contexts of wards that host large-scale farms and show that large-scale farms are found in wards with good infrastructure and soil quality. Second, we adopt a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impacts of large-scale farms on smallholders' area cultivated, maize yields, and access to fertiliser. We find that smallholders in wards with large-scale farms increase their area cultivated and maize yields, but have lower fertiliser usage. This hints at positive spillovers at the extensive and intensive margins but not at improved access to agricultural inputs. It is likely that these results are also driven by the emergence of medium-scale farms in these regions.
Q12|Identifying Factor Productivity from Micro-data: The case of EU agriculture|The classical problem of agricultural productivity measurement has regained interest owing to recent price hikes in world food markets. At the same time, there is a new methodological debate on the appropriate identification strategies for addressing endogeneity and collinearity problems in production function estimation. We examine the plausibility of four established and innovative identification strategies for the case of agriculture and test a set of related estimators using farmlevel panel datasets from seven EU countries. The newly suggested control function and dynamic panel approaches provide attractive conceptual improvements over the received ‘within’ and duality models. Even so, empirical implementation of the conceptual sophistications built into these estimators does not always live up to expectations. This is particularly true for the dynamic panel estimator, which mostly failed to identify reasonable elasticities for the (quasi-) fixed factors. Less demanding proxy approaches represent an interesting alternative for agricultural applications. In our EU sample, we find very low shadow prices for labour, land and fixed capital across countries. The production elasticity of materials is high, so improving the availability of working capital is the most promising way to increase agricultural productivity.
Q12|The productivity of family and hired labour in EU arable farming| This paper investigates the impact of labour force composition on productivity in EU arable farming. We test the heterogeneity of family and hired labour for a set of eight EU member states. To this end, we estimate augmented production functions using FADN data for the years 2001-2008. The results reject the notion that hired labour is generally less productive than family workers. In fact, hired labour is more productive than family members in countries traditionally characterised by family farms, namely France, West Germany and Poland. Here, an increase in reliance on hired labour or the shift of family labour to more productive tasks could raise productivity. This finding calls into question a main pillar of the received family farm theory. In about half the countries, there are no statistically different effects of both types of labour. For the United Kingdom, we find the classical case with family labour being more productive than hired labour. In this situation supervision by family members could increase productivity.
Q12|Storage infrastructure and agricultural yield: Evidence from a capital investment subsidy scheme|In a developing economy, the availability of storage infrastructure is considered essential for two purposes; the reduction of post-harvest losses resulting in food shortage, and allowing for gains from inter-temporal trade due to potential arbitrage opportunities arising out of volatility in food grain prices. This paper provides empirical evidence on a lesser studied impact of storage infrastructure, viz, agricultural yield. The author exploits potentially exogenous variation generated by the intensity of access to a capital investment subsidy program for construction and renovation of rural godowns in India to identify causal effects of better storage on yield. He finds that the program led to an increase in rice yield by 0.3 tons per hectare, approximately a 20% increase compared to the baseline. A potential mediating channel for such an effect would be reduced storage costs facilitating better investments in productive inputs. As supportive evidence, the author finds that fertilizer consumption increased by 21% in response to the intervention.
Q12|Large-scale farms and smallholders: Evidence from Zambia|In light of the surge in large-scale farms in developing countries, concerns have been raised that smallholders may be negatively affected.

Q12|Wirkungen von Direktzahlungen in der Landwirtschaft - ausgewählte Aspekte mit Bezug zum Strukturwandel|Die flächenbezogenen Direktzahlungen der ersten Säule der Gemeinsamen Agrarpolitik (GAP) stellen den größten Teil der öffentlichen Mittel an die aktiven Landwirte dar. Im Jahr 2016 beliefen sich diese Zahlungen für Deutschland auf 4,84 Mrd. Euro. Pro Hektar werden somit jährlich ewa 280 Euro gezahlt. Im Hinblick auf die Weiterentwicklung der GAP für die Zeit nach 2020 und aufgrund der großen finanziellen Bedeutung der Direktzahlungen für die Landwirte, werden teilweise kontroverse Diskussionen über die künftige Mittelverteilung und den Einsatz dieser Zahlungen zur bestmöglichen Erreichung von agrar- und umweltpolitischen Zielen geführt. Ein viel diskutiertes Thema ist insbesondere die Umverteilung der Direktzahlungen zugunsten kleinerer Betriebe. Um die Informationsbasis für Verhandlungen zu verbessern, hat das Bundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft (BMEL) das Thünen-Institut beauftragt, die Wirkungen der Direktzahlungen auf den Strukturwandel in der Landwirtschaft zu analysieren. Besondere Aspekte des uftrags waren die Überwälzung der Zahlungen an Verpächter, die Auswirkungen auf den betrieblichen Strukturwandel sowie Größeneffekte hinsichtlich des Betriebsaufwands und der Unternehmensgewinne. Um die Ergebnisse einer interessierten Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen, ird die auf einzelne Fragen des BMEL antwortende Stellungnahme nun publiziert. [...]
Q12|Consumption smoothing and the welfare cost of uncertainty|Separating the effects of uncertainty from realised events, and identifying the welfare effects of uncertainty, present a number of empirical challenges. Combining individuallevel panel data from rural Ethiopia with high-resolution meteorological data, we introduce a new proxy for income uncertainty - mean-preserving rainfall variability - and estimate that an increase in income uncertainty is associated with reductions in objective consumption and subjective well-being (SWB). Furthermore, 86% of the effect on SWB is attributed to the direct effects of uncertainty, consistent with a model of optimal expectations (Brunnermeier and Parker, 2005). In addition, we find that farmers in more uncertain environments are more resilient to realised rainfall shocks, consistent with a trade-off between optimism about the future and risk-management investments today. These findings suggest that the gains from further consumption smoothing are likely greater than estimates based solely on realised consumption fluctuations.
Q12|Climate Resilience Pathways of Rural Households. Evidence from Ethiopia|This paper explores the resilience capacity of rural Ethiopian households after the drought shock occurred in 2011. The work develops an original empirical framework able to capture the policy and socio-economic determinants of households’ resilience capacity by making parametric statistical assumption on the resilience distribution. To this end, the analysis employs a two-wave representative panel dataset aligned with detailed weather records while controlling for a large set of household- and community-level characteristics. The analysis shows that the majority of these factors affects significantly resilience capacity only in the group of households affected by the drought shock, suggesting that the observed effect relates to the adaptive capacity enabled by these factors, rather than a simple welfare effect. Three policy indications emerge from the findings of the empirical model. First, government support programmes, such as the PSNP, appear to sustain households’ resilience by helping them to reach the level of pre-shock total consumption, but have no impact on the food-consumption resilience. Secondly, the “selling out assets strategy” affects positively on households’ resilience, but only in terms of food consumption. Finally, the presence of informal institutions, such as social networks providing financial support, sharply increases households’ resilience by helping them to reach pre-shock levels of food and total consumption. Policies incentivizing the formation of these networks, through the participation of households to agricultural cooperative, agricultural associations, or community projects, may also help farmers in recovering their wealth level after a weather shock.
Q12|Estimating causal effects of cassava based value-webs on smallholders welfare: a multivalued treatment approach| The aim of the paper is to evaluate the impact of value-webs as an innovation in agricultural production on welfare of cassava smallholders in Nigeria. The estimation procedure involved the alternative process of multivalued treatment models when treatment units have multiple values. The study thus extends previous impact studies which focused on estimating causal effects from binary treatment units. The treatment units were determined from the extent of utilization of cassava which informed the classification of households into value-web groups. Value-web is defined here as a measure of joint linkages of product chains within the cassava system. The determinants of the choice of utilization were also estimated. Results show that value-web groups include non-cassava based households; low-level, middle-level and high-level value web groups at 32.4%, 34.1%, 24.4% and 9.1%, respectively. Resource allocation to cassava, farming experience, and access to improved cassava varieties increased probability of higher value-web activities. The ATE estimated from the model shows significant increases of up to N11, 560.14 (USD 37.9) and N11, 296.57(USD 37.04) in monthly farm income if non-cassava based and low-level web households became high-level web households.

Q12|Improved Post-Harvest Technology: What Impact on Nigeria s Smallholder Cassava Starch Processors Welfare?| This study examined the adoption of improved post-harvest technology for cassava processing and its impacts on welfare of Smallholder cassava starch processors. The study relied mainly on cross-sectional data collected through a survey conducted in the forest and guinea savanna zones of Nigeria. A multi-stage sampling procedure was used in selecting a sample frame of five hundred and seventy (570) cassava starch processors. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, logit model and the propensity score matching method. Smallholder cassava starch processing in Nigeria is mostly a female enterprise. The average age of the processors was 48 years, with an average household size of six. The decision to use improved technology is explained by number of income earners in the household, years of processing experience, cost of acquiring technology and the capacity of technology. This study found a positive and significant impact of improved post-harvest technology on output and income of smallholder cassava starch processors. Therefore, designing mechanisms to help promote use of improved technology among small-scale processors by developing affordable technologies appears to be a rational policy instrument to improve cassava starch processors welfare. Key words: cassava processing, improved technologies, output, income, Nigeria JEL: C21, D13, O33, Q12 Acknowledgement : Acknowledgments The study is an output of the Cassava Web Project funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) and the Deutsche Gesellschaft f r Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH.

Q12|Agricultural Commercialization, Fertilizer Use and Non-Farm Employment: What Options for Smallholder Farmers in Nigeria?| Abstract Agricultural commercialization is necessary for increased agricultural intensification and productivity in Nigeria. However, there is paucity of empirical information on the effects of agricultural commercialization on input use, labor demand and engagement in non-farm employment across the country. This study examined the effects of agricultural commercialization at the household level on fertilizer use, demand for hired labor and participation in non-farm employment in Northern Nigeria. Household Commercialization Index (HCI), Two-stage Least Squares (2SLS) and Instrumental Variable (IV) estimations were used to analyze the primary data collected from 270 maize farming households in Kaduna and Kano States. The study revealed that commercialization had the potentials for increasing the demand for fertilizer usage and hired labor among maize farming households. However, it reduced the tendency for households to participate in non-farm employment. Smallholder commercialization of maize should therefore be promoted through adoption of complementary technologies that free labor from on-farm activities.

Q12|Effects of agricultural commercialization on multidimensional poverty: Evidence from smallholder farmers in Kenya| While previous studies have examined the impacts of agricultural commercialization on farm household welfare in terms of income, the implications on multidimensional poverty have rarely been analyzed. We examine the impacts of commercialization on farm household welfare measured in terms of multidimensional poverty, with income-based poverty indicators as robustness checks. Using data from a sample of 805 farm households in Western Kenya and various econometric models, we measure average treatment effects, continuous treatment effects, and impact heterogeneity. Commercialization significantly reduces multidimensional poverty headcount by 35% and share of multiple deprivations in education, healthcare, and living standards by 39% and income poverty gap by 86% above the mean of less commercialized households. The impacts on per capita income are positive and significant. Generalized propensity score estimates show that commercialization continuously reduces multidimensional and income-based poverty. Quantile regressions results show that the absolute gains in per capita income are larger for the better-off, suggesting that commercialization may contribute to higher inequality. The effects of commercialization on multidimensional poverty are significant across different quantiles, but are largely homogeneous. The policy implications are discussed.

Q12|How to Make Farming and Agricultural Extension More Nutrition-Sensitive: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial in Kenya| We analyze how agricultural extension can be made more effective in terms of increasing smallholder farmers adoption of pro-nutrition technologies, such as biofortified crops. In a randomized controlled trial with farmers in Western Kenya, we implemented several extension treatments and evaluated their effects on the adoption of beans that were biofortified with iron and zinc. Difference-in-difference estimates show that intensive agricultural training tailored to local conditions can increase technology adoption considerably. Within less than one year, adoption of biofortified beans increased from almost zero to more than 20%. Providing additional nutrition training further increased adoption by another 10-12 percentage points, as this has helped farmers to better appreciate the technology s nutritional benefits. These results suggest that effective nutrition training through agricultural extension services is possible. Providing marketing training did not lead to additional adoption effects, although the study period may have been too short to measure these effects properly. This study is a first attempt to analyze how improved designs of agricultural extension can help to make smallholder farming more nutrition-sensitive. More research in this direction is needed.

Q12|Effect of subsidies on technical efficiency excluding or including environmental outputs: An illustration with a sample of farms in the European Union| With a sample of farms in the European Union (EU) and Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) data completed by additional data, we illustrate how the effect of farm subsidies on technical efficiency changes when environmental (good or bad) outputs are incorporated in the calculation of technical efficiency. Results indicate that the effect of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) operational subsidies on farm technical efficiency changes when environmental outputs (in this study: greenhouse gas emissions, nitrogen balance and ecological focus areas) are taken into account in the efficiency calculation: some effects change significance, and more importantly, some effects change sign.
Q12|Conservation agriculture and climate resilience|Agricultural productivity growth is vital for economic and food security outcomes which are threatened by climate change. In response, governments and development agencies are encouraging the adoption of ‘climate-smart’ agricultural technologies, such as conservation agriculture (CA). However, there is little rigorous evidence that demonstrates the effect of CA on production or climate resilience, and what evidence exists is hampered by selection bias. Using panel data from Zimbabwe, we test how CA performs during extreme rainfall events - both shortfalls and surpluses. We control for the endogenous adoption decision and find that use of CA in years of average rainfall results in no yield gains, and in some cases yield loses. However, CA is effective in mitigating the negative impacts of deviations in rainfall. We conclude that the lower yields during normal rainfall seasons may be a proximate factor in low uptake of CA. Policy should focus promotion of CA on these climate resilience benefits.
Q12|The impact of producer organisations on farm performance: A case study of large farms in Slovakia|This report estimates the farm level impact of producer organizationsâ€™ (PO) membership in Slovakia and the effectiveness of support provided to POs under the EU Rural Development Programme (RDP). We employ the PSM-DID econometric approach on a database of large Slovak commercial farms for 2006 and 2015. Our results show that belonging to a PO improves the economic performance of farms in Slovakia. In the short-run the support granted under RDP 2007-2013 to newly established PO does not improve the farm performance; only established and older POs (and potentially supported in the past) generate benefits to their members. Third, the estimates provide indirect evidence that the disbursement of PO support granted in the financial period 2007-2013 was rather ineffective in selecting POs with the highest potential to generate benefits to its members. Our analysis confirms that many POs were created for the sole purpose just to benefit from the support. This result is reinforced by the observed high closure rate of supported POs.
Q12|Jobs and Agricultural Policy: Impact of the Common Agricultural Policy on EU Agricultural Employment|This paper investigates the relationship between EU agricultural subsidies and the outflow of labor from agriculture. We use more representative subsidy indicators and a wider coverage (panel data from 210 EU regions over the period 2004-2014) than has been used before. The data allow to better correct for sample selection bias than previous empirical studies. We find that, on average, CAP subsidies reduce the outflow of labor from agriculture, but the effect is almost entirely due to decoupled Pillar I payments and the impact of Pillar II is mixed. Coupled Pillar I payments have no impact on reducing labor outflow from agriculture, i.e. on preserving jobs in agriculture. The impact of Pillar II is mixed. Our estimates predicts that a decline of 10 percent of the CAP budget would cause an extra 16,000 people to leave EU agriculture each year. A 10 percent decoupling would save 13,000 agricultural jobs each year.
Q12|On the role of probability weighting on WTP for crop insurance with and without yield skewness|A growing number of studies in finance and economics seek to explain insurance choices using the assumptions advanced by behavioral economics. One recent example in agricultural economics is the use of cumulative prospect theory (CPT) to explain farmer choices regarding crop insurance coverage levels (Babcock, 2015). We build upon this framework by deriving willingness to pay (WTP) for insurance programs under alternative assumptions, thus extending the model to incorporate farmer decisions regarding whether or not to purchase insurance. Our contribution is twofold. First, we study the sensitivity of farmer WTP for crop insurance to the inclusion of CPT parameters. We find that loss aversion and probability distortion increase WTP for insurance while risk aversion decreases it. Probability distortion in losses plays a particularly important role. Second, we study the impact of yield distribution skewness on farmer WTP assuming CPT preferences. We find that WTP decreases when the distribution of yields moves from negatively- to positively-skewed and that the combined effect of probability weighting in losses and skewness has a large negative impact on farmer WTP for crop insurance.
Q12|Jobs and Agricultural Policy : Impact of the Common Agricultural Policy on EU Agricultural Employment| This paper investigates the relationship between agricultural subsidies and the outflow of labor from agriculture. We use new and more representative subsidy indicators than have been used before and panel data from 215 EU regions over the period 2004-2014. The data allow to correct better for sample selection bias than previous empirical studies. We find that, on average, CAP subsidies reduce the outflow of labor from agriculture, but the effect is entirely due to decoupled payments and rural development payments. Coupled payments have no impact on reducing labor outflow from agriculture, i.e. on preserving farm employment. Acknowledgement :
Q12|Sell Low and Buy High: Arbitrage and Local Price Effects in Kenyan Markets|"Large and regular seasonal price fluctuations in local grain markets appear to offer African farmers substantial inter-temporal arbitrage opportunities, but these opportunities remain largely unexploited: small-scale farmers are commonly observed to ""sell low and buy high"" rather than the reverse. In a field experiment in Kenya, we show that credit market imperfections limit farmers' abilities to move grain inter-temporally. Providing timely access to credit allows farmers to buy at lower prices and sell at higher prices, increasing farm revenues and generating a return on investment of 28%. To understand general equilibrium effects of these changes in behavior, we vary the density of loan offers across locations. We document significant effects of the credit intervention on seasonal price fluctuations in local grain markets, and show that these GE effects shape individual level profitability estimates. In contrast to existing experimental work, the results indicate a setting in which microcredit can improve firm profitability, and suggest that GE effects can substantially shape microcredit's effectiveness. In particular, failure to consider these GE effects could lead to underestimates of the social welfare benefits of microcredit interventions."
Q12|Insurance Contracts when Individuals “Greatly Value” Certainty: Results from a Field Experiment in Burkina Faso|In discussing the paradoxical violation of expected utility theory that now bears his name, Maurice Allais noted that individuals tend to “greatly value” payoffs that are certain. Allais' observation would seem to imply that people will undervalue insurance relative to the predictions of expected utility theory because as conventionally constructed, insurance offers an uncertain benefit in exchange for a certain cost that certainty-loving individuals will overvalue. Pursuing this logic, we implemented insurance games with cotton farmers in Burkina Faso. On average, farmer willingness to pay for insurance increases significantly when a premium rebate framing is used to render both costs and benefits of insurance uncertain. We show that the impact of the rebate frame on the willingness to pay for insurance is driven by those farmers who exhibit a well-defined discontinuous preference for certainty, a concept that we adapt from the u-v model of utility and measure with a novel behavioral experiment. Given that the potential impacts of insurance for small scale farmers are high, and yet demand for conventionally framed contracts is often low, the insights from this paper suggest welfare-enhancing ways of designing insurance for low-income farmers.
Q12|The Economics of African American Slavery: The Cliometrics Debate|This working paper explores the significant contributions to the history of African-American slavery made by the application of the tools of cliometrics. As used here “cliometrics” is defined as a method of scientific analysis marked by the explicit use of economic theory and quantitative methods. American slavery of the late antebellum period [1840-1860] was one of the earliest topics that cliometricians focused on and, arguably, the topic upon which they made the largest impact.
Q12|Market Access, Trade Costs, and Technology Adoption: Evidence from Northern Tanzania|In this paper, we quantify market access in rural Tanzania, and the extent to which it constrains agricultural productivity. We collect granular data on farmer input and sales decisions, input and output prices, and travel costs in all 1,183 villages in two regions of Tanzania. We find that a village in the 90th percentile of the travel-cost adjusted price distribution faces input and output prices 40-55% less favorable than a village at the 10th percentile. In reduced form, an additional standard deviation of travel time is associated with 20-25% lower input adoption and output sales. We develop and quantify a spatial model of input adoption and conservatively estimate that farmers behave as if they face travel costs of 6% ad-valorem per kilometer of travel, which is equivalent to 40% when traveling to the closest retailer. Holding exogenous local factors fixed, we estimate that reducing travel costs by 50% (approximately the effect of paving rural roads) doubles adoption and reduces the adoption-remoteness gradient by 18%.

Q12|Effects if Fertilizer Subsidies in Zambia: A Literature Review|Fertilizer subsidies are again part of the policy agenda in Sub-Saharan Africa since the 1990s. Governments spend large shares of their agricultural budgets and their means to fight poverty on such programmes, but economists formulated doubts whether these investments will pay off. This paper reviews the existing literature on effects of fertilizer subsidies in Zambia, presents an analytical framework on input subsidies and compares the empirical evidence to the goals of the fertilizer subsidy. Major findings are that the subsidy programme has failed to substantially reduce poverty and to improve food security via decreased maize prices. Farm incomes have increased moderately, but the overall costs exceed the benefits by far. Reasons for this are identified as poor targeting, diversion and leakage. The paper concludes with a review of policy recommendations, mainly focused on improved targeting and diversification away from pure fertilizer subsidies.
Q12|Efficiency of sustainability management in Bulgarian agriculture|This paper applies a holistic framework for assessing efficiency of environmental and sustainability management in Bulgarian agriculture. Initially the multiprinciple, multictiteria and mulriindicator framework for assessing environmental and sustainability management in agriculture is outlined. After that environmental sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture at national and farms levels is evaluated. Finally, factors for improving environmental and sustainability management in agricultural farms in the country are identified. Our assessment at national and farm level have found out that there are significant discrepancies in efficiency levels based on aggregate national data and assessment (perception) of farm managers. Therefore, in management practices all kind of data have to be used in order to be able to take efficient decision at different managerial levels. Having in mind the importance of holistic assessments of efficiency of environmental and sustainability management in agriculture, and the enormous benefits for the farm management and agrarian policies, such studies are to be expended and their precision and representation increased.
Q12|Impact of governing modeson agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria|Specific system of governance in different countries, regions, subsectors, etc., eventually determines the speed and type of socio-economic development. Despite its big academic and practical importance, in Bulgaria and other countries in East Europe, there are very few empirical studies on dominating governing structures in agriculture, and their impact(s) on agrarian sustainability. In this paper the interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics framework is incorporated, and the impact of diverse market, private, collective, public and hybrid modes of governance on agrarian sustainability at the current stage of development in Bulgaria assessed. First, the methodological framework of the study is outlined. After that dominating governing modes in Bulgarian farms of different juridical type, size, specialization, ecological and geographical location are identified, and their impacts on agrarian sustainability and its economic, social, and environmental pillars evaluated. In conclusion implications for further research, public policy improvement, and private managerial strategy formation are presented. Agricultural producers of different use quite unlike mixture of effective market, private, collective and hybrid modes for governance of their activities and relations. Individual factors and modes most contributing to improvement of agrarian sustainability at the current stage of development are: manager’s personal convictions and initiatives, farms resources and innovation potential, near future profit and benefits strategies, market prices levels and dynamics, area-based EU subsidies, and informal agreements. Research on relations between the governing structure and agrarian sustainability is to continue though increasing representation, and the spectrum of specific governing modes used by farms of different type as well as assessments of the impact of institutions on agrarian sustainability and the impact of the governance at different hierarchical levels. The latter however, requires a new kind of micro and macro data, and a close cooperation between all interested parties.
Q12|Production and Exports of Kidney Beans in the Kyrgyz Republic: Value Chain Analysis|This report provides results of the study of the kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) production and the marketing value chain in the Kyrgyz Republic. The main tool of this survey is field study of farmers, dealers-wholesalers, and bean exporters with elements of quantitative and qualitative methods, as well as the results of desk analysis using open sources of information. The report analyzes agrotechnical conditions for bean production, including data on bean-related phytosanitary safety and the situation with bean-related food safety standards when exporting it and marketing problems in foreign markets. Findings of the study include the main barriers and constraints to increasing domestic production, improving bean quality and processing, and improving the phytosanitary situation and food safety standards; recommendations on Kyrgyz bean market improvement are also included.
Q12|Efficiency of agrarian governance in Bulgaria|Empirical studies on efficiency of the governance system in agriculture are very rare. That is a consequence of both theoretical and practical challenges. The criteria and approach for assessing social efficiency are still debated while appropriate statistical, accountancy, etc. data for evaluation diverse mechanisms and modes of governance are not readily available. This is a first attempt for a comprehensive empirical study on the efficiency of the system of agrarian governance in Bulgaria. Since there is a social “contract” about sustainable agrarian development in EU and Bulgaria, the impact to sustainability is taken as a criterion for assessing the social efficiency of the governance system. The interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics framework is incorporated, and the impact of institutional environment and diverse market, private, collective, public and hybrid modes of governance on agrarian sustainability at the current stage of development in Bulgaria assessed. First, the methodological framework of the study is outlined. After that impact of major components of institutional environment of agrarian sustainability evaluated. Following, dominating governing modes in Bulgarian farms of different juridical type, size, specialisation, ecological and geographical location are identified, and their impacts on agrarian sustainability assessed. In conclusion implications for further research, public policy improvement, and private managerial strategy formation are presented.
Q12|Institutions and sustainability – insights from Bulgarian agriculture|The specific system of governance is a critical factor, which to a great extent (pre)determines the type and speed of development in different countries, industries, regions, communities, etc. This article tries to fill the gap and assesses the impact of institutional environment on agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria. The interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics framework is applied and assessment made on specific effects of major components of the “external” institutional environment on agrarian sustainability level in different administrative, geographical and ecological regions, subsectors of agriculture, and farms of various juridical type and size. Our study has found out that individual elements of external institutional, market and natural environment affect quite unequally farms of different types, individual subsectors of agriculture, and specific ecological and geographical regions. This type of studies is to be expended and their precision and representation increased. The latter however, requires a close cooperation between all interested parties, and participation of the farmers, agrarian organisations, local and central authorities, interest groups, research institutes and experts, etc.

Chapters give a deep insights on diverse issues associated with agrarian and rural development in Bulgaria and China.
Q12|Modelling Efficiency Effects in a True Fixed Effects Stochastic Frontier|This paper proposes a stochastic frontier panel data model which includes time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity along with the efficiency effects. Following Paul and Shankar (2018), the efficiency effects are specified by a standard normal cumulative distribution function of exogenous variables which ensures the efficiency scores to lie in a unit interval. This specification eschews one-sided error term present in almost all the existing inefficiency effects models. The model parameters can be estimated by non-linear least squares after removing the individual effects by the usual within transformation or using non-linear least squares dummy variables (NLLSDV) estimator. The efficiency scores are directly calculated once the model is estimated. An empirical illustration based on widely used panel data on Indian farmers is presented.
Q12|Application of Optimized SFCL and STATCOM for the Transient Stability and LVRT Capability Enhancement of Wind Farms|In this paper, the combined superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) and STATCOM are used to improve transient stability and low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability of wind turbine generation system (WTGS). The SFCL absorbs the accelerating energy of the generator, and therefore, improves the WTGS transient stability. Also, STATCOM helps the restore connecting point voltage to improve LVRT capability by reactive power compensation (RPC) after fault clearing. The optimization problem of SFCL resistance and STATCOM capacity is formulated based on the transient stability and LVRT capability of WTGS. The Simulation study shows the superior improving LVRT capability of combined SFCL and STATCOM over individual SFCL or STATCOM. Also, the requirement capacity of STATCOM for RPC is significantly reduced. PSCAD/EMTDC software(V4.2) is used for simulation.
Q12|Effects of Natural Disaster on Rice Production at Farm Level: New Evidence from Vietnam|The current study uses a unique balanced panel of 3,922 households between 2008 and 2010 to examine the extent to which rice production in Vietnam is affected by natural disasters and how coping strategies lessen the negative effects of natural disaster, using a fixed effects model that controls for time invariant farm heterogeneity. With regard to natural disaster, we find evidence of the negative inter-temporal occurrence and negative inter-temporal severity effects, and the negative current occurrence one as well. With regard to coping strategies, we find various evidence of current, inter-temporal coping-occurrence and coping severity effects, depending on kinds of coping strategies.
Q12|Misperceived Quality: Fertilizer in Tanzania|Fertilizer use remains below recommended rates in most of Sub-Saharan Africa, contributing to poor crop yields and poverty. Farmers voice suspicion that available fertilizer is often adulterated, but these concerns are not backed by reliable evidence. In fact, an insight from industry but absent from academic literature is that profitable fertilizer adulteration is difficult. We surveyed all fertilizer sellers in Morogoro Region, Tanzania and tested 633 samples of their fertilizer. We also conducted a willingness-to-pay assessment with farmers. We find that fertilizers meet nutrient standards but that belief of rampant product adulteration persists among farmers. We find evidence of a quality inference problem in the market: 25% of fertilizer has deteriorated in observable ways and farmers rely on these observable attributes to (incorrectly) assess unobservable nutrient quality. We show that this misperception likely reduces technology adoption beyond the effect of nutrient quality being unobservable.
Q12|A preliminary test on risk and ambiguity attitudes, and time preferences in decisions under uncertainty: towards a better explanation of participation in crop insurance schemes|The exposure of farmers to different (and increasing) risks has been recognized by the EU policy, which supports several risk management tools through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Despite the vulnerability of the agricultural sector, and the attention paid at the EU level, the uptake of such tools is generally low across EU countries. The Italian case is emblematic: the uptake of subsidized crop insurance contracts is low, limited to few products, and concentrated in few areas. Coherently, the interest of policy makers toward explaining these characteristics and in gaining insights on the interventions that may help promoting participation is intense. This contribution investigates behavioral aspects linked to choices under risk and ambiguity, and account for time preferences in order to mimic the scenario faced by the potential adopters of the subsidized crop insurance contracts in Italy. Data are collected through questionnaires submitted to students from agricultural colleges in three administrative regions located in northern, central and southern Italy. Results show that attitude toward risk, ambiguity, and impatience are correlated with the intrinsic characteristics of respondents. In addition, some of those attitudes may help explaining decisions under uncertainty. Despite the empirical analysis is preliminary and focused on students, it allowed to validate a promising methodological approach capable of explaining farmer’s willingness to adopt (or renew) insurance contracts. By accounting for (currently under-investigated) behavioral aspects, it is likely to prove useful to re-design or implementing, more effectively, the current policies.
Q12|Cost-Benefit Analysis of Zimbabwe’s Livestock Development Program for the Reduction of Rural Poverty and Increasing of Income and Food Security on Beef, Dairy by Improving Hygiene in their Nutritional Practices and Building of Capacity|The Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) conducted in this program was aimed at reducing rural poverty and that will increase the incomes and food security looking at the value chain on beef and dairy for farmers producing in small scale and also to improve their hygiene and nutritional practices and building the capacity that will enhance agricultural development. The results of the cost- benefit analysis (CBA). It shows that annual income for beef cattle farmers would increase by USD419. The financial returns are driven by the significant increase in the costs associated with adopting Good Animal Husbandry Practices (GAHPs). The Veterinary Costs will increase by 475% while feeding and labor costs increased by an estimated to be 169% and 148% respectively. There also will be an increase in employment as a result of the increase in labour cost in the Value Chain.
Q12|Cost Benefit Analysis of Agricultural Interventions to Enhance the Production of Cowpea, Groundnuts, Maize and Soybeans Value Chains in Nigeria|This report presents the results of the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of a series of agriculture production and productivity enhancing interventions in Nigeria. More than 20,000 impoverished farmers have received assistance under this program. A CBA was undertaken to assess the financial and economic benefits of adopting best agricultural practices by these farmers in growing crops. While these interventions do improve the households’ incomes across all VCs, the assistance alone will not allow the households to move above the poverty line threshold. Households need to rely on other economic activities, including livestock husbandry, or non-farm employment to graduate from extreme poverty.

Q12|The Cost- Benefit Analysis for Resilience in the Sahel Enhanced on Vulnerable households in Burkina Faso and Niger|The CBA for Burkina Faso and Niger, evaluated the projects for the interventions implemented in agriculture, poultry, and small ruminant value chains (VCs). The interventions, investment costs, and the number of beneficiaries in the VC for this CBA were such that agricultural VC interventions, Resilience and Economic Growth in the Sahel – Accelerated Growth (REGIS-AG’s) beneficiaries were 41,224 and 61,254 farmers respectively. This program assessed the “Sustainable Livelihoods Component” with a focus on Conservation Farming (CF). This encompasses the use of an assortment of climate-adapted farming practices to intensify agricultural productivity in the cowpea, millet, and sorghum VCs, with the objective of increasing the income of households and access to food. CF was introduced to 58,670 farmers in Burkina Faso and 24,280 farmers in Niger. The beneficiaries from the cowpea VC were 21,700 and 23,322 for the poultry VC, which was on chicken production the intervention reached 13,157 and 13,801 beneficiaries in Burkina – Faso and Niger, respectively.
Q12|On the role of probability weighting on WTP for crop insurance with and without yield skewness|A growing number of studies in finance and economics seek to explain insurance choices us- ing the assumptions advanced by behavioral economics. One recent example in agricultural economics is the use of cumulative prospect theory (CPT) to explain farmer choices regarding crop insurance coverage levels (Babcock, 2015). We build upon this framework by deriving willingness to pay (WTP) for insurance programs under alternative assumptions, thus extend- ing the model to incorporate farmer decisions regarding whether or not to purchase insurance. Our contribution is twofold. First, we study the sensitivity of farmer WTP for crop insurance to the inclusion of CPT parameters. We find that loss aversion and probability distortion in- crease WTP for insurance while risk aversion decreases it. Probability distortion in losses plays a particularly important role. Second, we study the impact of yield distribution skewness on farmer WTP assuming CPT preferences. We find that WTP decreases when the distribution of yields moves from negatively- to positively-skewed and that the combined effect of proba- bility weighting in losses and skewness has a large negative impact on farmer WTP for crop insurance.
Q12|Somewhere in between towns, markets, and neighbors – Agricultural transition in the rural-urban interface of Bangalore, India|This paper presents a flexible conceptual and methodological framework to model the dynamics of agricultural transition in the increasingly complex rural-urban interfaces of large cities. Our empirical analysis is based on data of a household survey conducted in the rural-urban interface of Bangalore, India. In our analysis we follow a polycentric perspective of urbanization and introduce a two-dimensional variable to measure its effects. Furthermore, we accommodate high input and crop diversity by applying a Structured Additive Regression (STAR) model. Our results show that satellite towns and road infrastructure are the main channels by which urbanization drives agricultural transition. Access to satellite towns appears to be more strongly associated with the modernization of smallholders’ management systems than access to the urban center of Bangalore. Our results suggest that more flexible models are necessary to understand the dynamics of agricultural transition in the surroundings of fastgrowing large towns, the kind of town expected to be dominating the urbanization trend in the coming decades.
Q12|Plant Breeders’ Rights, Patents, and Incentives to Innovate| Both patents and Plant Breeders’ Rights (PBRs) can protect plant innovations. Unlike patents, PBRs allow farmers to save part of their harvest to replant. We analyze the impact of this exemption on prices and innovation in a monopoly setting. In a PBR regime, a monopolist might let farmers self-produce, and he over- or under-invests compared to socially optimal investments. Under a PBR and patent regime, large (small) innovations are more likely to be patented (protected with PBRs), but self-production is not completely prevented, private investments are often socially optimal, and incentives to innovate are boosted. However, overall effects on welfare are ambiguous.
Q12|Determinants of Amazon Deforestation: The role of Off-Farm Income|This paper aims at assessing the determinants of Amazon deforestation, with an emphasis on the role played by off-farm income. We first present a microeconomic model which relates off-farm income to deforestation patterns. We then test the empirical implications by using data on the 2006 Brazilian Agricultural Census. Our results suggest that an increase in off-farm income tends to reduce deforestation. This may be explained by the fact that greater off-farm opportunities tends to increase the opportunity cost of farm labor. Results also show that smallholders are less responsive to the increase in the returns of off-farm activities than large ones, which is in line with our hypothesis of labor market imperfections regarding off-farm activities.
Q12|Le secteur laitier français est-il compétitif face à la concurrence européenne et mondiale ?|With the end of milk quotas, the increasing openness of economies and the increased volatility of international prices, the question of the competitiveness of the French dairy sector is at the heart of many debates. Competitiveness is generally defined as the ability of a company or a country to conquer and/or maintain market shares in the face of competition both on the domestic and export markets. The French dairy sector is not only an important player in European and international trade in dairy products, but it has some good opportunities in the domestic market, including for high-value products. The decline in domestic consumption (in milk equivalent), the gradual saturation of the European demand and competition from several other European countries are now an incentive to develop our exports to more distant markets showing a growth in demand. Compared to other European or international competing countries (New Zealand, United States), the cost of producing milk in France, especially in the West (main French dairy region), is favored by low inputs, particularly because of abundant forage production (autonomy for feeding dairy cows). The way of achieving such a high level of autonomy, however, weights today on the average level of labor productivity and on the structure of expenses (high cost of mechanization) due to the importance of forages now mostly grown, harvested and distributed mechanically

Q12|Hortinlea Baseline Survey Report 2014|This report summarizes major findings from the HORTINLEA survey conducted in 2014 under the framework of HORTINLEA project. The HORTINLEA project is an inter-disciplinary research project addressing food security in East Africa, particularly in Kenya. The project targets to improve the livelihood and nutritional situation of the rural and urban poor. To achieve this, it focuses on production and consumption of horticultural crops, especially of African indigenous vegetables (AIVs). The HORTINLEA survey, conducted in rural, peri-urban and urban areas of Kenya focused on AIV actors along the value chain namely: producers, traders and consumers. The survey was carried out in September and October, 2014 where data was collected at the household, plot and community levels. It was administered using structured questionnaire with Geo-codes where more than 1500 actors were interviewed along the AIV value chain. Various topics were covered in the survey including household composition, education, health, assets, expenditure, credit and saving, agricultural and AIV production, agricultural and AIV marketing, nutrition, shocks and coping strategies. The most widely produced African Indigenous vegetable is African nightshade produced by about 72 procent of respondents followed by cowpeas produced by about 48 procent of respondents. AIVs are traditionally considered as â€œwomenâ€™s cropâ€ where almost 60 procent of the producers stated that women are responsible for producing AIVs and in about 57 procent of the sample women are also responsible for marketing of AIVs. Most of the sampled households sell their AIV produce where African nightshade is the most marketed one. However, most producers do not have contract with the buyer, but rather sell their produce directly to consumers. Most AIV producers sell their produce either at the farm gate or at a stand on weekly markets while less than two percent of respondents sell their AIVs via supermarkets. Even though the AIV value chain has many challenges, it has as well opportunities to improve. First, the link between producers to retailers and consumers could be expanded and formalized so that producers could benefit from marketing of these products. Second, post-harvest handling and transportation system of AIVs should be improved to ensure good quality and timely delivery of AIVs to consumers. Third, processing and value-addition activities could be introduced, which on the one hand improve the quality of the AIV product, while on the other hand create employment opportunity at different segments of the value chain.
Q12|Fertilizer and Sustainable Intensification in Africa|The paper investigates the important role of fertilizer to enhance sustainable intensification and food security in Sub-Saharan Africa based on a multi-disciplinary literature review. The review starts with a macro-perspective taking population growth, economic development and climate change into account. This is complemented with a micro-perspective summarizing findings from comprehensive micro-data in selected African countries. Agronomic, environmental and economic profitability implications of fertilizer use are reviewed. An assessment is made whether small farmers in Africa should be considered rational or partly irrational agricultural decision-makers and whether this can affect fertilizer use. I then discuss some controversial and promising policy approaches that may have the potential to enhance sustainable intensification and nutrient use efficiency in African agriculture before I conclude.
Q12|The Economics of Fertilizer Subsidies|Fertilizer and other input subsidies have been a prominent component of agricultural policies in many Asian and African countries since the 1960s. Their economic and political rationale is scrutinized with emphasis on the second generation of targeted input subsidy programs that were scaled up in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) after 2005. The extent to which they full-fill the goal of being ‘market smart’ is assessed after inspecting the potential for such subsidies in SSA. The new fertilizer subsidy programs do not live up the market smart principles and suffer from severe design and implementation failures. While a clear exit strategy was one of the key principles, this principle has been neglected with the result that most current programs are more ‘sticky’ than ‘smart’. They have only partially achieved the intended impacts and have resulted in a number of unintended negative impacts. Redesign should start from a pilot stage testing basic mechanisms.
Q12|Spillovers as a Driver to Reduce Ex-post Inequality Generated by Randomized Experiments: Experiments from an Agricultural Training Intervention|Randomized experiments ensure equal opportunities but could generate unequal outcomes by treatment status, which is socially costly. This study demonstrates a sequential intervention to conduct impact evaluation and subsequently to mitigate “experiment-driven” inequality. Specifically, control farmers were initially restricted from exchanging information with treated farmers, who received rice management training, to satisfy the stable unit treatment value assumption. We then encouraged information exchange between farmers one year after the training. We found positive training effects, but performance gaps created by our randomized assignment disappeared over time because of information spillovers and, hence, eventually control farmers also benefitted from our experiment.
Q12|Unraveling the Threads of Decentralized Community-Based Irrigation Systems in Bolivia|Irrigation is a key determinant of agricultural productivity, income, and sustainable development. This paper estimates the impact of the National Irrigation Program with a Watershed Approach (PRONAREC) on the value of agricultural production, investments in complementary technologies, household income, and water resource management in rural communities in Bolivia. We use a unique cross-sectional data set collected from a sample of 1,682 farmers (583 beneficiaries and 1,099 controls) for the 2014-2015 agricultural cycle. To evaluate the effects of the program, we exploit special features of the program design by comparing two rounds of program participants: treated communities are those that received the program first, while control communities are those that were in the pipeline to receive the treatment at a later period. The strategy controls for program placement and self-selection bias at the community level, and we control for self-selection based on observable characteristics with the implementation of Propensity Score Matching. The results show that participation in the program improved the value of agricultural production, and it triggered a deeper process of technological change that led to investments in complementary inputs. Additionally, there is evidence PRONAREC has strengthened farmers’ access to markets, increased household incomes, promoted the formalization of water users’ associations, and improved the organization and management of irrigation systems. Nevertheless, the lack of effects on agricultural productivity suggests program beneficiaries are in the upward sloping curve of the learning process
Q12|Livestock Transfers, Food Security and Women’s Empowerment: Evidence from a Randomized Phased-in Program in Nicaragua|This paper explores the impact of a livestock transfer program, that targeted small-holder female farmers with high levels of food insecurity in Nicaragua. For this purpose, the three dimensions of food security are assessed (i.e. access, availability and food use). The analysis uses a double difference estimation combined with a propensity score matching to capture the effects of program participation on a sample of 1200 farmers, representative of treatment and control groups. Also, taking advantage of a randomized phased-in, the findings are tested for a smaller sample of beneficiary farmers. The results confirm that program participation improve households’ food security through higher income from livestock sales and home consumption from own production (i.e. access and availability). Also, some evidence is found that food use is also improved by greater protein intake. Moreover, positive impacts on women’s empowerment and gender parity within the household are found, mainly driven by higher level of associativity.
Q12|Climate change and agriculture: farmer adaptation to extreme heat| This paper examines how farmers adapt, in the short-run, to extreme heat. Using a production function approach and micro-data from Peruvian households, we find that high temperatures induce farmers to increase the use of inputs, such as land and domestic labor. This reaction partially attenuates the negative effects of high temperatures on output. We interpret this change in inputs as an adaptive response in a context of subsistence farming, incomplete markets, and lack of other coping mechanisms. We use our estimates to simulate alternative climate change scenarios and show that accounting for adaptive responses is quantitatively important.
Q12|Looking beyond the farm and household: Determinants of on-farm diversification in India|"This paper analyses the factors affecting on-farm diversification decision. Notwithstanding the influence of farm and household conditions, studies have also highlighted the role of external pull factors on farm diversification. Though appraised in scholarship, this aspect has eluded an empirical scrutiny in literature. Taking India as a case, this study shows that apart from farm and household factors, there is a broader agro-ecological and structural feature which impacts on-farm diversification decision. Correcting for endogeneity in a seemingly unrelated system of ordered probit models, a ""three-stage"" residual inclusion model is estimated. The findings show that proximity to social infrastructure such as schools, colleges, and access to public transport matters for diversification. Results also show that though urbanization may increase demand for variety of products, it might as well impinge upon farm labor supply as non-farm opportunities also rises with urbanization. Thus, the underlying structure of the local economy also merits attention while understanding on-farm diversification process."
Q12|The impact of producer organisations on farm performance: A case study of large farms in Slovakia| This paper estimates the farm level impact of producer organizations (PO) membership in Slovakia and the effectiveness of support provided to POs under the EU Rural Development Programme (RDP). We employ the PSM-DID econometric approach on a database of large Slovak commercial farms for 2006 and 2015. First, our results show that belonging to a PO improves the economic performance of farms in Slovakia. Second, in the short-run the support granted under RDP 2007-2013 to newly established PO does not improve the farm performance; only established and older POs (and potentially supported in the past) generate benefits to their members. Third, the estimates provide indirect evidence that the disbursement of PO support granted in the financial period 2007-2013 was rather ineffective in selecting POs with the highest potential to generate benefits to its members. Our analysis confirms that many POs were created for the sole purpose just to benefit from the support. This result is reinforced by the observed high closure rate of supported POs.

Q12|Effects of trade policy on technological innovation in agricultural markets - implications for the developing economies|An induced technological innovation, which may be biased as a result of policy orientation, can have a complex impact on the traded commodity, particularly in a market with highly differentiated products. Furthermore, especially for developing countries, most of which are based on agriculture, it is important to understanding that impact. This paper aims to study a recent policy change at the European Union, by using an Ex-Ante method and a displacement model. The policy change affected global apple exports, particularly for large exporters such as China, South Africa, Chile, and the United States. Considering data availability, the project focuses on the U.S. market to study the impact of the EU’s policy-induced, biased, and technological innovation in the U.S. agricultural industry. The results and policies implications are generally applicable to other major agricultural exporters, including those from developing countries.
Q12|Working Paper 304 - The Use of Cash Versus Food Transfers in Eastern Niger|Food assistance in the form of cash has increased in recent years, in part due to proven cost and timeliness advantages relative to food transfers. Moreover, economic theory generally predicts that providing greater choice should improve welfare, such that food consumption outcomes should be the same or better with cash than with food transfers. Empirical investigations have shown, however, that people sometimes prefer to receive food, and that the marginal propensity to consume food is often greater from in-kind than from cash transfers. The mechanisms and rationale behind the conditional superiority of food transfers is not fully understood. This paper presents a model of household decision making that integrates cash versus food transfers and frictions (transaction costs), to generate predictions about the use of transfers, acknowledging the infra- or extra- marginality of different components of the food basket. The model predicts that when food is extra-marginal a food transfer of an inexpensive staple grain can have negative impacts on dietary diversity, relative to a cash transfer, but positive impacts for higher quality food transfers. These differences are primarily due to the transaction costs involved in selling food that lower the shadow prices of extra-marginal transferred foods. I find support for this model using data from a randomized cash-food pilot project in Eastern Niger.JEL classification: Q12, Q14, Q18 Keywords: cash transfers; food assistance; development economics; household models; Niger
Q12|Persistence in Food Insecurity and Poverty in Ethiopia| Using three rounds of data from the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS), we estimate a series of dynamic random effect probit models accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and the initial conditions problem using four measures of food insecurity and poverty. The descriptive analysis suggest higher levels of downward mobility and lower rates of exit for the food insecurity measures relative to food poverty and general poverty. There also appear to be lower levels of persistence in the subjective measure of food insecurity although for all measures close to the majority of the sample experience at least one period of food insecurity, food or general poverty. The estimation results provide some evidence of persistence or state dependence exists for subjective food insecurity, food and relative poverty measures. There is also evidence of cross effects so that being subjectively food insecure in the past increases the probability of being food poor and relatively poor in the current period.
Q12|From Farm to Kitchen: Gender, production diversity and dietary intake| We estimated a two-step control function procedure on panel and four different models on the cross section data using the latest three round panel of the Ethiopian socioeconomic survey. The results from our cross section and panel estimates show a positive and significant relationship between production diversity and dietary diversity. In addition, we also see that production diversity has different outcomes between male and female headed household. Before the impact of production diversity is accounted for being in a female headed households does increase consumption diversity. However, there is evidence of a negative and significant interaction between gender and production diversity. This suggests that the mechanism through which production diversity affects consumption diversity differs in female headed households. As are result the overall impact of gender on consumption diversity is negligible (when estimated at mean values). Market access, access to extension services and the availability of a nonfarm business are also positively related with consumption of diversified diet. Key words: Production diversity, dietary diversity, gender, Ethiopia. JEL CODES: Q12 Q18 Q01
Q12|Measuring the financial efficiency of agricultural cooperatives in South Africa: An application of the Simar-Wilson methodology| The SA government has favored cooperatives over other types of corporate entities in its programmes for rural development. This study examines financial efficiency and its determinants for 387 agricultural cooperatives in SA using a two-stage double bootstrap approach. Bias-corrected Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) efficiency estimates are obtained in the first-stage for the agricultural cooperatives. Next, a Double Bootstrapped Truncated Regression model was estimated to obtain bias-corrected scores. The model was designed to obtain DEA scores for financial efficiency. First-stage results indicate that many agricultural cooperatives are relatively inefficient. Results of the second-stage analysis identified significant determinants of efficiency as age of cooperatives, size, gender of management, governance indicators and training. Governance indicators negatively influencing efficiency indicate institutions that prioritize non-financial goals and consequently compromise on governance quality. The deviation from institutional control mechanisms most likely emerges in a weak institutional environment. Various types of training influenced financial efficiency meaning that an understanding of training needs across institutions is crucial for equipping and empowering cooperatives towards financial efficiency. The study shows that the design and implementation of suitable training programs are prerequisites for addressing financial efficiency of agricultural cooperatives.

Q12|The Effects of Risk and Ambiguity Aversion on Technology Adoption: Evidence from Aquaculture in Ghana|We study how aversion to risk and ambiguity affects the adoption of new technologies by Ghanaian smallholder aquafarmers. We conduct a set of field experiments designed to elicit farmers's risk and ambiguity preferences and combine it with surveybased information on their technology adoption decisions. We find that aquafarmers who are more risk-averse were quicker to adopt the new technologies: a fast-growing breed of tilapia fish, extruded feed and floating cages. By contrast, ambiguity aversion has no effect on the adoption of the new tilapia breed and extruded feed. Furthermore, it slows down the adoption of floating cages - a technology which entails higher fixed costs than the others - and the effect is diminishing in the number of other adopters in the village. We argue that these differential effects are due to the fact that the technologies are risk-reducing, with potential ambiguity about their payoff distributions at the early stages of adoption. The findings highlight the importance of distinguishing between risk and ambiguity in investigating technology adoption decisions of small-holder farmers in developing countries.
Q12|Wealth Heterogeneity and the Income Elasticity of Migration|How do income shocks affect international migration flows from poor countries? Income growth not only increases the opportunity cost of migration but also eases liquidity constraints. I develop a method to separate these countervailing individual effects and identify the overall income elasticity of migration. Using new administrative and census data from Indonesia, I find that positive agricultural income shocks increase labor emigration flows, particularly in villages with relatively more small landholders. However, in the most developed rural areas, persistent income shocks reduce emigration. Overall, the findings highlight the important role of wealth heterogeneity in shaping migration flows as incomes rise.
Q12|Risk management and coping strategies: climate change and agriculture in the Philippines|We provide an initial framework to guide government priorities among programs seeking to reduce the natural-disaster vulnerability of Philippine farm households. The framework sheds light on the pros and cons of alternative policies to reduce household vulnerability, paying particular attention to the role of discounting. The limited coping tools available to low-income households strengthen the case for preventive polices that reduce the probability or the severity of damages. We argue, however, that the inability of poor households to cope with increased exposure to risks does not necessarily imply that social insurance programs should be expanded. Finally, inasmuch as disaster risk management policies at the national level typically lack coherent foundations, we suggest how the farm level risk management framework might be expanded to the national level.
Q12|Effect of subsidies on technical efficiency excluding or including environmental outputs: An illustration with a sample of farms in the European Union|With a sample of farms in the European Union (EU) and Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) data completed by additional data, we illustrate how the effect of farm subsidies on technical efficiency changes when environmental (good or bad) outputs are incorporated in the calculation of technical efficiency. Results indicate that the effect of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) operational subsidies on farm technical efficiency changes when environmental outputs (in this study: greenhouse gas emissions, nitrogen balance and ecological focus areas) are taken into account in the efficiency calculation: some effects change significance, and more importantly, some effects change sign.
Q12|Trading off nutrition and education? A panel data analysis of the dissimilar welfare effects of Organic and Fairtrade standards|Millions of smallholder farmers in developing countries participate in different types of sustainability standards. A growing body of literature has analyzed the welfare effects, with mixed results. Yet, there are important knowledge gaps. First, most existing studies have looked at the effects of one standard in one country. When comparing between studies it is unclear whether dissimilar outcomes are the result of different standards or different local conditions. Second, most studies have used cross-section data, so that selectivity issues remain a challenge. Third, existing work has primarily analyzed effects in terms of purely economic indicators, such as prices and income, ignoring other dimensions of household welfare. We address these shortcomings using panel data from small-scale coffee producers in Uganda and comparing the effects of two of the most popular sustainability standards, namely Organic and Fairtrade. Welfare effects are analyzed in terms of household expenditures, child education, and nutrition. Results show that Organic and Fairtrade both have positive effects on total consumption expenditures. However, notable differences are observed in terms of the other outcomes. Organic contributes to improved nutrition but has no effect on education. For Fairtrade it is exactly the other way around. We explore the mechanisms behind these differences.
Q12|Biodiversity Productive Capacity in Mixed Farms of North-West of France: a Multi-output Primal System|Previous studies on the productive value of biodiversity emphasized that crop diversity increases crop yields. Here, we focus on the productivity of crop diversity and permanent grasslands for crops and milk. Using a GMM approach, we estimate detailed production functions using a sample of 3960 mixed farms from the FADN between 2002 and 2013. We highlight that permanent grasslands enhance crop production. We confirm that crop diversity increases crop and milk yields. Permanent grasslands and crop diversity are however substitute inputs. We also find that both of these biodiversity productive capacities influence variable input productivities. These results suggest the potential adaptations of farmers’ choices to environmental measures.
Q12|Temperature shocks, short-term growth and poverty thresholds: Evidence from rural Tanzania|Using the LSMS-ISA Tanzania National Panel Survey by the World Bank, we study the relationship between rural household consumption growth and temperature shocks over the period 2008–2013. Temperature shocks have a negative and significant impact on household growth if their initial consumption lies below a critical threshold. As such, temperature shocks slow income convergence among households, at least in the short run. Crop yields and total factor productivity in agriculture are the main transmission channels. Extrapolating from short-term elasticities to long-run phenomena, these findings support the Schelling Conjecture: economic development would help poor farming households to reduce the impacts of climate change. Hence, closing the yield gap, modernizing agriculture and favouring the structural transformation of the economy are all crucial issues for adaptation of farmers to the negative effects of global warming.
Q12|Market chain participation and food security: the case of the Ugandan maize farmers|An assessment of the links between market chain participation and food security is hampered by a scant empirical literature, mostly based on case studies. Our goal is to deal with this issue by providing a sound identification strategy using the WB LSMS-ISA panel data 2009-12 for Uganda and controlling for self-selection. We show that both the level and the variability of Ugandan maize farming households' food consumption is affected by market choice. However, contrary to common wisdom, intermediaries do not play a major role in farmers' welfare. This empirical evidence is consistent with the theoretical prediction that also in Sub-Saharan Africa modern food chains tend to reinforce vertical coordination across actors and the enforcement of contracts, thus reducing the market power of intermediaries.
Q12|Land, Food and Labour in Pre-Industrial Agro-Ecosystems: a Socio-Ecological Perspective on Early 19th Century Seigneurial Systems|Research on seigneurial agriculture and its role for agricultural changes in general has a long tradition within European Agricultural History. Still, much discussion arises on whether to emphasize «peasant paths» or “landlord paths” of agricultural development. This study contributes to the debate by introducing a social ecology perspective. Using the nineteenth-century case study of Grundherrschaft (manor) Grafenegg, we offer a first attempt at conceptualizing and empirically scrutinizing resource use and distribution in (late) Central European seigneurial agriculture. We integrate rich archival material to reconstruct the distribution of three central resources –land, food and labour– among the agrarian agents (e.g. manorial farmsteads, peasant farms and smallholdings). We found that the three central resources in pre-industrial agriculture were distributed unequally between the various farmsteads involved; labour was abundant, whereas food and land were scarce. The labour surplus extracted by the landlords caused subsistence pressure on most of the peasants, forcing them to use their modest resource base more efficiently, which in turn had effects on the local agroecology.
Q12|Technology Adoption, Capital Deepening, and International Productivity Differences|Cross-country differences in capital intensity are larger in the agricultural sector than in the non-agricultural sector, indicating that rich and poor countries differ in agricultural technology adoption. I build a two-sector general equilibrium model featuring technology adoption in agriculture. As the economy develops, farmers gradually adopt a modern capital-intensive technology to replace the traditional labour-intensive technology, as is observed in the U.S. historical data. Using this model, I find that the technology adoption channel is key to accounting for low agricultural capital intensity and labour productivity in poor countries. In the model, measured aggregate factors – land endowment, economy-wide productivity, and barriers to investment – can explain 1.56-fold more in rich-poor agricultural productivity differences compared to a model without technology adoption. I further show that land market frictions in agriculture impede technology adoption and magnify productivity differences.
Q12|Climate change in India: how to protect farmers?|The effects of climate change on Indian agriculture under different alternative climate scenarios are empirically studied. This article uses the Ricardian approach that links net revenues per acre as a function of climate, farm and households’characteristics. We estimate the net revenues per acre function using cross-sectional data and quantile regression. Empirical results show that farms with higher net revenues per acre look to be more affected by climate variables in magnitude. Farms with lower net revenues per acre tend to benefit more from crops mixing than farms with high income per acre. In a second step, we implement two climate scenarios which differ according to the assumptions on changes on average temperature and total rainfall. Farms with low net revenues per acre experience losses less important in magnitude but larger in percent change than farms with high net revenues per acre. At the district level, results show more heterogeneity. Under both scenarios, districts in the North of India tend to experience a decrease in net revenues per acre while an opposed effect is found for districts in the South of the country.
Q12|Improving access to savings through mobile money: Experimental evidence from smallholder farmers in Mozambique|Investment in improved agricultural inputs is infrequent for smallholder farmers in Africa. One barrier may be limited access to formal savings. We designed and conducted a field experiment in rural Mozambique that randomized access to a savings account through mobile money to a sample of smallholder farmers. All subjects were given access to mobile money and information about fertilizer use. We also randomized whether closest farming friends were targeted by the same intervention. We find that the savings account increased savings, the probability of fertilizer use, by 31-36 pp, and the use of other agricultural inputs. We also show that the savings account increased household expenditures, in particular non-frequent ones. Our results suggest that the network intervention decreased social pressure to share resources and that the savings account protected farmers against this network pressure.

Q12|A profile of non-farm household enterprises in Sub-Saharan Africa|This paper provides a comprehensive descriptive profile of non-farm household enterprises in ten Sub-Saharan African countries, disaggregated by the households' consumption quintiles. Various enterprise-related aspects are covered, such as the share of households that operate an enterprise, the motivation to start a business venture, and various owner and enterprise characteristics. The figures show that household enterprises are more prevalent among wealthier households, although push factors overall dominate as entry motive. Enterprises in lower quintiles are more often operated by owners with less education, and in most countries female owners are more frequently found among poorer households. The enterprises themselves are characterised by a small size, generally solo entrepreneurship, which only marginally increases along wealth levels. Poorer households operate more seasonal types of businesses, which employ rarely any external labour, and which contribute less to total household income compared to wealthier households. While business profits grow along the welfare quintiles, profits show a big jump from the fourth to the top quintile. Finally, poor entrepreneurial households are considerably more often located in rural than in urban areas. Based on these findings, this paper suggests a set of policy recommendations that include expanding the access to and availability of finance, education, and infrastructure, and introducing gender-sensitive entrepreneurial policies.
Q12|Determinants of productivity and efficiency of wheat production in Kazakhstan: A stochastic frontier approach<BR>[Determinanten von Produktivität und Effizienz der Weizenproduktion in Kasachstan: Ein Stochastic-Frontier-Ansatz]|Agriculture plays an important role for Kazakhstan not only because of rural employment, but also because of the diversity it brings to its oil dependent economy. A considerable increase in grain exports was achieved during the recent years, however, there still is a large room for increasing productivity and efficiency to boost the agricultural potential of the country further. The government of Kazakhstan has introduced several policy packages in the past to boost productivity and efficiency, however, the impact of these reforms has not been yet analyzed quantitatively. Micro level data collected from 200 farms in northern Kazakhstan in 2015 is used in the analysis, in order to fill this research gap. A mixture of evidences is found in terms of policy effect on productivity and efficiency. The results of the analysis showed that direct subsidy access reduced the efficiency, while access to supply chain infrastructure had the opposite effect and increased the efficiency. Therefore, the study concludes that the government should divert its policy support from direct subsidy payments to the improvement of agricultural infrastructure. This will influence positively not only productivity and efficiency, but also Kazakhstan's commitments towards international and regional trade agreements.
Q12|Will climate change benefit or hurt Russian grain production? A statistical evidence from a panel approach<BR>[Wird der Klimawandel der russischen Getreideproduktion nutzen oder schaden? Statistische Evidenz auf der Grundlage eines Panel-Ansatzes]|We conduct an examination of the climate effect to analyze the historical dependence of grain production on temperatures and precipitation levels, and project this dependence to estimate the productivity of different grain types in the mid- and long-terms, given four greenhouse gas concentration pathways. We find that altering temperatures have an equivocal effect on agriculture. The most productive zones of the southern black soil belt is projected to face considerable declines in yields, due to insufficient precipitation levels and high probability of heat waves during the summer vegetation period. The northern part, on the contrary, can experience increases in productivity as a result of milder and drier winters and warmer springs.
Q12|Überregional aktive Kapitaleigentümer in ostdeutschen Agrarunternehmen: Entwicklungen bis 2017|Anknüpfend an eine Untersuchung aus dem Jahr 2015 werden die Zahl und die bewirtschaftete Fläche landwirtschaftlicher Unternehmen, deren Kapitalanteile mehrheitlich in der Hand überregional aktiver Investoren sind, sowie die Zahl von Übernahmen durch solche Investoren im Zeitraum 2007 bis Anfang 2017 abgeschätzt. Hierzu werden in zehn Landkreisen der fünf ostdeutschen Bundesländer alle landwirtschaftlichen juristischen Personen mithilfe online verfügbarer Datenquellen hinsichtlich ihrer aktuellen Kapitaleigentümer sowie Veränderungen in der Eigentümerstruktur seit 2007 untersucht. Die Unternehmen werden anhand bestimmter Eigenschaften der Anteilseigner - wie Ortsansässigkeit, Zahl, familiäre Beziehungen und weitere wirtschaftliche Aktivitäten in verschiedenen Branchen - sowie deren Kapitalmehrheiten verschiedenen Kategorien zugeordnet. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Bedeutung überregional aktiver Investoren je nach Bundesland sehr unterschiedlich ist. Im Zeitablauf seit 2007 sind viele Unternehmen, die bislang im Eigentum Ortsansässiger waren, durch externe Investoren übernommen worden. Gleichzeitig hat die Fläche, die im Eigentum juristischer Personen ist, stetig zugenommen. Damit wächst auch die Bedeutung der Käufe von Kapitalanteilen an landwirtschaftlichen Unternehmen in Relation zum gesetzlich regulierten landwirtschaftlichen Grundstücksverkehr, wodurch das Grundstückverkehrsgesetz faktisch an Effektivität verliert.
Q12|Betriebs- und Unternehmensstrukturen in der deutschen Landwirtschaft: Workshop zu vorläufigen Ergebnissen und methodischen Ansätzen|Viele landwirtschaftliche Unternehmen in Deutschland setzen sich aus mehreren rechtlich selbständigen Betrieben zusammen. Dabei sind die landwirtschaftlichen und landwirtschaftsnahen Betriebe oftmals auf mehrere Familienmitglieder aufgeteilt. Insbesondere durch Professionalisierung und Wachstum in landwirtschaftsnahen Diversifizierungsbereichen entstehen gewerbliche Betriebe neben dem landwirtschaftlichen Betrieb. Diese Entwicklung und deren statistische Erfassung können Schwierigkeiten bei Politikanalysen mit sich bringen. Aus diesem Grund wurde am Thünen-Institut ein Projekt zur Analyse der Betriebs- und Unternehmensstrukturen in der deutschen Landwirtschaft gestartet. Ziel des Projektes ist es festzustellen, wie verbreitet komplexe Strukturen sind und wie diese in der offiziellen Agrarstatistik erfasst und dargestellt werden. Im Rahmen des Projektes wurde bislang eine regionale empirische Studie auf Basis von Experteninterviews durchgeführt, um die Verbreitung komplexer Strukturen einzuschätzen. Ferner wurden die vorhandenen Daten zu Landwirtschaft- und landwirtschaftsnahen Bereichen sowie die angewandten Erhebungsmethoden mit Hilfe von Literatur- und Datenrecherchen sowie zahlreichen Experteninterviews sondiert. Im Rahmen des Projektworkshops wurden die Zwischenergebnisse des Forschungsvorhabens präsentiert und diskutiert. Die bisherigen Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die aktuelle Methodik der offiziellen Agrarstatistik nur einen Teil der für die Politikanalyse und -beratung relevanten Einheiten in Bezug auf Betriebs- und Unternehmensstrukturen abdecken kann. Ferner wurde festgestellt, dass die aktuell vorliegenden Informationsquellen zur Landwirtschaft und zum landwirtschaftsnahen Bereich keinen wesentlichen zusätzlichen Erkenntnisgewinn in Bezug auf Betriebs- und Unternehmensstrukturen liefern können, solange diese nicht kombiniert werden. Im weiteren Verlauf des Projektes ist es geplant, die Relevanz einzelner Betriebs- und Unternehmenseinheiten (z. B. Biogasanlagen) einzuschätzen und diese Einheiten mit den zugehörigen landwirtschaftlichen Betrieben zu verknüpfen. Die Ergebnisse sollen mit einer empirischen Studie vervollständigt und die Auswirkungen der Berücksichtigung komplexer Strukturen auf die Analyse der Einkommenslage der landwirtschaftlichen Haushalte abgeschätzt werden. Im Rahmen des Workshops wurden vier Impulsvorträge zu folgenden Themen gehalten: (1) Umgang mit komplexen Unternehmen im Statistischen Unternehmensregister; (2) Auswirkung fehlender Informationen zu komplexen Strukturen auf die Politikanalyse und -beratung; (3) Handhabung komplexer landwirtschaftlicher Betriebe in der offiziellen Agrarstatistik und (4) agrarstatistisches System in Österreich.
Q12|Rainfall risk, fertility and development: Evidence from farm settlements during the American demographic transition|I analyze whether variation in rainfall risk played a role for the speed of the demographic transition among American settlers. The underlying hypothesis is that children constituted a buffer stock of labor that could be mobilized in response to income shocks. Identification relies on fertility differences between farm and non-farm households within counties and over time. The results suggest that in areas with a high variance in rainfall the fertility differential between farm households and non-farm households was significantly higher than in areas with a low variance in rainfall. This channel is robust to other relevant forces such as income, education and children’s survival as well as the spatial correlation in fertility levels. The analysis also shows that this effect was reduced and finally disappeared as irrigation systems and agricultural machinery emerged. Hence, access to risk-mitigating devices significantly contributed to the demographic transition in the US. These findings also have potentially important implications for Sub-Saharan Africa, especially for those areas where income risks are a major threat to households and where fertility is still high and only slowly declining or not declining at all.
Q12|Grass-Fed Beef Enterprise Efficiency Analysis in the U.S| We determine technical and scale efficiencies, scope economies, marginal productive contributions for inputs and outputs, and efficiency drivers for U.S. grass-fed beef enterprises. Average technical efficiency was 0.82. Increasing returns to scale and scope economies were found. Results suggest grass-fed beef enterprises can be scale efficient at >100 grass-fed beef animals.
Q12|Efficiency and Competitiveness of Kosovo Raspberry Producers| Raspberry production is a growing industry in Kosovo. In addition to private investments, this growth has been supported by grants, subsidies, and direct investment from international donor organizations and governmental institutions. At present, most of the commercially produced raspberries in Kosovo are produced on small farms, harvested by farmers and packed manually by collection centers, and then sold as frozen for the export market. The long-term viability and continued growth of raspberry production in Kosovo depends on the industry being able to compete in export markets and hold its own against production regions in Poland, Serbia, and Russia. Our study measures the efficiency of Kosovo raspberry producers with an aim towards enhancing industry competitiveness. We collected primary data on raspberry farmers in Kosovo during the summer of 2016. Using these data, we examine producer efficiency with an input oriented data envelopment analysis. Our findings suggest that efficiency improves with production experience and that outreach efforts could emphasize labor management.
Q12|Willingness To Pay For Irrigation Water In Louisiana| We conducted survey to collect information from Louisiana farmers to understand their concerns related to irrigation water quality and availability of sufficient water for crop irrigation. We used logistic models to estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) for irrigation water during critical crop growing periods. Variables affecting the participation in WTP are income, land holding size, risk aversion, and education. Our estimated results show that farmers with higher education are more likely to pay for irrigation water compared to farmers with high school and college degree. Age of the farmers, farm revenue, size of the rented land have negative effect on willingness to pay for irrigation water. The sizes of the owned land and risk aversion factor have positive effect on willingness to pay.
Q12|A Spatial Econometric Analysis of Within-field Crop Yield Variability Using Yield Monitor Data from a Mississippi Farm| It is widely observed that the crop yields vary significantly within the field, primarily because of the intra-field variations in soil, landscape, water, and nutrient conditions. That variability forms the foundation for site-specific management in precision agriculture. However, thus far the studies about the within-field yield variability are mostly based on one or several sample fields, while the variability distribution for a real world farm or a larger region have received less investigations. In addition, due to the small number of sample fields, the determining factors of yield variability have not been fully examined. This study fill this research gap by collecting and analyzing high resolution yield monitor data of over a hundred fields from a large size farm in the Mississippi Delta. It quantitatively describes the extent of the within-field yield variability over a large scale area, and empirically examines the relationship between the yield variability and factors such as soil types, landscapes, weather conditions, management inputs, etc. A spatial econometric model is utilized to account for other unobserved but spatially correlated yield-impacting soil properties. This study contributes to exploring the method of analyzing GIS data from farming and turning the data into site-specific management decisions.
Q12|Determinants Of Irrigation Technology Adoptions And Production Efficiency In Nepal’S Agricultural Sector| The factors considered in using irrigation as a production strategy in Nepal has been different from many countries mainly because of geographical diversity, water availability and investment constraint. This paper identifies the factors affecting irrigation technology adoption among the farmers in Nepal using household survey data 2011. We use a multinomial logit model to estimate variables affecting multiple irrigation technology (tube-well, canal and pond) adoptions in which sociodemographic information, land holding, access to credit, and geographical factors are major explanatory variables. Preliminary results show that education, land holding size, access to credit, and geographic factors have a higher impact on tube-well irrigation technology adoption. Additionally, productivity of major crops found to increase substantially in irrigated land. The impact of shallow tube-well is much greater in plain compared to other modes of irrigation in plain and hilly regions. Findings from this study should provide insights to producers and policy makers in identifying opportunities for utilizing and investing in more efficient irrigation technology
Q12|Small farms contribution to food security: a food system resilience perspective|This study examines the contribution of small farms (SFs) to food security by using the concept of food system resilience. The study concerns both the whole agri-food system and the subsystem of citrus fruits in the NUTS3 region of Ileia, in Southwestern Greece. Within a dynamic and diversified food system, most of SFs are characterized by a high degree of market integration along with a low degree of food self-sufficiency. A series of reinforcing and balancing feedback loops make the system more vulnerable, undermining its adaptive and transformative capacities. On the contrary, a series of other processes, including specific farming practices which integrate successfully traditional and scientific knowledge, strengthen the system. The ongoing crisis of the Greek economy affects heavily the operation of the regional food system and its outcomes, while it relatively weakens the reinforcement function of some feedback loops, mitigating their adverse consequences. Possible food insecurity problems exist in farms/households which fall below the poverty line, while SFs have to overcome the risk of extreme fragmentation. The findings of this study question the capacity of the regional food system to deliver in a sustainable way its outcomes, as well as to respond effectively to the current challenges.
Q12|Impacto de Subsidios en el Agro: Una mirada desde el sector cafetero|El Gobierno Nacional ha intervenido en varias ocasiones la política de precios y ha extendido subsidios directos al sector cafetero con el fin de aliviar las condiciones de los caficultores en periodos de precios externos a la baja. Este trabajo busca describir el Programa de Protección al Ingreso Cafetero (PIC) el cual fue implementado en el 2013 y tuvo una duración de dos años. Analizamos dos frentes distintos: el primero es ver el impacto del subsidio sobre el precio interno del café utilizando una metodología de regresiones discontinuas. El segundo es analizar si el programa tuvo incidencia alguna sobre la calidad de vida y las condiciones de producción de los productores cafeteros. Encontramos que existen efectos del PIC sobre el precio interno del café en Colombia. Adicionalmente, encontramos que existe un efecto sobre el área tecnificada como proporción del área de café. Nuestros resultados son robustos ante diferentes especificaciones. No se encontró efecto sobre variables relacionadas con el nivel de calidad de vida de los caficultores.
Q12|Unintended Impacts: How roads change health and nutrition for ethnic minorities in Congo|We investigate how a road connection in a remote area of Congo changes hunger and illness for ethnic minorities. Ethnic minorities’ production activities are highly local, making it hard to construct a valid counter-factual. We exploit a natural experiment: a river boundary between two forests, one of which builds roads to satisfy eco-certification. We find the road increases trade and leads to the export of farmed food products. People and households increase production and specialize. Ethnic minorities, net buyers of exported food during this season, face higher prices and lower real wages. We find the road increases their frequency of hunger and illness. In Central Africa, hunting restrictions accompany roads to prevent over exploitation of fauna. We find the restrictions reduce hunting effort for all households. Households shift consumption to fish but, on net, consume protein less frequently, with non-fisher households seeing the largest decreases.
Q12|Decentralization and Efficiency of Subsidy Targeting: Evidence from Chiefs in Rural Malawi|Developing countries spend vast sums on subsidies. Beneficiaries are typically selected via either a proxy-means test (PMT) or through a decentralized identification process led by local leaders. A decentralized allocation may offer informational or accountability advantages, but may be prone to elite capture. We study this tradeoff in the context of two large-scale subsidy programs in Malawi (for agricultural inputs and for food) decentralized to traditional leaders (“chiefs”) who are asked to target the needy. Using high-frequency household panel data on neediness and shocks, we find that nepotism exists but has only limited mistargeting consequences. Importantly, we find that chiefs target households with higher returns to farm inputs, generating an allocation that is more productively efficient than what could be achieved through a PMT. This could be welfare improving, since within-village redistribution is common.
Q12|Risk as Impediment to Privatization? The Role of Collective Fields in Extended Agricultural Households|As in the case of cooperatives, collective fields in extended agricultural households act as an insurance device but entail inefficiencies arising from the incentives to free ride on coworkersâ€™ efforts. Privatization provides good incentives but decreases the level of risk sharing. The classical analysis of this trade-off rules out another major risk-sharing mechanism, namely income transfers. This paper is a first attempt to merge the two insurance mechanisms: collective production, which is plagued by free riding, and income transfers, which are hampered by limited commitment. Privatization of land is shown to interact with incentives to abide by the insurance agreement, so that the trade-off between risk sharing and production may or may not be maintained with income transfers. We show that an increase in the value of the household membersâ€™ exit option or a decrease in patience decreases the optimal rate of privatization, while larger households are more likely to privatize land.

Un’analisi di sostenibilità socio-economica e ambientale nella produzione familiare di caffè in Brasile/Comparing agroecology and conventional agriculture. A socio-economic and environmental sustainability analysis in coffee smallholding production in Brazil|This paper aim at comparing agroecological and conventional practices for small coffee producers in Leste Region of Minas Gerais state (Brazil). Six production units have been deeply analyzed and compared in: income generation with price volatility, productivity, working conditions, product diversification, agrobiodiversity, cost composition, environmental impacts and forest conservation. The results show that agroecology practices help local small farmers in stabilizing and diversifying incomes, reducing production risks and improve working conditions. Furthermore agroecological practices both reduce the use of chemical inputs and improve forest conservation. According with the results of this study agroecology is a cost-effective and sustainable alternative of conventional monoculture agriculture for smallholder farmers of the examined region.
Q12|Un’analisi multidimensionale della sostenibilità per l’agricoltura familiare. Il caso dell’area amazzonica peruviana/A multidimensional assessment of sustainability for small farming production. The case study of the Peruvian Amazon|In the last century the agricultural sector grown exponentially with outstanding increase in food productions that released poverty and malnutrition in many parts of the world. These important results have been achieved to the detriment of the environment and equity caused by massive externalities that the new productive paradigm had generated. Since 1992 sustainability in agriculture is one of the main cornerstone of the international agenda for reaching global sustainable development and reducing poverty. One of the main challenge in designing sustainable agricultural policies is the use of effective measurement of sustainability that would encompass the intrinsic multidimensionality of small farming agriculture that is characterized to be a complex socio-ecological system in which social, economic and environmental aspects strictly interacts. This paper examines the application of an experimental method of sustainability assessment using HESOFI, a measurement framework developed in Central America for small scale agriculture. The paper analyzes by the use of several indicators of sustainability thirty mixed small farms located in Peruvian Amazon. In addition, the assessment has been developed with different categories of agricultural units divided by ethnic origin (Andean or Indigenous) and by certification (Fair Trade and Organic) in order to compare the different levels of sustainability reached by each category.
Q12|"The Returns of ""I Do"": Multifaceted Female Decision-making and Agricultural Yields in Tanzania"|Using the third round of the Tanzanian National Panel Survey, this study delves into the productivity returns of multifaceted female empowerment in agriculture. Unlike the classic unidimensional approach to identify gender gaps in agricultural yields, this study lays emphasis on the overlapping of manifold aspects of female empowerment in agriculture - including female plot ownership, female plot management and female control over the agricultural output - through a threefold interaction model. Next, I use Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition technique to understanding the mechanisms underlying significant yields gaps, as well as to assess the returns of female management and control rights to the classic yields gap against femaleowned plots. This study identifies significant yields gaps that would go unnoticed through the classic unidimensional approach. More specifically, and this is the first returns of female decision-making rights, female owners who further manage and control their owned plots are more productive than female mere owners. Next, female decision-making rights contribute at narrowing the classic yields gap against female-owned plots, mostly through the structural disadvantage - that is through lower productivity returns to factors of production - against female owners who would not manage their plot, nor control the agricultural output - the fruit of their labor. These findings are robust along several dimensions and call for a few implications with respect to collection and analysis of agricultural data, as well as to gender policies in agriculture.
Q12|Relationships between Institutional Capital, Dynamic Capabilities and Competitive Advantage: Empirical Examination of the Agribusiness Sector|Resource-based view (RBV) is based on the economic rent concept which explains sources of competitive advantage (CAd) at firm level. The RBV lacks a causality chain between resources and CAd which calls for further examination along with dynamic capabilities possessed by firms. This study aims to determine the relationship between institutional capital (IC), dynamic capabilities and CAd of agribusiness firms, more specifically the minor export crop farms, at the same time contending that the relationship between IC and CAd is mediated by the specific capabilities. The scope of the study comprises entities which have experience in commercial cultivation of minor export crops. 456 farm owners were selected from the highest growing districts of the selected crops (cinnamon, clove and pepper) using proportionate stratified random sampling technique. Self-administrated structured questionnaire was used to collect data. The regression-based path analysis was used to measure the direct and mediation relationship amongst the latent variables. The results of the study suggest that IC has a significant influence on both the quality management capability and marketing capability. This connection contributes valuable insights to the empirical support on the importance of specific capabilities on sustainable CAd. Managerial implications are highlighted along with future research directions
Q12|An efficiency-based concept to assess potential cost and greenhouse gas savings on German dairy farms|This article investigates potential savings of costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for a sample of 216 dairy farms in northern Germany using Data Envelopment Analysis. Tradeoffs between a cost-efficient and a GHG-efficient production are identified. For this purpose, an environmental-economic farm model is used, which allows ‘pricing’ the input with market prices and CO2 equivalents, respectively. Uncertainty of CO2 equivalents and volatility of input prices are taken into account and therefore efficiency scores are in the form of ranges. The results reveal that the sample farms are more GHG-efficient than cost-efficient. We estimate potential cost savings between 37.2% and 57.4% and potential savings in GHG emissions between 24.9% and 41.3%. Cost and GHG emission reductions are complementary across a wide range: by moving from the status quo to cost-efficient production, at least 87.5% of the GHG saving potential would be tapped. Unlocking the remaining reduction potential comes at a shadow price (abatement cost) of about €165/t CO2 equivalent. From an input allocative point of view, a change from cost-efficient production to GHG-efficient production requires reductions in nitrogen use and an extension of diesel use. Compared to the sample average and the cost-efficient farms, GHG efficient dairy farms are characterized by a higher share of legumes and a longer effective lifetime of cows.
Q12|Off-farm employment and agricultural specialization in China|While it is well known that China's off farm labor market is emerging rapidly, less is known about the effect of movement off the farm on the farming practices of those that have continued to farm. The overall goal of this paper is to analyze the effects of changes in China's off farm employment on one aspect of the performance of China's agricultural sector: the emergence of specialization in farming. To achieve this goal, we have three specific objectives. First, we document the changes in the flow of labor out of China's villages. Second, we examine how specialization in farming has changed over time. Third, we examine the association between off farm labor flows and specialization. Using panel data from a national representative data collected by the authors between 1999 and 2008, the analysis finds that off farm employment is indeed rising rapidly. At the same time, specialization is occurring off and on the farm. There is a strong and robust correlation between off farm employment and on farm specialization. The results imply that China's agriculture has responded dynamically to the modernization happening elsewhere in the economy.
Q12|Do disaster experience and knowledge affect insurance take-up decisions?|This study examines the effect of experience and knowledge on weather insurance adoption. First, we conduct insurance games with farmers, and find that the treatment improves real insurance take-up by 46%. The effect is not driven by changes in risk attitudes and perceived probability of disasters, or by learning of insurance benefits, but is driven by the experience acquired in the game. Second, we find that providing information about the payout probability has a strong positive effect on insurance take-up. Finally, when subjects receive both treatments, the probability information has a greater impact on take-up than does the disaster experience.
Q12|Revisiting Pesticide Taxation Schemes|The risks caused by pesticide use for human health and nature are one of the major challenges for agricultural policies. Despite their high potential to contribute to better policies, economic instruments such as pesticide taxes are rarely used in the current policy mix. In this essay, we combine current discussion on pesticide policies in European countries with new insights from recent economic research to provide an outline for better pesticide policies to policy makers and stakeholders. We show that differentiated taxation schemes have a high potential to reduce risks caused by pesticide use and that the targeted re-distribution of tax revenues in the agricultural sector is crucial to create leverage effects on pesticide use and to increase the acceptability of pesticide taxes.
Q12|Do water saving technologies save water? Empirical evidence from North China|This paper describes the extent of water saving technologies usage and evaluates their impacts on water use, water productivity, total irrigated sown area and crop mix in North China. A set of panel data collected at the househol.d and plot levels is used in empirical analysis. Water saving technologies are categorized into traditional technologies, household-based technologies and community-based technologies. By 2007, traditional technologies and household-based technologies are used in almost all sample villages. However, the shares of sown area on which water saving technologies are used are still fairly low. Econometric analysis using plot level fixed effects show that using water saving technologies can reduce crop water use and improve the productivity of water. The positive effects are generated mainly through the use of household-based or community-based technologies. The use of water saving technologies does not have statistically significant impacts on total irrigated sown area and crop mix.
Q12|Welfare impacts of improved chickpea adoption: A pathway for rural development in Ethiopia?|We analyse the impact of improved chickpea adoption on welfare in Ethiopia using three rounds of panel data. First, we estimate the determinants of improved chickpea adoption using a double hurdle model. We apply a control function approach with correlated random effects to control for possible endogeneity resulting from access to improved seed and technology transfer activities. To instrument for these variables we develop novel distance weighted measures of a household’s neighbours’ access to improved seed and technology transfer activities. Second, we estimate the impact of area under improved chickpea cultivation on household income and poverty. We apply a fixed effects instrumental variables approach where we use the predicted area under cultivation from the double hurdle model as an instrument for observed area under cultivation. We find that improved chickpea adoption significantly increases household income while also reducing household poverty. Finally, we disaggregate results by landholding to explore whether the impact of adoption has heterogeneous effects. Adoption favoured all but the largest landholders, for who the new technology did not have a significant impact on income. Overall, increasing access to improved chickpea appears a promising pathway for rural development in Ethiopia’s chickpea growing regions.
Q12|Agricultural commercialization and nutrition revisited: Empirical evidence from three African countries|The transition from subsistence to commercial agriculture is key for economic growth. But what are the consequences for nutritional outcomes? The evidence to date has been scant and inconclusive. This study contributes to the debate by revisiting two prevailing wisdoms: (a) market participation by African smallholders remains low; and (b) the impact of commercialization on nutritional outcomes is generally positive. Using nationally representative data from three African countries, the analysis reveals high levels of commercialization by even the poorest and smallest landholders, with rates of market participation as high as 90%. Female farmers participate less, but tend to sell larger shares of their production, conditional on participation. Second, we find little evidence of a positive relationship between commercialization and nutritional status. As countries and international agencies prioritize the importance of nutrition-sensitive agriculture, better understanding of the transmission channels between crop choices and nutritional outcomes should remain a research priority.
Q12|Labor productivity and employment gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa|Drawing on a new set of nationally representative, internationally comparable household surveys, this paper provides an overview of key features of structural transformation – labor allocation and labor productivity – in four African economies. New, micro-based measures of sector labor allocation and cross-sector productivity differentials describe the incentives households face when allocating their labor. These measures are similar to national accounts-based measures that are typically used to characterize structural change. However, because agricultural workers supply far fewer hours of labor per year than do workers in other sectors in all of the countries analyzed, productivity gaps shrink by half, on average, when expressed on a per-hour basis. Underlying the productivity gaps that are prominently reflected in national accounts data are large employment gaps, which call into question the productivity gains that laborers can achieve through structural transformation. Furthermore, agriculture’s continued relevance to structural change in Sub-Saharan Africa is highlighted by the strong linkages observed between rural non-farm activities and primary agricultural production.
Q12|Non-farm entrepreneurship in rural sub-Saharan Africa: New empirical evidence|We report on the prevalence and patterns of non-farm enterprises in six sub-Saharan African countries, and study their performance in terms of labor productivity, survival and exit, using the World Bank’s Living Standards Measurement Study - Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA). Rural households operate enterprises due to both push and pull factors and tend to do so predominantly in easy-to-enter activities, such as sales and trade, rather than in activities that require higher starting costs, such as transport services, or educational investment, such as professional services. Labor productivity differs widely: rural and female-headed enterprises, those located further away from population centers, and businesses that operate intermittently have lower levels of labor productivity compared to urban and male-owned enterprises, or enterprises that operate throughout the year. Finally, rural enterprises exit the market primarily due to a lack of profitability or finance, and due to idiosyncratic shocks.
Q12|How much of the labor in African agriculture is provided by women?|The contribution of women to labor in African agriculture is regularly quoted in the range of 60–80%. Using individual, plot-level labor input data from nationally representative household surveys across six Sub-Saharan African countries, this study estimates the average female labor share in crop production at 40%. It is slightly above 50% in Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda, and substantially lower in Nigeria (37%), Ethiopia (29%), and Niger (24%). There are no systematic differences across crops and activities, but female labor shares tend to be higher in households where women own a larger share of the land and when they are more educated. Controlling for the gender and knowledge profile of the respondents does not meaningfully change the predicted female labor shares. The findings question prevailing assertions regarding substantial gains in aggregate crop output as a result of increasing female agricultural productivity.
Q12|Farmers’ preferences for supermarket contracts in Kenya|With the modernization of global agri-food systems, the role of contract farming increases. This also involves smallholder farmers in developing countries. While previous studies have looked at economic impacts of contract schemes on smallholder farmers, little is known about farmers’ preferences for contracting in general, and for specific contract design attributes in particular. Better understanding farmers’ preferences and constraints is important to make smallholder contract schemes more viable and beneficial. This article builds on a choice experiment to analyze farmers’ preferences and preference heterogeneity for contracts in Kenya. In the study region, supermarkets use contracts to source fresh vegetables directly from preferred suppliers. However, farmer dropout rates are high. Mixed logit models are estimated to examine farmers’ attitudes towards critical contract design attributes. Having to deliver their harvest to urban supermarkets is costly; hence farmers require a significant output price premium. Farmers also dislike delayed payments that are commonplace in contract schemes. The most problematic contract attribute is related to unpredictable product rejection rates, substantially adding to farmers’ risk. Designing contracts with lower transaction costs, more transparent quality grading, and fairer risk-sharing arrangements could enhance smallholder participation in supermarket procurement channels.
Q12|The demand for public–private crop insurance and government disaster relief|Insurance premium subsidies and disaster relief payments are government actions that can help to smooth farmers’ incomes between years. In the EU crop insurance based on public–private partnership is promoted. We present an analysis based on farmers’ stated preferences with split data approach of crop insurance and disaster relief provided by the government. Results reveal that farmers’ willingness to pay for crop insurance is conditional on the prospect for government disaster relief. Results show that possibility for disaster relief payments will lead to extensive use of taxpayers’ money if crop insurance premiums are subsidized.
Q12|Using National Statistics to Increase Transparency of Large Land Acquisition: Evidence from Ethiopia|Almost a decade after the rise in land demand triggered by the 2007/08 commodity price boom, most potential target countries still lack access to relevant information on a routine basis. This has reduced their ability to effectively regulate, monitor, and attract responsible investors rather than speculators in their effort to increase agricultural productivity and have benefits accrue to the host communities. The example of Ethiopia shows how building on existing data collection efforts allows to address this challenge and help formulate policies that guide the path forward. Using the 2013/14 nationally representative smallholder and commercial farm surveys, we find that (i) for most crops commercial farms’ yields are higher than smallholders’, with a peak in the 10–20-ha bracket; (ii) commercial farms create few permanent jobs (with just one permanent job per 20ha) and use only 55% of the land transferred to them; and (iii) after a peak in 2008, formation of new commercial farms is down to the pre-2007 levels. These findings imply that having reliable data on commercial farms, collected on regular intervals, could generate feedback loops for policy formulation and also provide vital information to assess and take regulatory actions aimed at improving the performance and attracting higher levels of investment to the sector.
Q12|Income and energy use in Bangladesh: A household level analysis|We examine how energy use at the household level moves with income in Bangladesh. Using the 2010 wave of Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey data, our analyses indicate a U-shaped relationship of both electricity use and other types of energy use (combined) with household expenditure. The findings imply that as income grows households increase their energy expenditure less than proportionally, up to a threshold level of income. Beyond the threshold income, energy use increases as a proportion of income, particularly for electricity use. We identify the threshold (turning point) for both electricity and other types of energy use. Based on the current level of expenditure and its growth, reaching the turning point would require 17years for the former category but only 7years for the latter group.
Q12|Price hike of staple food, nutritional impact and consumption adjustment: evidence from the 2005–2010 rice price increase in rural Bangladesh| This paper studies the nutritional impact of the rice price increase between 2005 and 2010 on households in rural Bangladesh and their resulting adjustment in consumption of rice, non-rice food and non-food items. We compare net rice buyers, who suffer from a negative income effect, with self-sufficient households that do not suffer from any such effect. Our findings indicate that rural households in Bangladesh cope well with the surge in the domestic rice price as indicated by the absence of any effect on their calorie intake and dietary diversity. In fact, both types of households similarly change their consumption of rice, non-rice grain, pulses, protein, fruits and other items. Furthermore, we do not find any evidence of buyers’ switching towards low-quality items in a food group. In a separate analysis, we compare net rice sellers with self-sufficient households and arrive at a similar conclusion. In both cases, income plays a crucial role in the consumption of non-rice food and non-food items, indicating the importance of effective income support programs at the time of price shocks in staple food items.
Q12|An Alternative Specification for Technical Efficiency Effects in a Stochastic Frontier Production Function|This paper proposes an alternative specification for technical efficiency effects in a stochastic production frontier model. The proposed specification is distribution free and thus eschews one-sided error term present in almost all the existing inefficiency effects models. The efficiency effects are represented by the standard normal cumulative distribution function of exogenous variables which ensures the efficiency scores to lie in a unit interval. An empirical exercise based on widely used Philippines rice farming data set illustrates the simplicity and usefulness of the proposed model.
Q12|The welfare effects of coffee price volatility for Ethiopian coffee producers|Purpose - This paper aims to estimate the welfare effects for Ethiopian coffee producers from eliminating coffee price volatility. Design/methodology/approach - To estimate volatility, the generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity technique is applied to monthly coffee prices in Ethiopia for the period 1976-2012. To distinguish between the unpredictable and predictable components of volatility, we obtain separate estimates of the conditional and unconditional variance of the residual. This is combined with estimates of the coefficient of relative risk aversion to measure the welfare effects from eliminating the unpredictable component of price volatility. Findings - A key finding is that the welfare gain from eliminating coffee price volatility is small; the gain per producer comes to a meagre US$0.76 in a year. Originality/value - This has important policy implications for the efficacy of price stabilisation mechanisms for coffee producers, i.e. any attempt to eliminate coffee price volatility at a cost may not be a preferred outcome for Ethiopian producers. The contribution of the paper lies in using the unconditional variance, as it more truly reflects price risk faced by coffee producers without overestimating it.
Q12|Chained to Sustainable Development Goals? The Changing Role of Entities for Enhanced Resilience along Agriculture Food Value Chains in Thailand|The operation period of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ended in 2015, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be in operation in 2016-2030. The sustainable development agenda contained 17 goals and covered a broad range of quantitative and qualitative objectives across social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. These include (i) ending poverty and hunger, (ii) sustainable consumption and production, (iii) improving health and education, (iv) making cities more sustainable, (v) combating climate change, and (vi) protecting oceans and forests. Sustainable food production, marketing, and other post-harvest management practices are important to achieving majority of the SDGs. This paper examines the required changing roles of private and public organisations, as well as international organisations, in 2016-2030 to enhance resilience of agricultural food value chains in Thailand. The Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) of Thailand is a growth and development model characterised by its universality and inclusiveness; people-centred approach; moderation, moral values, and reasonableness; and knowledge and integrity. The SEP encourages a holistic farm management system to promote sustainability, food security, water conservation and biodiversity, development of human resources, risk management, investment, and expansion of businesses, thereby creating self-sufficiency at the household, community, organisational, and national levels. These objectives of the SEP are somewhat consistent with Goals 1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 15 of the SDGs. The required roles of organisations to enable Thailand to achieve the SDGs towards enhancing the resilience of agricultural food value chains are presented, and the policy implications are highlighted.
Q12|Assessing the Competitive Advantage of Public Policy Support for Supply Chain Resilience|This paper deals with the supply chain resilience of agricultural products in Japan. First, the food flow of Japan is explained. Japanese farmers and fishers produce and sell their products, receiving 9.4 trillion Japanese yen (¥). At the same time, Japan imports raw products and processed food. The fresh products move through the market to the eating out sector, the processing sector, and consumers. During this process, the value of agricultural products increases and consumers pay ¥73.5 trillion. Food flow sometimes suffers disasters, such as heavy rains, flooding, low temperatures, strong winds, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis. In April 2016, a strong earthquake hit the Kumamoto area, severely affecting the production and supply of watermelons. To increase the resilience of the agricultural supply chain, the sixth industrialisation is effective and well established. Japan's sixth industry contains 60,000 businesses. Most of them are food processing and direct shop businesses. Direct shops are operated by farmers, farmers' groups, farmers' companies, municipalities, cooperatives, and producers' groups. They sell mostly vegetables, fruits, and processed food. Direct shop K is located on the urban fringe of Chiba prefecture. Since it was established in 2004, the shop has become very popular in the region. However, it has had to overcome two crises: the effect of the radioactive fallout from the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident and contamination by residual agricultural chemicals. The manager had a large role in the recovery, but Japan's agricultural policy also provided direct and indirect support at the national and local levels. Public policy supports the resilience of the agricultural supply chain through measures such as agricultural land use planning, agricultural improvement projects, rapid reconstruction following damage, and improvement of agricultural resources.
Q12|Drivers of farmers' income: The role of farm size and diversification|The basic objective of this study is to analyse the role of farm size and diversification in determining farmers' income. Using data from NSS 70th round Situation Assessment Survey, the study considers two measures of income, viz., farm income per hectare (from crop and animal husbandry) and farmer's income per capita (from both farm and non-farm sources). Linear, log linear and panel data models are estimated to understand the nature of relationship between income, farm size and the two forms of diversification (on-farm and off-farm diversification). The study finds that a U-shaped relationship exists between farm size and farm / farmer's income. The results also show that both on-farm and off-farm diversification have an inverted U-shape relationship with farm / farmer's income. That is, diversification up to some level helps improve income but excessive diversification might lead to misallocation of resources and hence a fall in income. The results also show that engagement in public works programme such as MGNREGA has an adverse impact on farm / farmer's income, possibly due to the opportunity cost of time spent in such programmes. Finally, positive effect of education on income is seen only at somewhat high education levels.
Q12|Can Land Fragmentation Reduce the Exposure of Rural Households to Weather Variability?|Climate change continuously affects African farmers that operate in rain-fed environments. Coping with weather risk through credit and insurance markets is almost inexistent as these markets are imperfect in the African economies. Even though land fragmentation is often considered as a barrier to agricultural productivity, this article aims at analyzing whether land fragmentation, as an insurance alternative, is able to reduce farmers' exposure to weather variability. In order to address this research question, I use the Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) data on Uganda. After dealing with the endogeneity of land fragmentation, I find that higher land fragmentation decreases the loss of crop yield when households experience rain deviations. Therefore, policy makers should be cautious with land consolidation programs.

Q12|Limitations of Contract Farming as a Pro-poor Strategy: The Case of Maize Outgrower Schemes in Upper West Ghana|Contract farming (CF) arrangements have the potential to address market failures and improve technology adoption, productivity, and welfare. In Ghana, government and donors use CF as a strategy for increasing adoption of new agricultural technologies and developing value chains. Yet to date, there has not been a rigorous assessment of these CF schemes.
Q12|Nutrition incentives in dairy contract farming in northern Senegal| Health-related incentives to reward effort or commitment are commonplace in many professional contracts throughout the world. Typically absent from small-scale agriculture in poor countries, such incentives may help overcome both health issues for remote rural families and supply issues for firms. Using a randomized control design, we investigate the impact of adding a micronutrient-fortified product in contracts between a Senegalese dairy processing factory and its seminomadic milk suppliers. Findings show significant increases in frequency of delivery but only limited impacts on total milk delivered. These impacts are time sensitive and limited mostly to households where women are more in control of milk contracts.
Q12|Insuring against droughts: Evidence on agricultural intensification and index insurance demand from a randomized evaluation in rural Bangladesh| It is widely acknowledged that unmitigated risks provide a disincentive for otherwise optimal investments in modern farm inputs. Index insurance provides a means for managing risk without the burdens of asymmetric information and high transaction costs that plague traditional indemnity-based crop insurance programs. Yet many index insurance programs that have been piloted around the world have met with rather limited success, so the potential for insurance to foster more intensive agricultural production has yet to be realized. This study assesses both the demand for and the effectiveness of an innovative index insurance product designed to help smallholder farmers in Bangladesh manage risk to crop yields and the increased production costs associated with drought. Villages were randomized into either an insurance treatment or a comparison group, and discounts and rebates were randomly allocated across treatment villages to encourage insurance take-up and to allow for the estimation of the price elasticity of insurance demand. Among those offered insurance, we find insurance demand to be moderately price elastic, with discounts significantly more successful in stimulating demand than rebates. Farmers who are highly risk averse or sensitive to basis risk prefer a rebate to a discount, suggesting that the rebate may partially offset some of the implicit costs associated with insurance contract nonperformance. Having insurance yields both ex ante risk management effects and ex post income effects on agricultural input use. The risk management effects lead to increased expenditures on inputs during the aman rice-growing season, including expenditures for risky inputs such as fertilizers, as well as those for irrigation and pesticides. The income effects lead to increased seed expenditures during the boro rice-growing season, which may signal insured farmersâ€™ higher rates of seed replacement, which broadens their access to technological improvements embodied in newer seeds as well as enhancing the genetic purity of cultivated seeds.
Q12|Can Phosphate Salts Recovered from Manure Replace Conventional Phosphate Fertilizer?|Pig farming produces more manure than can reasonably be spread onto surrounding fields, particularly in regions with high livestock densities and limited land availability. Nutrient recycling offers an attractive solution for dealing with manure excesses and is one main objective of the European commission-funded project “BioEcoSIM”. Phosphate salts (“P-Salt”) were recovered from the separated liquid manure fraction. The solid fraction was dried and carbonized to biochar. This study compared the fertilizing performance of P-Salt and conventional phosphate fertilizer and determined whether additional biochar application further increased biomass yields. The fertilizers and biochar were tested in pot experiments with spring barley and faba beans using two nutrient-poor soils. The crops were fertilized with P-Salt at three levels and biochar in two concentrations. Biomass yield was determined after six weeks. Plant and soil samples were analysed for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents. The P-Salt had similar or even better effects than mineral fertilizer on growth in both crops and soils. Slow release of nutrients can prevent leaching, rendering P-Salt a particularly suitable fertilizer for light sandy soils. Biochar can enhance its fertilizing effect, but the underlying mechanisms need further investigation. These novel products are concluded to be promising candidates for efficient fertilization strategies.

Q12|Development and Testing of a Device to Increase the Level of Automation of a Conventional Milking Parlor through Vocal Commands|A portable wireless device with a “vocal commands” feature for activating the mechanical milking phase in conventional milking parlors was developed and tested to increase the level of automation in the milking procedures. The device was tested in the laboratory and in a milking parlor. Four professional milkers participated in the experiment. Before the start of the tests, a set of acoustic models with speaker-dependent commands defined for the project was acquired for each milker using a dedicated “milker training procedure”. Two experimental sessions were performed by each milker, with one session in the laboratory and a subsequent session in the milking parlor. The device performance was evaluated based on the accuracy demonstrated in the vocal command recognition task and rated using the word recognition rate (WRR). The data were expressed as %WRR and grouped based on the different cases evaluated. Mixed effects logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate the association between the %WRR and explanatory variables. The results indicated significant effects due to the location where the tests were performed. Higher values of the %WRR were found for tests performed in the laboratory, whereas lower values were found for tests performed in the milking parlor (due to the presence of background noise). Nevertheless, the general performance level achieved by the device was sufficient for increasing the automation level of conventional milking parlors.
Q12|Practices for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Rice Production in Northeast Thailand|Land management practices for rice productivity and carbon storage have been a key focus of research leading to opportunities for substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. The effects of land management practices on global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) from rice production within the farm gate were investigated. For the 13 study sites, soil samples were collected by the Land Development Department in 2004. In 2014, at these same sites, soil samples were collected again to estimate the soil organic carbon sequestration rate (SOCSR) from 2004 to 2014. Surveys were conducted at each sampling site to record the rice yield and management practices. The carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions, Net GWP, and GHGI associated with the management practices were calculated. Mean rice yield and SOCSR were 3307 kg·ha −1 ·year −1 and 1173 kg·C·ha −1 ·year −1 , respectively. The net GWP varied across sites, from 819 to 5170 kg·CO 2 eq·ha −1 ·year −1 , with an average value of 3090 kg·CO 2 eq·ha −1 ·year −1 . GHGI ranged from 0.31 to 1.68 kg·CO 2 eq·kg −1 yield, with an average value of 0.97 kg·CO 2 eq·kg −1 yield. Our findings revealed that the amount of potassium (potash, K 2 O) fertilizer application rate is the most significant factor explaining rice yield and SOCSR. The burning of rice residues in the field was the main factor determining GHGI in this area. An effective way to reduce GHG emissions and contribute to sustainable rice production for food security with low GHGI and high productivity is avoiding the burning of rice residues.
Q12|State Support in Brazil for a Local Turn to Food|The local turn to food is often claimed to be a way to increase the value-added component retained by primary producers and to provide healthy, fresh and affordable food to consumers. Rio do Grande do Sul in Brazil has several governmental support programs that aim to empower family farmers and open up new market opportunities for them. This article examines these programs, investigates how small-scale farmers engage with them and the resultant changes in farming and marketing practices that ensue. The article uses cluster and content analysis to identify and interpret the extent, and the different ways, in which these farmers engage with and make use of the local knowledge and innovation system. The results provide useful insights into how policy instruments improve the performance of family agribusinesses, helping them to make better use of the resources available to them, encouraging farm diversification, and strengthening local interrelations between producers and consumers.
